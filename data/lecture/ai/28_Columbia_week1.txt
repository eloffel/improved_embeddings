why ai?

   just as the industrial revolution freed up a lot of humanity
from physical drudgery, i think ai has the potential to free
up humanity from a lot of the mental drudgery.

what is ai?

thinking humanly: cognitive approach

requires to determine how humans think!
1960   s    cognitive revolution   .
requires scienti   c theories of internal activities of the brain
    what level of abstraction?    knowledge    or    circuits   ?
    how to validate?

today, cognitive science and arti   cial intelligence are dis-
tinct disciplines.

what is ai?

acting humanly:

    turing test (alan turing 1950): a computer passes the

test of intelligence, if it can fool a human interrogator.

    major components of ai: knowledge, reasoning, language,

understanding, learning.

what is ai?

thinking rationally: laws of thoughts

    codify    right thinking    with logic.
    several greek schools developed various forms of logic:notation

and rules of derivation for thoughts

    problems:

1. not all knowledge can be expressed with logical notations
2. computational blow up.

16

what is ai?

acting rationally:

    the right thing:

that which is expected to maximize goal

achievement, given the available information.

    a rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best
outcome, or when there is uncertainty, the best expected out-
come.

    aristotle (nicomachean ethics):every art and every inquiry,
and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at
some good.

bottom line

    ai is a    ourishing    eld.
    ai is not magic.
    ai is an exciting    eld: you can contribute!
    ai systems do not have to model human/nature but can act

like or be inspired by human/nature.

    rational agents are central to our approach to ai.

agents and environments

    agent: an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving
its environment through sensors and acting upon that environ-
ment through actuators.

    human agent:

    sensors: eyes, ears, and other
    actuators: hands, legs, mouth, and other body

    robotic agent:

    sensors: cameras and infrared range    nders
    actuators: various motors

47

agents and environments

    percept: agent   s perceptual inputs.
    percept sequence: history of what agent perceived.
    agent function: maps from percept histories to actions:

f : p           a

    the agent program runs on the physical architecture to

produce f .

rationality: de   nition

rational agent:

   for each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select
an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure,
given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever
built-in knowledge the agent has.
