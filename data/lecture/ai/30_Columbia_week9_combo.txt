training data:

given:
discrete (categorical/qualitative), yi     y.
example y = {   1, +1}, y = {0, 1}.

(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)/xi     rd and yi

is

task: learn a classi   cation function:

f : rd        y
linear classi   cation: a classi   cation model is said to be linear
if it is represented by a linear function f (linear hyperplane in rd+1
dimensional space).

    we can   t predict credit card default with any certainty. sup-
pose we want to predict how likely is a customer to default.
that is output a id203 between 0 and 1 that a customer
will default.

    it makes sense and would be suitable and practical.
    in this case, the output is real (regression) but is bounded

(classi   cation).

p (y|x) = p (default = yes |balance)
