environment types

    fully observable (vs. partially observable): an agent   s
sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment
at each point in time.

    deterministic (vs. stochastic): the next state of the en-
vironment is completely determined by the current state and
the action executed by the agent. (if the environment is de-
terministic except for the actions of other agents, then the
environment is strategic)

    episodic (vs. sequential): the agent   s experience is divided
into atomic    episodes    (each episode consists of the agent
perceiving and then performing a single action), and the choice
of action in each episode depends only on the episode itself.

environment types

    static (vs. dynamic): the environment is unchanged while
an agent is deliberating. (the environment is semidynamic if
the environment itself does not change with the passage of
time but the agent   s performance score does)

    discrete (vs. continuous): a limited number of distinct,

clearly de   ned percepts and actions.

    single agent (vs. multiagent): an agent operating by itself

in an environment.

agent type

four basic types in order of increasing generality:

    simple re   ex agents
    model-based re   ex agents
    goal-based agents
    utility-based agents

    agents that work towards a goal.
    agents consider the impact of actions on future states.
    agent   s job is to identify the action or series of actions that

lead to the goal.

problem solving as search

1. de   ne the problem through:

(a) goal formulation

(b) problem formulation

2. solving the problem as a 2-stage process:

(a) search:    mental    or    o   ine    exploration of several possi-

bilities

(b) execute the solution found

state space vs. search space

    state space: a physical con   guration

    search space: an abstract con   guration represented by a

search tree or graph of possible solutions

    search tree:

    root: initial state
    branches: actions
    nodes: results from actions. a node has: parent, children,

depth, path cost, associated state

    expand: a function that given a node, creates all children

nodes

strategy criteria

strategies evaluated according to:

    completeness: does the strategy always    nd a solution if

there is one?

    optimality: does the strategy    nd the optimal (lowest cost)

solution?

    time complexity: how long does it take to    nd a solution?

(number of nodes generated)

    space complexity: how much memory is needed to perform

the search (maximum number of nodes in memory)?

43

cost variables

    time: number of nodes generated
    space: maximum number of nodes stored in memory
    branching factor: b is maximum number of successors of any

node

    depth: d depth of the least-cost solution i.e. shallowest goal

node

    path length: m maximum length of any path in the state

space

uninformed search

use no domain knowledge!

strategies:

2. uniform-cost search: expand least cost node
3. depth-   rst search (dfs): expand deepest node
4. depth-limited search: depth    rst with depth limit
5. iterative deepening: depth-limited with increasing limit
