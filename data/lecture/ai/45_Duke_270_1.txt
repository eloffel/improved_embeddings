ai: the very idea
for as long as people have made machines, they 
have wondered whether machines could be 
made intelligent.

   can machines think?

modern ai
subject of intense study:	
    nearly every cs department has at least 1 ai researcher.	
    heavily funded (nsf, darpa, eu, etc.).	

    pays itself back fast (e.g., dart).	

    google, amazon, microsoft, etc.	
    ~ 700 phds a year in the us	
    thousands of research papers written every year.

this turns out to be a hard question!

two dimensions:	
       humanly    vs    rationally   	
       thinking    vs.    acting   .

what is a rational agent?

agent	
program

sensors

performance measure. 

actuators

rational agents
!
a rational agent acts in its environment, according to what is 
has perceived, in order to maximize its expected 
performance measure.

example: chess

performance measure?
environment?
prior knowledge?
sensing?
actions?

major topics covered

required text
arti   cial intelligence,  a modern approach	
russell & norvig, 3rd edition.

on lectures
the textbook contains everything you need to know.	
!
lectures contain everything you need to know.	
!
lecture notes do not contain everything you need to know.	
!
suggested approach:	

    come to lectures and pay attention.	
    revise via textbook (immediately).	
    clarify at of   ce hours.

grading
exams: (closed book)	
 midterm: 30%, in class.	
 final: 30%,    nals week.   	
!
coursework: 40% of grade.	
5 assignments, mix of:	

    short proofs.	
    algorithm design.	
    programming (python).	
    analysis.

academic honesty
i expect all duke students to conduct themselves with the 
highest integrity, according to the duke community 
standard. 
!
it is ok to:	
    have high-level discussions.	
    google for de   nitions and background.	
!
it is not ok to: 
    hand in anyone else   s code, or work, in part or in whole.	
    google for solutions.	

!

always hand in your own work.

academic honesty
consequences of cheating:	
    your case will be reported.	
    possible consequences include zeros on the assignment, 
suspension, failure to graduate, retraction of job offers.	
!

if i catch you i will refer you to the of   ce of student conduct.	
!
do not cheat. 

homework
i will post some reading on the course website.	

    please join piazza.	
    please do the reading.	
    please do the coding homework.
