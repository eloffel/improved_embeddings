what	is	game	theory?		
	
       settings where multiple agents each have different 
preferences and set of actions they can take 

       each agent   s utility (potentially) depends on all 
agents    actions 
       what is optimal for one agent depends on what other 
agents do! 

       game theory studies how agents can rationally 
form beliefs over what other agents will do, and 
(hence) how agents should act 

penalty	kick	example	

action 

action 

id203 .7 

id203 .3 

id203 1 

id203 .6 

id203 .4 

is this a 
   rational    
outcome?  if 
not, what 
is? 

overview	
 
       zero-sum games from adversarial search lecture 

       minimax, alpha-beta pruning 

       general-sum games 

       normal form vs. extensive form games 

       table specifying action-payoff vs. game tree with 
sequence of actions (and information sets) 

       solving games: dominance, iterated dominance, 
mixed strategy, nash equilibrium 

rock-paper-scissors	(zero-sum	game)	

column player aka. 
player 2 
(simultaneously) 
chooses a column 

row player 
aka. player 1 
chooses a row 

a row or column is 
called an action or 
(pure) strategy 

0, 0  -1, 1  1, -1 
1, -1  0, 0  -1, 1 
-1, 1  1, -1  0, 0 

row player   s utility is always listed first, column player   s second 

zero-sum game: the utilities in each entry sum to 0 (or a constant) 
three-player game would be a 3d table with 3 utilities per entry, etc. 

general-sum	games	
       you could still play a minimax strategy in general-

sum games 
       pretend that the opponent is only trying to hurt you! 

       but this is not rational: 

0, 0  3, 1 
1, 0  2, 1 

not zero-sum 

       if column was trying to hurt row, column would 

play left, so row should play down 

       in reality, column will play right (strictly dominant), 

so row should play up

   2/3	of	the	average   	game	

       everyone writes down a number between 0 and 100 
       person closest to 2/3 of the average wins 
      example: 
       a says 50 
       b says 10 
       c says 90 
       average(50, 10, 90) = 50 
       2/3 of average = 33.33 
       a is closest (|50-33.33| = 16.67), so a wins

nash	equilibrium		
[nash	50]	

       a vector of strategies (one for each player) = a 
strategy profile 
       strategy profile (  1,   2 ,    ,   n) is a nash equilibrium 
if each   i is a best response to   -i 
       does not say anything about multiple agents 
changing their strategies at the same time 
       in any (finite) game, at least one nash equilibrium 
(possibly using mixed strategies) exists [nash 50]

       (d, s) and (s, d) are nash equilibria 

       they are pure-strategy nash equilibria: nobody randomizes 
       they are also strict nash equilibria: changing your strategy will make 

you strictly worse off

       play is (s, s) = (-5, -5)!!! 

       this is the equilibrium selection problem

       any pure-strategy nash equilibria? 
       but it has a mixed-strategy nash equilibrium: 
 both players put id203 1/3 on each action 
if the other player does this, every action will give you 
expected utility 0 
       might as well randomize

is there a nash equilibrium that uses mixed strategies -- say, where player 1 
uses a mixed strategy? 
if a mixed strategy is a best response, then all of the pure strategies that it 
randomizes over must also be best responses 

       so we need to make player 1 indifferent between d and s 
       player 1   s utility for playing d = -pc
       player 1   s utility for playing s = pc
       so we need -pc
       then, player 2 needs to be indifferent as well 
       mixed-strategy nash equilibrium: ((4/5 d, 1/5 s), (4/5 d, 1/5 s)) 

s = 1 - 6pc
s 
s = 1/5 

s which means pc

s = 1 - 6pc

       to make player 1 indifferent between rr and rc, we need: 

 utility for rr = 0*p(cc)+1*(1-p(cc)) = .5*p(cc)+0*(1-p(cc)) = utility for rc 
 that is, p(cc) = 2/3 

       to make player 2 indifferent between cc and fc, we need: 

 utility for cc = 0*p(rr)+(-.5)*(1-p(rr)) = -1*p(rr)+0*(1-p(rr)) = utility for fc 
 that is, p(rr) = 1/3 

computa[onal	considera[ons	
       zero-sum games - solved efficiently as lp 
       general sum games may require exponential 
time (in # of actions) to find a single equilibrium 
(no known efficient algorithm and good reasons to 
suspect that none exists) 

       some better news:  despite bad worst-case 
complexity, many games can be solved quickly 

extensions	
       partial information 
       uncertainty about the game parameters, e.g., payoffs 
(bayesian games) 
       repeated games: simple learning algorithms can 
converge to equilibria in some repeated games 
       multistep games with distributions over next states 
(game theory + mdps = stochastic games) 
       multistep + partial information (partially observable 
stochastic games) 

       game theory is so general, that it can encompass 
essentially all aspects of strategic, multiagent behavior, 
e.g., negotiating, threats, bluffs, coalitions, bribes, etc.
