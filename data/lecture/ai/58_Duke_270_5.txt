knowledge

representation and reasoning
represent knowledge about the world.	

    representation language.	
    knowledge base.	
    declarative - facts and rules.

reason using that represented knowledge.	

    often asking questions.	
id136 procedure.	
   
    heavily dependent on language.

id118
representation language and set of id136 rules for reasoning 
about facts that are either true or false.	
!
model the world as a set of propositions:	

    raining	
    cloudy	
    examtoday	

!
!
each proposition is either true or false (though we may not 
know which).	
!

id118
can combine propositions using logical operators to make 
sentences (syntax vs. semantics): 
!
  a
                  (not a - a is false) 
                  (a or b - one (or both) of a or b is true) 
a _ b
                  (a and b - both a and b are true) 
a ^ b
                  (a implies b - if a is true, so is b) 
a =) b
                  (a iff b - a and b both true or both false)	
a () b
!
!
two uses of sentence:	

    fact	
    question

knowledge base
a list of sentences that apply to the world.	
!
for example:	
!
cold
!
  raining
!
(raining _ cloudy)
!
!
cold ()   hot
!
a knowledge base describes a set of worlds in which these facts 
and rules are true.

knowledge base
a model is a formalization of a    world   :	

    set the value of every variable in the kb to true or false.	
    2n models possible for n propositions.

models and worlds
each sentence has a truth value in each model.

if sentence a is true in

of) a.

models and worlds
the kb speci   es a subset of all possible models - those 
that satisfy all sentences in the kb.

id136
so if we have a kb, then what?	
!
we   d like to ask it questions. 
given:	
!
cold
!
  raining
!
(raining _ cloudy)
!
cold ()   hot
!
     we can ask:	
hot?

id136: process of deriving new facts from given facts.

a |= b

id136 (formally)
kb a entails sentence b 	
if and only if:	
   every model which satis   es a, satis   es b.	
!
!
in other words: if a is true then b must be true.	
!
!
!
that   s nice, but how do we compute?	
could just enumerate worlds    

logical id136
take a kb, and produce new sentences of knowledge.	
most frequently, determine whether

id136 algorithms: search process to    nd a proof of q using 
a set of id136 rules.	
!
desirable properties:

    soundness (or truth-preserving)	
    complete	

!

id136 rules

if              , and a is true, then b is true.	
a =) b
if         , then a is true, and b is true.
a ^ b

id136 rules
often written in form:

given this	
knowledge

start with

a _ b,  b

a

can infer this

proofs
for example, given kb:	
!
cold
!
  raining
!
(raining _ cloudy)
!
cold ()   hot
!
!
we ask:
hot?

id136:
cold = t rue
t rue ()   hot
  hot = t rue
hot = f alse

l1 _ ... _ lk, m1 _ ... _ mn

resolution
the following id136 rule is both sound and complete: 
!
!
!
!
where   
!
this is called resolution. it is sound and complete when 
combined with a sound and complete search algorithm.

l1 _ ...li 1 _ li+1 _ ...lk _ m1 _ ...mj 1 _ mj+1 _ ...mn

li =   mj

dendral and mycin
   id109    - knowledge based.	
!
dendral: (feigenbaum et al. ~1965)	

identify unknown organic molecules	

   
    eliminate most    chemically implausible    hypotheses.	

!

mycin: (shortliffe et al., 1970s)	
   
       research indicated that it proposed an acceptable therapy 

identify bacteria causing severe infections.	

in about 69% of cases, which was better than the 
performance of infectious disease experts.   

major issue: the knowledge bottleneck.
