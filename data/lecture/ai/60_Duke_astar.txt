we would like to prove that a   , equipped with an admissible heuristic, always    nds an optimal
solution. recall that an admissible heuristic h is one such that:

h(s)     h   (s),

for all states s, where h    measures the true cost from state s to the goal. in other words, h is
optimistic   it always underestimates the cost from s to the goal.

we proceed using a proof by contradiction: we assume that what we are trying to prove does
not hold, and then show that this leads to an impossible situation. here, we assume that we run a   
on a problem and it returns a solution, sa, with cost g(sa), and there is another solution that we
didn   t    nd, sopt, with cost g(sopt) such that:

g(sopt)     g(sa).

(recall that g(s) is the true cost-to-get from the start state to node s.) now, consider the    nal
node expansion, where sa was taken o    the frontier and evaluated. this is depicted in figure 1.
note that when selecting a node from the frontier, we select the node s such that g(s) + h(s)    
g(s(cid:48))+h(s(cid:48)), for all other nodes s(cid:48) in the frontier. thus, when we were selecting sa from the frontier,
it had the lowest total g(s) + h(s)   but since sa is a goal node, h(sa) = 0 and g(sa) is the exact
cost from the start node to sa.

now we note that sopt must have had some ancestor node in the frontier; lets call it sb. (note that
sb could be the start node.) since h is admissible and underestimates the cost the goal:

h(sb) + g(sb)     g(sopt).

but since sa was selected instead of sb, we see that:

h(sa) + g(sa) = g(sa)     h(sb) + g(sb)     g(sopt),

and hence we see that g(sa)     g(sopt). but we started out by assuming that g(sopt) < g(sa), and
(cid:3)
so we have reached a contradiction.

ancestor of sopt, is not.
