what  is  ai?

       ai is the study of complex information processing 
problems that often have their roots in some aspect of 
biological information processing.  the goal of the 
subject is to identify solvable and interesting 
information processing problems, and solve them.   

    david marr 

    the intelligent connection of perception to action

    rodney brooks

    actions that are indistinguishable from a human   s

    alan turing

different  approaches to  ai

   what is intelligence?

    philosophy, ethics, religion
    cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, 
linguistics
   understand natural forms of intelligence
   learn principles of intelligent behavior

    engineering

   can we build intelligent devices and systems?
   autonomous and semi-autonomous systems for 

replicating human capabilities, enhancing 
human capabilities, improving performance, etc.

the turing test

    a. turing,    computing machinery and intelligence,    1950
    can machines think?    can we tell if a conversation is by a 
    text in, text out
    operational test for intelligent behavior:  aka the imitation 

machine and not a human?

game

    predicted that by 2000, a machine might have a 30% chance 
    suggested major components of ai: knowledge rep., 

of fooling a lay person for 5 minutes

reasoning, natural language processing, learning

some successful ai  applications

1. language translation services (google)
2. translating telephone (skype)
3. news aggregation and summarization (google)
4. id103 (nuance)
5. song recognition (shazam)
6. face recognition (recognizr, google,    )

8. id53 (apple siri, ibm watson,    )
9. chess playing (ibm deep blue)

id164 in images task in the    large scale visual 
recognition challenge    competition

recognize speech from phone call audio task

ai  is  hard

ai is important

    ai problems often involve large, complex data

   speech, images, natural languages, genomic data,    
   what are the right primitives to use? 
   data are often noisy, unstructured and have missing 

values 

    computationally (np-) hard
    very hard to define general, computational    competence 

theories    for specific tasks that say what is computed 
and why  (what to compute)
    need algorithms that use domain-specific knowledge 
and constraints with incomplete models, while being time 
and space constrained, stable, and robust  (how to 
compute)

some challenging ai task 

characteristics

    is the environment fully observable or
partially observable?
    an environment is fully observable if we 
have access to the complete state of the 
environment at any point in time
    if all aspects that are relevant to the choice of 
action are able to be detected, then the 
environment is effectively fully observable
    note:  noisy, incomplete and inaccurate 
sensors can result in partially observable 
environments

ai task characteristics

    is the task deterministic or stochastic?
    a problem is deterministic if the next state of 
the world is completely determined by the 
current state and the agent   s actions
    randomness and chance are common 
causes of stochastic environments

ai task characteristics

ai task characteristics

    is the task discrete or continuous?
    a problem is discrete if there are a bounded 
number of distinct, clearly-defined states of 
the world, which limits the range of possible 
percepts and actions

    is the problem single agent or multi-agent?
    an environment is multi-agent if more than
one agent (computer or human) can affect 
the other's performance
    multi-agent environments can be competitive 
(   adversarial   ) or not (   benign   )

ai paradigm

    develop general, efficient, satisficing (i.e., 
acceptably good) methods for tackling ai 
problems

    given a real-world task,

1. convert it into a form that is well-defined and 

captures all relevant information necessary to solve 
it     this is a    modeling    process
    example:  model the    relevance    of a web page, 

x, to a user   s search query as:
f(x) = 10 * querymatch(x) + 3 * id95(x)

2. given a formal model, develop an algorithm for 

solving the task efficiently

models to be studied in cs 540
    state-based models  (search, planning)

   solutions are defined as a sequence of steps
   model task as a graph of states and solution as a 

path

   a state captures all the relevant information about 

the past in order to act (optimally) in the future

   apps:  navigation, games
   state-space graphs 

    parametric, reflex models  (machine learning)

   given a set of (input, output) pairs of training data, 

learn a set of parameters that will map input to 
output for future data

   apps: classification, regression
   id90, neural networks, id166s, id92

ai  today

    a set of    tools    for computing a variety of 
useful classes of model types that represent 
information extracted from raw input data, 
and use associated algorithms to    solve    
specific tasks
   neural networks, id48, 

id110s, heuristic search, logic, 
   
    there   s no magic in ai.  it   s all about models 
(i.e., representation), id203, statistics, 
optimization, and algorithms  

models to be studied in cs 540

    variable-based models (uncertainty)

   solution is an assignment of values for a set of 

variables

   apps:  sudoku, id103, face recognition
   id124, id110s, hidden 

markov models, id98s

    logic-based models (logic)

   symbolic representation of classes of objects
   deductive reasoning
   apps:  id53 systems, natural 

language understanding
