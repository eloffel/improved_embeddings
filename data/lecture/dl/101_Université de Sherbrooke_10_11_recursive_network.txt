topics: word phrase representations
    we   ve seen how to learn representations for single words

    how could we learn representations for phrases of arbitrary 
length?
    can we model relationships between words and multiword expressions

- ex.:        consider                   take into account       

    can we extract a representation of full sentences that preserves some of its 

semantic meaning
- ex.: 

        word representations
 were learned from a
 corpus        

   

        we trained word 
 representations on 
 a text data set
