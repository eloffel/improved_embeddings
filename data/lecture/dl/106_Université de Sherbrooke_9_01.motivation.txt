    id161 is the design of computers that can process 
visual data and accomplish some given task 
    we will focus on object recognition: given some input image, identify which object 
caltech 101 dataset

    we can design neural networks that are speci   cally adapted 
for such problems
    must deal with very high-dimensional inputs 

- 150 x 150 pixels = 22500 inputs, or 3 x 22500 if rgb pixels

    can exploit the 2d topology of pixels (or 3d for video data)
    can build in invariance to certain variations we can expect 

-

translations, illumination, etc.

    convolutional networks leverage these ideas

    local connectivity
    parameter sharing
    pooling / subsampling hidden units
