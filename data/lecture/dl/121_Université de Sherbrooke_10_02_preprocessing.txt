natural language processing - preprocessing

natural language processing 2

topics: id121
    typical preprocessing steps of text data

    tokenize text (from a long string to a list of token strings)

       he   s spending 7 days in san 

francisco.       

       he       
          s       
       spending       
       7       
       days       
       in       
       san francisco       
       .       

    for many datasets, this has already been done for you
    splitting into tokens based on spaces and separating punctuation is good enough 

in english or french

natural language processing 3

topics: lemmatization
    typical preprocessing steps of text data

    lemmatize tokens (put into standard form)

       he       
          s       
       spending       
       7       
       days       
       in       
       san francisco       
       .       

       he       
       be       
       spend       
       number       
       day       
       in       
       san francisco       
       .       

    the speci   c lemmatization will depend on the problem we want to solve

- we can remove variations of words that are not relevant to the task at hand

natural language processing 4

topics: vocabulary
    typical preprocessing steps of text data

    form vocabulary of words that maps lemmatized words to a unique id 

(position of word in vocabulary)

    different criteria can be used to select which words are part of the vocabulary

- pick most frequent words
-

ignore uninformative words from a user-de   ned short list (ex.:        the       ,        a       , etc.)

    all words not in the vocabulary will be mapped to a special       out-of-vocabulary       id

    typical vocabulary sizes will vary between 10 000 
and 250 000

    example:

       the       
       cat       
       and       
       the       
       dog       
       play       
       .

    we will note word ids with the symbol w

    can think of w as a categorical feature for the original word
    we will sometimes refer to w as a word, for simplicity
