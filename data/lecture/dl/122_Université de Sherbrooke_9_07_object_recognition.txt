filter bank layer - fid19: the input of a    lter bank
layer is a 3d array with n1 2d feature maps of size n2    n3.
each component is denoted xijk, and each feature map is
denoted xi. the output is also a 3d array, y composed of
m1 feature maps of size m2    m3. a    lter in the    lter bank
kij has size l1    l2 and connects input feature map xi to
