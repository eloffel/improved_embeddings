natural language processing 2

topics: natural language processing (nlp)
    natural language processing is concerned with tasks involving 
language data 
    we will focus on text data nlp
    speech processing is also nlp, though it has its own dedicated research 

community

    much like for id161, we can design neural networks

    main issue: text data is inherently high dimensional
