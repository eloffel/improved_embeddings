topics: id161
    we can design neural networks that are speci   cally adapted 
for such problems
    must deal with very high-dimensional inputs 

- 150 x 150 pixels = 22500 inputs, or 3 x 22500 if rgb pixels

    can exploit the 2d topology of pixels (or 3d for video data)
    can build in invariance to certain variations we can expect 

-

translations, illumination, etc.

    convolutional networks leverage these ideas

    local connectivity
    parameter sharing
    pooling / subsampling hidden units

topics: local connectivity
    first idea: use a local 
connectivity of hidden units
    each hidden unit is connected only to a 

subregion (patch) of the input image

    it is connected to all channels

- 1 if greyscale image
- 3 (r, g, b) for color image

    solves the following problems:
    fully connected hidden layer would have 
an unmanageable number of parameters
    computing the linear activations of the 
hidden units would be very expensive

topics: local connectivity
    units are connected to all channels:

    1 channel if grayscale image, 3 channels (r, g, b) if color image
