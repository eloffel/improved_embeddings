    supervised learning example: (x, y) x y
    supervised learning example: (x, y) x y
    training set: dtrain = {(x(t), y(t))}
    supervised learning example: (x, y) x y
topics: training, validation and test sets, generalization
    training set: dtrain = {(x(t), y(t))}
    training set            serves to train a model
    f (x;    )
    training set: dtrain = {(x(t), y(t))}
    f (x;    )
    validation set           serves to select hyper-parameters
    dvalid dtest
    f (x;    )
    test set           serves to estimate the generalization 
    dvalid dtest
performance (error)

    generalization is the behavior of the model on unseen 
examples
    this is what we care about in machine learning!

topics: grid search
    to search for the best con   guration of the hyper-parameters:

    you can perform a grid search

-

-

specify a set of values you want to test for each hyper-parameter
try all possible con   gurations of these values

    you can perform a random search

-

-

specify a distribution over the values of each hyper-parameters (e.g. uniform in some range)
sample independently each hyper-parameter to get a con   guration, and repeat as many 
times as wanted

    use a validation set performance to select the best 
con   guration
    you can go back and re   ne the grid/distributions if needed

topics: early stopping
    to select the number of epochs, stop training when validation 
set error increases (with some look ahead)
