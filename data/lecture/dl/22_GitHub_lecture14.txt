o train learning agent for the optimal 

policy         (    |    ) given states      and 
possible actions     

o the policy class can be either 

deterministic or stochastic

benefits of policy optimization

o often defining the policy         (    |    ) is easier than defining the     -function
o moreover, computing the     -value is often too expensive

    hard to solve arg max

    

        (    ,     )

    especially when having continuous or high-dimensional action spaces

o have a deep network optimize the         (    |    )

deep id23

o regards          at time     
o actions      taken according to a policy      = p(    |    )

o an action-value function

         ,      = max

    

    [         +             +1 +     2        +2 +     |         =     ,          =     ,     ]

where      is a discount factor of the future rewards

    future rewards should not be as important, because we do not know the future

o use a non-linear function approximator to model the action value 

function

            ,                   ,     ;

deep id23

o non-linear function approximator?

    deep networks

o input is as raw as possible, e.g. image frame

    or perhaps several frames

o output is the best possible action out of a set of actions for maximizing 

future reward

o important: no need anymore to compute the actual value of the action-

value function and take the maximum: arg max

    

        (    ,     )

    the network returns directly the optimal action

extra tricks

o replay memory/experience replay

    store memories <     ,     ,     ,         >
    train using random stored memories instead of the latest memory transition
    breaks the temporal dependencies     sgd works well if samples are roughly independent

o skipping frames

    saves time and computation
    anyways, from one frame to the other there is often very little difference

o     -greedy behavioral policy with annealed temperature during training

    select random action (instead of optimal) with id203     
    in the beginning of training our model is bad, no reason to trust the    optimal    action

o alternatively: exploration vs exploitation

    early stages     strong exploration
    late stages     strong exploitation

how to do one-shot?

o siamese networks-instance matching

    string geometric requirements
    hard when target should be matched on a conceptual and not on pixel level
    siamese instance search for tracking, tao et al.

o matching networks

    matching networks for id62, vinyals et al.

o memory networks

    id62 with memory-augmented neural networks, santoro et al.

o dynamic filter generation

    instead of fixing filters after training, learn to generate filter based on input

generative models and adversarial networks

o recently there has been a significant increase of interest for generative 

networks, also because of the emergence of adversarial networks. however, we 
still lack understanding of adversarial networks and how they precisely fit within 
the generative model framework. this topic is more open-ended and will be 
defined upon discussion with the candidate, after reading the very recent 
literature

recurrent siamese trackers

o in the recent literature a new type of tracking framework has emerged 

that casts tracking as an instance search problem. this framework, 
however, has the disadvantage that ignores the obvious temporal 
coherence between the frames of the tracked object over time. as such 
integration with recurrent temporal models is a promising direction.

deep knowledge memory networks

o training memory networks for answering sophisticated questions, modelling 

dialogues entails two components. first, learning how to read, write and access 
memories. second, learning to use relevant memories for answering a question. 
currently, memory networks rely on the same training set for these two training 
aspects. however, this does not necessarily need to be the case. in this thesis 
we will investigate how to use external knowledge datasets for sophisticated 
id53 and dialogue modelling.

o related concepts

    knowledge databases
    memory networks
    dialogue models
