filter invariance and equivariance

o filters learn how 

different variances 
affect appearance

o different layers and 
different hierarchies 
focus on different 
transformations

o for different objects 

filters reproduce 
different behaviors

several interesting questions

o what do the image activations in different layers look like?

o what types of images create the strongest activations?

o what are the activations for the class    ostrich   ?

o do the activations occur in meaningful positions?

feature maps

o the convolution activations are also called feature maps

o a deep network has several hierarchical layers

    hence several feature maps

feature map strength

o naturally, given an image some feature maps will be    stronger   

    contribute higher amount to the final classification score

o why? what pixel structure excited these particular feature maps?

    generally, what part of the picture excites a certain feature map?

where max pooling was activated

fooling images

o what if we follow a similar procedure but with a different goal

o generate    visually random    images

    images that make a lot of sense to a convnet but no sense at all to us

o or, assume we make very small changes to a picture (invisible to the 

naked eye)
    is a convnet always invariant to these changes?
    or could it be fooled?

understanding convnets and knowledge transfer - 31

smoothness assumption

o we assume our classifiers enjoy local generalization

o assume an image containing a cat lies at coordinates     

o assume also a small change      around     , such that      +      <     

         is a very small constant

o is the smoothness assumption reasonable?

o or can we    break    it by some adversarial examples

    e.g. if we correctly classify      as    argan goat   , with the

right      make the convnet see a    bmw i6   
    the      +      would be adversarial examples

generating adversarial examples

o if     :             1     ,      our goal can be mathematically described as

min      2

          +      =     ,      +          0, 1     

    .     .

o the goal is to optimize the distortion      so that the predicted label      is 

different than the original label

id21

o assume two datasets,      and     

o dataset      is

    fully annotated, plenty of images
    we can build a model        

o dataset      is

id163: 1million

    not as much annotated, or much fewer images
    the annotations of      do not need to overlap with     

        

o we can use the model         to learn a better        
o this is called id21

convnets are good in id21

o even if our dataset      is not large, we can train a id98 for it

o pre-train a network on the dataset     

o then, there are two solutions

    id98 as feature extractor

solution i: fine-tune         using         as initialization

o assume the parameters of      are already a good start near our final local 

optimum

o use them as the initial parameters for our new id98 for the target dataset

(    =0) =     s,      for some layers      = 1, 2,    
      ,     
o this is a good solution when the dataset      is relatively big

    e.g. for id163      with approximately 1 million images
    for a dataset      with more than a few thousand images should be ok

o what layers to initialize and how?

initializing         with        

o classifier layer to loss

    the loss layer essentially is the    classifier   
    same labels     keep the weights from        
    different labels     delete the layer and start over
    when too few data, fine-tune only this layer

o fully connected layers

    very important for fine-tuning
    sometimes you need to completely delete the last 

before the classification layer if datasets are very 
different

    capture more semantic,    specific    information
    always try first when fine-tuning
    if you have more data, fine-tune also these layers

initializing         with        

o upper convolutional layers (conv4, conv5)

    mid-level spatial features (face, wheel detectors    )
    can be different from dataset to dataset
    capture more generic information
    fine-tuning pays off
    fine-tune if dataset is big enough

o lower convolutional layers (conv1, conv2)

    they capture low level information
    this information does not change usually
    probably, no need to fine-tune but no harm trying

how to fine-tune?

o for layers initialized from         use a mild learning rate
    remember: your network is already close to a near optimum
    if too aggressive, learning might diverge
    a learning rate of 0.001 is a good starting choice (assuming 

0.01 was the original learning rate)

o for completely new layers (e.g. loss) use aggressive 

learning rate

    if too small, the training will converge very slowly
    remember: the rest of the network is near a solution, this 

layer is very far from one

    a learning rate of 0.01 is a good starting choice

o if datasets are very similar, fine-tune only fully 

connected layers

o if datasets are different and you have enough data, 

fine-tune all layers

solution ii: use         as a feature extractor for        

o essentially similar to a case of solution i

    but train only the loss layer

o essentially use the network as a pretrained feature extractor

o this is a good solution if the dataset      is small

    any fine-tuning of layer might cause overfitting

o or when we don   t have the resources to train a deep net

o or when we don   t care for the best possible accuracy

which layer?

higher layer features are capture 
more semantic information. good 
for higher level classification

lower layer features capture more 
basic information (texture, etc). good 
for image-to-image comparisons,
