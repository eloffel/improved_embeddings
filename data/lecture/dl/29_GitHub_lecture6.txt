    why separately?

o solve multiple tasks simultaneously

o one task might help learn another better

o one task might have more annotations

o in real applications we don   t want 7 vggnets

    1 for boundaries, 1 for normals, 1 for saliency,

o the total loss is the summation of the per task losses

o the per task loss relies on the common weights (vggnet) and the weights 

specialized for the task

                        =    
                

                   (                            ,                     ) +    (                    )

o one training image might contain specific only annotations

    only a particular task is    run    for that image

o gradients per image are computed for tasks available for the image only

o so far, what have you noticed?

o most works are done in 2016

    very fast, very active, very volatile area of research that attracts lots of interest
