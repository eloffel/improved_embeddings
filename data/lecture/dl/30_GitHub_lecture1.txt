o vision is ultra challenging!

    for a small 256x256 resolution and for 256 pixel values
    a total 2524,288 of possible images
    in comparison there are about 1024stars in the universe

o visual object variations

    different viewpoints, scales, deformations, occlusions

o semantic object variations

    intra-class variation
    inter-class overlaps

why should we be impressed?

o typically robotics are considered in controlled environments

    laboratory settings, predictable positions, standardized tasks (like in factory robots)

o what about real life situations?

    environments constantly change, new tasks need to be learnt without guidance, 

unexpected factors must be dealt with

o game ai
    at least 101048

possible go games. where do we even start?

why should we be impressed?

o nlp is an extremely complex task

    synonymy (   chair   ,    stool    or    beautiful   ,    handsome   )
    ambiguity (   i made her duck   ,    cut to the chase   )

o nlp is very high dimensional

    assuming 150k english words, we need to learn 150k classifiers
    with quite sparse data for most of them

o beating nlp feels the closest to achieving true ai

    although true ai probably goes beyond nlp, vision, robotics,     alone

why should we be impressed?

o music, painting, etc. are tasks that are uniquely human

    difficult to model
    even more difficult to evaluate (if not impossible)

o if machines can generate novel pieces even remotely resembling art, they 

must have understood something about    beauty   ,     harmony   , etc.

o have they really learned to generate new art, however?

    or do they just fool us with their tricks?

training a id88

o rosenblatt   s innovation was mainly the learning algorithm for id88s

o learning algorithm

    initialize weights randomly
    take one sample         and predict         
    for erroneous predictions update weights

    if the output was              = 0 and          = 1, increase weights
    if the output was              = 1 and          = 0, decrease weights

from a id88 to a neural network

o one id88 = one decision

o what about multiple decisions?

    e.g. digit classification

o stack as many outputs as the

possible outcomes into a layer
    neural network

o use one layer as input to the next layer

    multi-layer id88 (mlp)

non-linearizing linear machines 

o most data distributions and tasks are non-linear

o a linear assumption is often convenient, but not necessarily truthful

o problem: how to get non-linear machines without too much effort?

o solution: make features non-linear

o what is a good non-linear feature?

    non-linear kernels, e.g., polynomial, rbf, etc
    explicit design of features (sift, hog)?

how to get good features?

o high-dimensional data (e.g. faces) lie in lower dimensional manifolds

    goal: discover these lower dimensional manifolds
    these manifolds are most probably highly non-linear

o hypothesis (1): compute the coordinates of the input (e.g. a face image) 

to this non-linear manifold     data become separable 

o hypothesis (2): semantically similar things lie closer together than 

semantically dissimilar things

feature manifold example

o raw data live in huge dimensionalities

o semantically meaningful raw data prefer lower dimensional manifolds

    which still live in the same huge dimensionalities

o can we discover this manifold to embed our data on?

end-to-end learning of feature hierarchies

o a pipeline of successive modules

o each module   s output is the input for the next module

o modules produce features of higher and higher abstractions

    initial modules capture low-level features (e.g. edges or corners)
    middle modules capture mid-level features (e.g. circles, squares, textures)
    last modules capture high level, class specific features (e.g. face detector)

why learn the features?

o manually designed features

    often take a lot of time to come up with and implement
    often take a lot of time to validate
    often they are incomplete, as one cannot know if they 

are optimal for the task

o learned features

    are easy to adapt
    very compact and specific to the task at hand
    given a basic architecture in mind, it is relatively easy and 

fast to optimize

o time spent for designing features now spent for 

designing architectures
