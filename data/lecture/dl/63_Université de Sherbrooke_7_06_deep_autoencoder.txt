deep learning - deep autoencoder

topics: deep autoencoder
    pre-training can be used to initialize a deep autoencoder

    this is an example of a situation 

where under   tting is an issue
- perhaps surprisingly, pre-training 

initializes the optimization problem 
in a region with better local optima 
of training objective

    each rbm used to initialize
parameters both in encoder
and decoder (      unrolling      )

    better optimization algorithms

can also help

    if we reduce to 2d, we can visualize the data (e.g. a collection 
of document)
