    a language model is a probabilistic model that assigns 
probabilities to any sequence of words
                             p(w1, ... ,wt)
    id38 is the task of learning a language model that assigns high 

probabilities to well formed sentences

    plays a crucial role in id103 and machine translation systems

    an assumption frequently made is the nth order markov 
assumption
            p(w1, ... ,wt) =     p(wt | wt   (n   1) , ... ,wt   1)
    the tth word was generated based only on the n   1 previous words
    we will refer to wt   (n   1) , ... ,wt   1 as the context

topics: id165 model
    an id165 is a sequence of n words 

    unigrams (n=1):       is      ,       a      ,       sequence      , etc.
    bigrams (n=2):  [      is      ,       a       ],  [      a      ,       sequence       ], etc.
    trigrams (n=3):  [      is      ,       a      ,       sequence      ], [       a      ,       sequence      ,       of      ], etc.

    id165 models estimate the conditional from id165s counts
p(wt | wt   (n   1) , ... ,wt   1) = count(wt   (n   1) , ... ,wt   1, wt)
                                    count(wt   (n   1) , ... ,wt   1,    )
    the counts are obtained from a training corpus (a data set of word text)

    issue: data sparsity

    we want n to be large, for the model to be realistic
    however, for large values of n, it is likely that a given id165 will not have been 

observed in the training corpora
    smoothing the counts can help

- combine count(w1 , w2 , w3 , w4), count(w2 , w3 , w4), count(w3 , w4), and count(w4) to 

estimate p(w4 |w1, w2, w3)

    this only partly solves the problem
