invariance by data set expansion 2
topics: generating additional examples
    invariances built-in in convolutional network:

    small translations: due to convolution and max pooling
    small illumination changes: due to local contrast id172

    it is not invariant to other important variations such as 
rotations and scale changes
    however, it   s easy to arti   cially generate data with such 
transformations
    could use such data as additional training data
    neural network will learn to be invariant to such transformations
