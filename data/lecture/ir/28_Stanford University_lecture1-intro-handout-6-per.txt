introduction to

information retrieval

introducing information retrieval 

and web search

information retrieval

    information retrieval (ir) is finding material

(usually documents) of an unstructured nature 
(usually text) that satisfies an information need
from within large collections (usually stored on 
computers).

    these days we frequently think first of web search, 

but there are many other cases:

    e-mail search
    searching your laptop
    corporate knowledge bases
    legal information retrieval

basic assumptions of information retrieval

the classic search model

    collection: a set of documents

    assume it is a static collection for the moment

    goal: retrieve documents with information 

that is relevant to the user   s information need
and helps the user complete a task

user task

    which plays of shakespeare contain the words 

brutus and caesar but not calpurnia?

    one could grep all of shakespeare   s plays for 

brutus and caesar, then strip out lines containing 
calpurnia?

    why is that not the answer?

    slow (for large corpora)
    not calpurnia is non-trivial
    other operations (e.g., find the word romans near

countrymen) not feasible

introduction to

information retrieval

the boolean retrieval model

& extended boolean models

boolean queries: exact match

sec. 1.3

    the boolean retrieval model is being able to ask a 

query that is a boolean expression:

    boolean queries are queries using and, or and not

to join query terms

    views each document as a set of words

    is precise: document matches condition or not.

    perhaps the simplest model to build an ir system on

    primary commercial retrieval tool for 3 decades. 

    many search systems you still use are boolean:

    email, library catalog, mac os x spotlight

added 1992; new federated search added 
2010)

    tens of terabytes of data; ~700,000 users
    majority of users still use boolean queries
    example query:

    what is the statute of limitations in cases 

involving the federal tort claims act?

    limit! /3 statute action /s federal /2 

tort /3 claim

    /3 = within 3 words, /s = in same sentence

    another example query:

    requirements for disabled people to be able to 

access a workplace

    disabl! /p access! /s work-site work-place 

(employment /3 place

    note that space is disjunction, not conjunction!
    long, precise queries; proximity operators; 

incrementally developed; not like web search
    many professional searchers still like boolean 

search

introduction to

information retrieval

phrase queries and positional indexes

phrase queries

sec. 2.4

    we want to be able to answer queries such as 

   stanford university        as a phrase

    thus the sentence    i went to university at 

stanford    is not a match. 
    the concept of phrase queries has proven easily 
understood by users; one of the few    advanced 
search    ideas that works

    many more queries are implicit phrase queries

    for this, it no longer suffices to store only

<term : docs> entries

4/4/2013

7

a first attempt: biword indexes

longer phrase queries

sec. 2.4.1

sec. 2.4.1

    index every consecutive pair of terms in the text 

as a phrase

    for example the text    friends, romans, 

countrymen    would generate the biwords

    friends romans

    romans countrymen

    each of these biwords is now a dictionary term

    two-word phrase query-processing is now 

immediate.

    longer phrases can be processed by breaking 

them down

    stanford university palo alto can be broken into 

the boolean query on biwords:

stanford university and university palo and palo

alto

without the docs, we cannot verify that the docs 
matching the above boolean query do contain 
the phrase.

can have false positives!

issues for biword indexes

solution 2: positional indexes

sec. 2.4.1

sec. 2.4.2

    false positives, as noted before

    index blowup due to bigger dictionary

    infeasible for more than biwords, big even for 

them

    biword indexes are not the standard solution 

(for all biwords) but can be part of a 
compound strategy

    in the postings, store, for each term the 
position(s) in which tokens of it appear:

<term, number of docs containing term;

doc1: position1, position2     ;

doc2: position1, position2     ;

etc.>

positional index example

sec. 2.4.2

sec. 2.4.2

<be: 993427;

2: 3, 149;
4: 17, 191, 291, 430, 434;
5: 363, 367,    >

which of docs 1,2,4,5
could  contain    to be

or not to be   ?

    for phrase queries, we use a merge 

algorithm recursively at the document level

    extract inverted index entries for each distinct 

term: to, be, or, not.

    merge their doc:position lists to enumerate all 

positions with    to be or not to be   .

    to: 

    2:1,17,74,222,551; 4:8,16,190,429,433; 7:13,23,191; ...

    be:  

    1:17,19; 4:17,191,291,430,434; 5:14,19,101; ...

    but we now need to deal with more than 

    same general method for proximity searches

just equality

sec. 2.4.2

    limit! /3 statute /3 federal /2 tort 
    again, here, /id116    within k words of   .

    clearly, positional indexes can be used for 

such queries; biword indexes cannot.

    exercise: adapt the linear merge of postings to 

handle proximity queries.  can you make it 
work for any value of k?
    this is a little tricky to do correctly and efficiently
    see figure 2.12 of iir

    a positional index expands postings storage 

substantially

    even though indices can be compressed

    nevertheless, a positional index is now 

standardly used because of the power and 
usefulness of phrase and proximity queries     
whether used explicitly or implicitly in a 
ranking retrieval system.

positional index size

rules of thumb

sec. 2.4.2

    need an entry for each occurrence, not just 

    a positional index is 2   4 as large as a non-

once per document

    index size depends on average document size

why?

    average web page has <1000 terms

combination schemes

sec. 2.4.3

    these two approaches can be profitably 

combined
    for particular phrases (   michael jackson   ,    britney 

spears   ) it is inefficient to keep on merging positional 
postings lists

    even more so for phrases like    the who   

    williams et al. (2004) evaluate a more 

sophisticated mixed indexing scheme
    a typical web query mixture was executed in    of the 

time of using just a positional index

    it required 26% more space than having a positional 

index alone

    caveat: all of this holds for    english-like    

languages
