lecture	19:	web	question	answering

the	name	information	retrieval	is	standard,	but	as	
traditionally	practiced,	it   s	not	really	right

all	you	get	is	document	retrieval,	and	beyond	that	the	
job	is	up	to	you

getting	information
the common person   s view? [from a novel]

   i like the internet. really, i do. any time i need a piece of 
shareware or i want to find out the weather in bogota     i   m 
the first guy to get the modem humming.  but as a source of 
information, it sucks.  you got a billion pieces of data, 
struggling to be heard and seen and downloaded, and 
anything i want to know seems to get trampled underfoot in 
the crowd.

web	search	in	2025?
the	web,	it	is	a	changing.	

what	will	people	do	in	2025?
   type	key	words	into	a	search	box?
   use	the	semantic	web?
   ask	questions	to	their	computer	in	natural	language?
   use	social	or	   human	powered   	search?

introduction	to	information	retrieval

what	do	we	know	that   s	happening?
   much	of	what	is	going	on	is	in	the	products	of	

companies,	and	there	isn   t	exactly	careful	research	
explaining	or	evaluating	it

   so	most	of	this	is	my	own	meandering	observations

provenance (the	source)	and	information	reliability,	
especially	among	   information	professionals   	
(reporters,	lawyers,	spies,	   )

been	a	decade	of	work	targeting	link	farms,	etc.

knowledge:	jeremy	zawodny says	   

is	the	goal	to	go	from	language	to	
knowledge	bases?	

knowledge:
not	just	semantics	but	pragmatics

pragmatics	=	taking	account	of	context	in	determining	meaning
a	natural	part	of	language	understanding	and	use

search	engines	are	great	because	they	inherently	take	into	account	
pragmatics	(   associations	and	contexts   )

    for	humans,	going	from	the	largely	unstructured	language	on	

the	web	to	actionable	information	is	effortlessly	easy

    but	for	computers,	it   s	rather	difficult!
    this	has	suggested	to	many	that	if	we   re	going	to	produce	the	
next	generation	of	intelligent	agents,	which	can	make	decisions	
on	our	behalf
    answering	our	routine	email
    booking	our	next	trip	to	fiji
then	we	still	first	need	to	construct	knowledge	bases

    to	go	from	languages	to	information
    but	should	we	rather	just	have	computers	work	with	language?
