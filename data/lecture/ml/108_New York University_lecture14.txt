random variables 

       a random variable is some aspect of the world about 

which we (may) have uncertainty 
       r = is it raining? 
       d = how long will it take to drive to work? 
       l = where am i? 

       we denote random variables with capital letters 

       random variables have domains 

       r in {true, false}   (sometimes write as {+r,   r}) 
       d in [0,    ) 
       l in possible locations, maybe {(0,0), (0,1),    } 

id203 distributions 

       discrete random variables have distributions 

t 

p 
warm  0.5 
cold 
0.5 

w 
sun 
rain 
fog 

meteor 

p 
0.6 
0.1 
0.3 
0.0 

       a discrete distribution is a table of probabilities of values 
       the id203 of a state (lower case) is a single number 

       must have:  

joint distributions 

       a joint distribution over a set of random variables: 

 specifies a real number for each assignment:  

       how many assignments if n variables with domain sizes d? 

       must obey: 

t 
hot 
hot 
cold 
cold 

w 
sun 
rain 
sun 
rain 

p 
0.4 
0.1 
0.2 
0.3 

       for all but the smallest distributions, impractical to write out or estimate 

      

instead, we make additional assumptions about the distribution 

marginal distributions 

       marginal distributions are sub-tables which eliminate variables  
       marginalization (summing out): combine collapsed rows by adding 

t 
hot

cold 

w 
sun 
rain

p 
0.4

p (t) =xw
p (w) =xt

p (t, w)

p (t, w)

t

w

p

p 
0.6

conditional probabilities 

       a simple relation between joint and conditional probabilities 

       in fact, this is taken as the definition of a id155 

t

p

conditional distributions 

       conditional distributions are id203 distributions over 

some variables given fixed values of others

the product rule 

       sometimes have conditional distributions but want the joint 

       example: 

w 
sun

p 
0.8

bayes    rule 

       two ways to factor a joint distribution over two variables: 

       dividing, we get: 

       why is this at all helpful? 

       let   s us build one conditional from its reverse 
       often one conditional is tricky but the other one is simple 
       foundation of many practical systems (e.g. asr, mt) 

      

in the running for most important ml equation!
