given:
1. a sample x1,          , xn.
2. an estimator   s of a statistic s.
bootstrap algorithm:
1. generate b bootstrap samples b1,          bb. each bootstrap sam-
ple is obtained by sampling n times with replacement from
sample data. bb.)

2. evaluate the estimator on each bootstrap sample:

  sb =   s(bb)

3. compute the bootstrap estimate of s by averaging over all

bootstrap samples:

face detection

credit: rapid id164 using a boosted cascade of simple

features by viola and jones 2001

goal: search for locations of faces in images.

solution:
1. divide the image into patches.
2. classify each piece as    face    or    not face   .

note: only a small number of patches represent faces.

please study the viola-jones paper for your    nal.

there will be a question on face detection, worth about 20%.

the article is available in the resources (piazza + courseworks).
