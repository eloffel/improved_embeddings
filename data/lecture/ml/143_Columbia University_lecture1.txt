tom mitchell

   a computer program is said to learn from experience e with
respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p , if
its performance at tasks in t , as measured by p , improves with
experience e.

ml tasks

binary classi   cation (categorization)
input:    examples    (instances, objects, individuals, observations)
with labels (outcome, output, response variable).

(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) / xi     x     rn, yi     y = {   1, +1}

output: h : x        y
example: approve credit yes/no, spam/ham.

question: how about digit recognition?

today   s teaser

learning from moocs data. let   s take coursera as an example.

    enumerate what data is involved?
    what are the characteristics of each piece of data?
    how big is the data?
    what questions would one ask? how would ml help improve

the whole coursera system?

    analyze the terms of service for coursera: who owns the
data? can it be shared? can you delete your data at anytime?
