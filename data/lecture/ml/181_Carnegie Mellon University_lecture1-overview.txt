what   if   i   m   not   sure   whether   i   meet   them?
    don   t   worry:   we   re   not   sure   either
    however,   we   ve   designed   a   way   to   assess   
your   background   knowledge   so   that   you   
know   what   to   study!

lectures

    you   should   ask   lots   of   questions

    interrupting   (by   raising   a   hand)   to   ask   your   question   

is   strongly   encouraged

    asking   questions   later   (or   in   real   time)   on   piazza   is   

also   great

    when   i   ask   a   question   

    i   want   you   to   answer
    even   if   you   don   t   answer,   think   it   through   as   though   

i   m   about   to   call   on   you

    interaction   improves   learning   (both   in-     class   and   

at   my   office   hours)

16

textbooks

you   are   not   required to   read   a   textbook,   but   it   
will   help   immensely!

17

syllabus

the   syllabus   is   located   on   the   course   webpage:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgorid113y/courses/10601-     s17

the   course   policies   are   required reading.

how   to   succeed   in   10-     601

19

how   to   succeed   in   601

    start   the   homework   assignments   early
    ask   the   course   staff   for   help   

(e.g.   office   hours)
    don   t   skip   lectures
    read   a   machine   learning   textbook

(seriously,   pick   one   and   read   it!)

20

how   to   not   succeed   in   601

    ignore   the   prerequisites
    stop   submitting   homework   assignments
    get   overwhelmed   by   the   fast   pace   of   the   

course,   but   tell   no   one
    copy   code   from   a   friend
    cheat   on   an   exam

21

teaching   assistants

    3-     4   tas   will   author   each   homework   

assignment

    those   are   the   best   tas   to   query   about   that   

assignment   in   office   hours

    it   is   not   the   tas   job   to   teach   you   a   

programming   language   or   to   debug   your   
program

frameworks   for   learning

    function   approximation
    probabilistic   approach
    information   theoretic   approach

25

learning   settings

    supervised   learning
    unsupervised   learning
    semi-     supervised   learning
    feature   learning
    structured   prediction*
    active   learning
    reinforcement    learning
    collaborative   filtering

26

theoretical   questions

    how   many   examples   do   we   need   to   learn?
    how   do   we   quantify   our   ability   to   generalize   

to   unseen   data?

    which   algorithms   are   better   suited   to   

specific   learning   settings?

27

machine   learning   &   ethics

what   ethical   responsibilities   do   we   
have   as   machine   learning   experts?

some   topics   that   we   

won   t   cover   are   probably   
deserve   an   entire   course

if   our   search   results   for   news   are   
optimized   for   ad   revenue,   might   
they   reflect   gender   /   racial   /   socio-     
economic   biases?

should   restrictions    be   placed   on   
intelligent   agents   that   are   capable   of   
interacting   with   the   world?

how   do   autonomous   vehicles   make   
decisions   when   all   of   the   outcomes   
are   likely   to   be   negative?
