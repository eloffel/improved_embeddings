what you should know 

    id90

   what is a decision tree, and how to induce it from data

    fundamental machine learning concepts

   difference between memorization and generalization
   what inductive bias is, and what is its role in learning. 
   what underfitting and overfitting means
   how to take a task and cast it as a learning problem

why you should never ever 
touch your test data!!

what you should know

    new algorithms
   id92 classification
   id116 id91

    fundamental ml concepts
   how to draw decision boundaries
   what decision boundaries tells us about the 

underlying classifiers

   the difference between supervised and 

unsupervised learning

what you should know

   id88 concepts

   training/prediction algorithms (standard, voting, 

averaged)

gives us

   convergence theorem and what practical guarantees it 

   how to draw/describe the decision boundary of a 

id88 classifier

   fundamental ml concepts

   determine whether a data set is linearly separable and 

define its margin

   error driven algorithms, online vs. batch algorithms

what you should know

   what are reductions and why they are useful

   implement, analyze and prove error bounds of 

algorithms for
   weighted binary classification
   multiclass classification (ova, ava)
