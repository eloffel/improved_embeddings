id110s definition 

a bayes network represents the joint id203 distribution 

over a collection of random variables 

 
a bayes network is a directed acyclic graph and a set of 

id155 distributions (cpd   s) 

       each node denotes a random variable 
       edges denote dependencies 
       for each node xi its cpd defines p(xi | pa(xi))
       the joint distribution over all variables is defined to be 

pa(x) = immediate parents of x in the graph

algorithm for constructing bayes network 
       choose an ordering over variables, e.g., x1, x2, ... xn  
       for i=1 to n 

       add xi to the network 
       select parents pa(xi) as minimal subset of x1 ... xi-1 such that  
 

notice this choice of parents assures

construction)

conditional independence, revisited 
       we said: 

       each node is conditionally independent of its non-descendents, 

given its immediate parents. 

       does this rule give us all of the conditional independence 

relations implied by the bayes network? 
       no! 
       e.g., x1 and x4 are conditionally indep given {x2, x3} 
       but x1 and x4 not conditionally indep given x3 
       for this, we need to understand d-separation

x and y are conditionally independent given z,     
if and only if x and y are d-separated by z. 
 
suppose we have three sets of random variables: x, y and z 
 
x and y are d-separated by z (and therefore conditionally indep, given z) 
iff every path from every variable in x to every variable in y is blocked 
 
a path from variable x to variable y is blocked if it includes a node in z 
such that either 
 
1.    arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node and 
this node is in z  
2.    or, the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor 
any of its descendants, is in z

from [bishop, 8.2] 

what you should know 
       bayes nets are convenient representation for 

encoding dependencies / conditional independence 

       bn = graph plus parameters of cpd   s 

       defines joint distribution over variables 
       can calculate everything else from that 
       though id136 may be intractable 

       reading conditional independence relations from the 

graph 
       each node is cond indep of non-descendents, given only its 

parents 

       d-separation 
          explaining away    

 

id136 in bayes nets 
      
       for certain cases, tractable 

in general, intractable (np-complete) 

       assigning id203 to fully observed set of variables 
       or if just one variable unobserved 
       or for singly connected graphs (ie., no undirected loops) 

       belief propagation 

       for multiply connected graphs 

       junction tree 

       sometimes use monte carlo methods 

       generate many samples according to the bayes net 

distribution, then count up the results
