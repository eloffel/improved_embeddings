1.1 id203 and statistics

1.1.1 axioms of id203

1. p (a)     0, where a is an event.
2. p (   ) = 1, where     is the sample space.
3. p (a     b) = p (a) + p (b), for disjoint a, b.

1.1.2 set operations apply to probabilities

commutative :a     b = b     a
a     b = b     a

associative :a     (b     c) = (a     b)     c
a     (b     c) = (a     b)     c

distributive :a     (b     c) = (a     b)     (a     c)
a     (b     c) = (a     b)     (a     c)

demorgan(cid:48)s : (a     b)c = ac     bc
(a     b)c = ac     bc

1.1.3 conditional probabilities and independence
the id155 of a given b is p (a|b) = p (a   b)
we can rearrange this de   nition to get the chain rule for probabilities: p (a     b) = p (a|b)p (b).
example: we roll two fair dice. what is the id203 that the sum is greater than six, given that one die
is a three?

(assuming p (b) > 0).

p (b)

1

a, b are independent if p (a     b) = p (a)p (b); equivalently, if p (b|a) = p (b) (when p (a) > 0).
a, b are conditionally independent given c if p (a     b|c) = p (a|c)p (b|c).

1.1.4 bayes    rule

p (a|b) =

p (b|a)p (a)

p (b)

=

p (b|a)p (a)

p (b|a)p (a) + p (b|ac)p (ac)

example: suppose you   re being screened for a rare, but serious disease that only 5% of the population
has. the screening procedure is 99% accurate, meaning it returns a positive result for 99% of people who
have the disease. if a person does not have the disease, the test returns positive 0.1% of the time. your
test returned a positive result. what is the chance that you actually have this disease; that is, what is
p (d = true|t = positive)?

x xp(x),
       xp(x)dx, x continuous

x discrete

   = e(x) =

  2 = v ar(x) = e((x       )2) = e(x 2)       2

(cid:80)

h(y ) =    (cid:88)

p (y = y) log2 p (y = y)

h(y |xi) =

p (xi = x)h(y |xi = x)

1.1.6 law of large numbers and central limit theorem
law of large numbers: if x1, ..., xn are iid with mean   , then   xn       , as n        .
   
central limit theorem: if x1, ..., xn are iid with mean    and variance   2, then
n        . (there are lots of other ways to express the clt; e.g.,
etc.)

n(   xn     )

   

  

n(   xn       )     n (0,   2), as
    n (0, 1),   xn     n (  ,   2/n),

1.2 id202

be familiar with: matrix/vector operations, determinants, norms, linear independence, ...

(lots of good resources listed on homework 1)

1.3 calculus

make sure you can... di   erentiate functions wrt variables (important for optimization).

let   s run the   algorithm on a short example to build a decision tree to predict the habitability of planets
based on size and orbit (question courtesy of martin azizyan).
