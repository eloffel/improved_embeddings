chapter 1:  
introduction 

big data 

3 

    widespread use of personal computers and 
wireless communication leads to    big data    

    we are both producers and consumers of data 
    data is not random, it has structure, e.g., customer 

behavior 

    we need    big theory    to extract that structure from 

data for 
(a) understanding the process 

(b) making predictions for the future  

 

 

why    learn    ? 

4 

    machine learning is programming computers to optimize 

a performance criterion using example data or past 
experience. 

    there is no need to    learn    to calculate payroll 

    learning is used when: 

    human expertise does not exist (navigating on mars), 

    humans are unable to explain their expertise (speech 

recognition) 

    solution changes in time (routing on a computer network) 

    solution needs to be adapted to particular cases (user 

biometrics) 

what we talk about when we  talk 
about    learning    

5 

    learning general models from a data of particular 

examples  

    data is cheap and abundant (data warehouses, 

data marts); knowledge is expensive and scarce.  

    example in retail: customer transactions to consumer 

behavior:  
  people who bought    blink    also bought    outliers     

(www.amazon.com) 

    build a model that is a good and useful 

approximation to the data.   

data mining 

6 

    retail: market basket analysis, customer 

relationship management (crm) 

    finance: credit scoring, fraud detection 
    manufacturing: control, robotics, troubleshooting 
    medicine: medical diagnosis 
    telecommunications: spam filters, intrusion detection 
    bioinformatics: motifs, alignment 
    web mining: search engines 
    ... 

what is machine learning? 

7 

    optimize a performance criterion using example 

data or past experience. 

    role of statistics: id136 from a sample 

    role of computer science: efficient algorithms to 

    solve the optimization problem 

    representing and evaluating the model for id136 

applications

    association 

    supervised learning 

    classification 

    regression 

    unsupervised learning 

    id23 

learning associations 

9 

    basket analysis:  

  p (y | x ) id203 that somebody who buys x 
also buys y where x and y are products/services. 

 

 

  example: p ( chips | beer ) = 0.7 

classification 

10 

    example: credit 

scoring 

    differentiating 

between low-risk and 
high-risk customers 
from their income and 
savings 

discriminant: if income >   1 and savings >   2  
 

then low-risk else high-risk 

 

 

 

classification: applications 

11 

    aka pattern recognition 
    face recognition: pose, lighting, occlusion (glasses, 

beard), make-up, hair style  

    character recognition: different handwriting styles. 
    id103: temporal dependency.  
    medical diagnosis: from symptoms to illnesses 
    biometrics: recognition/authentication using physical 

and/or behavioral characteristics: face, iris, 
signature, etc 

    outlier/novelty detection: 

face recognition

regression 

    example: price of a 

used car 

    x : car attributes 

  y : price 

 

 

y = g (x | q ) 

  g ( ) model, 

   q parameters 

y = wx+w0

regression applications 

14 

    navigating a car: angle of the steering 

    kinematics of a robot arm 

  1= g1(x,y) 
  2= g2(x,y) 

(x,y)

    response surface design 

supervised learning: uses 

15 

    prediction of future cases: use the rule to predict 

the output for future inputs 

    knowledge extraction: the rule is easy to 

understand 

    compression: the rule is simpler than the data it 

explains 

    outlier detection: exceptions that are not covered 

by the rule, e.g., fraud 

unsupervised learning 

16 

    learning    what normally happens    

    no output 

    id91: grouping similar instances 

    example applications 

    customer segmentation in crm 

    image compression: color quantization 

    bioinformatics: learning motifs 

id23

    learning a policy: a sequence of outputs 

    no supervised output but delayed reward

    robot in a maze 

    multiple agents, partial observability, ...
