decoding
find a translation that maximizes p(f|e)p(e)
np-complete for ibm model 1
use a phrase translation table (e.g., koehn   s pharaoh system, 2004)
use id67 to find the subset of phrase translations that covers the source sentence
combine with id125

naclo problem #1
naclo solution #1
clause restructuring (collins et al.)
ich werde ihnen den report aushaendigen     damit sie den eventuell uebernehment koennen.
i will pass_on to_you the report, so_that you can adopt that perhaps 
verb initial: that perhaps adopt can -> adopt that perhaps can
verb second: so that you adopt   can -> so that you can adopt
move subject: so that can you adopt -> so that you can adopt
particles: we accept the presidency *particle* -> we accept the presidency
(in german, split-prefix phrasal verbs are very common, 
e.g.,    anrufen    ->    rufen sie bitte noch einmal an        call right back please)
synchronous grammars
generate parse trees in parallel in two languages using different rules
e.g.,
np -> adj n (in english)
np -> n adj (in spanish)
itg (inversion transduction grammar) [wu 1995]
don   t allow all permutations in derivations
only <> and [ ] are allowed
