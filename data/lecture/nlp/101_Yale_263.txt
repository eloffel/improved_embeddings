mildly context-sensitive grammars
superset of id18
polynomial parsing
o(n6)
constant growth property
(string length grows linearly)
cannot handle the language of strings with the same number of as, bs, and cs.

[example from julia hockenmaier]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mildly_context-sensitive_grammar_formalism]
other formalisms
tree substitution grammar (tsg)
terminals generate entire tree fragments
tsg and id18 are formally equivalent

mildly context-sensitive grammars
more powerful than tsg
examples:
id34 (tag)
id35 (id35)

(tree) operations in tag
substitution
insert an initial tree to the bottom of a tree
adjunction (not in tsg)
insert an auxiliary tree fragment in the middle of a tree
used for long-distance dependencies and for optional modifiers
features
each elementary tree has features that can be associated with the top half and with the bottom half
unification is needed
(lexicalization)
ltag: each initial or auxiliary tree is labeled with a lexical item

id34 (tag)
it can generate languages like anbncndn or ww (cross-serial dependencies): 
e.g., mary gave a book and a magazine to chen and mike, respectively.
expressive power
tag is formally more powerful than id18 
tag is less powerful than id19

tag example
maria sings
maria often sings  (optional modifier)
[example from jungo kasai]

cross-serial dependencies (anbn)
notes
embedded pushdown automaton (vijay-shanker 1988)
similar to the usual pushdown automaton for id18, but the stack includes stacks of symbols, instead of symbols directly
it can generate the language {anbncndn}
