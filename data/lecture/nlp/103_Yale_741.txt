notes
id56s are used to keep    memory   , just like finite-state automata
they can be used as generators, acceptors, transducers, etc.
application to machine translation
sequence-to-sequence learning (sutskever, vinyals, and le, 2014)
other applications
id38 (mikolov 2012)
character-level id56s for text generation
