common mistake: using     as the main connective with    :
   x cat(x)     eatsfish(x)
means    everyone is a cat and everyone eats fish

first order logic
solutions
lambda expressions
example
inc(x) =   x x+1
then inc(4) = (  x x+1)(4) = 5
example
add(x,y) =   x,  y(x+y)
then add(3,4) = (  x,  y(x+y))(3)(4)= (  y 3+y)(4) = 3+4 = 7
useful for id29 (see later)
