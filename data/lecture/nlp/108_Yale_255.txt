dependency grammars
characteristics
lexical/syntactic dependencies between words
the top-level predicate of a sentence is the root
simpler to parse than context-free grammars
particularly useful for free word order languages
how to identify the heads
h=head, m=modifier
h determines the syntactic category of the construct
h determines the semantic category of the construct
h is required; m may be skipped
fixed linear position of m with respect to h

head rules from collins   s thesis
non-projectivity
rare in english
topicalization
cats, i like a lot.
extraposition
the pizza is ready with pepperoni.

notes
how to extend a projective method for non-projective parses
use a swap operator (nivre 2009)
not clear what to do with conjunctions
