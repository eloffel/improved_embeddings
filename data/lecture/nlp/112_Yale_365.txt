introduction to nlp
id29
id29
converting natural language to a logical form
e.g., executable code for a specific application
example:
airline reservations
geographical query systems

stages of id29
input
sentence
syntactic analysis
syntactic structure
semantic analysis
semantic representation
id152
add semantic attachments to id18 rules
id152
parse the sentence syntactically
associate some semantics to each word
combine the semantics of words and non-terminals recursively
until the root of the sentence
example
input
javier likes pizza
output
like(javier, pizza)
example
s  -> np vp   {vp.sem(np.sem)}    t
vp -> v np    {v.sem(np.sem)}     <e,t>
np -> n       {n.sem}             e
v  -> likes   {   x,y likes(x,y)   <e,<e,t>>
n  -> javier  {javier}            e
n  -> pizza   {pizza}             e


id29
associate a semantic expression with each node
javier
likes
pizza
v:    x,y likes(x,y)
n: pizza
vp:   x likes(x,pizza)
n: javier
s: likes(javier, pizza)
grammar with semantic attachments
example from jurafsky and martin
using id35 (steedman 1996)
id35 representations for semantics
adj:   x.tall(x)
(s\np)/adj :   f.  x.f(x)
np: yaoming
yaoming        is                  tall
      np       (s\np)/adj      adj
yaoming         f.  x.f(x)       x.tall(x)
                              s\np
                              x.tall(x)
                          s
                  tall (yaoming)

framenet
represents
events, relations, states, entities
1,195 semantic frames
example: absorb_heat
an entity (generally food) is exposed to a heat_source whose temperature may also be specified. generally, the entity undergoes some sort of change as a result of this process.
bacon was frying in the pan, and a great heap of eggs already lay steaming on a plate.
if it cooks at 400 for an hour, it 'll be nothing but a pile of ash!
1,774 frame-to-frame relations

status of amr
amr currently lacks
multilingual consideration
quantifier scope
co-references across sentences
grammatical number, tense, aspect, quotation marks
many noun-noun or noun-adjective relations
many detailed frames, e.g. earthquake (with roles for magnitude, epicenter, casualties, etc)
