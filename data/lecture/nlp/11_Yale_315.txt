id138
id138 is a project run by george miller (1920-2012) and christiane fellbaum at princeton university.
it includes a database of words (mainly nouns and verbs but also adjectives and adverbs) and semantic relations between them.
the main relation is hypernymy, so the overall structure of the database is more tree-like (see next slide).
