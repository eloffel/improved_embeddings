text similarity
introduction
text similarity
motivation
people can express the same concept (or related concepts) in many different ways. for example,    the plane leaves at 12pm    vs    the flight departs at noon   
text similarity is a key component of natural language processing
uses in nlp
if the user is looking for information about cats, we may want the nlp system to return documents that mention kittens even if the word    cat    is not in them. 
if the user is looking for information about    fruit dessert   , we want the nlp system to return documents about    peach tart    or    apple cobbler   .
a id103 system should be able to tell the difference between similar sounding words like the    dulles    and    dallas    airports.

types of text similarity
many types of text similarity exist:
morphological similarity (e.g., respect-respectful)
spelling similarity (e.g., theater-theatre)
synonymy (e.g., talkative-chatty)
homophony (e.g., raise-raze-rays)
semantic similarity (e.g., cat-tabby)
sentence similarity (e.g., paraphrases)
document similarity (e.g., two news stories on the same event)
