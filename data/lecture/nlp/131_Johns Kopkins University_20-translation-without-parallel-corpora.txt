distributional hypothesis

if we consider oculist and eye-doctor we    nd 
that, as our corpus of utterances grows, these 
two occur in almost the same environments.  in 
contrast, there are many sentence environments 
in which oculist occurs but lawyer does not... 

it is a question of the relative frequency of such 
environments, and of what we will obtain if we 
ask an informant to substitute any word he 
wishes for oculist (not asking what words have 
the same meaning).   

these and similar tests all measure the 
id203 of particular environments occurring 
with particular elements...  if a and b have 
almost identical environments we say that they 
are synonyms.

russian candidate translations. we    rst collect the topical signatures for each word (e.g.
troops appears in the page about barack obama 15 times and in the page about virginia
32 times.) based on the interlingually linked pages. we can then directly compare each
pair of topical signatures.

how	
   good	
   is	
   each	
   approach?

we have a wide variety of using monolingual texts to measure 
translation equivalence.  which is the best? 

we measured the accuracy on 24 languages: albanian, azeri, 
bengali, bosnian, bulgarian, cebuano, gujarati, hindi, 
hungarian, indonesian, latvian, nepali, romanian, serbian, 
slovak, somali, swedish, tamil, telugu, turkish, ukrainian, 
uzbek, vietnamese and welsh. 

for each foreign word we computed a ranked list of english 
words using each signal of translation equivalence. 

the number of candidate english words varied by language, 
from 34,000 to 287,000.

3.1 evaluation metric

we compared the predictions against a bilingual dictionary for 
each language, and calculated whether a good translation 
we measure performance using accuracy in the top-k ranked translations. we de   ne

top-k accuracy over some set of ranked lists l as follows:

where ilk is an indicator function that is 1 if and only if a correct item is included in the
top-k elements of list l. that is, top-k accuracy is the proportion of ranked lists in a set
of ranked lists for which a correct item is included anywhere in the highest k ranked
elements. the denominator l is the number of words in a test set for a language. the

number of languages, and (3) introducing a discriminative model to set the weights of
each feature to optimize translation quality.

combining	
   signals

6.1 baseline combination technique: mrr

on its own, each of these measures of translation equivalence is 
a weak signal.  

as our baseline combination, we use the mean reciprocal rank (mrr) across all mono-
lingual signals, h,

can we combine the weak signals into something stronger?  if 
so, how?

 1 over the rank 

m rre

1

rh e

h h
h

mean reciprocal rank

where rh e is the rank of english word e under the monolingual similarity measure h.
this unsupervised approach to rank aggregation assumes no prior knowledge of which
signals are likely to be the most informative.

set of signals

rank of word e by signal h

combining	
   signals

mrr is an unsupervised approach to combining signals.  we 
also introduce a novel discriminative approach that exploits the 
fact we use a small bilingual dictionary to project across vector 
spaces. 

we train a binary classifier to predict whether a word is a 
translation or not.  translations from our dictionary serve as 
positive training examples.  each one is paired with 3 randomly 
selected non-translations as negative training examples. 

we rank translations based on the strength of the classifier   s 
prediction that a word is a translation.
