   awful	
   german	
   language

   
 the germans have another kind 
of parenthesis, which they make 
by splitting a verb in two and 
putting half of it at the beginning 
of an exciting chapter and the 
other half at the end of it. 
can any one conceive of 
anything more confusing than 
that? these things are called 
   separable verbs.    the wider the 
two portions of one of them are 
spread apart, the better the 
author of the crime is pleased 
with his performance.

phrase-based models have an overly simplistic 
way of handling different word orders.

we can describe the linguistic differences 
between different languages. 

collins defines a set of 6 simple, linguistically 
motivated rules, and demonstrates that they 
result in significant translation improvements.

the	
   awful	
   german	
   language

   

some german words are so long 
that they have a perspective. 
freundschaftsbezeigungen. 
dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.   
stadtverordnetenversammlungen. 
these things are not words, they 
are alphabetical processions. and 
they are not rare; one can open a 
german newspaper at any time 
and see them marching 
majestically across the page   and 
if he has any imagination he can 
see the banners and hear the 
music, too.

 a dog is der hund; now you put 
that dog in the genitive case, and is 
he the same dog he was before? 
no, sir; he is des hundes; put him 
in the dative case and what is he? 
why, he is dem hund. now you 
snatch him into the accusative case 
and how is it with him? why, he is 
den hunden. but suppose he 
happens to be twins and you have to 
pluralize him- what then? why, 
they'll swat that twin dog around 
through the 4 cases until he'll think 
he's an entire international dog 
show. i don't like dogs, but i wouldn't 
treat a dog like that.

the	
   awful	
   german	
   language

   
 the germans have an inhuman 
way of cutting up their verbs. 
now a verb has a hard time 
enough of it in this world when 
it's all together. it's downright 
inhuman to split it up. but that's 
just what those germans do. 
they take part of a verb and put 
it down here, like a stake, and 
they take the other part of it and 
put it away over yonder like 
another stake, and between 
these two limits they just shovel 
in german.
