what a scene!  seized by the 
tentacle and glued to its suckers, 
the unfortunate man was swinging 
in the air at the mercy of this 
enormous appendage.  he gasped, 
he choked, he yelled: "help!  help!"  
i'll hear his harrowing plea the rest 
of my life!    
the poor fellow was done for.  

what a scene!  the unhappy man, 
seized by the tentacle and    xed to 
its suckers, was balanced in the air 
at the caprice of this enormous 
trunk. he rattled in his throat, he 
was sti   ed, he cried, "help! help!" 
that heart-rending cry!  i shall 
hear it all my life.  
the unfortunate man was lost.  

id141 with 

parallel monolingual data
barzilay and mckeown (2001) identify paraphrases 

using identical contexts in aligned sentences: 
emma burst into tears and he tried to comfort her, 

saying things to make her smile.  

emma cried and he tried to console her, adorning 

his words with puns.  

burst into tears = cried and comfort = console 

id141 with 
comparable texts

dolan, quirk, and brockett (2004) extract 

sentential paraphrases from newspaper articles 

published on the same topic and date:
on its way to an extended mission at saturn, the 

cassini probe on friday makes its closest 
rendezvous with saturn's dark moon phoebe.
the cassini spacecraft, which is en route to 

saturn, is about to make a close pass of the ringed 

planet's mysterious moon phoebe.

distributional hypothesis

if we consider oculist and eye-doctor we    nd 
that, as our corpus of utterances grows, these 
two occur in almost the same environments.  in 
contrast, there are many sentence environments 
in which oculist occurs but lawyer does not... 

it is a question of the relative frequency of such 
environments, and of what we will obtain if we 
ask an informant to substitute any word he 
wishes for oculist (not asking what words have 
the same meaning).   

these and similar tests all measure the 
id203 of particular environments occurring 
with particular elements...  if a and b have 
almost identical environments we say that they 
are synonyms. 

   zellig harris (1954)

dirt

lin and panel (2001) operationalize the distributional 
hypothesis using dependency relationships to de   ne 

similar environments. 

 

duty and responsibility share a similar set of 
dependency contexts in large volumes of text:

modi   ed by adjectives
additional, administrative, 

assigned, assumed, collective, 
congressional, constitutional ...

objects of verbs

assert, assign, assume, 
attend to, avoid, become, 

breach ...

id141 & translation
translation is re-writing a text using 
words in a different language. 

id141 is translation into the 
same language.

have been shown to address both these issues, ob-
taining paraphrases via a pivoting step over foreign
language phrases (bannard and callison-burch,
2005). the coverage of paraphrase lexica extracted
from bitexts has been shown to outperform that
obtained from other sources (zhao et al., 2008a).
while there have been efforts pursuing the extrac-
tion of more powerful paraphrases (madnani et
al., 2007; callison-burch, 2008; cohn and lapata,
2008; zhao et al., 2008b), it is not yet clear to which
extent sentential paraphrases can be induced from

phrase induction to produce rich syntactic para-

    perform a thorough analysis of the types of

phrase table, english paraphrases can be obtained
by pivoting through foreign language phrases. since
paraphrase id203
many paraphrases can be extracted for a phrase,
bannard and callison-burch rank them using a para-
phrase id203 de   ned in terms of the translation
model probabilities p(f|e) and p(e|f ):

from bitexts?

bilingual parallel corpora provide an excellent source 

of lexical and phrasal paraphrases.   

sentential | structural paraphrases are more 

obviously learned from english-english sentence

model that will allow it to score its own output for the 
task
augment the grammar: use your domain knowledge 
to add any rules that would not normally be contained in 
a paraphrase grammar.
other features: take advantage of the english to 
english to add other features that model grammaticality 
more generally.

summary

extraction & representation 

extended large-scale paraphrase acquisition 
from bitexts to syntactic paraphrases  

generation


introduced a straightforward and effective 
adaptation framework 
extensions beyond smt


improved performance by using monolingual 
information

current directions

domain-speci   c id141


what if we want to generate paraphrases for speci   c 
domains like biology?  do they vary?  how do we ensure 
ours are appropriate  

polysemy of paraphrases


our method sometimes groups paraphrases that 
correspond to different senses of the input phrase.  how 
can we partition them into sets? 

paraphrase recognition and entailment 


the rte problem diverges in interesting ways from 
id141.  we are combining natural language 
id136 and data-driven id141.
