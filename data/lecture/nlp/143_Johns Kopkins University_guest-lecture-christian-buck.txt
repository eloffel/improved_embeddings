quality estimation

christian buck,

university of edinburgh

in this lecture you will ...

    lose trust in mt
    learn how to trust some mt
    learn how to build a complete confidence 

estimation system

    be surprised how easy that is
    be also surprised how hard it is

mt - what is it good for?

    making websites available
    skyping with foreign landlords
    post-editing
    trading (including hft)
    information retrieval

easy to fail at any of these

(sentence level) quality estimation

produce quality score

    given source and (machine) translation
    without reference translation

applications:

    good enough for publishing (print signs)?
    inform readers
    hide terrible translation from post-editors
    decide between different systems

q = f(source, target)

q = f(source, target, mt)

2003 summer workshop @ jhu

what is good quality?

early work: predict automatic scores
    id7  (~trustrank)
    wer
    [many other scores not yet invented]

problem: noisy on sentence level

good quality for gisting

content should be comprehensible
accuracy over fluency?

gold standard:
    collect feedback from users

    likert scores 1-4, 1-5, ...

    answer questions

good quality for post-editing

time is money
avoid making translators hate their job
fit with workflow
only show mt if speedup expected

measure time, collect interface actions
humans are complicated

summary

1. specify objective
2. get training data
3. extract features
4. train classifier / regression model
5. profit!

necessary tool for human trials

features

think of some features!

common good features

    source sentence perplexity
    number of out-of-vocabulary words
    number of words with many translations
    number of words in source
    mismatched question marks

simple source side features

    language model score
    number of 

    words
    characters

    percentage of
    proper names
    numbers
    punctuation characters
    very rare/common words/ngrams

by quoting men singing off-color songs about 
their beauty.

    how many subsets?

feature selection

find best subset of 24 features

    testing 1 subset takes 1m. how long?

greedy feature selection

forward selection
    add feature that gives best improvement on 

dev set

backward selection
    remove feature that gives best improvement 

on dev set (when it   s gone)
