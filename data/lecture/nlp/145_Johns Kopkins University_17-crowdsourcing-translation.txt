quality control

cheating with google translate

we de   ne an assignment   s quality as the proportion
of controls that are correct in a given assignment,
where correct means exactly correct or judged to be

 (trij 2 syns[gj])

(1)

where ai is the ith assignment, ki is the number of
controls in ai, trij is the turker   s provided transla-
tion of control word j in assignment i, gj is the gold
standard translation of control word j, syns[gj] is
the set of words judged to be synonymous with gj
and includes gj, and  (x) is kronecker   s delta and
takes value 1 when x is true. most assignments had
two known words embedded, so most assignments

(3)

where assigns[i] is the assignments completed
by turker i, and quality(a) is as above.

| assigns[i] |
translation quality
quality(li) = ptj2turkers[i] quality(tj)

quality for a language is then given by

| turkers[i] |

when a turker completed assignments in more than
one language, their quality was computed separately
for each language. figure 4 shows the transla-
tion quality for languages with contributions from
at least 50 workers.
cheating using machine translation one obvi-
ous way for workers to cheat is to use available
online translation tools. although we followed
best practices to deter copying-and-pasting into on-
line mt systems by rendering words and sentences

the los angeles times reported that at about 5:20 p.m. 
on tuesday march 4, 2003, a bomb concealed in a 
backpack exploded at the airport in davao city, the 
second largest city in the philippines. at least 23 
people were reported dead, with more than 140 injured, 
and president arroyo of the philippines characterized 
the blast as a terrorist act. 
with the 13 hour time difference, it was then at 4:20 
a.m on the same date in washington, dc. twenty-four 
hours later, at 4:13 a.m. on march 5, participants in 
the translingual information detection, extraction and 
summarization (tides) program were noti   ed that 
cebuano had been chosen as the language of interest 
for a    surprise language    practice exercise that had been 
planned quite independently to begin on that date. the 
noti   cation observed that cebuano is spoken by 24% of 
the population of the philippines and that it is the lingua 
franca in the south philippines, where the event 
occurred.

gun violence database

over 3,000 cities. figure 4 shows how intentional
and unintentional shootings were distributed across
the country. while there is some error mapping ar-
ticles to the date of the shooting, the articles are
roughly evenly spaced over the year (see figure 3).

interface we use alchemy to perform title, date,
and entity extraction for each of our articles. our
hit interface presents the text of each article, with
entities highlighted so they can be easily referenced,
as well as a link to the original article. the text is
displayed in a split screen along side a form con-
taining the questions from table 2. where possible
(e.g for    state    or    age of shooter   ) we constrain the
file:///users/ellie/documents/research/gun-database/results/times.html
workers answers using multiple choice. for free-text
answers, we prompt the worker with a list of sug-
gested answers based on the extracted entities. e.g.
file:///users/ellie/documents/research/gun-database/results/deets.html
for    name of shooter    we provide the list of people
figure 2). 512 reports involve shooters who are un-
which were identi   ed in the text. our hit interface
der the age of 18.
is show in figure 1.

figure 7: victims and shooters by race.

74% of our records contain information about the
time of day of the shooting (see figure 6). 90% con-
tain information about shooter gender, 70% contain
4 costs

6 possible future steps
extending the coverage of the database would in-
volve pulling articles from sources other than the
gunreport. besides being limited in number of
articles, the gunreport data may contain substan-
tial bias, having been curated by one individual.
crawling local television and news sites and using
automatic text classi   cation, as was discussed pre-
liminarily in section 2, is one possible approach
which may reduce this bias. alternatively, ar-
ticle collecting could be crowdsourced and built
into the pipeline. additional expansions could in-
clude gathering information about the reporting it-
self (e.g. prominence of the article on a website,
presence/absence of a photo).

coverage aside, further improvements can be
made to enrich existing records in the database. no
efforts have yet been explored to de-duplicate the
records. while the gunreport articles are unlikely
to contain many repeated reports, articles gathered
through a web crawl or through id104 are
very likely to contain either repeat articles or mul-
tiple unique articles reporting on the same incident.
