because we want to provide everyone with access to 
all the world's information, including information 
written in every language, one of the exciting projects 
at google research is machine translation... now you 
can see the results for yourself. we recently launched 
an online version of our system for arabic-english 

and english-arabic. try it out!

develop a statistical  model of translation that can be 
learned from data and used to predict the correct 
english translation of new chinese sentences.
