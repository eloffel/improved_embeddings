automatic evaluation 

    understanding advantages of human versus 
    details of id7
    how to validate automatic id74 
    what makes a good {manual / automatic} 

evaluation?

evaluating mt quality

    why do we want to do it?
    want to rank systems
    want to evaluate incremental changes
    what to make scienti   c claims
    how not to do it
       back translation   
    the vodka is not good

human evaluation of mt 
v.  automatic evaluation
    human evaluation is
    ultimately what we're interested in, but
    very time consuming
    not re-usable 
    automatic evaluation is
    cheap and reusable, but
    not necessarily reliable

goals for 

automatic evaluation
    no cost evaluation for incremental changes
    ability to rank systems
    ability to identify which sentences we're 
doing poorly on,  and categorize errors
    correlation with human judgments
    interpretability of the score

methodology

    comparison against reference translations
    intuition: closer we get to human translations, 
    could use wer like in id103

the better we're doing

word error rate

    levenshtein distance (also "id153")
    minimum number of insertions, substitutions, 
and deletions needed to transform one string 
into another

    useful measure in id103
    this shows how easy it is to recognize speech
    this shows how easy it is to wreck a nice beach

problems with using 
wer for translation?

    (discuss with your neighbor)

problems with wer

    unlike id103 we don't have the 
assumption of 
    exact match against the reference 
    in machine translation there can be many 

possible (and equally valid) ways of translating 
a sentence
    this shows how easy it is to recognize speech
    it illustrates how simple it is to transcribe the spoken 

word

problems with wer

    unlike id103 we don't have the 
assumption of 
    linearity 
    clauses can move around, since we're not 
doing transcription 
    this shows how easy it is to recognize speech
    it is easy to recognize speech, as this shows
    this shows that recognizing speech is easy

solutions?

    (talk to your neighbor)

solutions

    compare against lots of test sentences
    use multiple reference translations for each 
    look for phrase / id165 matches, allow

movement

id7

    bilingual evaluation understudy
    uses multiple reference translations
    look for id165s that occur anywhere in the

which will take him to miami, florida.

would take him to miami, florida.

plane that was to carry him to miami in florida.

ref 4 orejuela seemed quite calm as he was being led to the american

papineni et al. (2002) de   ne id7 in terms of id165 precision. they calculate an
id165 precision
id165 precision score, pn, for each id165 length by summing over the matches for
every hypothesis sentence s in the complete corpus c as:

pn =

  s2c   ngram2scountmatched(ngram)

  s2c   ngram2scount(ngram)

id7   s id165 precision is modi   ed slightly to eliminate repetitions that occur across
sentences. for example, even though the bigram    to miami    is repeated across all four
reference translations in table 6.1, it is counted only once in a hypothesis translation.
these is referred to as clipped id165 precision.

    id7 modi   es this precision to eliminate 
repetitions that occur across sentences.

id7   s calculates precision for each length of id165 up to a certain maximum

scheme, recall would be underestimated for each hypothesis translation.

rather than de   ning id165 recall id7 instead introduces a brevity penalty to com-
pensate for the possibility of proposing high-precision hypothesis translations which
are too short. the brevity penalty is calculated as:

brevity penalty
bp =( 1

e1 r/c

if
if

c > r
c     r

translations

where c is the length of the corpus of hypothesis translations, and r is the effective
reference corpus length. the effective reference corpus length is calculated as the sum
of the single reference translation from each set which is closest to the hypothesis
translation.

    c is the length of the corpus of hypothesis 
    r is the effective reference corpus length
    the effective reference corpus length is the 
sum of the single reference translation from 
each set that is closest to the hypothesis 
translation.

the brevity penalty is combined with the weighted sum of id165 precision scores

to give id7 score. id7 is thus calculated as

brevity penalty

id7 

id7 = bp     exp(

n=1

wn logpn)

a id7 score can range from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate closer matches to
the reference translations, and where a score of 1 is assigned to a hypothesis translation
which exactly matches one of the reference translations. a score of 1 is also assigned
to a hypothesis translation which has matches for all its id165s (up to the maximum n
measured by id7) in the clipped reference id165s, and which has no brevity penalty.
to give an idea of how id7 is calculated we will walk through what the id7
score would be for the hypothesis translation given in table 6.1. counting punctuation

    geometric average of the id165 precisions
    optionally weight them with w

problems with id7

    (discuss with your neighbor)

problems with id7
    synonyms and paraphrases are only handled 

if they are in the set of multiple reference 
translations

    the scores for words are equally weighted 
so missing out on content-bearing material 
brings no additional penalty.

    the brevity penalty is a stop-gap measure to 
compensate for the fairly serious problem of 
not being able to calculate recall.
