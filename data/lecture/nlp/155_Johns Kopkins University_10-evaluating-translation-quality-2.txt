scheme, recall would be underestimated for each hypothesis translation.

rather than de   ning id165 recall id7 instead introduces a brevity penalty to com-
pensate for the possibility of proposing high-precision hypothesis translations which
are too short. the brevity penalty is calculated as:

brevity penalty
bp =( 1

e1 r/c

if
if

c > r
c     r

translations

where c is the length of the corpus of hypothesis translations, and r is the effective
reference corpus length. the effective reference corpus length is calculated as the sum
of the single reference translation from each set which is closest to the hypothesis
translation.

    c is the length of the corpus of hypothesis 
    r is the effective reference corpus length
    the effective reference corpus length is the 
sum of the single reference translation from 
each set that is closest to the hypothesis 
translation.

the brevity penalty is combined with the weighted sum of id165 precision scores

to give id7 score. id7 is thus calculated as

id7 

id7 = bp     exp(

n=1

wn logpn)

a id7 score can range from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate closer matches to
the reference translations, and where a score of 1 is assigned to a hypothesis translation
which exactly matches one of the reference translations. a score of 1 is also assigned
to a hypothesis translation which has matches for all its id165s (up to the maximum n
measured by id7) in the clipped reference id165s, and which has no brevity penalty.
to give an idea of how id7 is calculated we will walk through what the id7
score would be for the hypothesis translation given in table 6.1. counting punctuation

    geometric average of the id165 precisions
    optionally weight them with w

problems with id7

    (discuss with your neighbor)

problems with id7
    synonyms and paraphrases are only handled 

if they are in the set of multiple reference 
translations

    the scores for words are equally weighted 
so missing out on content-bearing material 
brings no additional penalty.

    the brevity penalty is a stop-gap measure to 
compensate for the fairly serious problem of 
not being able to calculate recall.

these timing    gures are promising because they
indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the
most reliable on (constituent ranking and sentence
ranking) were also much quicker to complete than
the ones that they were unreliable on (assigning    u-
ency and adequacy scores). this suggests that    u-
ency and adequacy should be replaced with ranking
tasks in future evaluation exercises.

id7 score

coughlin (2003) performs a large-scale inves-
tigation of id7   s correlation with human judg-
ments, and    nds one example that fails to corre-
late. her future work section suggests that she
has preliminary evidence that statistical machine
translation systems receive a higher id7 score
than their non-id165-based counterparts.

6 conclusions
in this paper we have shown theoretical and prac-
tical evidence that id7 may not correlate with hu-
man judgment to the degree that it is currently be-

chine translation can be time consuming and ex-
pensive. an automatic evaluation metric, on the
other hand, can be used for frequent tasks like
monitoring incremental system changes during de-
velopment, which are seemingly infeasible in a
manual evaluation setting.

the way that id7 and other automatic evalu-
ation metrics work is to compare the output of a
machine translation system against reference hu-
man translations. machine translation evaluation
metrics differ from other metrics that use a refer-
ence, like the word error rate metric that is used

however, there is a question as to whether min-
imizing the error rate with respect to id7 does in-
deed guarantee genuine translation improvements.
if id7   s correlation with human judgments has
been overestimated, then the    eld needs to ask it-
self whether it should continue to be driven by
id7 to the extent that it currently is.

evaluation

when writing a paper
    if you're writing a paper that claims that 
  - one approach to machine translation is  
    better than another, or that 
  - some modi   cation you've made to a 
    system has improved translation quality

    then you need to back up that claim
    id74 can help, but good 

experimental design is also critical
