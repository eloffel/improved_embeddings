context-free grammars

hopcroft and ullman, 1979

a id18 g = (n,   , r, s) where:

(cid:73) n is a set of non-terminal symbols
(cid:73)    is a set of terminal symbols
(cid:73) r is a set of rules of the form x     y1y2 . . . yn
(cid:73) s     n is a distinguished start symbol

for n     0, x     n , yi     (n       )

a context-free grammar for english

n = {s, np, vp, pp, dt, vi, vt, nn, in}
s = s
   = {sleeps, saw, man, woman, telescope, the, with, in}

r =

s     np vp
vp     vi
vp     vt
np
vp     vp pp
np     dt nn
np     np pp
pp     in
np

vi     sleeps
vt     saw
nn     man
nn     woman
nn     telescope
dt     the
in     with
in     in
note: s=sentence, vp=verb phrase, np=noun phrase,
pp=prepositional phrase, dt=determiner, vi=intransitive verb,
vt=transitive verb, nn=noun, in=preposition

left-most derivations

a left-most derivation is a sequence of strings s1 . . . sn, where

(cid:73) s1 = s, the start symbol
(cid:73) sn          , i.e. sn is made up of terminal symbols only
(cid:73) each si for i = 2 . . . n is derived from si   1 by picking the

left-most non-terminal x in si   1 and replacing it by some   
where x        is a rule in r

for example: [s], [np vp], [d n vp], [the n vp], [the man vp],
[the man vi], [the man sleeps]

properties of id18s

(cid:73) a id18 de   nes a set of possible derivations
(cid:73) a string s           is in the language de   ned by the
id18 if there is at least one derivation that yields s

(cid:73) each string in the language generated by the id18
may have more than one derivation (   ambiguity   )
