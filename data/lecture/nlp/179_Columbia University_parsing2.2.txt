weaknesses of pid18s

(cid:73) lack of sensitivity to lexical information

if q(np     np pp) > q(vp     vp pp) then (b) is more
probable, else (a) is more probable.

words

here the two parses have identical rules, and
therefore have identical id203 under any
assignment of pid18 rule probabilities

(cid:73) example: president of a company in africa

(cid:73) both parses have the same rules, therefore receive same

id203 under a pid18

(cid:73)    close attachment    (structure (a)) is twice as likely in wall

street journal text.

structural preferences: close attachment

previous example: john was believed to have been shot by bill

here the low attachment analysis (bill does the shooting) contains
same rules as the high attachment analysis (bill does the
believing), so the two analyses receive same id203.
