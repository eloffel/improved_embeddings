if you got a billion dollars to spend on a huge research project that you get 
to lead, what would you like to do?

(sep 2014)

[   ]michaelijordan
i'd use the billion dollars to build a nasa-size program focusing on natural 
language processing (nlp), in all of its glory (semantics, pragmatics, etc).
intellectually i think that nlp is fascinating, allowing us to focus on highly-
structured id136 problems, on issues that go to the core of "what is 
thought" but remain eminently practical, and on a technology that surely 
would make the world a better place.

(sep 2014)

   although current deep learning research tends to claim to encompass nlp, i'm (1) 
much less convinced about the strength of the results, compared to the results in, 
say, vision; (2) much less convinced in the case of nlp than, say, vision, the way to 
go is to couple huge amounts of data with black-box learning architectures.

  

i'd invest in some of the human-intensive labeling processes that one sees in projects 
like framenet and (gasp) projects like cyc. i'd do so in the context of a full merger of 
"data" and "knowledge", where the representations used by the humans can be 
connected to data and the representations used by the learning systems are directly 
tied to linguistic structure. i'd do so in the context of clear concern with the usage of 
language (e.g., causal reasoning).

frame semantics

   frame: semantic frames are schematic representations of situations

involving various participants, propositions, and other conceptual 
roles.

   frame elements (fes) include events, states, relations and entities.

case grammar -> frames
   valency: predicates have arguments (optional & required)

   example:    give    requires 3 arguments:

   agent (a), object (o), and beneficiary (b)
   jones (a) gave money (o) to the school (b)

   frames:

   commercial transaction frame: buy/sell/pay/spend
   save <good thing> from <bad situation>
   risk <valued object> for 

<situation>|<purpose>|<beneficiary>|<motivation>

   collocations & typical predicate argument relations

   save whales from extinction (not vice versa)
   ready to risk everything for what he believes

thematic (semantic) roles

   agent - the volitional causer of an event

   the waiter spilled the soup

   experiencer - the experiencer of an event

   john has a headache

   force - the non-volitional causer of an event

   the wind blows debris from the mall into our yards.

   theme - the participant most directly affected by an event

   only after benjamin franklin broke the ice ...

   result - the end product of an event

   the french government has built a regulation-size baseball 

diamond ...

thematic (semantic) roles

   instrument - an instrument used in an event

   he turned to poaching catfish, stunning them with a shocking 

device ...

   beneficiary - the beneficiary of an event

   whenever ann makes hotel reservations for her boss ...

   source - the origin of the object of a transfer event

   i flew in from boston

   goal - the destination of an object of a transfer event

   i drove to portland

   can we read semantic roles off from pid18 or dependency 

parse trees?

semantic roles    grammatical roles

   agent     the volitional causer of an event

   usually    subject   , sometimes    prepositional argument   , ...

   theme     the participant directly affected by an event

   usually    object   , sometimes    subject   , ...

   instrument     an instrument (method) used in an event

   usually prepositional phrase, but can also be a    subject   

   john broke the window.
   john broke the window with a rock.
   the rock broke the window.
   the window broke.
   the window was broken by john.

ergative verbs

   ergative verbs

   subject when intransitive = direct object when transitive.
   "it broke the window" (transitive) 
   "the window broke" (intransitive).

   most verbs in english are not ergative (the subject role does not change 

whether transitive or not)
   "he ate the soup" (transitive) 
   "he ate" (intransitive)

   ergative verbs generally describe some sort of    changes    of states:

   verbs suggesting a change of state     break, burst, form, heal, melt, 

tear, transform

   verbs of cooking     bake, boil, cook, fry
   verbs of movement     move, shake, sweep, turn, walk
   verbs involving vehicles     drive, fly, reverse, run, sail

   predicate can be a verb, noun, adjective, adverb
   the same word with multiple senses can belong to 

multiple frames

framenet (2004)

   project at uc berkeley led by chuck fillmore for 

developing a database of frames, general semantic 
concepts with an associated set of roles.

   roles are specific to frames, which are    invoked    by the 
predicate, which can be a verb, noun, adjective, adverb
   judgement frame

   invoked by: v: blame, praise, admire; n: fault, admiration
   roles: judge, evaluee, and reason

   specific frames chosen, and then sentences that employed 
these frames selected from the british national corpus and 
annotated by linguists for semantic roles.

   initial version: 67 frames, 49,013 sentences, 99,232 role 

fillers

propbank

(proposition bank)

propbank := proposition bank (2005)

   project at colorado led by martha palmer to add semantic 

roles to the id32.

   proposition := verb + a set of roles
   annotated over 1m words of wall street journal text with 

existing gold-standard parse trees.

   statistics:

   43,594 sentences       99,265 propositions 
   3,324 unique verbs    262,281 role assignments

propbank argument numbering
   numbered roles, rather than named roles.

   arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3,    

   different numbering scheme for each verb sense.
   the general pattern of numbering is as follows.

   arg0 =    proto-agent    (agent)
   arg1 =    proto-patient    (direct object / theme / patient)
   arg2 = indirect object (benefactive / instrument / attribute / 

end state)

   arg3 = start point (benefactive / instrument / attribute)
   arg4 = end point

different    frameset    for each verb sense

   mary left the room.
   mary left her daughter-in-law her pearls in her will.

frameset leave.01 "move away from":
arg0: entity leaving
arg1: place left

frameset leave.02 "give":
arg0: giver 
arg1: thing given
arg2: beneficiary

id14

id14 (task)

   shallow meaning representation beyond syntactic parse trees
   id53

      who    questions usually use agents
      what    question usually  use patients
      how    and    with what    questions usually use instruments
      where    questions frequently use sources and destinations.
      for whom    questions usually use beneficiaries
      to whom    questions usually use destinations

   machine translation generation

   semantic roles are usually expressed using particular, distinct 

syntactic constructions in different languages.

srl as parse node classification

   treat problem as classifying parse-tree nodes.
   can use any machine-learning classification method.
   critical issue is engineering the right set of features for the classifier 

to use.
