background

let   s look at an application of bayes    theorem to the analysis of
cognitive processes. first we need to introduce some data.

research on human decision making investigates, e.g., how
physicians make a medical diagnosis (casscells et al. 1978):

example

if a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a
false-positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found
to have a positive result actually has the disease, assuming you
know nothing about the person   s symptoms or signs?

most frequent answer: 95%

reasoning: if false-positive rate is 5%, then test will be correct
95% of the time.

correct answer: 2%

reasoning: assume you test 1000 people; the test will be positive
in 50 cases (5%), but only one person actually has the disease.
hence the chance that a person with a positive result has the
disease is 1/50 = 2%.

only 12% of subjects give the correct answer.

mathematics underlying the correct answer: bayes    theorem.

bayes    theorem

we need to think about bayes    theorem slightly di   erently to apply
it to this problem (and the terms have special names now):

bayes    theorem (for hypothesis testing)

given a hypothesis h and data d which bears on the hypothesis:

p(h|d) =

p(d|h)p(h)

p(d)

p(h): independent id203 of h: prior id203
p(d): independent id203 of d
p(d|h): id155 of d given h: likelihood
p(h|d): id155 of h given d: posterior id203

application to diagnosis

in casscells et al.   s (1978) examples, we have the following:

h: person tested has the disease;
  h: person tested doesn   t have the disease;
d: person tests positive for the disease.

the following probabilities are known:

p(  h) = 1     p(h) = 0.999

p(d|h) = 1 (assume perfect test)

p(h) = 1/1000 = 0.001
p(d|  h) = 5% = 0.05
compute the id203 of the data (rule of total id203):
p(d) = p(d|h)p(h)+p(d|  h)p(  h) = 1  0.001+0.05  0.999 = 0.05095
compute the id203 of correctly detecting the illness:

p(h|d) =

p(h)p(d|h)

p(d)

0.001    1
0.05095

=

= 0.01963

base rate neglect

base rate neglect

base rate: the id203 of the hypothesis being true in the
absence of any data (i.e., prior id203).

base rate neglect: people have a tendency to ignore base rate
information (see casscells et al.   s (1978) experimental results).

base rate neglect has been demonstrated in a number of
experimental situations;

often presented as a fundamental bias in decision making;

however, experiments show that subjects use base rates in
certain situations;

it has been argued that base rate neglect is only occurs in
arti   cial or abstract mathematical situations.

base rates and experience

potential problems with in casscells et al.   s (1978) study:

subjects were simply told the statistical facts;

they had no    rst-hand experience with the facts (through
exposure to many applications of the test);

providing subjects with experience has been shown to reduce
or eliminate base rate neglect.

medin and edelson (1988) tested the role of experience on decision
making in medical diagnosis.

base rates and experience

medin and edelson (1988) trained subjects on a diagnosis task in
which diseases varied in frequency:

subjects were presented with pairs of symptoms and had to
select one of six diseases;

feedback was provided so that they learned symptom/disease
associations;

base rates of the diseases were manipulated;

once subjects had achieved perfect diagnosis accuracy, they
entered the transfer phase;

subjects now made diagnoses for combinations of symptoms
they had not seen before; made use of base rate information.

discrete random variables

de   nition: random variable
if s is a sample space with a id203 measure and x is a
real-valued function de   ned over the elements of s, then x is
called a random variable.

we will denote random variable by capital letters (e.g., x ), and
their values by lower-case letters (e.g., x).

example
given an experiment in which we roll a pair of dice, let the random
variable x be the total number of points rolled with the two dice.

for example x = 7 picks out the set
{(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)}.

this can be illustrated graphically:

for each outcome, this graph lists the value of x , and the dotted
area corresponds to x = 7.

id203 distributions

de   nition: id203 distribution
if x is a discrete random variable, the function given by
f (x) = p(x = x) for each x within the range of x is called the
id203 distribution of x .

theorem: id203 distribution
a function can serve as the id203 distribution of a discrete
random variable x if and only if its values, f (x), satisfy the
conditions:

f (x)     0 for each value within its domain;

x f (x) = 1, where x over all the values within its domain.

in many cases, we   re interested in the id203 for values x     x,
rather than for x = x.

de   nition: cumulative distribution

f (t) for         < x <    

f (x) = p(x     x) =

where f (t) is the value of the id203 distribution of x at t, is
the cumulative distribution of x .

cumulative distributions

theorem: cumulative distributions
the values f (x) of the cumulative distribution of a discrete
random variable x satis   es the conditions:

1 f (      ) = 0 and f (   ) = 1;

if a < b, then f (a)     f (b) for any real numbers a and b.

example

consider the example of f (x) on the previous slide:

1 f (      ) = 0 as f (0) < 0 by de   nition; f (   ) = 1 as

f (   )     3 by de   nition;

2 f (a) < f (b) holds for (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) by de   nition;

f (a) = f (b) holds for all other values of a and b.

summary

there are many applications of bayes    theorem in cognitive
science (here: medical diagnosis);

base rate neglect: experimental subjects ignore information
about prior id203;

a random variable picks out a subset of the sample space;

a id203 distribution returns a id203 for each value
of a random variable.

a cumulative distribution sums all the values of a id203
up to a threshold.
