terminology

terminology for id203 theory:

experiment: process of observation or measurement; e.g., coin
   ip;

outcome: result obtained through an experiments; e.g., coin
shows tail;

sample space: set of all possible outcomes of an experiment;
e.g., sample space for coin    ip: s = {h, t}.

for now, we will only deal with discrete sample spaces (i.e., sample
spaces whose elements can be mapped the set of integers).

terminology

example: finite sample space
roll two dice, each with numbers 1   6. sample space:

s1 = {(x, y )|x = 1, 2, . . . , 6; y = 1, 2, . . . , 6}

alternative sample space for this experiment: sum of the dice:

s2 = {x|x = 2, 3, . . . , 12}

example: in   nite sample space
flip a coin until head appears for the    rst time:

s3 = {h, th, tth, ttth, tttth, . . .}

events

often we are not interested in individual outcomes, but in events.
an event is a subset of a sample space.

example
with respect to s1, describe the event b of rolling a total of 7
with the two dice.

b = {(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)}

events

often we are interested in combinations of two or more events.
this can be represented using set theoretic operations. assume a
sample space s and two events a and b:

complement   a (also a0): all elements of s that are not in a;
subset a     b: all elements of a are also elements of b;
union a     b: all elements of s that are in a or b;
intersection a     b: all elements of s that are in a and b.

these operations can be represented graphically using venn
diagrams.

axioms of id203

events are denoted by capital letters a, b, c , etc. the id203
of and event a is denoted by p(a).

axioms of id203

1 the id203 of an event is a nonnegative real number:

p(a)     0 for any a     s.

2 p(s) = 1.

3

if a1, a2, a3, . . . , is a sequence of mutually exclusive events of
s, then:

p(a1     a2     a3     . . . ) = p(a1) + p(a2) + p(a3) + . . .

id203 of an event

theorem: id203 of an event
if a is an event in a discrete sample space s and o1, o2, o3, . . . ,
are the individual outcomes comprising a, then p(a) = p(o1) +
p(o2) + p(o3) + . . .

example
we    ip a fair coin twice. what   s the id203 of obtaining at least one
head?
the sample space is s = {hh, ht , th, tt}. as the coin is fair, all
outcomes are equally likely: p(hh) = p(ht ) = p(th) = p(tt ) = 1
4 .
the event of obtaining at least one head is a = {hh, ht , th} and
p(a) = p(hh) + p(ht ) + p(th) = 1

id203 of an event

this leads us to the following special case of the previous theorem:

theorem: equally likely outcomes
if an experiment can result in n equally likely outcomes, and if n
of these outcomes constitute an event a, then p(a) = n
n .

this theorem is consistent with the frequency interpretation of
id203 theory: the id203 of an event is the proportion of
the time that events of the same kind will occur in the long run.

this will become important later in this course.

example
assume all letters occur equally often in english. then what   s the
id203 of a three-letter word only consisting of vowels?
there are n = 263 three letter words. the set of vowels is
{a, e, i, o, u}. then the event a of having a three letter word
consisting only of vowels is a = {aaa, aae, aai, aao, . . .}. the size
of this set is n = 53. by the theorem of equally likely outcomes,
p(a) = n

n = 53

263 = 0.00711.

examples and explanations

1 what   s the id203 of a three letter word not consisting of

three vowels? p(  a) = 1     p(a) = 1     0.00711 = 0.99289,
where a is the set of all three letter words containing only
vowels (see example above).

2 this follows from set theory: s         = s, hence

p(s) + p(   ) = p(s), hence p(   ) = 0.

3 let a = {ht , th}, the event of getting exactly one head
when    ipping a coin twice, and b = {hh, ht , th}, the
event of getting at least one head. then p(a) = 1
2 and
p(b) = 3
4 again, this follows from set theory:         a     s for any

event a. hence p(   )     a     p(s), and therefore 0     a     1.

axiom 3 allows us to add the probabilities of mutually exclusive
events. this is called the special addition rule. but what about
events that are not mutually exclusive?

theorem: general addition rule
if a and b are two events in a sample space s, then:
p(a     b) = p(a) + p(b)     p(a     b)

example
language is lateralized in the brain: in most people, language processing
mainly takes place in the left hemisphere. in some people, however,
language is right-lateralized, i.e., it is mainly processed in the right
hemisphere.

assume the id203 of being left-handed is p(a) = 0.15, and the
id203 of language being right-lateralized is p(b) = 0.05.

if a and b are mutually exclusive then the id203 of being either
left-handed or right-lateralized is p(a     b) = p(a) + p(b) = 0.2.
however, the two events are not mutually exclusive: there are
left-handers that are right-lateralized (in fact, this is more likely in
left-handers than in right-handers). we know that p(a     b) = 0.04.
now the id203 of being left-handed or right-lateralized is
p(a     b) = p(a) + p(b)     p(a     b) = 0.16.
