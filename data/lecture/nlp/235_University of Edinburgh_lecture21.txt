continuous random variables

we only dealt with discrete (integer-valued) random variables. in
many situations, continuous (real-valued) random variables occur.

examples
the outcomes of real-life experiments are often continuous:

an experimental subject reacts to a picture by pressing a
button (e.g., to indicate if the picture is familiar): the reaction
time (in ms) is a continuous random variable.

an eeg machine measures the electrical brain activity when a
subjects reads a word: the current (in   v) is a continuous
random variable.

de   nition of id203 distribution, cumulative distribution, joint
distribution, etc., can be extended to the continuous case.

id203 density functions

extend de   nitions from discrete to continuous random variables:

use intervals a     x     b instead of discrete values x = x;
use integration over intervals instead of summation over
discrete values.

de   nition: id203 density function

a function with values f (x), de   ned over the set of all real
numbers, is called a id203 density function (pdf) of the
continuous random variable x if and only if:

z b

p(a     x     b) =

f (x)dx

for any real constants a and b with a     b.

theorem: intervals of pdfs
if x is a continuous random variable and a and b are real
constants with a     b, then:
p(a     x     b) = p(a     x < b) = p(a < x     b) = p(a < x < b)

theorem: valid pdfs
a function can serve as the pdf of a continuous random variable x
if its values, f (x), satisfy the conditions:

2 r    

1

f (x)     0 for each value within its domain;
       f (x)dx = 1.

cumulative distributions

in analogy with the discrete case, we can de   ne:

de   nition: cumulative distribution
if x is a continuous random variable and the value of its
id203 density function at t is f (t), then the function given by:

f (x) = p(x     x) =

f (t)dt for         < x <    

z x

      

is the cumulative distribution of x .

intuitively, the cumulative distribution captures the area under the
curve de   ned by f (t) from        to x.

theorem: value of cumulative distribution
if f (x) and f (x) are the values of the pdf and the distribution
function of x at x, then:

p(a     x     b) = f (b)     f (a)
for any real constants a and b with a     b and:

f (x) =

where the derivative exists.

use the theorem on the previous slide to compute the id203
p(0     x     1) for f (t):

other densities

in analogy with the discrete case, we can de   ne for continuous
random variables:

joint id203 density;

marginal id203 density;

essentially, we replace thep signs with integrals in the de   nitions

for the discrete case. we will not deal with this in detail.

summary

id203 density functions are the id203 distributions
for continuous random variables;

cumulative distributions can also be de   ned for continuous
random variables.
