what is id203 theory?

id203 theory deals with combinatorics:

given a set of items, how many di   erent orders are there?

examples
how many possible three letter words are there in english?

a sentence can have a subject, a verb, and an object. in english,
these occur in the order svo. how many other orders are
theoretically possible in other languages?

what is id203 theory?

id203 theory deals with prediction:

given an event has occurred, how likely is it that another
event will occur?

examples
given that the    rst letter of a word is k, how likely is it that the
next letter will be s?

given that you   ve just heard the word amok, how likely is it that
the previous word was run?

what is id203 theory?

id203 theory deals with id136:

given some prior knowledge about an event and some new
evidence regarding the event, what can we infer?

example

if a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a
false-positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found
to have a positive result actually has the disease, assuming you
know nothing about the person   s symptoms or signs?

example: id203 and language

probabilities in language processing:

more probable words are recognized faster, produced more
quickly;

for ambiguous words, the more probable meaning is retrieved
more quickly;

for ambiguous sentences, the more probable reading is
preferred over the less probable one;

when speakers know the beginning of a sentence, they can
predict the next word.

probabilities in id146:

learners segment words into sounds by using probable sound
combinations;

learners acquire the meaning of a word by    guring out which
other words it is likely to occur with;

learners acquire the structure of sentences based on probable
combination word categories.

language
reasoning

example: id203 and reasoning

probabilities in human reasoning and decision making:

reasoning can be formalized using logic (e.g., a     b means
a implies b);

however, it turns out that this is not a very good model
human reasoning, which often involves uncertain information;

alternative: formalization in probabilistic terms
(e.g., p(a     b) means a implies b with a certain id203);
the id203 of a rule can change with experience (i.e.,
depending on how often it has been applied);

in general, human decision making can be viewed as a form of
probabilistic id136 (bayesian id136).

reasoning
memory

example: id203 and memory

probabilities in human memory:

the id203 of correctly recalling an item depends on
amount of practice;

the id203 of forgetting an item depends on amount of
time elapsed;

items that occur more frequently are recalled more accurately
and more quickly;

items that stay in short term memory longer are more likely to
be transfered to long term memory.

what is combinatorics?

before we move to id203 theory, we need to introduce basic
combinatorics.

combinatorics is the science of counting. for a given set of
elements, determine what arrangements of the elements are
possible, and how many there are.

useful for id203 theory: the id203 of a set often depends
on how many di   erent possibilities (combinations) of elements
there are in the set.

multiplications of choices

theorem: multiplication of choices
if an operation consists of k steps, of which the    rst step can be
done in n1 ways, the second step can be done in n2 ways, etc.,
then the whole operation can be done in n1    n2 . . . nk ways.

here, an operation can be any procedure, process, or method of
selection.

example
how many possible three letter words are there in english? there
are 26 choices for the    rst letter, 26 choices for the second letter,
and 26 choices for the third letter. the overall number of
combinations is therefore 26    26    26 = 263 = 17, 576.

multiplications of choices

example
assume you want to travel to either london, paris, lisbon, or
dublin, by either boat or plane. then there are n1    n2 = 4    2 = 8
ways in which this can be done.

this can be visualized using a tree diagram:

permutations

example
a sentence can have a subject, a verb, and an object. in english,
these occur in the order svo. how many other orders are
theoretically possible in other languages?

we assume that each of s, v, and o occur only once. for the    rst
position in the sentence, we have three choices, for the second
position, two choices, and for the third position, one choice. the
total number of combinations is therefore 3    2    1 = 6.

permutations

this argument can be generalized. assume a set of n objects. then
the number of possible orders is n(n     1)(n     2) . . . 3    2    1 = n!.

theorem: permutations of distinct objects
the number of permutations of n distinct objects is n!.

example
assume a text consists of 10 sentences. a copy editor wants to
re-order the text to improve its readability. he can choose from
10! = 3, 628, 800 di   erent orders.

permutations

theorem: permutations of distinct objects with grouping
the number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time
is (for r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n):

npr =

n!

(n     r )!

example
in a game of cards, assume you have    ve cards, of which you select
two. the number of ways this can be done is:

5p2 =

5!

(5     2)!

=

5!
3!

= 5    4 = 20

permutations

so far we have assumed that the n objects from which we select r
objects are all distinct. what happens, however, if we are dealing
with identical objects?

example
how many di   erent permutations are there of the letters in the
word book?

naively, there are 4! = 24 di   erent permutations of b, o1, o2, and
k. however, bo1ko2 and bo2ko1 are in fact the same word boko.
hence the total number of permutations of the letters is 24

2 = 12.

when we generalize this reasoning, we arrive at the following
theorem:

theorem: permutations of identical objects
the number of permutations of n objects of which n1 are of one
kind, n2 are of a second kind, . . . , nk are of a kth kind, and
n1 + n2 +        + nk = n is:

n!

n1!    n2! . . . nk !

combinations

often, we want to determine the number of ways in which r objects
can be selected from among n distinct objects without regard to
order. such selections (arrangements) or called combinations.

example
to run an experiment, we select 10 subjects from an undergraduate class
of 25. if we care about the order in which the subjects are selected, then
the number of possible selections is:

25p10 =

= 1.186    1013

25!
15!

if we don   t care about the order, then we have to divide this by 10!, i.e.,
number of di   erent orders for 10 subjects:

25p10
10!

= 3, 268, 760

binomial coe   cients

again, we can generalize this: we have npr permutations when we
select r out of n objects, and r ! ways of ordering the r objects.

theorem: combinations of distinct objects
the number of combinations of n distinct objects taken r at a time

is (for r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n):(cid:18)n
(cid:19)

= npr
r !

=

n!

r !(n     r )!

r

note that combinations are the same as subsets: we compute the
total number of subsets of r objects that can be selected from a
set of n distinct objects (sets are always unordered).
