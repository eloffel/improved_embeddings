id155

de   nition: id155
if a and b are two events in a sample space s, and p(a) 6= 0 then
the id155 of b given a is:
p(a     b)

p(b|a) =

p(a)

intuitively, the id155 p(b|a) is the id203
that the event b will occur given that the event a has occurred.

examples
the id203 of having a tra   c accident given that it snows:
p(accident|snow).
the id203 of reading the word amok given that the previous word
was run: p(amok|run).

example
a manufacturer knows that the id203 of an order being ready
on time is 0.80, and the id203 of an order being ready on
time and being delivered on time is 0.72. what is the id203 of
an order being delivered on time, given that it is ready on time?

r: order is ready on time; d: order is delivered on time.
p(r) = 0.80, p(r     d) = 0.72. therefore:

p(d|r) =

p(r     d)

p(r)

=

0.72
0.80

= 0.90

from the de   nition of id155, we obtain:

theorem: multiplication rule
if a and b are two events in a sample space s, and p(a) 6= 0 then:

p(a     b) = p(a)p(b|a)

as a     b = b     a, it follows also that:

p(a     b) = p(b)p(a|b)

example

back to lateralization of language (see last lecture). let
p(a) = 0.15 be the id203 of being left-handed, p(b) = 0.05
be the id203 of language being right-lateralized, and
p(a     b) = 0.04.
the id203 of language being right-lateralized given that a
person is left-handed:

p(b|a) =

p(a     b)

p(a)

=

0.04
0.15

= 0.267

the id203 being left-handed given that language is
right-lateralized:

p(a|b) =

p(a     b)

p(b)

=

0.04
0.05

= 0.80

independence

de   nition: independent events
two events a and b are independent if and only if:

p(b     a) = p(a)p(b)

intuitively, two events are independent if the occurrence of
non-occurrence of either one does not a   ect the id203 of the
occurrence of the other.

theorem: complement of independent events
if a and b are independent, then a and   b are also independent.

this follows straightforwardly from set theory.

example
a coin is    ipped three times. each of the eight outcomes is equally likely.
a: head occurs on each of the    rst two    ips, b: tail occurs on the third
   ip, c : exactly two tails occur in the three    ips. show that a and b are
independent, b and c dependent.

a = {hhh, hht}
p(a) = 1
b = {hht , htt , tht , ttt} p(a) = 1

c = {htt , tht , tth}

p(c ) = 3
p(a     b) = 1

p(b     c ) = 1

8 = p(a     b), hence a and b are independent.
16 6= p(b     c ), hence b and c are dependent.

total id203

theorem: rule of total id203
if events b1, b2, . . . , bk constitute a partition of the sample space
s and p(bi ) 6= 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, then for any event a in s:

kx

p(a) =

p(bi )p(a|bi )

i=1

b1, b2, . . . , bk form a
partition of s if they are
pairwise mutually exclusive
and if b1     b2     . . .    bk = s.

total id203

example
in an experiment on human memory, participants have to
memorize a set of words (b1), numbers (b2), and pictures (b3).
these occur in the experiment with the probabilities p(b1) = 0.5,
p(b2) = 0.4, p(b3) = 0.1.

then participants have to recall the items (where a is the recall
event). the results show that p(a|b1) = 0.4, p(a|b2) = 0.2,
p(a|b3) = 0.1. compute p(a), the id203 of recalling an item.
by the theorem of total id203:
i=1 p(bi )p(a|bi )

p(a) = pk

= p(b1)p(a|b1) + p(b2)p(a|b2) + p(b3)p(a|b3)
= 0.5    0.4 + 0.4    0.2 + 0.1    0.1 = 0.29

bayes    theorem
if b1, b2, . . . , bk are a partition of s and p(bi ) 6= 0 for
i = 1, 2, . . . , k, then for any a in s such that p(a) 6= 0:

p(br|a) =

pk
p(br )p(a|br )
i=1 p(bi )p(a|bi )

p(a) =pk

this can be simpli   ed by renaming br = b and by substituting

i=1 p(bi )p(a|bi ) (theorem of total id203):

bayes    theorem (simpli   ed)

p(b|a) =

p(b)p(a|b)

example
reconsider the memory example. what is the id203 that an
item that is correctly recalled (a) is a picture (b3)?

by bayes    theorem:

p(b3|a) =

pk
p(b3)p(a|b3)
i=1 p(bi )p(a|bi )
= 0.1  0.1
0.29 = 0.0345

the process of computing p(b|a) from p(a|b) is sometimes
called bayesian inversion.
