de(cid:12)nition: id178

if x is a discrete random variable and f (x) is the value of its
id203 distribution at x, then the id178 of x is:

h(x ) = (cid:0) x
x2x

f (x) log2 f (x)

id178 is measured in bits (the log is log2);
intuitively, it measures amount of information (or uncertainty)
in random variable;

it can also be interpreted as the length of message to transmit
an outcome of the random variable;

note that h(x ) (cid:21) 0 by de(cid:12)nition.

example: 8-sided die
suppose you are reporting the result of rolling a fair
eight-sided die. what is the id178?
the id203 distribution is f (x) = 1
1 : : : 8. therefore id178 is:

8 for x =

h(x ) = (cid:0)

= log 8 = 3 bits

this means the average length of a message required to transmit
the outcome of the roll of the die is 3 bits.

example: 8-sided die
suppose you wish to send the result of rolling the die. what is the
most e(cid:14)cient way to encode the message?

the id178 of the random variable is 3 bits. that means the
outcome of the random variable can be encoded as 3 digit binary

id203 letters.

theorem: id178

if x is a binary random variable with the distribution f (0) = p and
f (1) = 1 (cid:0) p, then:

h(x ) = 0 if p = 0 or p = 1
max h(x ) for p = 1
2

intuitively, an id178 of 0 means that the outcome of the random
variable is determinate; it contains no information (or uncertainty).
if both outcomes are equally likely (p = 1
uncertainty.

2 ), then we have maximal

de(cid:12)nition: joint id178

if x and y are discrete random variables and f (x ; y ) is the value
of their joint id203 distribution at (x ; y ), then the joint
id178 of x and y is:

h(x ; y ) = (cid:0) x

f (x ; y ) log f (x ; y )

the joint id178 represents the amount of information needed on
average to specify the value of two discrete random variables.

de(cid:12)nition: conditional id178

if x and y are discrete random variables and f (x ; y ) and f (y jx)
are the values of their joint and id155
distributions, then:

h(y jx ) = (cid:0) x
x2x

f (x ; y ) log f (y jx)

is the conditional id178 of y given x .

the conditional id178 indicates how much extra information you
still need to supply on average to communicate y given that the
other party knows x .

example: simpli(cid:12)ed polynesian
now assume that you have the joint id203 of a vowel and a
consonant occurring together in the same syllable:

for id203 distributions we de(cid:12)ned:

g (x)

a similar theorem holds for id178:

theorem: conditional id178
if x and y are discrete random variables with joint id178
h(x ; y ) and the marginal id178 of x is h(x ), then:

h(y jx ) = h(x ; y ) (cid:0) h(x )

division instead of subtraction as id178 is de(cid:12)ned on logarithms.

summary

example: simpli(cid:12)ed polynesian
use the previous theorem to compute the joint id178 of a
consonant and a vowel. first compute h(c ):

h(c ) = (cid:0) x
x2c

f (x) log f (x)

= (cid:0)(f (p) log f (p) + f (t) log f (t) + f (k) log f (k))

id178 measures the amount of information in a random
variable or the length of the message required to transmit the
outcome;

joint id178 is the amount of information in two (or more)
random variables;

conditional id178 is the amount of information in one
random variable given we already know the other.

then we can compute the joint id178 as:

h(v ; c ) = h(v jc ) + h(c ) = 1:375 + 1:061 = 2:436 bits
