expectation

the notion of mathematical expectation derives from games of
chance. it   s the product of the amount a player can win and the
id203 of wining.

example
in a ra   e, there are 10,000 tickets. the id203 of winning is
therefore
10,000 for each ticket. the prize is worth $4,800. hence
the expectation per ticket is $4,800

1

10,000 = $0.48.

in this example, the expectation can be thought of as the average
win per ticket.

expectation

this intuition can be formalized as the expected value of a random
variable:

de   nition: expected value

if x is a discrete random variable and f (x) is the value of its
id203 distribution at x, then the expected value of x is:

x

e (x ) =

x    f (x)

x

we will only deal with the discrete case here (but the de   nition
can be extended to cover continuous random variables).

expectation

the notion of expectation can be generalized to cases in which a
function g (x ) is applied to a random variable x .

theorem: expected value of a function

if x is a discrete random variable and f (x) is the value of its
id203 distribution at x, then the expected value of g (x ) is:

x

e [g (x )] =

g (x)f (x)

the expectation of a random variable is also called the mean of
the random variable. it   s denoted by   .

de   nition: mean
if x is a discrete random variable and f (x) is the value of its
id203 distribution at x, then the mean of x is:

   = e (x ) =

de   nition: variance
if x is a discrete random variable and f (x) is the value of its
id203 distribution at x, and    is its mean then:

  2 = var(x ) = e [(x       )2] =

(x       )2f (x)

x

is the variance of x .

x

intuitively, var(x ) re   ects the spread or dispersion of a
distribution, i.e., how much it diverges from the mean.

   is called the standard deviation of x .

if    and    are the mean and the standard deviation of a random
variable x , and    6= 0, then for any positive constant k:

p(|x       | < k  )     1     1

in other words, the id203 that x will take on a value within k
standard deviations of the mean is at least 1     1
k 2 .

example
assume k = 2. then p(|x       | < 2  ) = 1     1
75% of the values of x fall within 2 standard deviations of the
mean.

chebyshev   s theorem

example
using chebyshev   s theorem, we can show: if x is normally
distributed, then:

p(|x       | < 2  ) = .9544

in other words, the 95.44% of all values of x fall within 2 standard
deviations of the mean. this is a tighter than the bound of 75%
that holds for an arbitrary distribution.

many cognitive variables (e.g., iq measurements) are normally
distributed. more on this in the next lecture.

summary

the expected value of a random variable is its average value
over a distribution;

the mean is the same as the expected value;

the variance of random variable indicates its dispersion, or
spread around the mean;

chebyshev   s theorem places a bound on the id203 that
the values of a distribution will be within a certain interval
around the mean;

for example, at least 75% of all values of a distribution fall
within two standard deviations of the mean.
