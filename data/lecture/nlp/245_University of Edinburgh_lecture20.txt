joint distributions

previously, we introduced p(a     b), the id203 of the
intersection of the two events a and b.

let these events be described by the random variables x at value x
and y at value y . then we can write:

p(a     b) = p(x = x     y = y ) = p(x = x, y = y )

this is referred to as the joint id203 of x = x and y = y .

note: often the term joint id203 and the notation p(a, b) is
also used for the id203 of the intersection of two events.

joint distributions

the notion of the joint id203 can be generalized to
distributions:

de   nition: joint id203 distribution
if x and y are discrete random variables, the function given by
f (x, y ) = p(x = x, y = y ) for each pair of values (x, y ) within the
range of x is called the joint id203 distribution of x and y .

de   nition: joint cumulative distribution
if x and y are a discrete random variables, the function given by:

f (x, y ) = p(x     x, y     y ) =

f (s, t) for         < x, y <    

x

x

s   x

t   y

where f (s, t) is the value of the joint id203 distribution of x and y
at (s, t), is the joint cumulative distribution of x and y .

example: corpus data

we can now de   ne the following random variables:

x : the length of the word;

y : number of vowels in the word.

examples for id203 distributions:

fx (5) = p(earth) + p(probe) + p(comet) = 0.14;
fy (2) = p(earth) + p(probe) + p(some) + p(comet) = 0.17.

examples for cumulative distributions:

fx (3) = fx (2) + fx (3) = 0.34 + 0.33 = 0.67;
fy (1) = fx (0) + fx (1) = 0.03 + 0.80 = 0.83.

now compute the joint distribution of x and y as

marginal distributions

if we    project    one of the two dimensions of a joint distributions,
we obtain a marginal distributions:

de   nition: marginal distribution

if x and y are discrete random variables and f (x, y ) is the value of
their joint id203 distribution at (x, y ), the functions given by:

x

previously, we de   ned the id155 of two events a
and b as follows:

p(b|a) =

p(a     b)

p(a)

let these events be described by the random variable x = x and
y = y . then we can write:

p(x = x|y = y ) =

p(x = x, y = y )

p(y = y )

=

f (x, y )
h(y )

where f (x, y ) is the joint id203 distribution of x and y and
h(y ) is the marginal marginal distribution of y .

de   nition: conditional distribution
if f (x, y ) is the value of the joint id203 distribution of the
discrete random variables x and y at (x, y ) and h(y ) is the value
of the marginal distributions of y at y , and g (x) is the value of
the marginal distributions of x at x, then:

f (x|y ) =

the notion of independence of events can also be generalized to
id203 distributions:

de   nition: independence

if f (x, y ) is the value of the joint id203 distribution of the
discrete random variables x and y at (x, y ), and g (x) and h(y )
are the values of the marginal distributions of x at x and y at y ,
respectively, then x and y are independent i   :

f (x, y ) = g (x)h(y )

for all (x, y ) within their range.

summary

a joint id203 distribution returns a id203 for each
pair of values of two random variables.

marginal distributions project one of the dimensions of a joint
id203 distribution;

the conditional distribution is the joint distribution divided by
the marginal distribution;

two distributions are independent if the joint distribution is
the same as the product of the two marginal distributions.
