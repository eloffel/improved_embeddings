binominal distribution

often we are interested in experiments with repeated trials:

assume there is a    xed number of trials;

each of the trial can have two outcomes (e.g., success and
failure, head and tail);

the id203 of success and failure is the same for each trial:
   and 1       ;
the trials are all independent.

then the id203 of getting x successes in n trials in a given

order is   x (1       )n   x . and there are(cid:0)n

a random variable x has a binominal distribution i    its id203
distribution is given by:

if we invert successes and failures (or heads and tails), then the
id203 stays the same. therefore:

theorem: binomial distribution

b(x; n,   ) = b(n     x; n, 1       )

two other important properties of the binomial distribution are:

theorem: binomial distribution
the mean and the variance of the binomial distribution are:

   = n  

and   2 = n  (1       )

normally distributed random variables are ubiquitous in
id203 theory;
many measurements of physical, biological, or cognitive
processes yield normally distributed data;
such data can be modeled using a normal distributions
(sometimes using mixtures of several normal distributions);
also called the gaussian distribution.

normal distribution

de   nition: standard normal distribution
the normal distribution with    = 0 and    = 1 is referred to as the
standard normal distribution:

theorem: standard normal distribution
if a random variable x has a normal distribution, then:

p(|x       | <   ) = 0.6826
p(|x       | < 2  ) = 0.9544

this follows from chebyshev   s theorem (see previous lecture).

theorem: z -scores
if a random variable x has a normal distribution with the mean   
and the standard deviation    then:

z =

x       

  

has the standard normal distribution.

this conversion is often used to make results obtained by di   erent
experiments comparable: convert the distributions to z -scores.

summary

the uniform distribution assigns each value the same
id203;

the binomial distributions models an experiment with a    xed
number of independent binary trials, each with the same
id203;

the normal distribution models the data generated by
measurements of physical, biological, or cognitive processes;

z -scores can be used to convert a normal distribution into the
standard normal distribution.
