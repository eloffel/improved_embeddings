fqa as a classification task
a predefined set of answers, say 10 answers
given a question, pick the best one out of 10.

qanta assignment
get id33 of the question
build id56 over dependency tree
train this id56 over training data
use this id56 as a feature extractor
train a id28 classifier over the features from the id56 as our predictor

dependency-tree
id56s
unlike constituent parses, words reside at nodes other than leaves
need to combine word vector of node with    hidden    vectors of children
