      in our viral texts project, for example, we have built models of 
reprinting for noisily-ocr   d nineteenth-century newspapers to trace the 
   ow of news, literature, jokes, and anecdotes throughout the united 
states.

distribution

    words that appear in similar contexts have similar 

representations (and similar meanings, by the 
distributional hypothesis).

parts of speech

    parts of speech are categories of words de   ned 

distributionally by the morphological and syntactic 
contexts a word appears in.

morphological distribution

pos often de   ned by distributional properties; verbs 
= the class of words that each combine with the 
same set of af   xes

walk
slice
believe

of
red

-s

walks
slices
believes

*ofs
*reds

-ed

walked
sliced
believed
*ofed
*redded

-ing

walking
slicing
believing
*o   ng
*reding

bender 2013

morphological distribution

we can look to the function of the af   x (denoting past 
tense)  to include irregular in   ections.

walk
sleep
eat
give

-s

walks
sleeps
eats
gives

-ed

walked
slept
ate
gave

-ing

walking
sleeping
eating
giving

syntactic distribution

    substitution test: if a word is replaced by another 

word, does the sentence remain grammatical?

kim saw the

elephant

before we did

dog
idea
*of
*goes

bender 2013

syntactic distribution

    these can often be too strict; some contexts admit 

substitutability for some pairs but not others.

kim saw the

elephant
*sandy

before we did

both nouns but 
common vs. proper

kim *arrived the

elephant

before we did

both verbs but 

transitive vs. intransitive
