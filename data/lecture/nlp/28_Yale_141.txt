examples
all languages have verbs and nouns
all spoken languages have consonants and vowels
[greenberg 1]    in declarative sentences with nominal subject and object, the dominant order is almost always one in which the subject precedes the object.   
[greenberg 29]    if a language has inflection, it always has derivation.
