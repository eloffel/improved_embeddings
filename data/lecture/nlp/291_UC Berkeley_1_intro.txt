nlp is interdisciplinary

    arti   cial intelligence  

    machine learning (ca. 2000   today); statistical 

models, neural networks 

    linguistics (representation of language) 

    social sciences/humanities (models of language at 

use in culture/society)

nlp = processing language

what makes language hard?

    language is a complex social process 

    tremendous ambiguity at every level of 

representation 

    modeling it is ai-complete (requires    rst solving 

general ai)

what makes language hard?
    speech acts (   can you pass the salt?)    

[austin 1962, searle 1969] 

    conversational implicature (   the opera singer was 

amazing; she sang all of the notes   ).    
[grice 1975] 

    shared knowledge (   clinton is running for election   ) 
    variation/indexicality (   this homework is wicked 

hard   )

i made her duck    

                        [slp2 ch. 1] 

    i cooked waterfowl for her 
    i cooked waterfowl belonging to her 
    i created the (plaster?) duck she owns 
    i caused her to quickly lower her head or body 
       

processing as representation

    nlp generally involves representing language for 

some end, e.g.: 

    dialogue 
    translation 
    id103 
    text analysis

when i look at an article in russian, i say: 'this is really written in english, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. i will now proceed to decode.'

rational speech act view

   one morning i shot an elephant in

communication involves recursive 

reasoning: how can x choose words to 

maximize understanding by y?

meaning is co-constructed by the

info 159/259

    this is a class about models. 

    you   ll learn and implement algorithms to solve nlp 
tasks ef   ciently and understand the fundamentals 
to innovate new methods. 

    this is a class about the linguistic representation of 

text. 

    you   ll annotate texts for a variety of representations 

so you   ll understand the phenomena you   ll be 
modeling
