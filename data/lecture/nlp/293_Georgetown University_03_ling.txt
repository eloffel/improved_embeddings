what is language?

    wikipedia:    language is the ability to acquire 
and use complex systems of  communication, 
particularly the human ability to do so, and a 
language is any specific example of  such a 
system. the scientific study of  language is 
called linguistics.

what is language?

    dictionary.com:    1. a body of  words and the 

systems for their use common to a people who 
are of  the same community or nation, the same 
geographical area, or the same cultural tradition   

   2. communication by voice in the distinctively 
human manner, using arbitrary sounds in 
conventional ways with conventional meanings; 
speech.

what is language?

    collins:    1. a system for the expression of  

thoughts, feelings, etc, by the use of  spoken 
sounds or conventional symbols   

   2. the faculty for the use of  such systems, 
which is a distinguishing characteristic of  man 
as compared with other animals

what is language?

    merriam-webster:    a:  the words, their 

pronunciation, and the methods of  combining

   b (1):  audible, articulate, meaningful sound as

understood meanings

knowledge of/about language

    every linguist gets questions like: 

       how many languages do you speak?    

       which is correct in this sentence:    who    or    whom   ?    

    these reflect misunderstandings of  what linguistics is.

7

knowledge of/about language

    studying a language does not necessarily require 

fluency in it 
    though it requires data, ideally from a native speaker 

    speaking a language doesn   t entail understanding 

how it works! 
    linguistics = studying what speakers know, but don   t 
know they know. uncovering the implicit knowledge 
behind a skill. 

    you learned your native language primarily through 

exposure, not being taught the rules of  grammar!

8

knowledge of/about language

    speech is primary, writing is a technology 

    most languages of  the world are never or rarely written down 
    written language can be more conservative, stylistically fixed 

    mosts linguists are descriptivists 

    they study what language is according to the practice of  a 
speech community, not what it should be according to some 
socially accepted authority or stereotype (prescriptivist).  
    in linguistics, grammar rules describe the patterns of  how 

people talk.

statistically significant.

example, russian has two indefinite series characterized by the markers -to
(kto-to "someone,"  cto-to "something,"  gde-to "somewhere," etc.)  and  -nibud'
(kto-nibud'"anyone,"  cto-nibud'"anything," gde-nibud'"anywhere," etc.). like
english  any-indefinites,  the russian -nibud' -indefinites do not occur in posi-
tive declarative sentences such as (8a), but  they do occur in questions and
conditionals  (e.g., 8b).

companion),  be  it  marked  by  an  adposition  and/or  case  or  be  it  unmarked.  as  is  common  in 
typology, this is a functional domain rather than a formal concept. the local phrase markers are 
given in boldface in the examples and in the glosses. 
however,  -nibud'-indefinites  also  occur  in  "assertive"  contexts  when  non-
specific  reference is intended, that is, the speaker has no particular referent
in mind. for instance, whereas the  english sentence  he wants to marry  some-
...g  nn  na-  u

some language myths

    kids today are ruining the previously pure form 

of  our language. 
    commentary of  this nature goes back over the 

centuries. in fact, language is constantly evolving. it 
is an organic system, which means it complex and 
   messy    but adapts to the needs of  speakers.

12

some language myths

    when <low-prestige group members> talk they 

are being lazy/using bad grammar. 
    relative to standard american english, dialects like 
african-american english have some differences in 
vocabulary and grammar (including pronunciation 
and syntax). 

    scientifically, is nothing better or worse about any 
dialect; there is just social prestige and acceptance.

13

some language myths

   

it   s easy to define the boundaries of  a language. 
    roughly speaking, if  two dialects are mutually 
intelligible, they are said to be from the same 
language. in practice, there can be a lot of  gray area
   e.g., arabic has many dialects, some of  which are 
quite different from each other. 

    geopolitical considerations often interfere as well: 

colloquially we call chinese a language, but mandarin 
and cantonese are not mutually intelligible. 
conversely, by linguistic criteria, hindi and urdu are 
considered dialects of  the same language.

14

some language myths

    sign language is less systematic than spoken 

language. 
    there are actually many sign languages:    

american sign language and british sign 
language are quite different, for example. this is 
because all languages develop subject to a 
community of  speakers. 

    sign languages also have grammar, with patterns 
and structure in how hands are shaped, how they 
are positioned and moved, facial expressions, etc.

15

some language myths

    people are hereditarily predisposed to have an 

easier time learning some languages. 
    fact: children are capable of  natively acquiring any 
language given sufficient exposure at the right age. 
inability to do so is attributed to a mental or 
communicative deficit or disability.

16

some language myths

    most languages have millions of  speakers. 

    fact: there are approximately 6000   7000 

languages spoken today. about a third have small 
native speaker populations and are in danger of  
extinction.   

http://www.ethnologue.com/world

17

   
according to 
www.ethnologue.com/
statistics/size, only 
5.6% of languages 
have    1m native 
speakers   but these 
account for 94% of the 
world   s population.

lighting presentations

    as a practical measure, most of  the lectures will 

focus on english. but other languages raise 
other challenges for nlp/language technologies. 

    from now on, we   ll start class with a 5-minute 
presentation from one of  you that describes a 
different language. this will showcase the 
diversity of  the world   s languages.

36

language spotlight    
lighting presentations

    ground rules: 

    1 presentation per enrolled student. sign up for a 

slot after class today. indicate your choice of  
language at least a week in advance. 

    you must choose a language that (a) is not english 

and (b) has not been presented yet. 

    the style of  presentation is up to you: you may use 

slides, handouts, multimedia, etc. 

    5 minutes. practice with a timer. we will cut 

you off  if  you go over.

37

language spotlight    
lighting presentations

    your presentation should cover: 

1. typological overview: how many speakers, where spoken, 

what language family/related languages; synthetic vs. 
analytic, svo/vso/etc., what kinds of  inflectional 
morphology on nouns and verbs, what kinds of  agreement 

    http://ethnologue.org/, http://wals.info/  

2. a couple of  interesting phenomena in the language 
(probably: different from english). give examples (with ipa 
or romanized id68 if  a non-roman script).    
e.g., german compounds. 

3. what about this language would be especially difficult for 

nlp/language technologies?
