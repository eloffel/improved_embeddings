proposal due

progress due

presentations
final report due

proposal:  2-4 page document outlining 
the problem, your approach, possible 
dataset(s) and/or software systems to use.  
must cite and brie   y describe at least two 
pieces of relevant prior work (research 
papers).  describe scope of proposed work.

progress report: longer document with 
preliminary results

presentations: in-class and short

final report

    groups of 1-3:  we encourage size 2
    we expect more work with more team members

nlp research
    all the best publications in nlp are open access!

(eacl, lrec...)

    conference proceedings:  acl, emnlp,  naacl
    journals:  tacl, cl
    nlp and nlp-related work appears in other journals/conferences 
too (data mining, machine learning, ai, information retrieval, etc.)

    reading tips

   
   

    google scholar
find papers
see paper   s number of citations (imperfect but useful correlate of 
paper quality) and what later papers cite it
    authors    webpages  (   nd researchers who are good at writing 
    misc. nlp research reading tips:

and whose work you like)

    end to end systems

    id53
    conversational dialogue systems 

(hard to eval?)

    predict external things from text

    movie revenues based on movie 
reviews ... or online buzz?  http://
www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/movie$-data/
    visualization and exploration  (harder 
to evaluate)
    temporal analysis of events, show 
    topic models: cluster and explore 
    figure out a task with a cool dataset

on timeline

documents

    e.g. urban dictionary

science id53
    a    full-stack    sort of task ... 8th-grade science 
textbook input, question-answering output

sources of data
    all projects must use (or make, and use) a textual dataset.  many 

possibilities.
   

for some projects, creating the dataset may be a large portion of the work; 
for others, just download and more work on the system/modeling side

    semeval and conll shared tasks:

dozens of datasets/tasks with labeled nlp annotations
   
   
   
   

sentiment, ner, coreference, textual similarity, syntactic parsing, discourse 
parsing, and many other things...
e.g. semeval 2015 ... conll shared task 2015 ...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semeval (many per year)
http://ifarm.nl/signll/conll/ (one per year)

    general text data  (not necessarily task speci   c)

books (e.g. project gutenberg)
reviews  (e.g. yelp academic dataset https://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset)

   
   
    web
