fig. 5. visualization of the phrase-based model of translation. the model involves three steps. (1) the
english sentence is segmented into    phrases      arbitrary contiguous sequences of words. (2) each phrase
is translated. (3) the translated phrases are reordered. as in figure 3, each arrow corresponds to a single
decision.

    phrases can memorize local reorderings
    state-of-the-art (currently or very recently) in 

long-distance reordering for verb movement in german to english translation, using
language-speci   c heuristics.

industry, e.g. google translate

as we can see, a dominant theme of translation modeling is the constant tension

between expressive modeling of reordering phenomena, and model complexity.
