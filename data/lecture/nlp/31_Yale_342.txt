text similarity
text kernels
unigram kernels
same as a bag of words
for example, we can split the sentence    google bought kaggle    into the three unigrams:
   google   
   bought   
   kaggle   
similarly, we can split    kaggle bought google    into:
   kaggle   
   bought   
   google   
however, the vector representations of the two sentences will be identical (<1,1,1>) and therefore their cosine similarity will be computed as 1.

bigram kernels
using a bigram kernel, we can split the sentence    google bought kaggle    into the two bigrams:
   google bought   
   bought kaggle   
similarly, we can split    kaggle bought google    into:
   kaggle bought   
   bought google   
using this representation, the vectors corresponding to the two sentences are <1,1,0,0> and <0,0,1,1>, respectively, and their cosine similarity is 0.

letter and substring kernels
letter id165s can be used for various applications such as id147, language recognition, and id39.
for example, the word stop can be represented as the set of all of its substrings: s, t, o, p, st, to, op, sto, top, and stop.
in this representation, sim(stop,stops) > sim(stop,plot), even though all three words are different.

subsequences
unlike a substring, a subsequence doesn   t need to consist of contiguous words (or letters).
comp, cotr, opter, cpute     all of these are letter-based subsequences of computer
subsequence kernels (of words, not letters) are most useful for measuring similarity between sentences.

quiz
on the next slide, you will see a set of published headlines relating the same scientific study published in 2009. the study suggests that wolfgang amadeus mozart may have died of complications caused by strep throat.
take the time to read all these headlines. what interesting (class-related) observations can you make based on your reading?
what kernels would be most appropriate for id91 all these headlines together? in other words, these kernels should assign high pairwise similarity scores for the headlines in the group.
did mozart die of strep throat?
what killed mozart? study suggests strep infection
what killed mozart? strep, study suggests
what killed mozart? study suggest it might have been a strep infection
wstc/wnlk local news what killed mozart? a new theory emerges

infection killed mozart - report
mozart's killer revealed: it was not salieri
infection killed mozart, says study
did poison or strep infection kill mozart?
mozart may have died from strep throat, says study
cause of mozart's death revealed
mozart died from strep
what really killed mozart? possibly strep
mozart may have been killed by strep throat

answer to quiz
observations
all sentences have mozart
the syntax varies a lot (e.g., passive/active voice)
they all have some word related to dying (e.g.,    kill/die/disease   )
suggestions
id165 kernel will probably not work very well here
some semantic information should be encoded in the kernel
possibly, use id97
