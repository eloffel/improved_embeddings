how

traditional physics, engineering

    lots of math!
    this course: more than traditional cs, but less than 
    lots of data!
    lots of code that implements math & algorithms
    skill: translating from math to code
    skill: debugging math/linguistic/algorithm code
    a little bit of linguistics (goes a long way)

at the same time, the research team grew to about

25 full-time researchers and engineers, including several
student members from key university partnerships. the team
performed and documented more than 8,000 independent
experiments by the time watson went live. each experiment

25 engineers, 4 years, 200 subsystems,

for rapidly creating and advancing a wide diversity of
algorithm techniques to meet target performance.

the breadth of the jeopardy! domain is exempli   ed by the

ken jennings and brad rutter and, on any given day, may
defeat either one of them. watson played 55 real-time
previously unseen games against these players and won 71%
of them. to do this, watson computed its con   dences
and its best answer in approximately three seconds, on
average, and included a very competitive betting strategy.

the third set of metrics is distributed across the individual
component algorithms that populate the deepqa processing
pipeline. each paper in this special issue presents
individual component technologies and describes how they
affect end-to-end performance. however, it is important

of components for which simple ablations from the full
system do not provide statistically meaningful insights given
the size of the test sets we use. we see some individual
components that provide an impact on accuracy in the range
of 2% to 5% when added to the wasb system.

jeopardy! proved to be an excellent challenge problem.

the goal to beat human champions drove the creation
and advancement of the deepqa architecture and the
adaptwatson methodology. both proved indispensable for
conducting large-scale open-domain qa research and, more
generally, language understanding research. in addition to
