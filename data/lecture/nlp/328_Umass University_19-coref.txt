    (   harry_potter_concept   )
referring expressions a.k.a. mentions
    14 nps are underlined above (are they all referential?)
coreference: when referring mentions have the same referent.
coreference resolution:    nd which mentions refer to the same entity.  
i.e. cluster the mentions into entity clusters.

applications: text id136, search, etc.

mention pair model

hary potter was a wizard.  lord voldemort attempted to murder him.

mention pairs

    view gold standard as de   ning links between 
    think of as binary classi   cation problem: take 
    issues: many mention pairs.  also: have to resolve 

random pairs as negative examples

expressions

hary potter was a wizard.  lord voldemort attempted to murder him.
    view as antecedent selection problem: which previous mention 
do i corefer with?
    makes most sense for pronouns, though can use model for all 
    process mentions left to right. for the n   th mention, it   s a n-way 
multi-class classi   cation problem: antecedent is one of the n-1 
mentions to the left, or null.
    features are asymmetric!
    use a limited window for antecedent candidates, e.g. last 5 
    score each candidate by a linear function of features.

sentences (for news...)

predict antecedent to be the highest-ranking candidate.

    training: simple way is to process the gold 
standard coref chains (entity clusters) into positive 
and negative links.  train binary classi   er.
    prediction: select the highest-scoring candidate as 
the antecedent.  (though multiple may be ok.)
    using for applications: take these links and form 

entity clusters from connected components

features for pronoun resolution

    english pronouns have some grammatical markings that restrict 
the semantic categories they can match.  use as features against 
antecedent candidate properties.
    number agreement
    animacy/human-ness? agreement
    gender agreement

it vs. he/she/him/her/his

he/she/it vs. they/them

   

he/him/his vs. she/her vs. it

    grammatical person - interacts with dialogue/discourse structure
    re   exives

    i/me vs you/y   all vs he/she/it/they
    bob knew that john bought himself a book.
    john knew that bob bought him a book.
