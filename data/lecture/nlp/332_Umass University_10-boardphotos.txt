alternate explanation of viterbi and calc_factor_scores.
left: think of viterbi as an algorithm that takes in as input a graph where there are 
weights on each node and edge.  the graph has a lattice structure.  it returns the 
highest-scoring path  through that lattice.  (where path score = sum of all node and 
edge weights on path.)
right: calc_factor_scores builds this graph, represented as (ascores,bscores).  the 
b_t scores are node weights and a scores are edge weights (same pattern of edge 
weights at each timestep).

scores from local crf features

o   ce hours:
starting problem 3, averaged perc. weightsums trick.
some intuition:
bar{theta} overcounts the gradients near the start.
they get summed in for all the later thetas.
so theta undercounts early gradients relative to bar{theta}.
thus we make s, which highly weights gradients near the end.
subtracting s out of theta reduces weights of gradients near 
the end.
