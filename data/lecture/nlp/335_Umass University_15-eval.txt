classi   cation metrics

might seem a natural metric, we generally don   t use it, because when the classes
are unbalanced (as indeed they are with spam, which is the majority of email) we
can get a high accuracy by doing nothing and just always returning    positive   . but
that   s not very helpful if our eventual goal is    nd useful email. similarly, if we   re a
company doing id31 with the goal of    nding and addressing consumer
complaints about our products, and even assuming we are a fantastic company with
99% positive comments, we don   t want to ignore the 1% of cases where customers
have complaints. thus we need a metric that rewards us for    nding correct examples
of both classes even in unbalanced situations.

precision

instead, we most commonly report a combination of two metrics, precision and

recall, each of which measures a different aspect of a useful solution.

precision measures the percentage of the items that the system detected (i.e., the
system labeled as positive) that are in fact positive (i.e., are positive according to the
human gold labels). precision is de   ned as

precision =

true positives

true positives + false positives

    you can also just look at the

mt evaluation

mt evaluation 

       manual (the best!?):  

       sser (subjective sentence error rate) 
       correct/incorrect 
       adequacy and fluency (5 or 7 point scales) 
       error categorization 
       comparative ranking of translations 

       testing in an application that uses mt as one sub-

component 
       e.g., id53 from foreign language documents 

       may not test many aspects of the translation (e.g., cross-lingual ir) 

       automatic metric:  

       wer (word error rate)     why problematic?

       id165 precision (score is between 0 & 1) 
       what percentage of machine id165s can 
be found in the reference translation?  
       an id165 is an sequence of n words 
reference translation twice at a certain n-
gram level (two mt words airport are only 
correct if two reference words airport; can   t 
cheat by typing out    the the the the the   ) 
       do count unigrams also in a bigram for 

       not allowed to match same portion of 

unigram precision, etc.

       can   t just type out single word 

   the    (precision 1.0!) 

it was thought quite hard to    game    the system 
(i.e., to find a way to change machine output so 
that id7 goes up, but quality doesn   t)

       id7 is a weighted geometric mean, with a 

brevity penalty factor added. 
       note that it   s precision-oriented
