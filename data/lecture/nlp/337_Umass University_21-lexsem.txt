    word-based features in supervised ml:
fundamentally, too much data sparsity
    idea: we want a database of word meanings to 

help analyze texts.  how to represent word 
meanings?
    today:  word senses and taxonomies
    next week:  context vectors (distributional 

semantics)

word senses (concepts)

    a single word (word form) can have different 
senses or word meanings.
    coarse ambiguity: pos or proper-vs-common noun
    finer-grained ambiguity:
    i went to my bank today.
    i saw the bank of a river.

computing with word senses

    if we could disambiguate word senses
    could link to a knowledge base of entities or 
    could do better synonym/hypernym analysis 

concepts (e.g.    clinton   ) 

(e.g.       nd documents talking about female 
politicians   )

    questions
    1. where do the word senses come from?
    2. what is this good for?
    3. how to disambiguate?

(today:  pre-speci   ed knowledge base)

word sense relations

    binary relations between word senses explain how to 

generalize or relate their meanings.

word sense relations

    binary relations between word senses explain how to

    synonymy: mean the same thing

    i drank cocoa <==> i drank hot chocolate

set equivalence; bidirectional entailment under substitution

    these relations hold between senses  (not words)

    i saw the river bank =/=> i saw the river    nancial institution

in general, the    ve algorithms we describe in this section do not attempt to distinguish
between similarity and semantic relatedness; for convenience we will call them simi-
larity measures, although some would be more appropriately described as relatedness
measures; we return to this question in sec. 20.8.

id138

figure 20.6
from nickel to coin (1), dime (2), money (5), and richter scale (7).

a fragment of the id138 hypernym hierarchy, showing path lengths

the oldest and simplest thesaurus-based algorithms are based on the intuition that
the shorter the path between two words or senses in the graph de   ned by the thesaurus
hierarchy, the more similar they are. thus a word/sense is very similar to its parents or
its siblings, and less similar to words that are far away in the network. this notion can
be operationalized by measuring the number of edges between the two concept nodes

    hand-curated database of word senses for 
english
    nouns, adjective, adverbs
(has verbs but problematic)
    each concept (   synset   ) has
    a set of words it corresponds to.
    hypernym relations to other concepts
    synonymy among words sharing a synset.

each is: (lemma,pos) pair
