output
this saved fiber refinement includes all dlc changes in run-id alldlc. run-id fiberall demanded that plan activate fiber for csas 1201, 1301, 1401 and 1501 in 1995 q2. it requested the placement of a 48-fiber cable from the co to section 1103 and the placement of 24-fiber cables from section 1201 to section 1301 and from section 1401 to section 1501 in the second quarter of 1995. for this refinement, the resulting 20 year route pwe was $856.00k, a $64.11k savings over the base plan and the resulting 5 year ifc was $670.20k, a $60.55k savings over the base plan.
