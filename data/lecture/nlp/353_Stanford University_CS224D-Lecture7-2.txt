what	is	aws	and	ec2

    aws	(amazon	web	service)	:	cloud	service	platform	provide	by	
amazon,	which	includes:

1.	compute:	e.g.	ec2	(elastic	compute	cloud)
2.	storage:	e.g.	s3	&	ebs
3.	database
4.	networking
   

using	ec2
    just	like	ssh into a	myth/corn	machine
    more	flexible:	can	install	new	packages
    more	powerful:	e.g.	use gpu	to make	training	neural	networks	faster

ec2	and	tensorflow setup

    we	provide	an	ami	(amazon	machine	image)	that	already	has	
tensorflow installed.	
    all	you	need	to	do	is	to	launch	your	instance	using	that	ami.	
    a	step-by-step	tutorial	can	be	found	on	the	class	website

data	storage	when	using	ec2

    the	way	data	is	stored	is	different	than	myth/corn
    when	you	terminate	an	instance,	all	the	data	on	that	instance	would	
be	lost!
    however,	for	ebs-backed	instance,	data	is	preserved when you
choose to stop it instead of terminate it. ebs-backed instance is our
default set up.
    you can also store your data somewhere else, e.g. s3
