    machine translation evaluation

1947

when i look at an article in 

russian, i say to myself: 
this is really written in 
english, but it has been 
coded in some strange 
symbols.  i will now 
proceed to decode.

1950s-1960s

    1954 georgetown-ibm experiment

    250 words, 6 grammar rules

    1966 alpac report

    skeptical in research progress
    led to decreased us government funding for mt

rule based systems

    approach

    build dictionaries
    write transformation rules
    refine, refine, refine

    meteo system for weather 

forecasts (1976)

    1990s: increased research

    mid 2000s: phrase-based mt

    (moses, google translate)

    around 2010: commercial viability

    since mid 2010s: neural network models

learning from data

    what is the best translation?

    counts in parallel corpus (aka bitext)

    here european parliament corpus

learning from data

    what is most fuent?

    a id38 problem!

word alignment

phrase-based models

    input segmented in phrases
    each phrase is translated in 

output language

    phrases are reordered

neural mt

what is mt good (enough) for?

    assimilation: reader initiates translation, wants to know content

    user is tolerant of inferior quality
    focus of majority of research

    communication: participants in conversation don   t speak same language

    users can ask questions when something is unclear
    chat room translations, hand-held devices
    often combined with id103

    dissemination: publisher wants to make content available in other 

languages

    high quality required
    almost exclusively done by human translators

applications

state of the art

    historical background

    machine translation is an old idea

    machine translation today

    use cases and method

    machine translation evaluation

how good is a translation?
problem: no single right answer

evaluation

    how good is a given machine translation system?

    many different translations acceptable

    id74

    subjective judgments by human evaluators
    automatic id74
    task-based evaluation

adequacy and fluency

    human judgment

    given: machine translation output
    given: input and/or reference translation
    task: assess quality of mt output

    metrics

    adequacy: does the output convey the meaning of the input sentence? is 

part of the message lost, added, or distorted?

    fluency: is the output fluent? involves both grammatical correctness and 

idiomatic word choices.

fluency and adequacy: scales

let   s try:
rate fluency & adequacy on 1-5 scale

challenges in mt evaluation

    no single correct answer

    human evaluators disagree

automatic id74

    goal: computer program that computes quality of translations

    advantages: low cost, optimizable, consistent

    basic strategy

    given: mt output
    given: human reference translation
    task: compute similarity between them

precision and recall of words

precision and recall of words

word error rate

wer example

id7 
bilingual evaluation understudy

multiple reference translations

id7 examples

semantics-aware metrics: e.g., 
meteor

drawbacks of automatic metrics

    all words are treated as equally relevant

    operate on local level

    scores are meaningless (absolute value not informative)

    human translators score low on id7

yet automatic metrics such as id7 
correlate with human judgement

caveats: bias toward statistical systems

automatic metrics

    essential tool for system development

    use with caution: not suited to rank systems of different types

    still an open area of research

    connects with semantic analysis
