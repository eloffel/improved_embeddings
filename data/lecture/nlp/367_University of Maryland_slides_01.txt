what	is	language?

wikipedia:

   language	is	the	ability	to	acquire	and	use	complex	systems	of	
communication,	particularly	the	human	ability	to	do	so,	and	a	language	
is	any	specific	example	of	such	a	system.	the	scientific	study	of	
language	is	called	linguistics.   	

    computational	linguistics	(cl)

    the	science	of	doing	what	linguists	do	with	language,	but	using	computers

    natural	language	processing	(nlp)

    the	engineering	discipline	of	doing	what	people	do	with	language,	but	using	

computers

    speech/language/text	processing
    human	language	technology

nlp	state	of	the	art

still	a	challenging	problem!

many	useful	applications	already	exist

ai   s	language	problem
   machines	that	truly	understand	
language	would	be	incredibly	useful.	
but	we	don   t	know	how	to	build	
them.

what	does	an	nlp	system	need	to	   know   ?

    language	consists	of	many	levels	of	structure

    humans	fluently	integrate	all	of	these	in	producing	and	understanding	
language

    ideally,	so	would	a	computer!

why	is	nlp	hard?

ambiguity

at	the	word	level

    part	of	speech

    [v	duck]!
    [n	duck]	is	delicious	for	dinner.

    word	sense

    i	went	to	the	bank	to	deposit	my	check.
    i	went	to	the	bank	to	look	out	at	the	river

ambiguity

at	the	syntactic	level

    pp	attachment	ambiguity

    i	saw	the	man	on	the	hill	with	the	telescope

    structural	ambiguity

    i	cooked	her	duck
    visiting	relatives	can	be	annoying
    time	flies	like	an	arrow

ambiguity

    quantifier	scope

    everyone	on	the	island	speaks	two	languages.

    hard	cases	require	world	knowledge,	understanding	of	speaker	goals

ambiguity

    nlp	challenge:	how	can	we	model	ambiguity,	and	choose	the	correct	
analysis	in	context?

    approach:	learn	from	data

word	counts

    most	frequent	words	in	the	english	europarl corpus
    (out	of	24m	word	tokens)

word	counts

    but	also,	out	of	the	93,638	distinct	words	(word	types),	36,231	occur	
only	once

zipf   s law

zipf   s law:	implications

    even	in	a	very	large	corpus,	there	will	be	a	lot	of	infrequent	words

    the	same	holds	for	many	other	levels	of	linguistic	structure

    core	nlp	challenge:	we	need	to	estimate	probabilities	or	to	be	able	to	
make	predictions	for	things	we	have	rarely	or	never	seen

variation	and	expressivity

    the	same	meaning	can	be	expressed	with	different	forms

    i	saw	the	man
    the	man	was	seen	by	me

    she	needed	to	make	a	quick	decision	in	that	situation
    the	scenario	required	her	to	make	a	split-second	judgment

100	spoken	by	95%	of	population

social	impact

    nlp	experiments	and	applications	can	have	a	direct	effect	on	
individual	users   	lives

    some	issues

    privacy
    exclusion
    overgeneralization
