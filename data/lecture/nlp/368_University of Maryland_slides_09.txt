how	can	we	define	pos?

    by	meaning?

    verbs	are	actions
    adjectives	are	properties
    nouns	are	things

    by	the	syntactic	environment

    what	occurs	nearby?
    what	does	it	act	as?

    by	what	morphological	processes	affect	it

    what	affixes	does	it	take?

    typically	combination	of	syntactic+morphology

parts	of	speech

    open	class

    impossible	to	completely	enumerate
    new	words	continuously	being	invented,	borrowed,	etc.

    closed	class

    closed,	fixed	membership
    reasonably	easy	to	enumerate
    generally,	short	function	words	that	   structure   	sentences

open	class	pos

    four	major	open	classes	in	english

    nouns
    verbs
    adjectives
    adverbs

    all	languages	have	nouns	and	verbs...	but	may	not	have	the	other	two

nouns

    open	class

    semantics:

    new	inventions	all	the	time:	muggle,	webinar,	...

    generally,	words	for	people,	places,	things
    but	not	always	(bandwidth,	energy,	...)

    syntactic	environment:

    occurring	with	determiners
    pluralizable,	possessivizable

    other	characteristics:
    mass	vs.	count	nouns

verbs

    open	class

    new	inventions	all	the	time:	google,	tweet,	...

    semantics

    generally,	denote	actions,	processes,	etc.

    syntactic	environment

    e.g.,	intransitive,	transitive

    other	characteristics

    main	vs.	auxiliary	verbs
    gerunds	(verbs	behaving	like	nouns)
    participles	(verbs	behaving	like	adjectives)

adjectives	and	adverbs

    adjectives

    generally	modify	nouns,	e.g.,	tall girl

    adverbs

    a	semantic	and	formal	hodge-podge   
    sometimes	modify	verbs,	e.g.,	sang	beautifully
    sometimes	modify	adjectives,	e.g.,	extremely hot

closed	class	pos

    prepositions

    in	english,	occurring	before	noun	phrases
    specifying	some	type	of	relation	(spatial,	temporal,	   )
    examples:	on the	shelf,	before noon

    particles

    resembles	a	preposition,	but	used	with	a	verb	(   phrasal	verbs   )
    examples:	find	out,	turn	over,	go	on

particle	vs.	prepositions

he	came	by the	office	in	a	hurry
he	came	by his	fortune	honestly

we	ran	up the	phone	bill
we	ran	up the	small	hill

(by	=	preposition)
(by	=	particle)

(up	=	particle)
(up	=	preposition)

he	lived	down the	block
he	never	lived	down the	nicknames

(down	=	preposition)
(down	=	particle)

more	closed	class	pos

    determiners

    establish	reference	for	a	noun
    examples:	a,	an,	the (articles),	that,	this,	many,	such,	   

    pronouns

    refer	to	person	or	entities:	he,	she,	it
    possessive	pronouns:	his,	her,	its
    wh-pronouns:	what,	who

closed	class	pos:	conjunctions

    coordinating	conjunctions

    join	two	elements	of	   equal	status   
    examples:	cats	and dogs,	salad	or soup

    subordinating	conjunctions

    join	two	elements	of	   unequal	status   
    examples:	we   ll	leave	after you	finish	eating.	while i	was	waiting	in	line,	i	saw	

    complementizers are	a	special	case:	i	think	that you	should	finish	your	

my	friend.

pos	tagging

pos	tagging:	what   s	the	task?

    process	of	assigning	part-of-speech	tags	to	words

    but	what	tags	are	we	going	to	assign?

    coarse	grained:	noun,	verb,	adjective,	adverb,	   
    fine	grained:	{proper,	common}	noun
    even	finer-grained:	{proper,	common}	noun	   animate

    important	issues	to	remember

    choice	of	tags	encodes	certain	distinctions/non-distinctions
    tagsets will	differ	across	languages!

    for	english,	penn	treebank	is	the	most	common	tagset

penn	treebank	tagset:	45	tags

penn	treebank	tagset:	choices

    example:

    the/dt	grand/jj	jury/nn	commmented/vbd	on/in	a/dt	number/nn	of/in	

other/jj	topics/nns	./.

    distinctions	and	non-distinctions

    prepositions	and	subordinating	conjunctions	are	tagged	   in   	(   although/in	

i/prp..   )

    except	the	preposition/complementizer    to   	is	tagged	   to   

why	do	pos	tagging?

    one	of	the	most	basic	nlp	tasks

    nicely	illustrates	principles	of	statistical	nlp	

    useful	for	higher-level	analysis

    needed	for	syntactic	analysis
    needed	for	semantic	analysis

    sample	applications	that	require	pos	tagging

    machine	translation
    information	extraction
    lots	more   

try	your	hand	at	tagging   

    the	back door
    on	my	back
    win	the	voters	back
    promised	to	back the	bill

try	your	hand	at	tagging   

    i	hope	that she	wins
    that day	was	nice
    you	can	go	that far

why	is	pos	tagging	hard?

    ambiguity!

    ambiguity	in	english

    11.5%	of	word	types	ambiguous	in	brown	corpus
    40%	of	word	tokens	ambiguous	in	brown	corpus
    annotator	disagreement	in	penn	treebank:	3.5%

pos	tagging:	how	to	do	it?

    given	penn	treebank,	how	would	you	build	a	system	that	can	pos	tag	
new	text?

    baseline:	pick	most	frequent	tag	for	each	word	type

    90%	accuracy	if	train+test sets	are	drawn	from	penn	treebank

    can	we	do	better?

    but	there	are	challenges

    how	to	compute	argmax efficiently?
    what	are	appropriate	features?

    approach:	leverage	structure	of

feature	functions	for	sequence	labeling

    example	features?

    number	of	times	   monsters   	is	tagged	as	

noun

   verb   

   verb   

    number	of	times	   noun   	is	followed	by	

    number	of	times	   tasty   	is	tagged	as	

    number	of	times	two	verbs	are	adjacent
       

feature	functions	for	sequence	labeling

    standard	features	of	pos	tagging

    unary	features: #	times	word	w	has	been	
labeled	with	tag	l	for	all	words	w	and	all	
tags	l

    markov	features: #	times	tag	l	is	adjacent	

to	tag	l   	in	output	for	all	tags	l	and	l   

    size	of	feature	representation	is	constant	wrt

input	length

the	feature	function	
decomposes	over	the	input

adding	weights	along	the	path	
corresponds	to	score	for	input/ouput

algorithm	can	find	the	argmax
