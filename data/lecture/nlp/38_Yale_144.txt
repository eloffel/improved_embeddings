word distributions
word distributions
words are not distributed evenly!
same goes for letters of the alphabet (etaoin shrdlu), city sizes, wealth, etc.
usually, the 80/20 rule applies
80% of the wealth goes to 20% of the people or it takes 80% of the effort to build the easier 20% of the system
more examples coming up

stop words
fact:
250-300 most common words in english account for 50% or more of a given text.
example: 
   the    and    of    represent 10% of tokens.    and   ,    to   ,    a   , and    in    - another 10%. next 12 words - another 10%. 
moby dick ch.1: 
859 unique words (types), 2256 word occurrences (tokens). top 65 types cover 1132 tokens (> 50%).
token/type ratio: 
2256/859 = 2.63
power-law distribution
power-law
many words with a small frequency of occurrence
a few words with a very large frequency
high skew (asymmetry)
comparing to a normal distribution:
many people of a medium height
almost nobody of a very high or very low height
symmetry
slide from qiaozhu mei
scaling the axes
linear scale
log-log scale

long-tail on a linear scale - straight line on a log-log plot
power law distribution
the id203 of observing an item of size    x    is given by






straight line on a log-log plot

power laws are seemingly everywhere
note: these are cumulative distributions
source:mej newman,    power laws, pareto distributions and zipf   s law   , contemporary physics 46, 323   351 (2005)
zipf's law is fairly general!
 frequency of accesses to web pages 
 in particular the access counts on the wikipedia page,
with s approximately equal to 0.3 
 page access counts on polish wikipedia (data for late july 2003) 
approximately obey zipf's law with a slope s about 0.5 
 words in the english language 
 for instance, in shakespeare   s play haid113t with s approximately 0.5 
 sizes of settlements
 income distributions amongst individuals 
 size of earthquakes

another way to plot: zipf   s distribution
words by rank
word frequency
p(k) ~ k-a
zipf   s law in natural language
rank x frequency     constant
    constant     0.1    length of collection (in words) 
    not accurate at the tails, but accurate enough for our purposes
heaps    law
size of vocabulary: v(n) = knb
in english, k is between 10 and 100,    is between 0.4 and 0.6.
