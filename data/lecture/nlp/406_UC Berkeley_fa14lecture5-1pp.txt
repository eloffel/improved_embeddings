manner  of  articulation

    in  addition  to  varying  by  place,  sounds  vary  by  

manner

    stop:  complete  closure  of  articulators,  no  air  

escapes  via  mouth
    oral  stop:  palate  is  raised  (p,  t,  k,  b,  d,  g)
    nasal  stop:  oral  closure,  but  palate  is  lowered  (m,  

n,  ng)

    fricatives:  substantial  closure,  turbulent:  (f,  v,  s,  z)

    approximants:  slight  closure,  sonorant:  (l,  r,  w)

    vowels:  no  closure,  sonorant:  (i,  e,  a)

   she  just  had  a  baby   

    what  can  we  learn  from  a  wavefile?

    no  gaps  between  words  (!)
    vowels  are  voiced,  long,  loud
    length  in  time  =  length  in  space  in  waveform  picture
    voicing:  regular  peaks  in  amplitude
    when  stops  closed:  no  peaks,  silence
    peaks  =  voicing:  .46  to  .58  (vowel  [iy],  from  second  .65  to  .74  (vowel  [ax])  

    silence  of  stop  closure  (1.06  to  1.08  for  first  [b],  or  1.26  to  1.28  for  second  

and  so  on

[b])

    fricatives  like  [sh]:  intense  irregular  pattern;  see  .33  to  .46

    spectrum  represents  these  freq  components

out  each  frequency  component  of  wave.  

    x   axis  shows  frequency,  y   axis  shows  magnitude  (in  decibels,  

a  log  measure  of  amplitude)

    peaks  at  930  hz,  1860  hz,  and  3020  hz.

source  /  channel

why  these  peaks?  

    articulation  process:

    the  vocal  cord  vibrations  

create  harmonics

    the  mouth  is  an  amplifier
    depending  on  shape  of  

mouth,  some  harmonics  are  
amplified  more  than  others

resonances  of  the  vocal  tract

    the  human  vocal  tract  as  an  open  tube:

closed  end

open  end

length  17.5  cm.

    air  in  a  tube  of  a  given  length  will  tend  

to  vibrate  at  resonance  frequency  of  
tube.  

    constraint:  pressure  differential  should  
be  maximal  at  (closed)  glottal  end  and  
minimal  at  (open)  lip  end.

figure from w. barry

from  sundberg

computing  the  3  formants  of  schwa

    let  the  length  of  the  tube  be  l

    f1 =  c/   1 =  c/(4l)  =  35,000/4*17.5  =  500hz
    f2 =  c/   2 =  c/(4/3l)  =  3c/4l  =  3*35,000/4*17.5  =  1500hz
    f3 =  c/   3 =  c/(4/5l)  =  5c/4l  =  5*35,000/4*17.5  =  2500hz

    so  we  expect  a  neutral  vowel  to  have  3  resonances  at  500,  

1500,  and  2500  hz

    these  vowel  resonances  are  called  formants

how  to  read  spectrograms

    [bab]:  closure  of  lips  lowers  all  formants:  so  rapid    increase  in  

all  formants  at  beginning  of  "bab   

    [dad]:  first  formant  increases,  but  f2  and  f3  slight  fall
    [gag]:  f2  and  f3  come  together:  this  is  a  characteristic    of  

velars.  formant  transitions  take  longer  in  velars  than  in  
alveolars or  labials

from ladefoged    a course in id102   

   she  came  back  and  started  again   

1.    lots  of  high   freq  energy
3.    closure  for  k
4.    burst  of  aspiration  for  k
5.    ey vowel;  faint  1100  hz  formant  is  nasalization
6.    bilabial  nasal
7.    short  b  closure,  voicing  barely  visible.  
8.    ae;  note  upward  transitions  after  bilabial  stop  at  beginning
9.    note  f2  and  f3  coming  together  for  "k"

    reminder  of  basic  facts  about  sound  waves

    f  =  c/   
    c  =  speed  of  sound  (approx  35,000  cm/sec)
    a  sound  with     =10  meters:  f  =  35  hz  (35,000/1000)
    a  sound  with     =2  centimeters:  f  =  17,500  hz  (35,000/2)
