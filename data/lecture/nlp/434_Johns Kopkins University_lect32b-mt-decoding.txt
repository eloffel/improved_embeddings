    foreign input is segmented in phrases
    each phrase is translated into english

explosion of search space

    number of hypotheses is exponential with respect to sentence length
    decoding is np-complete [knight, 1999]
    need to reduce search space

pruning
    hypothesis recombination is not su   cient
    heuristically discard weak hypotheses early
    organize hypothesis in stacks, e.g. by

    same foreign words covered
    same number of foreign words covered
    same number of english words produced

    compare hypotheses in stacks, discard bad ones

    histogram pruning: keep top n hypotheses in each stack (e.g., n=100)
    threshold pruning: keep hypotheses that are at most    times the cost of

best hypothesis in stack (e.g.,    = 0.001)

    for each uncovered contiguous span:

    look up future costs for each maximal contiguous uncovered span

    pruning might drop hypothesis that lead to the best path (search error)
    id67: safe pruning

    future cost estimates have to be accurate or underestimates
    lower bound for id203 is established early by

depth    rst search: compute cost for one complete translation

    if cost-so-far and future cost are worse than lower bound, hypothesis can be

safely discarded

    not commonly done, since not aggressive enough

limits on reordering

33

    reordering may be limited

    monotone translation: no reordering at all
    only phrase movements of at most n words

    reordering limits speed up search (polynomial instead of exponential)
    current reordering models are weak, so limits improve translation quality

    why does id7 fail systran and manual post-edits?
    how can this overcome with novel id74?

    future of automatic methods

    automatic metrics too useful to be abandoned
    evidence still supports that during system development, a better id7

indicates a better system
