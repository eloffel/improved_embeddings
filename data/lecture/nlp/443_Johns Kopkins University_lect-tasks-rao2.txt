dependency  parsing:  constraints

dependency  parsing:  approaches

    commonly  imposed  constraints:

    single   head  (at  most  one  head  per  node)
    connectedness  (no  dangling  nodes)
    acyclicity  (no  cycles  in  the  graph)
    projectivity:

    an  arc  i (cid:31) j is  projective  iff,  for  every  k occurring  

between  i and  j in  the  input  string,  i (cid:31) j.

    a  graph  is  projective  iff  every  arc  in  a is  projective.

    srl  can  be  treated  as  an  sequence  labeling    

problem.

    for  each  verb,  try  to  extract  a  value  for  each  
of  the  possible  semantic  roles  for  that  verb.

srl  with  parse  trees

    parse  trees  help  identify  semantic  roles  through  

exploiting  syntactic  clues  like     the  agent  is  usually  
the  subject  of  the  verb   .

    parse  tree  is  needed  to  identify  the  true  subject.

selectional  restrictions

word  senses

   

selectional  restrictions are  constraints  that  certain  verbs  place  
on  the  filler  of  certain  semantic  roles.
    agents  should  be  animate
    beneficiaries  should  be  animate

   

instruments  should  be  tools

    patients  of     eat     should  be  edible
    sources  and  destinations  of     go     should  be  places.
    sources  and  destinations  of     give     should  be  animate.

    taxanomic  abstraction  hierarchies  or  ontologies  (e.g.  

hypernym  links  in  id138)  can  be  used  to  determine  if  such  
constraints  are  met.

   

   john     is  a     human     which  is  a     mammal     which  is  a     vertebrate
