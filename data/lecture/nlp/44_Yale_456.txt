translate in target language order to ease id38.
one segmentation out of 4096
one reordering out of 40,320
one phrase translation out of 581
search in phrase models
[example from schafer/smith 06]
and many, many more   even before reordering














search in phrase models
many ways of segmenting source
many ways of translating each segment
restrict phrases > e.g. 7 words, long-distance reordering
prune away unpromising partial translations or we   ll run out of space and/or run too long
how to compare partial translations?
some start with easy stuff:    in   ,    das   , ...
some with hard stuff:    agrarpolitik   ,    entscheidungsproblem   ,    
phrase-based translation models
segmentation of the target sentence
translation of each phrase
rearrange the translated phrases

id7 (papineni et al. 2002)
id7
simple id165 precision
log id7 = min (0,1-reflen/candlen) + mean of log precisions
multiple human references
brevity penalty
correlates with human assessments of automatic systems
doesn   t correlate well when comparing human and automatic translations

example from mtc
chinese:
napster                           
english
napster ceo hilbers resigns
napster ceo hilbers resigned
napster chief executive hilbers resigns
napster ceo konrad hilbers resigns

   good    compared to what?
idea #1: a human translation. 
ok, but
good translations can be very dissimilar
we   d need to find hidden features (e.g. alignments)
idea #2: other top n translations (the    n-best list   ). 
better in practice, but
many entries in n-best list are the same apart from hidden links
compare with a id168 l
0/1: wrong or right; equal to reference or not
task-specific metrics (word error rate, id7,    )
