why it does okay    

    we never see    the go of    in our training text.
    so our dice will never generate    the go of.   

    that trigram has id203 0.

why it does okay     but isn   t perfect.

    we never see    the go of    in our training text.
    so our dice will never generate    the go of.   

    that trigram has id203 0.

    but we still got some ungrammatical sentences    
    all their 3-grams are    attested    in the training text, but

still the sentence isn   t good.

you shouldn   t eat these chickens

because these chickens eat

arsenic and bone meal

why it does okay     but isn   t perfect.

    we never see    the go of    in our training text.
    so our dice will never generate    the go of.   

    that trigram has id203 0.

    but we still got some ungrammatical sentences    
    all their 3-grams are    attested    in the training text, but

still the sentence isn   t good.

    could we rule these bad sentences out?

    4-grams, 5-grams,     50-grams?
    would we now generate only grammatical english?

grammatical english sentences

possible under
trained 50-gram
model ?

training sentences

possible under trained 3-gram model

(can be built from observed 3-grams by rolling dice)

possible under trained 4-gram model

what happens as you increase
the amount of training text?

training sentences

(can be built from observed 3-grams by rolling dice)

possible under trained 4-gram model

what happens as you increase
the amount of training text?

training sentences
(all of english!)

now where are the 3-gram, 4-gram, 50-gram boxes?
is the 50-gram box now perfect?
(can any model of language be perfect?)
can you name some non-blue sentences in the 50-gram box?

are id165 models enough?

    can we make a list of (say) 3-grams that

combine into all the grammatical
sentences of english?

    ok, how about only the grammatical

sentences?

    how about all and only?

can we avoid the systematic
problems with id165 models?

    remembering things from arbitrarily far back in the

sentence
    was the subject singular or plural?
    have we had a verb yet?

    formal language equivalent:

    a language that allows strings having the forms

a x* b and c x* d

(x* means    0 or more x   s   )

    can we check grammaticality using a 50-gram model?
    no?  then what can we use instead?

finite-state models

    regular expression:

a x* b | c x* d

    finite-state acceptor:

x

b
x

d

a

c

must remember

whether

first letter
was a or c.

where does the
fsa do that?

context-free grammars

    sentence     noun verb noun
    s     n v n
    n     mary
    v     likes

    how many sentences?
    let   s add: n     john
    let   s add: v     sleeps, s     n v
    let   s add: v     thinks, s     n v s
