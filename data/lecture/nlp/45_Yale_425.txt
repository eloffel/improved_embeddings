summarization evaluation
evaluation criteria
appropriate length
fidelity
salience
grammaticality
non-redundancy
referential well-formedness
structure and coherence
ideal evaluation
r>c
types of evaluation methods
extrinsic techniques (task-based)
can you make the same decision using the summary as with the full text, but in less time
intrinsic techniques
comparing summaries against gold standards

precision and recall
id8 (lin and hovy 2003)
characteristics
based on papineni et al.   s id7 (used for machine translation)
r stands for recall
correlated with manual evaluations when averaged over many examples
very convenient for prototyping
variants
id8-n is a measure of id165 overlap between a summary and a set of reference summaries
id8-l uses longest common subsequence instead of id165 overlap
disadvantage
it can be easily gamed
relative utility (radev et al. 2000)
u(system, ideal)=  % of ideal utility
 covered by system summary
relative utility
ru =
relative utility

ru =
= 0.765
normalized system performance
random performance

example

0.833 - 0.732
0.841 - 0.732
= 0.927
d {14} = 

(s-r)
(j-r)
= 
j = 0.841
r = 0.732
s = 0.833

normalized evaluation of {14}






subsumption and equivalence
subsumption: if the information content of sentence a (denoted as i(a)) is contained within sentence b, then a becomes informationally redundant and the content of b is said to subsume that of a:
			 i(a)     i(b)

equivalence: if i(a)     i(b)     i(b)     i(a)
subsumption
(1) john doe was found guilty of the murder.
(2) the court found john doe guilty of the murder of jane doe last august and sentenced him to life.

subsumption
subsumption (cont   d)
score (s) = si (wcci + wppi + wffi) - wrrs

rs = cross-sentence word overlap

rs = 2 * (# overlapping words) / (# words in sentence 1 + # words in sentence 2)
wr = maxs (score(s))
the pyramid method
nenkova and passonneau 2004
based on semantic content units (scu)
used for id57
different surface realizations with equivalent meanings
