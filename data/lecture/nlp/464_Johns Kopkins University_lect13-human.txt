(cid:1)(cid:1) what happens to a self-paced reader when she 

goes down the garden path? 
(cid:1)(cid:1) eventually she has to backtrack. 
(cid:1)(cid:1) that   s when she pauses:    point of disambiguation.    
(cid:1)(cid:1) the lawyer examined by the judge ...  

(cid:1)(cid:1) why isn   t the second sentence a garden path: 

(cid:1)(cid:1) the shop sold to the bank was quite old.  
(cid:1)(cid:1) the necklace sold to the bank was quite old. 

(cid:1)(cid:1) people are sensitive to frequency! 

big human-parsing debate of the 1990   s: 
how soon does semantics come into play? 

(cid:1)(cid:1) how fast is semantics?  use it constantly, or only as a last resort? 
(cid:1)(cid:1) hypothesis 1: rely mainly on syntactic heuristics 
(cid:1)(cid:1) get a parse this way, then interpret it semantically 
(cid:1)(cid:1) backtrack & fix if we can   t finish the parse or it makes little semantic sense 
(cid:1)(cid:1) sample heuristic: when you build a pp,  

                             attach it to the most recently built thing you can 

(cid:1)(cid:1) sample heuristic: when an np starts a sentence, it   s the subject 
(cid:1)(cid:1) if true, people should backtrack on    the necklace sold to the bank was        
(cid:1)(cid:1) hypothesis 2: rely mainly on syntactic probabilities using head words 

(cid:1)(cid:1) smarter version of hypothesis 1:    necklace    isn   t a common subject for    sell    
(cid:1)(cid:1) explains why no backtracking on    the necklace sold to the bank was        

(cid:1)(cid:1) hypothesis 3: consider full semantics of a constituent as soon as it   s built 

(cid:1)(cid:1) full interpretation as soon as we build a constituent 
(cid:1)(cid:1) so semantic analysis and backtracking are never delayed 
(cid:1)(cid:1) garden paths result from genuinely ambiguous prefix, not slow semantics 

(cid:1)(cid:1) hypothesis 4: consider full semantics of a constituent even before it   s built 

(cid:1)(cid:1) start interpreting a constituent before hearing it all 
(cid:1)(cid:1) semantics before syntax!   (opposite of hypothesis 1)
