    how to evaluate topic models?

       anecdotally   ,    empirically    

   

intrinsic vs. extrinsic

id166 document classification on reuters 21578

human metrics

1. word intrusion
2. topic intrusion

crowdsourced approach using amazon mechanical turk

evaluating three different approaches: lda, plsi, ctm. 

word intrusion

   spot the intruder word   

process:

1. select a topic at random

2. choose the 5 most probable words from the topic

3. choose an improbable word from this topic (which is probable in another topic)

4. shuffle

5. present to subject

word intrusion

if the topic set is coherent, then the users will agree on the outlier.

if the topic set is incoherent, then the users will choose the outlier at random.

topic intrusion

   spot the intruder topic   

process:

1. choose a document

2. choose the three highest-prob. topics for this document

3. choose one low-prob. topic for this document

4. shuffle

5. present to subject

word intrusion: how to measure it

model parameters:

mp    

     =  
    

which is just a fancy way of saying:

    (        ,    

     =         

    )/

topic intrusion: how to measure it

topic log odds (tlo):

tlo    

     = ( 
    

log          ,        ,   

         log          ,        ,    

     )/    

    

    

translation: normalized difference between id203 mass of actual    intruder    and 
selected    intruder   .

upper bound is 0, higher is better. 

topic intrusion

wikipedia corpus, 50 topic lda model

problems

measures homogeneity (synonymy), not topic strength (coherence)

example document: curling

possible topic: broom, ice, canada, rock, sheet, stone

consider syntactic differences: 

organization, physicality, proportions, red
