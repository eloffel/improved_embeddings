conclusion

this lecture

1 we   ll explore the partition semantics for questions, using it to

de   ne some initial pragmatic principles.

2 we   ll develop a decision-theoretic perspective on the partition

semantics and its pragmatics, with the goal of developing a
more general treatment based in id205.

answering

    fully congruent answers identify a single cell.

    partial answers overlap with more than one cell.

    over-answers identify a proper subset of one of the cells.

decision theory

the study of how (rational) agents make decisions (often under
uncertainty (luce and rai   a, 1957; lewis, 1986; hansson, 2005).

for the purposes of this talk, we require only the basic structure of
decision problems. we   ll see that, with a decision problem    xed,
we gain an understanding of

    where question meanings come from; and

    how two discourse participants might disagree on what the

question(s) should be.

decision problems

de   nition (decision problems)

a decision problem is a structure dp = (w , s , ps , a, us ):

    w is a space of possible states of a   airs;

    s is an agent;
    ps is a (subjective) id203 distribution for agent s;
    a is a set of actions that s can take; and
    us is a utility function for s, mapping action   world pairs to

real numbers.

the chance of rain is 60%. s is no fan of rain and hates to get
wet. it   s not good, but not terrible, to carry the umbrella on a dry
day. best of all is sunshine with no umbrella to schlepp.

utility value of new information

incoming information might change the decision problem by
changing the expected utilities.

de   nition (conditional expected utility)

let dp = (w , s , ps , a, us ) be a decision problem.

eudp(a|p) = xw    w

p({w }|p)    u(a, w )

de   nition (conditional expected utility)

let dp = (w , s , ps , a, us ) be a decision problem.

eudp(a|p) = xw    w

example

    eu(no-umbrella) =    1.6
    eu(no-umbrella|{w4 , w5}) = 8.0
    eu(umbrella) = .4

conclusion

changes to the utility value

the utility value of new information is a measure of the extent to
which it changes the utility value of the decision problem.

de   nition

uvdp (p) = max
a   a

uvdp(a|p)     uv(dp)

example
for the umbrella example, the utility value jumps from .4 to 8.0
when we learn that it will be sunny. thus:

uvschlepp({w4 , w5}) = 8.0

a decision-theoretic view of (in)congruence

rather an alternative decision problem, one that the answerer

greater generality via decision theory
the decision-theoretic approach frees us from having to de   ne
everything in terms of questions. decision problems are more
general, and thus they can be used to understand other discourse
moves.
