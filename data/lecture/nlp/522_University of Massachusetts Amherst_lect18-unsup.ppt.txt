attachment ambiguity

    where to attach a phrase in the parse tree?
       i saw the man with the telescope.   
    what does    with a telescope    modify?
    is the problem ai complete?  yes, but   

    proposed simple structural factors

    right association [kimball 1973]

   low    or    near    attachment =    early closure    of np

    minimal attachment [frazier 1978]

(depends on grammar) =    high    or    distant    attachment
=    late closure    (of np)

attachment ambiguity

   
   

   
   

   the children ate the cake with a spoon.   
   the children ate the cake with frosting.   

   joe included the package for susan.   
   joe carried the package for susan.   

    ford, bresnan and kaplan (1982):

   it is quite evident, then, that the closure effects in
these sentences are induced in some way by the
choice of the lexical items.   

lexical acquisition, semantic similarity

    previous models give same estimate to all

unseen events.

    unrealistic - could hope to refine that based

on semantic classes of words

    examples

       susan ate the cake with a durian.   
       susan had never eaten a fresh durian before.   
    although never seen    eating pineapple    should be

more likely than    eating holograms    because
pineapple is similar to apples, and we have seen
   eating apples   .

an application: selectional preferences

    most verbs prefer arguments of a particular

type.  such regularities are called selectional
preferences or selectional restrictions.

       bill drove a         mustang, car, truck, jeep

    selectional preference strength: how strongly

does a verb constrain direct objects

       see    versus    unknotted   

measuring selectional preference strength

    assume we are given a id91 of (direct object) nouns.

resnick (1993) uses id138.

    selectional association between a verb and a class

proportion that its summand contributes to preference strength.

    for nouns in multiple classes, disambiguate as most likely

sense:

selection preference strength

topic models

unsupervised models of
word co-occurrences

a probabilistic approach

    define a probabilistic generative

model for documents.

    learn the parameters of this

model by fitting them to the data
and a prior.

id91 words into topics with

id44

[blei, ng, jordan 2003]

generative
process:

example:

for each document:

sample a distribution
over topics,   
for each word in doc

70% iraq war
30% us election

sample a topic, z

iraq war

sample a word
from the topic, w

   bombing

collocations

    an expression consisting of two or more

words that correspond to some conventional
way of saying things.

    characterized by limited compositionality.
    compositional: meaning of expression can be

predicted by meaning of its parts.

       weapons of mass destruction   
       kick the bucket   ,    hear it through the grapevine   

topics modeling phrases

    topics based only on unigrams often

difficult to interpret

    topic discovery itself is confused because
important meaning / distinctions carried by
phrases.

    significant opportunity to provide improved

language models to asr, mt, ir, etc.

our scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken
from the people and put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff or
duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal-revenue taxes levied
upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors. it must be
conceded that none of the things subjected to internal-revenue taxation
are, strictly speaking, necessaries. there appears to be no just complaint
of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be
nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of
the people.

how do new links form in social networks?

1) randomly (poisson graph)
2) pick someone popular (preferential attachment)
3) pick someone with mutual friends

(adamic & adar, liben-nowell & kleinberg)

4) pick someone from one of your    communities   

(mimno, wallach & mccallum 2007)
can we find communities that help predict links?

text and co-authorships

community

authors

topics

words

1) to generate a document,
we first pick a community.

2) the community then

determines the choice of
authors and topics.

3) from topics, we pick

words.
