    why is natural language interesting and difficult, complex

and ambiguous.
    why?  how to we resolve this ambiguity?

i propose to consider the question
"can machines think?      
we can only see a short distance ahead, but
we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

layers of computational linguistics

1. id102 & phonology
2. morphology
3. syntax
4. semantics
5. pragmatics
6. discourse

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

the study of:

1. id102  &  phonology
language sounds,
how they are
physically formed;

systems of discrete
sounds, e.g. languages   
syllable structure.

dis-k&-'nekt
disconnect

   it is easy to recognize speech.   
   it is easy to wreck a nice beach.   

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

jeetjet?

2. morphology

the study of the sub-word units of meaning.

disconnect
   not   

   to attach   

even more necessary in some other languages,
e.g. turkish:

uygarlastiramadiklarimizdanmissinizcasina

uygar las tir ama dik lar imiz dan mis siniz casina
(behaving) as if you are among those whom we could not civilize

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

the study of the structural relationships between words.

3. syntax

i know that you and frank were planning to disconnect me.

s

v

np
n

vp

sbar

sbar

i

know that

s

np

vp

np conj nnp

you

and

frank

were planning to disconnect me.

not same structure:
you know me--frank and i were planning to disconnect that.

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

4. semantics

the study of the literal meaning.

i know that you and frank were planning to disconnect me.

action = disconnect
actor = you and frank
object = me

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

5. pragmatics

the study of how language is used to accomplish goals.
what should you conclude from the fact i said something?
how should you react?

i   m sorry dave, i   m afraid i can   t do that.

includes notions of polite and indirect styles.

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

6. discourse

the study of linguistic units larger than a single utterance.
the structure of conversations: 

turn taking, thread of meaning.

david bowman:
  open the pod bay doors, hal.
hal:
  i   m sorry, dave, i   m afraid i can   t do that.
david bowman:
  what are you talking about, hal?
   hal:
  i know that you and frank were planning to disconnect me,
and i'm afraid that's something i cannot allow to happen.

linguistic rules

e.g. morphology

to make a word plural, add    s   

     dog     dogs
    baby     babies
    dish     dishes
    goose     geese
    child     children
    fish     fish  (!)

language evolves

    morphology

    we learn new words all the time:

bioterrorism, cyberstalker, infotainment,
thumb candy, energy bar

    part-of-speech

    historically:    kind    and    sort    were always nouns:

   i knowe that sorte of men ryght well.    [1560]

    now also used as degree modifiers:

   i   m sort of hungry.    [present]
   it sort o    stirs one up to hear about old times.    [1833]

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

natural language computing

is hard because

    natural language is:

    highly ambiguous at all levels
    complex and subtle
    fuzzy, probabilistic
    interpretation involves combining evidence
    involves reasoning about the world
    embedded a social system of people interacting

    persuading, insulting and amusing them
    changing over time

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

probabilistic models of language

to handle this ambiguity and to integrate
evidence from multiple levels we turn to:

the tools of id203:
    bayesian classifiers (not rules)
    id48 (not dfas)
    probabilistic id18s

       other tools of machine learning, ai, statistics

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

natural language processing

    natural language processing (nlp) studies
how to get computers to do useful things with
natural languages:
    most commonly natural language understanding
    the complementary task is natural language

engineering

goal

generation

    nlp draws on research in linguistics,

theoretical computer science, artificial
intelligence, mathematics and statistics,
psychology, cognitive science, etc.

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

what & where is nlp

    goals can be very far-reaching

    true text understanding
    reasoning and decision-making from text
    real-time spoken dialog

    or very down-to-earth
    searching the web
    context-sensitive id147
    analyzing reading-level or authorship statistically
    extracting company names and locations from news articles.

    these days, the later predominate (as nlp becomes

increasingly practical, focused on performing measurably useful
tasks now).

    although language is complex, and ambiguity is pervasive,

nlp can also  be surprisingly easy sometimes:
    rough text features often do half the job

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

linguistics

    linguistics is the study of natural languages:

    understanding this naturally-occurring

phenomenon.

    structure, meaning, how acquired, differences and

commonalities across languages.

scienti   c
goal

    linguistics draws on research in natural

language processing, theoretical computer
science, artificial intelligence, mathematics
and statistics, psychology, cognitive
science, etc.

goals of the course

    introduce you to natural language processing

problems and solutions.

    ultimate focus on handling ambiguity by

probabilistic integration of evidence.

    give you some hands-on practice with data and

a handful of methods.

andrew mccallum, umass amherst,
 including material from chris manning and jason eisner

this class

    assumes you come with some skills   

    some basic math/id203,

decent programming skills
(we will use python; tutorial coming next week.)

    some ability to learn missing knowledge
    teaches key theory and methods for

id38, tagging, parsing, etc.

    but it   s something like an    ai systems    class:

    hands on with data
    often practical issues dominate over theoretical

niceties

grading

    7 short written homework / programming

assignments.
    no way to really internalize without doing it
    some hands-on experience
    should be fun!
    should take about 1-2 hours each.

    random, informal in-class    collaborative quizzes   

    help you set expectations for the mid-term and final

    final project: with a small team, mixed backgrounds

    chance to explore a special interest at end of term
    midterm & final, and classroom participation

for linguistics students:
programming?  yipes!

    yes, but with extensive support for those w/out

experience.

    historically popular language for cl courses:

    prolog (clean, hard to learn, counter-intuitive)
    perl (quick, but obfuscated syntax, messy to read)
    interpreted, rapid prototyping

    why python is better-suited:

    easy to learn, clean syntax, powerful features
    becoming increasingly popular in complinguistics!
    extensive tutorials, compling support, toolkits, data, etc.
    many cs students don   t know it either: put you on

more equal footing.

syllabus outline

    two parts:

    first half:

    first: hands-on course, introductory, methods, hw
    second: more like a seminar + project

    language, structures, and computation
    foundation of id203 and id205
    use those foundations to work with language

    example topics:

    language models, language prediction, spam filtering.
    collocations, word id91, id51.
    finite state machines, markov models, part-of-speech

tagging.

    modern parsing techniques.
    information extraction, semantics, id53,

discourse.
