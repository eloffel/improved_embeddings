predictive annotation
some observations
word proximity
in documents that contain the answers, the query terms tend to occur in close proximity to each other
phrases
the answers to fact-seeking questions are usually phrases
these phrases can be categorized by question type
the phrases can be identified in text by pattern matching techniques
type: the position of the span type in the list of potential span types. example: type (   lou vasquez   ) = 1, because the span type of    lou vasquez   , namely    person    appears first in the list of potential span types,    person org name role   .
feature selection
avgdst: the average distance in words between the beginning of the span and the words in the query that also appear in the passage. example: given the question    who was johnny mathis' high school track coach?    and the passage    tim o'donohue, woodbridge high school's varsity baseball coach, resigned monday and will be replaced by assistant johnny ceballos, athletic director dave cowen said.    and the span    tim o   donohue   , the value of avgdst is equal to 8.
notinq: the number of words in the span that do not appear in the query. example: notinq (   woodbridge high school   ) = 1, because both    high    and    school    appear in the query while    woodbridge    does not. it is set to    100 when the actual value is 0.
frequency: number of times a given span appears in the hit list.
sscore: passage relevance as computed by the search engine.
number: position of the span among all spans returned. example:    lou vasquez    was the first span returned by guruqa on the sample question.
rspanno: position of the span among all spans returned within the current passage.
count: number of spans of any span class retrieved within the current passage.
