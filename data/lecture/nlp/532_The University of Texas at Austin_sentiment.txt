polarity classi   cation [slide from lillian lee]

consider just classifying an avowedly subjective text unit as 
either positive or negative (   thumbs up or    thumbs down   ).
one application: review summarization.

elvis mitchell, may 12, 2000: it may be a bit early to make such judgments, but 
battle   eld earth may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century.

can   t we just look for words like    great   ,    terrible   ,    worst   ?
yes, but ... learning a suf   cient set of such words or phrases 
is an active challenge.

subject 1

positive: dazzling, brilliant, phenomenal, excellent, 
fantastic
negative: suck, terrible, awful, unwatchable, hideous

subject 2

positive: gripping, mesmerizing, riveting, spectacular, 
cool, awesome, thrilling, badass, excellent, moving, 
exciting 
negative: bad, cliched, sucks, boring, stupid, slow

automatically

(from data)

positive: love, wonderful, best, great, superb, 
beautiful, still

polarity words are not enough [slide from lillian lee]

can   t we just look for words like    great    or    terrible   ?
yes, but ...

this laptop is a great deal.

a great deal of media attention surrounded the release of the new laptop.

this laptop is a great deal ... and i   ve got a nice bridge you might be interested in.

polarity words are not enough 

polarity    ippers: some words change positive expressions 
into negative ones and vice versa.

negation: america still needs to be focused on job creation. not among obama's 
great accomplishments since coming to of   ce !! [from a tweet in 2010]

contrastive discourse connectives: i used to hate it. but this stuff is 
yummmmmy :) [from a tweet in 2011 -- the tweeter had already bolded    hate    and 
   but   !] 

multiword expressions: other words in context can make a 
negative word positive:
that movie was shit. [negative]

that movie was the shit. [positive] (american slang from the 1990   s)

more subtle sentiment (from pang and lee)

with many texts, no ostensibly negative words occur, yet they 
indicate strong negative polarity.

   if you are reading this because it is your darling fragrance, please wear it at home 
exclusively, and tape the windows shut.    (review by luca turin and tania sanchez 
of the givenchy perfume amarige, in perfumes: the guide, viking 2008.)

   she runs the gamut of emotions from a to b.    (dorothy parker, speaking about 
katharine hepburn.) 

   jane austen   s books madden me so that i can   t conceal my frenzy from the 
reader. every time i read    pride and prejudice    i want to dig her up and beat her 
over the skull with her own shin-bone.    (mark twain.)

thwarted expectations (from pang and lee)

there are also highly negative texts that use lots of positive words, but 
ultimately are reversed by the    nal sentence. for example

this    lm should be brilliant. it sounds like a great plot, the actors 
are first grade, and the supporting cast is good as well, and 
stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance. however, 
it can   t hold up.

this is referred to as a thwarted expectations narrative because in the 
   nal sentence the author sets up a deliberate contrast to the preceding 
discourse, giving it more impact.

polarity classi   cation: it   s more than positive and negative

positive:    as a used vehicle, the ford focus represents a 
solid pick.   
negative:    still, the focus' interior doesn't quite measure up 
to those offered by some of its competitors, both in terms of 
materials quality and design aesthetic.   
neutral:    the ford focus has been ford's entry-level car 
since the start of the new millennium.   
mixed:    the current focus has much to offer in the area of 
value, if not re   nement.

other dimensions of id31

subjectivity: is an opinion even being expressed? many 
statements are simply factual.
target: what exactly is an opinion being expressed about?
important for aggregating interesting and meaningful statistics about sentiment.

also, it affects how the language use indicates polarity: e.g, unpredictable is 
usually positive for movie reviews, but is very negative for a car   s steering

ratings: rather than a binary decision, it is often of interest to 
provide or interpret predictions about sentiment on a scale, 
such as a 5-star system.

other dimensions of id31

perspective: an opinion can be positive or negative 
depending on who is saying it

entry-level could be good or bad for different people

it also affects how an author describes a topic: e.g. pro-choice vs pro-life, 
affordable health care vs obamacare.

authority: was the text written by someone whose opinion 
matters more than others?

it is more important to identify and address negative sentiment expressed by a 
popular blogger than a one-off commenter or supplier of a product reviewer on a 
sales site

follower graphs (where applicable) are very useful in this regard

spam: is the text even valid or at least something of interest?
many tweets and blog post comments are just spammers trying to drive traf   c to 
their sites

sentiment lexicons: bing liu   s opinion lexicon

bing liu maintains and freely distributes a sentiment lexicon 
consisting of lists of strings.

distribution page (direct link to rar archive)

positive words: 2006

negative words: 4783

useful properties: includes mis-spellings, morphological variants, slang, and 
social-media mark-up

note: may be used for academic and commercial purposes.

the mpqa (multi-perspective id53) 
subjectivity lexicon is maintained by theresa wilson, janyce

2005).
note: distributed under a gnu public license (not suitable

other sentiment lexicons

sentiid138 (baccianella, esuli, and sebastiani 2010) 
attaches positive and negative real-valued sentiment scores 
to id138 synsets (fellbaum1998).

note: recently changed license to permissive, commercial-friendly terms. 

harvard general inquirer is a lexicon attaching syntactic, 
semantic, and pragmatic information to part-of-speech tagged 
words (stone, dunphry, smith, and ogilvie 1966).
linguistic inquiry and word counts (liwc) is a proprietary 
database consisting of a lot of categorized regular 
expressions.  its classi   cations are highly correlated with 
those of the harvard general inquirer.

complexity of features

features can be de   ned on very deep aspects of the 
linguistic content, including syntactic and rhetorical structure.
the models for these can be quite complex, and often require 
signi   cant training material to learn them, which means it is 
harder to employ them for languages without such resources.

i   ll show an example for part-of-speech tagging in a bit.

also: the more    ne-grained the feature, the more likely it is 
rare to see in one   s training corpus. this requires more 
training data, or effective semi-supervised learning methods.

is it coherent to ask what the sentiment of a document is?

documents tend to discuss many entities and ideas, and they 
can express varying opinions, even toward the same entity.
this is true even in tweets, e.g.

here's a #hcr proposal short enough for 
mitch mcconnell to read: pass the damn bill now

positive towards the hcr bill

negative towards mitch mcconnell

entity and aspect (hu and liu, 2004; liu, 2006) 

an entity e is a product, person, event, organization, or topic. 
e is represented as 

a hierarchy of components, sub-components, and so on. 

each node represents a component and is associated with a set of attributes of 
the component. 

iphone

{cost,size,appearance,...}

screen

{...}

...

battery

{battery_life,size,...}

an opinion can be expressed on any node or attribute of the 
node. 
for simplicity, we use the term aspects (features) to 
represent both components and attributes.

opinion de   nition (liu, ch. in nlp handbook, 2010) 

an opinion is a quintuple (e,a,so,h,t) where:

e is a target entity. 

a is an aspect/feature of the entity e. 

so is the sentiment value of the opinion from the opinion holder h on feature a of 
entity e at time t. so is positive, negative or neutral (or more granular ratings). 

h is an opinion holder. 

t is the time when the opinion is expressed. 

examples from the previous passage:

(iphone, general, +, abc123, 5-1-2008) 
(iphone, touch_screen, +, abc123, 5-1-2008)
