1.  introduction 

many  chapters  in  this  book  illustrate  that  applying  a  statistical  method  such  as  latent  semantic  analysis  (lsa; 
landauer  &  dumais,  1997;  landauer,  foltz,  &  laham,  1998)  to  large  databases  can  yield  insight  into  human 
cognition. the lsa approach makes three claims: that semantic information can be derived from a word-document 
co-occurrence  matrix;  that  dimensionality  reduction  is  an  essential  part  of  this  derivation;  and  that  words  and 
documents can be represented as points in euclidean space. in this chapter, we pursue an approach that is consistent 
with  the  first  two  of  these  claims,  but  differs  in  the  third,  describing  a  class  of  statistical  models  in  which  the 
semantic properties of words and documents are expressed in terms of probabilistic topics. 
topic models (e.g., blei, ng, & jordan, 2003; griffiths & steyvers, 2002; 2003; 2004; hofmann, 1999; 2001) are 
based upon the idea that documents are mixtures of topics, where a topic is a id203 distribution over words. a 
topic model is a generative model for documents: it specifies a simple probabilistic procedure by which documents 
can be generated. to make a new document, one chooses a distribution over topics. then, for each word in that 
document, one chooses a topic at random according to this distribution, and draws a word from that topic. standard 
statistical  techniques  can  be  used  to  invert  this  process,  inferring  the  set  of  topics  that  were  responsible  for 
generating a collection of documents. figure 1 shows four example topics that were derived from the tasa corpus, 
a collection of over 37,000 text passages from educational materials (e.g., language & arts, social studies, health, 
sciences) collected by touchstone applied science associates (see landauer, foltz, & laham, 1998). the figure 
shows the sixteen words that have the highest id203 under each topic. the words in these topics relate to drug 
use, colors, memory and the mind, and doctor visits. documents with different content can be generated by choosing 
different  distributions  over  topics.  for  example,  by  giving  equal  id203  to  the  first  two  topics,  one  could 
construct  a document  about a  person  that has  taken  too many  drugs,  and  how  that  affected  color  perception.  by 
giving equal id203 to the last two topics, one could construct a document about a person who experienced a 
loss of memory, which required a visit to the doctor.

figure 1. an illustration of four (out of 300) topics extracted from the tasa corpus. 

 
representing the content of words and documents with probabilistic topics has one distinct advantage over a purely 
spatial representation. each topic is individually interpretable, providing a id203 distribution over words that 
picks out a coherent cluster of correlated terms. while figure 1 shows only four out of 300 topics that were derived, 
the topics are typically as interpretable as the ones shown here. this contrasts with the arbitrary axes of a spatial 
representation,  and  can  be  extremely  useful  in  many  applications  (e.g.,  griffiths  &  steyvers,  2004;  rosen-zvi, 
griffiths, steyvers, & smyth, 2004; steyvers, smyth, rosen-zvi,  & griffiths, 2004).  
the  plan  of  this  chapter  is  as  follows.  first,  we  describe  the  key  ideas  behind  topic  models  in  more  detail,  and 
outline  how  it  is  possible  to  identify  the  topics  that  appear  in  a  set  of  documents.  we  then  discuss  methods  for

answering two kinds of similarities: assessing the similarity between two documents, and assessing the associative 
similarity between two words. we close by considering how generative models have the potential to provide further 
insight into human cognition. 

2.  generative models 

a  generative  model  for  documents  is  based  on  simple  probabilistic  sampling  rules  that  describe  how  words  in 
documents might be generated on the basis of latent (random) variables. when fitting a generative model, the goal is 
to  find  the  best  set  of  latent  variables  that  can  explain  the  observed  data  (i.e.,  observed  words  in  documents), 
assuming that the model actually generated the data. figure 2 illustrates the id96 approach in two distinct 
ways:  as  a  generative  model  and  as  a  problem  of  statistical  id136.    on  the  left,  the  generative  process  is 
illustrated with two topics. topics 1 and 2 are thematically related to money and rivers and are illustrated as bags 
containing different distributions over words. different documents can be produced by picking words from a topic 
depending on the weight given to the topic. for example, documents 1 and 3 were generated by sampling only from 
topic 1 and 2 respectively while document 2 was generated by an equal mixture of the two topics. note that the 
superscript numbers associated with the words in documents indicate which topic was used to sample the word. the 
way that the model is defined, there is no notion of mutual exclusivity that restricts words to be part of one topic 
only. this allows topic models to capture polysemy, where the same word has multiple meanings. for example, both 
the  money  and  river  topic  can  give  high  id203  to  the  word  bank,  which  is  sensible  given  the  polysemous 
nature of the word.

topic 2

 
the generative process described here does not make any assumptions about the order of words as they appear in 
documents. the only information relevant to the model is the number of times words are produced. this is known as 
the  bag-of-words  assumption,  and  is  common  to  many  statistical  models  of  language  including  lsa.  of  course, 
word-order  information  might  contain  important  cues  to  the  content  of  a  document  and  this  information  is  not 
utilized by the model. griffiths, steyvers, blei, and tenenbaum (2005) present an extension of the topic model that 
is sensitive to word-order and automatically learns the syntactic as well as semantic factors that guide word choice 
(see also dennis, this book for a different approach to this problem).  
the right panel of figure 2 illustrates the problem of statistical id136. given the  observed words in a set of 
documents,  we  would  like  to  know  what  topic  model  is  most  likely  to  have  generated  the  data.  this  involves 
inferring  the  id203  distribution  over  words  associated  with  each  topic,  the  distribution  over  topics  for  each 
document, and, often, the topic responsible for generating each word.

3.  probabilistic topic models 

a variety  of probabilistic  topic  models  have been used  to  analyze  the content  of documents  and  the  meaning of 
words (blei et al., 2003; griffiths and steyvers, 2002; 2003; 2004; hofmann, 1999; 2001). these models all use the 
same fundamental idea     that a document is a mixture of topics     but make slightly different statistical assumptions. 
to introduce notation, we will write p( z ) for the distribution over topics z in a particular document and p( w | z ) 
for the id203 distribution over words w given topic z. several topic-word distributions p( w | z ) were illustrated 
in figures 1 and 2, each giving different weight to thematically related words. each word wi in a document (where 
the  index  refers  to  the  ith  word  token)  is  generated  by  first  sampling  a  topic  from  the  topic  distribution,  then 
choosing  a  word  from  the  topic-word  distribution.  we  write  p(  zi  =  j  )  as  the  id203  that  the  jth  topic  was 
sampled for the ith word token and p( wi | zi = j ) as the id203 of word wi under topic j. the model specifies the 
following distribution over words within a document:

j

(
p w z
|

)
(

)

where t is the number of topics. to simplify notation, let   (j) = p( w | z=j ) refer  to the multinomial distribution over 
words for topic j and   (d) = p( z ) refer to the multinomial distribution over topics for document d. furthermore, 
assume that the text collection consists of d documents and each document d consists of nd word tokens. let n be 
the total number of word tokens (i.e., n =    nd). the parameters    and    indicate which words are important for 
which topic and which topics are important for a particular document, respectively.  
hofmann (1999; 2001) introduced the probabilistic topic approach to document modeling in his probabilistic latent 
semantic  indexing  method  (plsi;  also  known  as  the  aspect  model).  the  plsi  model  does  not  make  any 
assumptions about how the mixture weights    are generated, making it difficult to test the generalizability of the 
model to new documents. blei et al. (2003) extended this model by introducing a dirichlet prior on   , calling the 
resulting  generative  model  latent  dirichlet  allocation  (lda).  as  a  conjugate  prior  for  the  multinomial,  the 
dirichlet distribution is a convenient choice as prior, simplifying the problem of statistical id136. the id203 
density of a t dimensional dirichlet distribution over the multinomial distribution  p=(p1,    , pt)  is defined by:

the parameters of this distribution are specified by   1       t. each hyperparameter   j can be interpreted as a prior 
observation  count  for  the  number  of  times  topic  j  is  sampled  in  a  document,  before  having  observed  any  actual 
words from that document. it is convenient to use a symmetric dirichlet distribution with a single hyperparameter    
such that   1 =   2=   =   t =  . by placing a dirichlet prior on the topic distribution   , the result is a smoothed topic 
distribution,  with  the  amount  of  smoothing  determined  by  the      parameter.  figure  3  illustrates  the  dirichlet 
distribution for three topics in a two-dimensional simplex. the simplex is a convenient coordinate system to express 
all  possible  id203  distributions  --  for  any  point  p  =  (p1,     ,  pt)  in  the  simplex,  we  have 
.  the 
dirichlet prior on the topic distributions can be interpreted as forces on the topic combinations with higher    moving 
the topics away from the corners of the simplex, leading to more smoothing (compare the left and right panel). for    
< 1, the modes of the dirichlet distribution are located at the corners of the simplex. in this regime (often used in 
practice), there is a bias towards sparsity, and the pressure is to pick topic distributions favoring just a few topics.

griffiths  and  steyvers  (2002;  2003;  2004)  explored  a  variant  of  this  model,  discussed  by  blei  et  al.  (2003),  by 
placing  a  symmetric  dirichlet(   )  prior  on      as  well.  the  hyperparameter      can  be  interpreted  as  the  prior 
observation  count  on  the  number  of  times  words  are  sampled  from  a  topic  before  any  word  from  the  corpus  is 
observed. this smoothes the word distribution in every topic, with the amount of smoothing determined by    . good 
choices  for  the  hyperparameters     and     will  depend  on  number  of  topics  and  vocabulary  size.  from  previous 
research, we have found    =50/t and    = 0.01 to work well with many different text collections.

graphical model. probabilistic generative models with repeated sampling steps can be conveniently illustrated using 
plate notation (see buntine, 1994, for an introduction). in this graphical notation, shaded and unshaded variables 
indicate  observed  and  latent  (i.e.,  unobserved)  variables  respectively.  the  variables     and    ,  as  well  as  z  (the 
assignment of word tokens to topics) are the three sets of latent variables that we would like to infer. as discussed 
earlier, we treat the hyperparameters    and    as constants in the model. figure 4 shows the graphical model of the 
topic model used in griffiths & steyvers (2002; 2003; 2004). arrows indicate conditional dependencies between 
variables while plates (the boxes in the figure) refer to repetitions of sampling steps with the variable in the lower 
right corner referring to the number of samples. for example, the inner plate over z and w illustrates the repeated 
sampling  of  topics  and  words  until  nd  words  have  been  generated  for  document  d.  the  plate  surrounding   (d) 
illustrates  the  sampling  of  a  distribution  over  topics  for  each  document  d  for  a  total  of  d  documents.  the  plate 
surrounding   (z)  illustrates  the  repeated  sampling  of  word  distributions  for  each  topic  z  until  t  topics  have  been 
generated.  
geometric interpretation. the probabilistic topic model has an elegant geometric interpretation as shown in figure 5 
(following hofmann, 1999). with a vocabulary containing w distinct word types, a w dimensional space can be 
constructed where each axis represents the id203 of observing a particular word type. the w-1 dimensional 
simplex represents all id203 distributions over words. in figure 5, the shaded region is the two-dimensional 
simplex that represents all id203 distributions over three words. as a id203 distribution over words, each 

 

5

document  in  the  text  collection  can  be  represented  as  a  point  on  the  simplex.  similarly,  each  topic  can  also  be 
represented as a point on the simplex. each document that is generated by the model is a convex combination of the 
t  topics  which  not  only  places  all  word  distributions  generated  by  the  model  as  points  on  the  w-1  dimensional 
simplex, but also as points on the t-1 dimensional simplex spanned by the topics. for example, in figure 5, the two 
topics span a one-dimensional simplex and each generated document lies on the line-segment between the two topic 
locations. the dirichlet prior on the topic-word distributions can be interpreted as forces on the topic locations with 
higher    moving the topic locations away from  the corners of the simplex.  
when the number of topics is much smaller than the number of word types (i.e., t << w), the topics span a low-
dimensional subsimplex and the projection of each document onto the low-dimensional subsimplex can be thought 
of as id84. this formulation of the model is similar to latent semantic analysis. buntine (2002) 
has  pointed  out  formal  correspondences  between  topic  models  and  principal  component  analysis,  a  procedure 
closely related to lsa.

id105 interpretation. in lsa, a word document co-occurrence matrix can be decomposed by singular 
value decomposition into three matrices (see other chapter in this book by martin & berry): a matrix of word vectors, 
a diagonal matrix with singular values and a matrix with document vectors. figure 6 illustrates this decomposition. 
the topic model can also be interpreted as id105, as pointed out by hofmann (1999). in the model 
described above, the word-document co-occurrence matrix is split into two parts: a topic matrix     and a document 
matrix 
. note that the diagonal matrix d in lsa can be absorbed in the matrix u or v, making the similarity 
between the two representations even clearer.   
this  factorization  highlights  a  conceptual  similarity  between  lsa  and  topic  models,  both  of  which  find  a  low-
dimensional  representation  for  the  content  of  a  set  of  documents.  however,  it  also  shows  several  important 
differences between the two approaches. in topic models, the word and document vectors of the two decomposed 
matrices are id203 distributions with the accompanying constraint that the feature values are non-negative and 
sum up to one. in the lda model, additional a priori constraints are placed on the word and topic distributions. 
there is no such constraint on lsa vectors, although there are other id105 techniques that require 
non-negative feature values (lee & seung, 2001). second, the lsa decomposition provides an orthonormal basis 
which  is  computationally  convenient  because  one  decomposition  for  t  dimensions  will  simultaneously  give  all 
lower dimensional approximations as well. in the topic model, the topic-word distributions are independent but not 
orthogonal; model id136 needs to be done separately for each dimensionality.

other applications. the statistical model underlying the id96 approach has been extended to include other 
sources  of  information  about  documents.  for  example,  cohn  and  hofmann  (2001)  extended  the  plsi  model  by 
integrating  content  and  link  information.  in  their  model,  the  topics  are  associated  not  only  with  a  id203 
distribution over terms, but also over hyperlinks or citations between documents. recently, steyvers, smyth, rosen-
zvi, and griffiths (2004) and rosen-zvi, griffiths, steyvers, and smyth (2004) proposed the author-topic model, an 
extension  of  the  lda  model  that  integrates  authorship  information  with  content.  instead  of  associating  each 
document  with  a  distribution  over  topics,  the  author-topic  model  associates  each  author  with  a  distribution  over 
topics and assumes each multi-authored document expresses a mixture of the authors    topic mixtures.  the statistical 
model underlying the topic model has also been applied to data other than text. the grade-of-membership (gom) 
models  developed  by  statisticians  in  the  1970s  are  of  a  similar  form  (manton,  woodbury,  &  tolley,  1994),  and 
erosheva  (2002)  considers  a  gom  model  equivalent  to  a  topic  model.  the  same  model  has  been  used  for  data 
analysis in genetics (pritchard, stephens, & donnelly, 2000).  

4.  algorithm for extracting topics 

the main variables of interest in the model are the topic-word distributions     and the topic distributions    for each 
document. hofmann (1999) used the id83 to obtain direct estimates of     and   . 
this  approach  suffers  from  problems  involving  local  maxima  of  the  likelihood  function,  which  has  motivated  a 
search for better estimation algorithms (blei et al., 2003; buntine, 2002; minka, 2002). instead of directly estimating 
the  topic-word  distributions       and  the  topic  distributions     for  each  document,  another  approach  is  to  directly 
estimate the posterior distribution over z (the assignment of word tokens to topics), given the observed words w, 
while marginalizing out     and   . each zi gives an integer value [ 1..t ] for the topic that word token i is assigned to. 
because  many  text  collections  contain  millions  of  word  token,  the  estimation  of  the  posterior  over  z  requires 
efficient estimation procedures. we will describe an algorithm that uses id150, a form of markov chain 
monte carlo, which is easy to implement and provides a relatively efficient method of extracting a set of topics from 
a large corpus (griffiths & steyvers, 2004; see also buntine, 2004, erosheva 2002 and pritchard et al., 2000). more 
information about other algorithms for extracting topics from a corpus can be obtained in the references given above. 
id115 (mcmc) refers to a set of approximate iterative techniques designed to sample values 
from  complex  (often high-dimensional) distributions  (gilks,  richardson,  &  spiegelhalter, 1996). gibbs  sampling 
(also  known  as  alternating  conditional  sampling),  a  specific  form  of  mcmc,  simulates  a  high-dimensional 
distribution by sampling on lower-dimensional subsets of variables where each subset is conditioned on the value of 
all  others.  the  sampling  is  done  sequentially  and  proceeds  until  the  sampled  values  approximate  the  target 
distribution. while the gibbs procedure we will describe does not provide direct estimates of     and   , we will show 
how     and     can be approximated using posterior estimates of z.

the id150 algorithm. we represent the collection of documents by a set of word indices wi and document 
indices di, for each word token i. the id150 procedure considers each word token in the text collection in 
turn,  and  estimates  the  id203  of  assigning  the  current  word  token  to  each  topic,  conditioned  on  the  topic 
assignments to all other word tokens. from this conditional distribution, a topic is sampled and stored as the new 
topic assignment for this word token. we write this conditional distribution as p( zi =j | z-i , wi , di ,     ), where zi = j 
represents the topic assignment of token i to topic j, z-i refers to the topic assignments of all other word tokens, and 
          refers to all other known or observed information such as all other word and document indices w-i and d-i, and 
hyperparameters   , and   .  griffiths and steyvers (2004) showed how this can be calculated by:

djc contains the number of times 
of times word w is assigned to topic j, not including the current instance i and 
topic j is assigned to some word token in document d, not including the current instance i. note that equation 3 
gives  the  unnormalized  id203.  the  actual  id203  of  assigning  a  word  token  to  topic  j  is  calculated  by 
dividing the quantity in equation 3 for topic t by the sum over all topics t. 
the factors affecting topic assignments for a particular word token can be understood by examining the two parts of 
equation 3. the left part is the id203 of word w under topic j whereas the right part is the id203 that topic 
j has under the current topic distribution for document d. once many tokens of a word have been assigned to topic j 
(across documents), it will increase the id203 of assigning any particular token of that word to topic j. at the 
same time, if topic j has been used multiple times in one document, it will increase the id203 that any word 
from that document will be assigned to topic j. therefore, words are assigned to topics depending on how likely the 
word is for a topic, as well as how dominant a topic is in a document. 
the id150 algorithm starts by assigning each word token to a random topic in [ 1..t ]. for each word token, 
the count matrices cwt and cdt are first decremented by one for the entries that correspond to the current topic 
assignment. then, a new topic is sampled from the distribution in equation 3 and the count matrices cwt and cdt 
are incremented with the new topic assignment. each gibbs sample consists the set of topic assignments to all n 
word tokens in the corpus, achieved by a single pass through all documents. during the initial stage of the sampling 
process (also known as the burnin period), the gibbs samples have to be discarded because they are poor estimates 
of the posterior. after the burnin period, the successive gibbs samples start to approximate the target distribution 
(i.e., the posterior distribution over topic assignments). at this point, to get a representative set of samples from this 
distribution,  a  number  of  gibbs  samples  are  saved  at  regularly  spaced  intervals,  to  prevent  correlations  between 
samples (see gilks et al. 1996).       
estimating    and   . the sampling algorithm gives direct estimates of z for every word. however, many applications 
of  the  model  require  estimates         and         of  the  word-topic  distributions  and  topic-document  distributions 
respectively.   these can be obtained from the count matrices as follows:

these values correspond to the predictive distributions of sampling a new token of word i from topic j, and sampling

conditioned on a particular sample z. 
an  example.  the  gibbs  sampling  algorithm  can  be  illustrated  by  generating  artificial  data  from  a  known  topic 
model and applying the algorithm to check whether it is able to infer the original generative structure. we illustrate 
this  by  expanding  on  the  example  that  was  given  in  figure  2.  suppose  topic  1  gives  equal  id203  to  words

the topic assignments (black = topic 1; white = topic 2). at the start of sampling (top panel), the assignments show

exchangeability of topics. there is no a priori ordering on the topics that will make the topics identifiable between 
or even within runs of the algorithm. topic j in one gibbs sample is theoretically not constrained to be similar to 
topic j in another sample regardless of whether the samples come from the same or different markov chains (i.e., 
samples spaced apart that started with the same random assignment or samples from different random assignments). 
therefore,  the  different  samples  cannot  be  averaged  at  the  level  of  topics.    however,  when  topics  are  used  to 
calculate  a  statistic  which  is  invariant  to  the  ordering  of  the  topics,  it  becomes  possible  and  even  important  to 
average  over  different  gibbs  samples  (see  griffiths  and  steyvers,  2004).  model  averaging  is  likely  to  improve 
results because it allows sampling from multiple local modes of the posterior.   
stability of topics. in some applications, it is desirable to focus on a single topic solution in order to interpret each 
individual topic. in that situation, it is important to know which topics are stable and will reappear across samples 
and which topics are idiosyncratic for a particular solution. in figure 8, an analysis is shown of the degree to which 
two topic solutions can be aligned between samples from different markov chains. the tasa corpus was taken as

input (w=26,414; d=37,651; n=5,628,867; t=100;    =50/t=.5;    =.01) and a single gibbs sample was taken after 
2000 iterations for two different random initializations. the left panel shows a similarity matrix of the two topic 
solutions. dissimilarity between topics j1 and j2 was measured by the symmetrized kullback liebler (kl) distance 
between topic distributions:

where       and          correspond to the estimated topic-word distributions from two different runs. the topics of the 
second run were re-ordered to correspond as best as possible (using a greedy algorithm) with the topics in the first 
run. correspondence was measured by the (inverse) sum of kl distances on the diagonal. the similarity matrix in 
figure 8 suggests that a large percentage of topics contain similar distributions over words. the right panel shows 
the worst pair of aligned topics with a kl distance of 9.4. both topics seem related to money but stress different 
themes. overall, these results suggest that in practice, the solutions from different samples will give different results 
but that many topics are stable across runs.

determining the number of topics. the choice of the number of topics can affect the interpretability of the results. 
a solution with too few topics will generally result in very broad topics whereas a solution with too many topics will 
result  in  uninterpretable  topics  that  pick  out  idiosyncratic  word  combinations.  there  are  a  number  of  objective 
methods  to  choose  the  number  of  topics.  griffiths  and  steyvers  (2004)  discussed  a  bayesian  model  selection 
approach.  the idea is to estimate the posterior id203 of the model while integrating over all possible parameter 
settings (i.e., all ways to assign words to topics). the number of topics is then based on the model that leads to the 
highest posterior id203. another approach is to choose the number of topics that lead to best generalization 
performance to new tasks. for example, a topic model estimated on a subset of documents should be able to predict 
word choice in the remaining set of documents. in computational linguistics, the measure of perplexity has been 
proposed to assess generalizability of text models across subsets of documents (e.g., see blei et al. 2003; rosen-zvi 
et al., 2004). recently, researchers have used methods from non-parametric bayesian statistics to define models that 
automatically  select  the  appropriate  number  of  topics  (blei,  griffiths,  jordan,  &  tenenbaum,  2004;  teh,  jordan, 
beal, & blei, 2004). 

5.  polysemy with topics 

many  words  in  natural  language  are  polysemous,  having  multiple  senses;  their  semantic  ambiguity  can  only  be 
resolved by other words in the context. probabilistic topic models represent semantic ambiguity through uncertainty 
over topics. for example, figure 9 shows 3 topics selected from a 300 topic solution for the tasa corpus (figure 1 

 

10

showed  four  other  topics  from  this  solution).  in  each  of  these  topics,  the  word  play  is  given  relatively  high 
id203 related to the different senses of the word (playing music, theater play, playing games).

figure 10. three tasa documents with the word play. 

 
in a new context, having only observed a single word play, there would be uncertainty over which of these topics 
could  have  generated  this  word.  this  uncertainty  can  be  reduced  by  observing  other  less  ambiguous  words  in 
context.  the  disambiguation  process  can  be  described  by    the  process  of  iterative  sampling  as  described  in  the 
previous section (equation 4), where the assignment of each word token to a topic depends on the assignments of 
the other words in the context. in figure 10, fragments of three documents are shown from tasa that use play in 

 

11

three different senses. the superscript numbers show the topic assignments for each word token. the gray words are 
stop words or very low frequency words that were not used in the analysis. the sampling process assigns the word 
play to topics 77, 82, and 166 in the three document contexts.  the presence of other less ambiguous words (e.g., 
music in the first document) builds up evidence for a particular topic in the document. when a word has uncertainty 
over topics, the topic distribution developed for the document context is the primary factor for disambiguating the 
word.  

6.  computing similarities 

the  set  of  topics  derived  from  a  corpus  can  be  used  to  answer  questions  about  the  similarity  of  words  and 
documents: two words are similar to the extent that they appear in the same topics, and two documents are similar to 
the extent that the same topics appear in those documents. 
similarity  between  documents.  the  similarity  between  documents  d1  and  d2  can  be  measured  by  the  similarity 
.  there  are  many  choices  for  similarity  functions 
between  their  corresponding  topic  distributions 
between id203 distributions (lin, 1991). a standard function to measure the difference or divergence between 
two distributions p and q is the kullback leibler (kl) divergence,

this non-negative function is equal to zero when for all j, pj = qj. the kl divergence is asymmetric and in many 
applications, it is convenient to apply a symmetric measure based on kl divergence:

which  measures  similarity  between p  and q  through  the  average  of p  and  q  --  two  distributions p  and  q  will  be 
similar if they are similar to their average (p+q)/2. both the symmetrized kl and js divergence functions seem to 
work  well  in  practice.  in  addition,  it  is  also  possible  to  consider  the  topic  distributions  as  vectors  and  apply 
geometrically motivated functions such as euclidian distance, dot product or cosine. 
for information retrieval applications, document comparison is necessary to retrieve the most relevant documents to 
a  query. the query  can  be a  (new)  set of  words produced by  a user or  it  can  be  an existing document  from  the 
collection. in the latter case, the task is to find similar documents to the given document. one approach to finding 
relevant documents is to assess the similarity between the topic distributions corresponding to the query and each 
candidate documents di, using one of the distributional similarity functions as discussed earlier. another approach 
(e.g. buntine et al., 2004) is to model information retrieval as a probabilistic query to the topic model -- the most 
relevant  documents  are  the  ones  that  maximize  the  conditional  id203  of  the  query,  given  the  candidate 
document. we write this as p( q | di ) where q is the set of words contained in the query. using the assumptions of 
the topic model, this can be calculated by:

note  that  this  approach  also  emphasizes  similarity  through  topics,  with  relevant  documents  having  topic 
distributions that are likely to have generated the set of words associated with the query.   
whatever similarity or relevance function is used, it is important to obtain stable estimates for the topic distributions. 
this  is  especially  important  for  short  documents.  with  a  single  gibbs  sample,  the  topic  distribution  might  be

influenced by idiosyncratic topic assignments to the few word tokens available. in that case, it becomes important to 
average the similarity function over multiple gibbs samples. 
similarity between two words. the similarity between two words w1 and w2 can be measured by the extent that they 
share the same topics. using a probabilistic approach, the similarity between two words can be calculated based on 
the  similarity  between    (1)  and    (2),  the  conditional  topic  distributions  for  words  w1  and  w2  where 
.  either  the  symmetrized  kl  or  js  divergence  would  be 
   =
appropriate to measure the distributional similarity between these distributions.  
there  is  an  alternative  approach  to  express  similarity  between  two  words,  emphasizing  the  associative  relations 
between words. the association between two words can  be expressed as a conditional distribution over potential 
response  words  w2  for  cue  word  w1,  i.e.
 --  what  are  likely  words  that  are  generated  as  an  associative 
response  to  another  word?  much  data  has  been  collected  on  human  word  association.  typically,  a  cue  word  is 
presented and the subject writes down the first word that comes to mind. nelson, mcevoy, and schreiber (1998) 
have developed word association norms for over 5000 words using hundreds of subjects per cue word. in figure 9, 
left panel, the distribution of human responses is shown for the cue word play. the responses reveal that different 
subjects associate with the cue in the different senses of the word (e.g., play(cid:198)ball and play(cid:198)actor).   in the 
topic model, word association corresponds to having observed a single word in a new context, and trying to predict 
new words that might appear in the same context, based on the topic interpretation for the observed word.  for a 
particular subject who activates a single topic j, the predicted distribution for w

in human word association, high frequency words are more likely to be used as response words than low frequency 
 will be influenced by the word frequency 
words. the model captures this pattern because the left term
of w2     high frequency words (on average) have high id203 conditioned on a topic.  
the  right  panel  of  figure  9  shows  the  predictions  of  the  topic  model  for  the  cue  word  play  using  a  300  topic 
solution  from  the  tasa  corpus.    griffiths  and  steyvers  (2002;  2003)  compared  the  topic  model  with  lsa  in 
predicting  word  association,  finding  that  the  balance  between  the  influence  of  word  frequency  and  semantic 
relatedness found by the topic model can result in better performance than lsa on this task.

7.  conclusion 

generative  models  for  text,  such  as  the  topic  model,  have  the  potential  to  make  important  contributions  to  the 
statistical analysis of large document collections, and the development of a deeper understanding of human language 

 

13

learning  and  processing.  these  models  make  explicit  assumptions  about  the  causal  process  responsible  for 
generating a document, and enable the use  of sophisticated statistical methods to identify the latent structure that 
underlies a set of words. consequently, it is easy to explore different representations of words and documents, and to 
develop richer models capable of capturing more of the content of language. topic models illustrate how using a 
different representation can provide new insights into the statistical modeling of language, incorporating many of the 
key assumptions behind lsa but making it possible to identify a set of interpretable probabilistic topics rather than 
a semantic space. topic models have also been extended to capture some interesting properties of language, such as 
the  hierarchical  semantic  relations  between  words  (blei  et  al.,  2004),  and  the  interaction  between  syntax  and 
semantics (griffiths et al., 2004). the vast majority of generative models are yet to be defined, and investigating 
these  models  provides  the  opportunity  to  expand  both  the  practical  benefits  and  the theoretical  understanding  of 
statistical language learning.
