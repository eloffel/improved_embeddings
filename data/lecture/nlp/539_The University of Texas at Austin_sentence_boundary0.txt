a graphic adventure game is a form of adventure game. 
they are distinct from text adventures. whereas a player 
must actively observe using commands such as "look" in a 
text-based adventure, graphic adventures revolutionized 
gameplay by making use of visual human perception. 
eventually, the text parser interface associated with older 
interactive fiction games was phased out in favor of a 
point-and-click interface, i.e., a game where the player 
interacts with the game environment and objects using an 
on-screen cursor. in many of these games, the mouse pointer 
is context sensitive in that it applies different actions to 
different objects.
