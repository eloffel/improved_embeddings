    query: aids treatment 

 
irrelevant document: 
 
hemophiliacs lack a protein, called factor viii, that is essential 
for making blood clots. as a result, they frequently suffer internal 
bleeding and must receive infusions of clotting protein derived from 
human blood. 
during the early 1980s, these treatments were often tainted with 
the aids virus. in 1984, after that was discovered, manufacturers 
began heating factor viii to kill the virus. the strategy greatly 
reduced the problem but was not foolproof. however, many experts 
believe that adding detergents and other refinements to the 
purification process has made natural factor viii virtually free of 
aids.

    query: aids treatment 
 

 
federal health officials are recommending aggressive use of a newly 
approved drug that protects people infected with the aids virus 
against a form of pneumonia that is the no.1 killer of aids victims. 
the food and drug administration approved the drug, aerosol 
pentamidine, on thursday. the announcement came as the centers for 
disease control issued greatly expanded treatment guidelines 
recommending wider use of the drug in people infected with the aids 
virus but who may show no symptoms.
