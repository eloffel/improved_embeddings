coreference resolution revisited	

mihai surdeanu msurdeanu@email.arizona.edu www.surdeanu.info/mihai  april 19th, 2013 what is it?	

coreference resolution = the task of id91 together of expressions that refer to the same entity/concept. michelle lavaughn robinson obama is an american lawyer and writer. she is the wife of the 44th and current president of the united states, barack obama, and the first african-american first lady of the united states. michelle lavaughn robinson obama is an american lawyer and writer. she is the wife of the 44th and current president of the united states, barack obama, and the first african-american first lady of the united states. why is it important?	

      id53          who is barack obama   s spouse?          information extraction          find all per:spouse relations between all named entities in this large corpus.          news aggregation          what are recent events involving michelle obama?          requires cross-document coreference resolution. more on this soon. why is it important?	

      performance doubles for these applications when coreference resolution is used.       see: r. gabbard, m. freedman, and r. weischedel, "coreference for learning to extract relations: yes, virginia, coreference matters," acl 2011. real-world example

chengdu, china (id98)     the researcher dressed in blue
plastic smock, slippers and gloves is having a tough time
getting his work done.
every time zhang zhen sets up his camera on a tripod in an
effort to document the behavior of one of [[the panda cubs]
scattered on [a grassy hillside]], one particularly frisky baby
panda comes wobbling towards him, interrupting his shoot.
   mumu!    he yells in frustration, as the four-month old cub rears
up on [her] hind legs, lunging towards him. he picks mumu up
and deposits her at [the opposite end] of [the enclosure].
   i   m not sure why she   s been all over me like this. i think she   s
excited today,    zhang says.
mumu is the oldest of fourteen baby pandas that were born last
summer here at the research base of [[giant panda] breeding]
in [chengdu, china].

some insights learned	

      most algorithms focus on step 2: computing mention-pair scores using machine learning, which is a local operation       poor representation of context: only two mentions considered       recent work showed that it is important to address coreference resolution as a global task, where all mentions are modeled jointly       this is hard to model using machine learning       ml models generalize poorly to new words, domains, and languages       annotating coreference is expensive idea i
