the distribution of tags

    tags follow all the usual frequency-based distributional 

behavior. 
 most word types have only one part of speech. 

   
    of the rest, most have two. things go pretty much as we'd 

expect from there on. 

    of course, as usual, the most frequently occurring word 

   

types tend to have multiple tags. 
(as we'll see later in the semester, they also tend to have 
more meanings). 

    therefore while its easy to determine the correct tag for 
most word types, it isn't necessarily so easy to tag most 
texts.

state of the art

    a dumb tagger that simply assigns the most 

common tag to each word achieves ~90%

    best approaches give ~96/97% 
    this still means that there will be on 

average one tagging error per sentence

    life is much more difficult if we do not 

have a lexicon and/or training corpus or if 
we use a tagger across domains and genres.
