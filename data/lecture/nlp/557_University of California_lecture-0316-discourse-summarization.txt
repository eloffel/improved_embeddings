coherence	vs	semantics

a	meaningless	sentence	can	be	grammatical..

colorless	green	ideas	sleep	furiously

the	discourse	equivalent	of	grammaticality	is	coherence

can	a	coherent	text	be	without	meaning?

example	essay

the	second	reason	for	the	five-paragraph	theme	is	that	it	
makes	you	focus	on	a	single	topic.	some	people	start	
writing	on	the	usual	topic,	like	tv	commercials,	and	they	
wind	up	all	over	the	place,	talking	about	where	tv	came	
from	or	capitalism	or	health	foods	or	whatever.	but	with	
only	five	paragraphs	and	one	topic	you   re	not	tempted	to	
get	beyond	your	original	idea,	like	commercials	are	a	good	
source	of	information	about	products.	you	give	your	three	
examples,	and	zap!	you   re	done.	this	is	another	way	the	
five-paragraph	theme	keeps	you	from	thinking	too	much.
