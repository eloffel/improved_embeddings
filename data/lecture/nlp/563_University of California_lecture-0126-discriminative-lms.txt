language  models

id203  of  a  sentence

is  a  given  sentence  something  you  would  expect  to  see?

   
    syntactically  (grammar)  and  semantically  (meaning)

id203  of  the  next  word
    predict  what  comes  next  for  a  given  sequence  of  words.
    think  of  it  as  v   way  classification

estimating  parameters

beyond  the  scope  of  the  course

lots  of  tricks,  heuristics,     domain  knowledge   
lot  of  engineering  for  efficiency,  e.g.  gpus

   
   
    new  training  algorithms  being  proposed  every  year

   

   

sometimes,  architecture   specific

lots  of  available  tools  you  can  use!

    tensorflow,  torch,  keras,  mxnet,  etc.
