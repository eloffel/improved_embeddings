tips	and	tricks:	tf-idf

sparsity	of	words
    remember	zipf   s law?	lots	of	rare	words
    for	classification,	they	can	be	more	informative!

cs	295:	statistical	nlp	(winter	2017)

13

tips	and	tricks:	tf-idf

why	use	log(proportion)
   

it	works   

   

   

importance	is	not	a	linear	function

idf	is	an	additive	function

14

tips	and	tricks:	id173

overfitting
    training	data	is	finite:	thus	has	spurious	correlations
    rare	words	that	occur	with	one	label!

    or	don   t	occur	often	enough
    curse	of	the	zipf   s law	continues   

for	a	word	that	occurs	10	times   

there	are	many	that	occur	~10	times!

    penalize	really	high	weights
