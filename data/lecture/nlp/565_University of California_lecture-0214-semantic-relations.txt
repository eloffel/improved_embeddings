framenet also codes relationships between frames, allowing frames to inherit
from each other, or representing relations between frames like causation (and gen-
eralizations among frame elements in different frames can be representing by inher-
itance as well). thus, there is a cause change of position on a scale frame that is

this frame consists of words that indicate the change of an item   s posi-
tion on a scale (the attribute) from a starting point (initial value) to an
end point (final value).

some of the semantic roles (frame elements) in the frame are de   ned as in
fig. 22.3. note that these are separated into core roles, which are frame speci   c, and
non-core roles, which are more like the arg-m arguments in propbank, expressed
more general properties of time, location, and so on.

here are some example sentences:

(22.20)
(22.21)
(22.22)
(22.23)

[item oil] rose [attribute in price] [difference by 2%].
[item it] has increased [final state to having them 1 day a month].
[item microsoft shares] fell [final value to 7 5/8].
[item colon cancer incidence] fell [difference by 50%] [group among

men].

(22.24) a steady increase [initial value from 9.5] [final value to 14.3] [item

in dividends]

(22.25) a [difference 5%] [item dividend] increase...

note from these example sentences that the frame includes target words like rise,

fall, and increase. in fact, the complete frame consists of the following words:

    the headword of the constituent, examiner. the headword of a constituent
can be computed with standard head rules, such as those given in chapter 11
in fig. ??. certain headwords (e.g., pronouns) place strong constraints on the
possible semantic roles they are likely to    ll.
