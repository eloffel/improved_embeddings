how	maple	syrup	is	made

maple	syrup	comes	from	sugar	maple	trees.		at	one	time,	maple	syrup	was	used	to	make	
sugar.		this	is	why	the	tree	is	called	a	"sugar"	maple	tree.		sugar	maple	trees	make	sap.		
farmers collect	the	sap.		the	best	time	to	collect	sap	is	in	february	and	march.		the	nights	
must	be	cold	and	the	days	warm.		the	farmer	drills	a	few	small	holes	in	each	tree.		he	
puts	a	spout	in	each	hole.		then	he	hangs	a	bucket	on	the	end	of	each	spout.		the	bucket	
has	a	cover	to	keep	rain	and	snow	out.		the	sap	drips	into	the	bucket.		about	10	gallons	of	
sap	come	from	each	hole.	

    who	collects	maple	sap?		(farmers)
    what	does	the	farmer	hang	from	a	spout?		(a	bucket)	
    when	is	sap	collected?		(february	and	march)
    where	does	the	maple	sap	come	from?		(sugar	maple	trees)	
    why	is	the	bucket	covered?		(to	keep	rain	and	snow	out)
