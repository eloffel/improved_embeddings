id136
modus ponens:
   
           
   

example:
cat(martin)
    x: cat(x)     eatsfish(x)
eatsfish(martin)



modus ponens
id136
forward chaining
as individual facts are added to the database, all derived id136s are generated
backward chaining
starts from queries 
example: the prolog programming language
prolog example
father(x, y) :- parent(x, y), male(x).
parent(john, bill).
parent(jane, bill).
female(jane).
male (john).
?- father(m, bill).
the kinship domain
brothers are siblings
   x,y brother(x,y)     sibling(x,y)
one's mother is one's female parent
   m,c mother(c) = m     (female(m)     parent(m,c))
   sibling    is symmetric
   x,y sibling(x,y)     sibling(y,x)
universal instantiation
every instantiation of a universally quantified sentence is entailed by it:
   v   
subst({v/g},   )
	
	for any variable v and ground term g

e.g.,    x cat(x)     fish(y)     eats(x,y) yields:
cat(martin)     fish(blub)     eats(martin,blub) 

existential instantiation
for any sentence   , variable v, and constant symbol k that does not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base:
    v   
subst({v/k},   )

e.g.,    x cat(x)     eatsfish(x) yields:

cat(c1)     eatsfish(c1)

	provided c1 is a new constant symbol, called a skolem constant


unification
if a substitution    is available, unification is possible
examples:
p=eats(x,y), q=eats(x,blub), possible if    = {y/blub}
p=eats(martin,y), q=eats(x,blub), possible if    = {x/martin,y/blub}
p=eats(martin,y), q=eats(y,blub), fails because martin   blub
subsumption
unification works not only when two things are the same but also when one of them subsumes the other one
example: all cats eat fish, martin is a cat, blub is a fish
