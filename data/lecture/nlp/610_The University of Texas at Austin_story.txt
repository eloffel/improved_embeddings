university of texas at austin
ai   nlp in the 70   s and early 80   s
focused on id99 and complex id136.
focused on story understanding and interpreting characters goals and plans (charniak, schank et al.)
focused on dialog understanding that inferred participants goals and plans.
required extensive manual symbolic  knowledge engineering.
only worked on a small number of specially concocted illustrative examples.
brittle and difficult to generalize to robust, reliable performance on unseen examples.


conceptual dependency
semantic representation developed by schank in his ut thesis in 1969.
represents meaning using a frame-like representation based on a set of semantic primitives with slots for semantic roles.
ptrans:  physical transfer, e.g. go, drive
atrans:  abstract transfer of ownership, e.g. give, sell.
mtrans: mental transfer of information, e.g. tell, email.
ingest:  take into the body, e.g. eat, drink.
conceptual dependency example
     john sold a prius to mary for $20k.

 (atrans (agent john)
                    (object (car (model prius) 
                    (from john) (to mary))
 (atrans (agent mary)
                   (object (money (amount 20000)
                                                     (units us-dollars))
                   (from mary) (to john))
conceptual dependency
motivation and issues
motivation: reduce sentences to canonical form that supports id53 without id136.
did mary buy a car from john?
did mary give john money? 
issues:
correct and comprehensive set of primitives is unclear
hard to encode complex verbs like    bet   
no guidance in representing objects.
makes id29 difficult.
only eliminates some kinds of id136.
does mary own a prius?
does john own a prius?
story understanding
my phd thesis (1987) involved learning plan schemata (   scripts   ) for story understanding in the    schankian    tradition.
used hand-coded symbolic knowledge to    deeply understand    short, concocted stories by understanding the plans and goals of the characters.
genesis learned new plan schemata from a single example using explanation-based learning to improve its future understanding.

inititial schema learning
input: fred is mary's father and is a millionaire.  john approached mary and pointed a gun at her.  she was wearing blue jeans.  he told her if she did not get in his car then he would shoot her.  he drove her to his hotel and locked her in his room.  john called fred and told him john was holding mary captive. john told fred if fred gave him 250000 dollars at trenos then john would release mary.  fred paid him the ransom and the kidnapper released mary. valerie is fred's wife and he told her that someone had kidnapped mary.

thematic goal achieved: john is happy that john has the $250000.
explanation suitable for generalization. pruning...generalizing...packaging...
creating new schema: (capturebargain ?x55 ?a34 ?b9 ?c4 ?r5 ?y5 ?l11)
?b9 is a person.  ?c4 is a location.  ?r5 is a room.  ?c4 is in ?r5.  ?x55 is a character.  ?b9 is free.  ?x55 captures ?b9 and locks him/her in ?r5.  ?a34 is a character.  ?x55 contacts ?a34 and tells it that ?b9 is ?x55's captive.  ?y5 is a valuable.  ?x55 wants to have ?y5 more than it wants ?b9 to be ?x55's captive.  ?a34 has a positive relationship with ?b9.  ?a34 has ?y5.  ?x55 and ?a34 carry out a bargain in which ?x55 releases ?b9 and ?a34 gives ?x55 ?y5 at ?l11.

unknown word 'ransom' refers to ?y5 in capturebargain
unknown word 'kidnapper' refers to ?x55 in capturebargain
having: ?x55 captured ?b9. suggest capturebargain
having: ?x55 contacted ?a34 and told it that ?b9 was ?x55's captive. suggest capturebargain
having: ?x55 and ?a34 carried out a bargain in which ?x55 released ?b9 and ?a34 gave ?x55 ?y5 at ?l11. suggest capturebargain

mary was free.  john captured mary and locked her in a room.  john contacted fred and told him that mary was john's captive.  john wanted to have $250000 more than he wanted mary to be john's captive.  fred had a positive relationship with mary.  fred had the $250000.  john and fred carried out a bargain in which john released mary and fred gave john the $250000 at trenos.

>why did john approach mary?
so john could aim the gun at mary.

>why did john aim the gun at mary?
so john could threaten to shoot mary with the gun unless mary went from john in to the car.

>why did mary get into the car?
because mary wanted not to be shot and because mary believed that if mary did not go from john into the car then john would shoot mary with the gun.

>why did john threaten to shoot mary unless she got in the car?
so john could drive mary to the hotel in the car.

>why did john drive mary to the hotel?
so john could move mary from the hotel into the room.

>why did john move mary into the room?
so john could confine mary in the room.

>why did john confine mary in the room?
so john could call fred and could tell him that mary was john's captive and so john and fred could carry out a bargain in which john released mary and fred gave john the $250000 at trenos.

>why did john tell fred that john was holding mary captive?
so john and fred could carry out a bargain in which john released mary and fred gave john the $250000 at trenos.

>why did fred give john the money?
because fred believed that if fred gave john the $250000 at trenos then john would release mary and because fred wanted mary to be free more than he wanted to have the $250000.

>why did fred have $250000?
because fred had millions of dollars.

>why did fred believe that john was holding mary captive?
because john called fred and told him that mary was john's captive.

conclusions
deep semantic processing requires understanding scripts, goals, and plans.
hand-coded knowledge can be used to produce complex representations of text that can answer interesting and difficult questions.
difficult to extend approach to be robust and cover a wide range of text.
recent work on using statistical learning to acquire scripts from large corpora of newspaper text (chambers & jurafsky, 2008).
