         u.s. supreme court quashes 'illegal' guantanamo trials
military trials arranged by the bush administration for detainees at guantanamo bay are illegal, the united states supreme court ruled thursday. the court found that the trials     known as military commissions     for people detained on suspicion of terrorist activity abroad do not conform to any act of congress. the justices also rejected the government's argument that the geneva conventions regarding prisoners of war do not apply to those held at guantanamo bay. writing for the 5-3 majority, justice stephen breyer said the white house had overstepped its powers under the u.s. constitution. "congress has not issued the executive a blank cheque," breyer wrote.
president george w. bush said he takes the ruling very seriously and would find a way to both respect the court's findings and protect the american people.

early information extraction
frump (dejong, 1979) was an early information extraction system that processed news stories and identified various types of events (e.g. earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods).
used    sketchy scripts    of various events to identify specific pieces of information about such events.
able to summarize articles in multiple languages.
relied on    brittle    hand-built symbolic knowledge structures that were hard to build and not very robust.
10
muc
darpa funded significant efforts in ie in the early to mid 1990   s.
message understanding conference (muc) was an annual event/competition where results were presented.
focused on extracting information from news articles:
terrorist events
industrial joint ventures
company management changes
information extraction of particular interest to the intelligence community (cia, nsa).
established standard evaluation methodolgy using development (training) and test data and metrics: precision, recall, f-measure.

ti - two potentially oncogenic cyclins, cyclin a and cyclin d1, share common properties of subunit configuration, tyrosine phosphorylation and physical association with the rb protein
ab - originally identified as a    mitotic cyclin   , cyclin a exhibits properties of growth factor sensitivity, susceptibility to viral subversion and association with a tumor-suppressor protein, properties which are indicative of an s-phase-promoting factor (spf) as well as a candidate proto-oncogene    
moreover, cyclin d1 was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and, like cyclin a, was readily phosphorylated by pp60c-src in vitro.
in synchronized human osteosarcoma cells, cyclin d1 is induced in early g1 and becomes associated with p9ckshs1, a cdk-binding subunit.
immunoprecipitation experiments with human osteosarcoma cells and ewing   s sarcoma cells demonstrated that cyclin d1 is associated with both p34cdc2 and p33cdk2, and that cyclin d1 immune complexes exhibit appreciable histone h1 kinase activity

web extraction
many web pages are generated automatically from an underlying database.
therefore, the html structure of pages is fairly specific and regular (semi-structured).
however, output is intended for human consumption, not machine interpretation.
an ie system for such generated pages allows the web site to be viewed as a structured database.
an extractor for a semi-structured web site is sometimes referred to as a wrapper.
process of extracting from such pages is sometimes referred to as screen scraping.

ie as sequence labeling
can treat ie as a sequence labeling problem.
can apply a sliding window classifier using various classification algorithms.
can apply sequence models:

crf
lstm

18
pattern-matching rule extraction
another approach to building ie systems is to use pattern-matching rules for each field to identify the strings to extract for that field. 
when building web extraction systems (wrappers) manually, it is common to write regular expression patterns (in a language like perl) to identify the desired regions of the text.
works well when a fairly fixed local context is sufficient  to identify extractions, as in extracting from web pages generated by a program or very stylized text like classified ads.
19
id157
language for composing complex patterns from simpler ones.
an individual character is a regex.
union: if e1 and e2 are regexes, then (e1 | e2 ) is a regex that matches whatever either e1 or e2 matches.
concatenation: if e1 and e2 are regexes, then e1 e2 is a regex that matches a string that consists of a substring that matches e1 immediately followed by a substring that matches e2  
repetition (kleene closure): if e1 is a regex, then e1* is a regex that matches a sequence of zero or more strings that match e1
20
enhanced regex   s (perl)
special terms for common sets of characters, such as alphabetic or numeric or general    wildcard   .
special repetition operator (+) for 1 or more occurrences.
special optional operator (?) for 0 or 1 occurrences.
special repetition operator for specific range of number of occurrences: {min,max}.
a{1,5}  one to five a   s.
a{5,}    five or more a   s
a{5}     exactly five a   s
21
perl regex   s
character classes:
\w (word char) any alpha-numeric (not: \w)
\d (digit char) any digit (not: \d)
\s (space char) any whitespace (not: \s)
.   (wildcard) anything
anchor points:
\b (boundary) word boundary
^  beginning of string
$  end of string

22
perl regex examples
u.s. phone number with optional area code:
/\b(\(\d{3}\)\s?)?\d{3}-\d{4}\b/
email address:
/\b\s+@\s+(\.com|\.edu|\.gov|\.org|\.net)\b/
23
simple extraction patterns
specify an item to extract for a slot using a regular expression pattern.
price pattern:    \b\$\d+(\.\d{2})?\b   
may require preceding (pre-filler) pattern to identify proper context.
amazon list price:
pre-filler pattern:    <b>list price:</b> <span class=listprice>   
filler pattern:    \$\d+(\.\d{2})?\b   
may require succeeding (post-filler) pattern to identify the end of the filler.
amazon list price:
pre-filler pattern:    <b>list price:</b> <span class=listprice>   
filler pattern:    .+   
post-filler pattern:    </span>   

24
adding nlp information to patterns
if extracting from automatically generated web pages, simple regex patterns usually work.
if extracting from more natural, unstructured, human-written text, some nlp may help.
part-of-speech (pos) tagging
mark each word as a noun, verb, preposition, etc.
syntactic parsing
identify phrases: np, vp, pp
semantic word categories (e.g. from id138)
kill: kill, murder, assassinate, strangle, suffocate
extraction patterns can use pos or phrase tags.
crime victim:
prefiller: [pos: v, hypernym: kill]
filler: [phrase: np]
25
pattern-match rule learning
writing accurate patterns for each slot for each application requires laborious software engineering.
alternative is to use rule induction methods.
rapier system (califf & mooney, 1999) learns three regex-style patterns for each slot:
pre-filler pattern
filler pattern
post-filler pattern
rapier allows use of pos and id138 categories in patterns to generalize over lexical items.
26
rapier pattern induction example
if goal is to extract the name of the city in which a posted job is located, the least-general-generalization constructed by rapier is:
27
evaluating ie accuracy
always evaluate performance on independent, manually-annotated test data not used during system development.
measure for each test document:
total number of correct extractions in the solution template: n
total number of slot/value pairs extracted by the system: e
number of extracted slot/value pairs that are correct (i.e. in the solution template): c
compute average value of metrics adapted from ir:
recall = c/n
precision = c/e
f-measure = harmonic mean of recall and precision  

28
ie experiment in bioinformatics
large scale comparison of ie methods on identifying names of human proteins in biomedical journal abstracts (bunescu et al. 2004).
goal is to mine the large body of biomedical literature to extract a useful database of all known protein interactions.
biologists can use this    protein network    to better understand the overall biochemical functioning of an organism.
29
non-learning protein extractors
dictionary-based extraction
uses a    gazetteer    of known human protein names.
kex (fukuda et al., 1998)
general protein-name identifier not specialized for human.
30
learning methods for protein extraction
rule-based pattern induction
 rapier (califf & mooney, 1999) 
 bwi (freitag & kushmerick, 2000)
token classification (bio chunking approach):
k-nearest neighbor 
transformation-based rule learning      abgene (tanabe & wilbur, 2002)
support vector machine (maximum-margin id88)
maximum id178 (discriminative version of na  ve bayes)
31
biomedical corpora
aimed: 750 abstracts that contain the word human were randomly chosen from medline for testing protein name extraction. they were manually tagged by experts to annotate a total of 5,206 human protein references (bunescu et al., 2005).
32
experimental method
10-fold cross-validation: average results over 10 trials with different training and (independent) test data.
for methods which produce confidence in extractions, vary threshold for extraction in order to explore recall-precision trade-off.
use standard methods from information-retrieval to generate a complete precision-recall curve.
maximizing f-measure assumes a particular cost-benefit trade-off between incorrect and missed extractions.

id111 with ie
automatically extract information from a large corpus to build a large database or knowledge-base of useful information.
for example, we have used our trained protein interaction extractor to mine biomedical journal abstracts:
input: 753,459 medline abstracts that reference    human   
output: database of 6,580 interactions between 3,737 human proteins  
id10
unsupervised approach to extraction in which the set of relations to extract are not predefined.
use dependency parses to extract specific lexical relations between entities and cluster  these paths to define an ontology of extracted relations.
