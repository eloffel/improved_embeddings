1

    what is meaning?
    what is the meaning of the word cat?

    not a speci   c cat
    not all cats
    abstract notion of any cat
    atomic semantic units: concepts

    example: cat     cat

semantic relationships

    hypernym / hyponym

    cat is-a feline
    basis of hierarchical relationships in id138

    part / whole

    cat has-part paw
    paw is-part-of cat

    membership

    faculty has-member professor
    professor is-member-of faculty

    antonym / opposite

    leader is-opposite-of follower

thematic roles

    words play semantic roles in a sentence

i|{z}

agent

|

{z

}

|

see the woman

with the telescope

theme

instrument

{z

4

.

}

    speci   c verbs typically require arguments with speci   c thematic roles and

allow adjuncts with speci   c thematic roles.

semantic frames

5

    complex concepts can be de   ned by semantic frames, whose slots are    lled

by concrete information

    soccer-game

    home-team: heart of midlothian
    away-team: fc motherwell
    score: 3-0
    time-started: 2006-02-18 16:00 gmt
    location: tynecastle stadium, edinburgh

    information extraction: can we    ll semantic frames from text?

source of semantic knowledge

6

    semantic knowledge is not directly observable
    building semantic knowledge bases

    for instance id138, an ontology
    labor intensive
    may not contain all information we want, e.g.

    pigeon is a typical bird
    penguin is not a typical bird

    can we automatically learn semantics?

learning semantics

7

the meaning of a word is its use.
ludwig wittgenstein, aphorism 43

    represent context of a word in a vector

    similar words have similar context vectors

    example: google sets http://labs.google.com/sets

    one meaning of cat

- enter: cat, dog
- return: cat, dog, horse,    sh, bird, rabbit, cattle, ...

    another meaning of cat

- enter: cat, more
- return: more, cat, ls, rm, mv, cd, cp, ...

8

    detecting national stereotypes with google
    enter: scots are known to be *

    frugal, friendly, generous, thrifty, ...
    enter: englishmen are known to be *

    prudish, great sports-lovers, people with manners, courteous, cold, ...

    enter: germans are known to be *

    pathetic, hard-nosed, arrogant, very punctual, fanatical, hard-working, ...

discourse

9

    beyond the sentence level, we are interested in how texts are structured

    central message of text
    supporting arguments
    introduction, conclusion

    elementary discourse units (edu) (    clauses) are related to each other
    texts shift in focus     text segmentation

text segmentation
    some text types have very pronounced topic shifts

    news broadcasts cover di   erent stories

    also other long texts may cover multiple topics

    lectures
    speeches
    essays

    task text segmentation

    given: text
    wanted: segmentation into smaller units with di   erent topics

philipp koehn

emnlp lecture 13

segmentation by vocabulary change

11

    at a topic boundary, use of vocabulary changes

    by comparing vocabulary of neighboring text parts, boundaries can be detected

    example: stargazers text from hearst [1994]

    intro: the search for life in space
    the moons chemical composition
    how early proximity of the moon shaped it
    how the moon helped life evolve on earth
    imid203 of the earth-moon system

rhetorical relations

13

    rhetorical structure theory (rst): relations between spans of edus
    example:

                              
attribution

`````````

the bank also says

                              
enablement

(((((((((((

hhhhhhhhhh

it will use its network to channel investments

philipp koehn

emnlp lecture 13

18 february 2008

types of rhetorical relations

14

    mono-nuclear: nucleus is more salient than satellite, which contains

supporting information

    multi-nuclear: joining spans have equal importance
    78 types of relations in 16 classes

attribution, background, cause, comparison, condition, contrast, elaboration,
enablement, evaluation, explanation,
joint, manner-means, topic-comment,
summary, temporal, topic-change

    more detail, see: building a discourse-tagged corpus in the framework of
rhetorical structure theory by lynn carlson, daniel marcu, and mary ellen
okurowski [sigdial 2001]

discourse parsing

15

    human annotator agreement on rhetorical relations is not very high

    77.0% if 18 relation types are used
    71.9% if 110 relation types are used

    probabilistic parsing model [soricut and marcu, naacl 2003]

    probabilistic chart parser
    achieves similar performance

    experiments done on the sentence level.
    discourse parsing should be useful for, e.g., summarization

anaphora

16

violent protests broke out again in happyland. according to the country   s
department of peace,    owers will be handed out tomorrow. a spokesman of the
department announced that they will be blue and green. this will demonstrate
the country   s commitment to alleviate the situation.
    a text contains often multiple references to the same objects:

       owers     they
    happyland     the country
    department of peace     the department
    violent protests     the situation
    handing out    owers     this

    id2 (matching the references) is a hard problem

sentiment detection

17

    what is the overall sentiment of a text
    example: movie review

    is it a recommendation or a negative review?
    can be framed as a text classi   cation problem
    see seeing stars: exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization

with respect to rating scales by bo pang and lillian lee [acl 2005]

    similar questions

    is a text critical of a person?
    does the text have a bias (political, etc.)?
