    task: make sense of foreign text like

    one of the oldest problems in arti   cial intelligence

    egyptian language was a mystery for centuries
    1799 a stone with egyptian text and its translation into greek was found
    humans could learn how to translated egyptian

parallel data

3

    lots of translated text available: 100s of million words of translated text for

some language pairs

    a book has a few 100,000s words
    an educated person may read 10,000 words a day
    3.5 million words a year
    300 million a lifetime
    soon computers will be able to see more translated text than humans read

in a lifetime

    machine can learn how to translated foreign languages

    foreign input is segmented in phrases

[from koehn et al., 2003, naacl]

    any sequence of words, not necessarily linguistically motivated

    each phrase is translated into english
    phrases are reordered

    why automatic id74?

    manual evaluation is too slow
    evaluation on large test sets reveals minor improvements
    automatic tuning to improve machine translation performance

    history

    word error rate
    id7 since 2002

    id7 in short: overlap with reference translations

    research questions

    why does id7 fail systran and manual post-edits?
    how can this overcome with novel id74?

    future of automatic methods

    automatic metrics too useful to be abandoned
    evidence still supports that during system development, a better id7

indicates a better system

       nal assessment has to be human judgement
