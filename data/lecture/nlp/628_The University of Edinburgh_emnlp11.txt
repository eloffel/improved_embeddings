word senses

1

    some words have multiple meanings
    this is called polysemy
    example: bank

       nancial institution: i put my money in the bank.
    river shore: he rested at the bank of the river.

    how could a computer tell these senses apart?

homonym

2

    sometimes two completely di   erent words are spelled the same
    this is called a homonym
    example: can

    modal verb: you can do it!
    container: she bought a can of soda.

    distinction between polysemy and homonymy not always clear

how many senses?

3

    how many senses does the word interest have?

    she pays 3% interest on the loan.
    he showed a lot of interest in the painting.
    microsoft purchased a controlling interest in google.
    it is in the national interest to invade the bahamas.
    i only have your best interest in mind.
    playing chess is one of my interests.
    business interests lobbied for the legislation.
    are these seven di   erent senses? four? three?

id138

4

    one way to de   ne senses is to look them up in id138, a hierarchical

database of senses

    according to id138, interest has 7 senses:

    sense 1: a sense of concern with and curiosity about someone or something,

synonym: involvement

    sense 2: the power of attracting or holding one   s interest (because it is

unusual or exciting etc.), synonym: interestingness

    sense 3: a reason for wanting something done, synonym: sake
    sense 4: a    xed charge for borrowing money; usually a percentage of the

amount borrowed

    sense 5:

a diversion that occupies one   s time and thoughts (usually

pleasantly), synonyms: pastime, pursuit

    sense 6: a right or legal share of something; a    nancial involvement with

something, synonym: stake

    sense 7: (usually plural) a social group whose members control some    eld

of activity and who have common aims, synonym: interest group

5

    organization of id138

    id138 groups words into synsets.
    polysemous words are part of multiple synsets
    synsets are organized into a hierarchical structure of is-a relationships, e.g.

a dog is-a pet, pet is-a animal

    is id138 too    ne grained?

di   erent sense = di   erent translation

    another way to de   ne senses:

if occurrences of the word have di   erent

6

translations, these indicate di   erent sense
    example interest translated into german

    zins:    nancial charge paid for load (id138 sense 4)
    anteil: stake in a company (id138 sense 6)
    interesse: all other senses

languages di   er

7

    foreign language may make    ner distinctions
    translations of river into french

       euve: river that    ows into the sea
    rivi`ere: smaller river

    english may make    ner distinctions than a foreign language
    translations of german sicherheit into english

    security
    safety
    con   dence

one last word on senses

8

    a lot of research in id51 is focused on polysemous words

with clearly distinct meanings, e.g. bank, plant, bat, ...

    often meanings are close and hard to tell apart, e.g. area,    eld, domain, part,

member, ...

    she is a part of the team.
    she is a member of the team.
    the wheel is a part of the car.
    * the wheel is a member of the car.

id51 (wsd)

    for many applications, we would like to disambiguate senses

9

    we may be only interested in one sense
    searching for chemical plant on the web, we do not want to know about

chemicals in bananas

    task: given a polysemous word,    nd the sense in a given context
    popular topic, data driven methods perform well

wsd as supervised learning problem

    words can be labeled with their senses

    she pays 3% interest/interest-money on the loan.
    he showed a lot of interest/interest-curiosity in the painting.

    similar to tagging

    given a corpus tagged with senses
    de   ne features that indicate one sense over another
    learn a model that predicts the correct sense given the features

    we can apply similar supervised learning methods

    naive bayes, related to id48
    transformation-based learning
    maximum id178 learning

simple features

11

    directly neighboring words

    plant life
    manufacturing plant
    assembly plant
    plant closure
    plant species

    any content words in a 10 word window (also larger windows)

    animal
    equipment
    employee
    automatic

more features

12

    syntactically related words
    syntactic role in sense
    topic of the text
    part-of-speech tag, surrounding part-of-speech tags

training data for supervised wsd

13

    senseval competition

    bi-annual competition on wsd
    provides annotated corpora in many languages

    pseudo-words

    create arti   cial corpus by arti   cially con   ate words
    example: replace all occurrences of banana and door with banana-door

    multi-lingual parallel corpora

    translated texts aligned at the sentence level
    translation indicates sense

naive bayes

14

    we want to predict the sense s given a set of features f
    first, apply the bayes rule

argmaxsp(s|f ) = argmaxsp(f|s)p(f )

(1)

    then, decompose p(f ) by assuming all features are independent (that   s naive!)

p(fi|s)

(2)

p(f ) = y

fi   f

    the prior p(s) and the conditional posterior probabilities p(fi|s) can be learned

decision list
    yarowsky [1994] uses a decision list for wsd

15

    two senses per word
    rules of the form: collocation     sense
    example: manufacturing plant     plant-factory
    rules are ordered, most reliable rules    rst
    when classifying a test example, step through the list, make decision on    rst

rule that applies

    learning: rules are ordered by

log

smoothing is important

(cid:18)p(sensea|collocationi)

p(senseb|collocationi)

(cid:19)

id64
    yarowsky [1995] presents id64 method
1. label a few examples
2. learn a decision list
3. apply decision list to unlabeled examples, thus labeling them
4. add newly labeled examples to training set
5. go to step 2, until no more examples can be labeled
    initial starting point could also be

    a short decision list
    words from dictionary de   nition

one sense per discourse

17

    rules encode the principle:
one sense per collocation

    id64 method also uses important principle:

one sense per discourse

    in one discourse only one sense of a polysemous word appears
    text talks either about plant-factory or plant-living

    improved id64 method

    after labeling examples, one sense per discourse principle is enforced
    all examples in one document are labeled with the same sense
    or, examples that are not in the majority sense are un-labeled
