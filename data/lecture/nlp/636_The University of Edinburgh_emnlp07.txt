information extraction

  extract information salient to the needs of the users

  information about house prices from real estate magazines
  character relations from novels
  location of terrorist attacks from newspapers

  extract structured data from unstructured or semi

structured natural language data, e.g. from
newspapers

  task involving natural language understanding and 

information retrieval

information extraction tasks

  id39

  which phrases refer to what kind of entities

  coreference resolution

  which phrases refer to the same entity

  id36

  which entities are related in what kind of relationships

  event extraction

  which events are mentioned with which attributes

id39

  named entity is an object of interest such as a person, 

organization, or location 

  identifying word sequences
  labelling those sequences
example:
meg whitman, ceo of ebay, said in new york   
  label meg whitman as person
  label ebay as organisation
  label new york as location

conll shared task 2003

  brings together researchers in computational natural

language learning

  aims at evaluating different machine learning

approaches

  gives training, development and test sets for ner in 

german and english

  identify entities and classify as person, location, 

organisation and misc

iob scheme in conll

  inside, outside, begin
  for each type of entity there is an i-xxx and a b-xxx 

tag

  non-entities are tagged o
  b-xxx only used if two entities of same type next to 

each other

  assumes that named entities are non-recursive and 

don   t overlap
example:    meg whitman    ceo    of      ebay
o       o     i-org

i-per b-per

a graphical model for ner

meg

whitman        ceo

   

 the ner framework covers

 features

 local classifiers

 sequential constraints

features

  features are the most important aspect of almost

every machine learning system
  is the word capitalised?
  is the word at the start of a sentence?
  what is the pos tag?
  info from gazetteers

  the more useful features you incorporate, the more

powerful your learner gets

local classifier

find

p(tagifeatures)

  maximum id178 classifier (berger et al. 1996)
  large margin approach such as support vector machines 

(id166s) (vapnik 1995)

  naive bayes (strong independence assumption)
  whatever you like

ensemble methods

  take a set of diverse classifiers
  let them vote on the tag of a single token (or average

their probabilistic output)

  diversity through different feature sets, different 
learners, different training data (dietterich 2000)

sequential modelling

  tags interdepend

  could use a model such as:

12

software

  use any programming language you want
  try to find good toolkits

  maxent toolkit of zhang lee (very good and fast 

training)

  crf++ framework (supports sequential modelling)
  weka (easy to use but memory intensive and slow)
  id166 light, libid166 (long training time, usually good 

performance)
