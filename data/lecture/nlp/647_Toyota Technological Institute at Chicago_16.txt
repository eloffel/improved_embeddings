machine	translation	

and	other	nlp	applications

announcements

    presentations	will	actually	be	9	minutes	

because	we	have	so	many	to	fit	in

    i	will	post	guidelines	on	the	final	project	

report	    think	of	it	as	a	short	(4-page)	paper
    i	will	send	you	your	midterm	and	assignment

why	do	you	think	that	hope	ramp	works	better	than	fear	ramp?

i	think:	going	away	from	something	bad	does	not	
necessarily	mean	that	you	are	going	toward	something	good.

you	might	be	going	toward	something	else	that   s	bad!

    we	have	a	latent	variable,	so	this	becomes:

alignments,	synchronous	id18	derivations,	etc.

    given	a	document,	produce	a	summary	of	a	

provided	length

    vast	majority	of	systems	are	extractive:	they	

extract	content	from	the	document
    this	is	safer,	since	the	document	is	presumably	

grammatical

    but	this	limits	applicability
