or, contextual meaning

pragmatics is important for building conversational agents, understanding human
decision making, understanding language, etc.

7 / 67

pragmatics vs. syntax, semantics (yule, 1996)

(cid:73) syntax: the relationships between linguistic forms, how they are arranged in

sequences, and which sequences are well-formed.

(cid:73) semantics: the relationships between linguistic forms and entities in the world.
(cid:73) pragmatics: the relationships between linguistic forms and the users of those

forms.

speech act theory

we do not simply produce utterances containing grammatical structures; we perform
actions via those utterances.
actions performed via utterances are generally called speech acts (austin, 1975).

speech act theory

(cid:73) locutionary act (the actual utterance and its ostensible meaning)
(cid:73) illocutionary act (its real, intended meaning)
(cid:73) perlocutionary act (its actual e   ect, whether intended or not)
