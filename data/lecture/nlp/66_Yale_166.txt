languages and automata
language:
set of strings
automaton:
abstract model
defines a language (all the strings that it accepts)
input: string
output: yes/no

the id154




recursively enumerable
context-sensitive
mildly context-sensitive

context-free
regular
[slide from jurafsky and martin]
examples
languages and automata
regular
finite-state
id157
id39, id66
context-free
push-down automata
most nl and pl phenomena
context-sensitive
linear bounded automaton
captures typing in pl
are natural languages regular
in practice
almost
in theory
no
center-embedding requires context-free rules
example

proof that nl are not regular
pumping lemma for regular languages
if l is an infinite language over a, then there are strings x,y,z     a* such that y     e and xynz     l for all n   0. 
regular languages are closed under intersection

[figure from jurafsky and martin]
proof (cont   d)
consider the language l=anbn
there are only three options for y:
a+
b+
a+b+
in each case, repeating y (or skipping y) will result in a string that is not in l
another example
sentences
the cat caught a fish
the cat that the dog saw caught a fish
the cat that the dog that the girl found saw caught a fish
language
(the n)n (verb)n-1 caught a fish
a = {the cat, the dog, the rat, the girl    }
b = {ate, saw, caught, chased, found    } 
intersect with english
a* b* caught a fish
l =    an bn-1 caught a fish    is not regular (see previous slide)

representing anbn as a cfl

are natural languages context-free
in practice
almost
in theory
no
cross-serial dependencies cannot be captured using a id18
[figure from jurafsky and martin]
example
ambncmdn is not context-free
intersect some sentences in dutch or swiss german
