       this	
   film	
   should	
   be	
   brilliant.	
   	
   it	
   sounds	
   like	
   a	
   great	
   plot,	
   

the	
   actors	
   are	
   first	
   grade,	
   and	
   the	
   supporting	
   cast	
   is	
   
good	
   as	
   well,	
   and	
   stallone	
   is	
   attempting	
   to	
   deliver	
   a	
   
good	
   performance.	
   however,	
   it	
   can   t	
   hold	
   up.   

    well	
   as	
   usual	
   keanu	
   reeves	
   is	
   nothing	
   special,	
   but	
   

surprisingly,	
   the	
   very	
   talented	
   laurence	
   fishbourne is	
   
not	
   so	
   good	
   either,	
   i	
   was	
   surprised.
