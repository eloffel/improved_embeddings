syntax of predicate logic 

       symbol set 
       constants 
       boolean connectives 
       variables 
       functions 
       predicates (aka relations) 
       quantifiers 

       terms: variables, constants, functional 
       sentences:  

expressions (can be arguments to predicates) 

       atomic sentences (predicate expressions),  
       complex sentences (atomic sentences connected by 
       quantified sentences 

booleans),

       quantifiers 

      all dogs are mammals. 
      some birds can   t fly. 
      3 birds can   t fly. 

semantics of predicate logic 

semantics, part 2 

       a term is a reference to an object 

      constants 
      variables 
      functional expressions 

       sentences make claims about objects 

      well-formed formulas, (wffs) 

       object constants refer to individuals 
       there is a correspondence between  

      functions, which return values 
      predicates, which are true or false 

function: father_of(mary) = bill 
predicate: father_of(mary, bill)

so, we need the ability to allow the verb to 
provide a template-like structure with slots 
to be filled in. and we need to specify 
where the slot fillers come from.
