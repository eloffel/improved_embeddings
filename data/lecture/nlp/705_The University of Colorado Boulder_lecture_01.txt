natural language processing 

we   re going to study what goes into 
getting computers to perform useful 
and interesting tasks involving human 
language.

natural language processing 

more specifically, it   s about the structure 
of human languages, the algorithms that 
exploit that structure to process 
language, and the formal basis for those 
algorithms.

why should you care? 

three trends 

1.    an enormous amount of information is now 

available in machine readable form as natural 
language text (newspapers, web pages, 
medical records, financial filings, etc.) 
2.    conversational agents are becoming an 

important form of human-computer 
communication 

3.    much of human-human interaction is now 
mediated by computers via social media

text analytics 

       data-mining of weblogs, microblogs, 
discussion forums, message boards, user 
groups, and other forms of user generated 
media 
!   product marketing information 
!   political opinion tracking 
!   social network analysis 
!   buzz analysis (what   s hot, what topics are 
people talking about right now)

id53 

       traditional information retrieval provides 
documents/resources that provide users 
with what they need to satisfy their 
information needs. 
       id53 on the other hand 
directly provides an answer to information 
needs posed as questions.

machine translation 

the automatic translation of texts between 
languages is one of the oldest non-numerical 
applications in computer science. 
in the past 10 years or so, mt has gone from a 
niche academic curiosity to a robust commercial 
industry.

how? 

all of these applications operate by 
exploiting underlying regularities inherent 
in human languages. 
sometimes in complex ways, sometimes in 
pretty trivial ways.

applications 

 first, what makes an application a 
language processing application (as 
opposed to any other piece of software)? 
!   an application that requires the use of 
knowledge about the structure of human 
language 
"   example: is unix wc (word count) an 
example of a language processing 
application?

17 

applications 

       word count? 

!   when it counts words: yes 

"    to count words you need to know what a word is. 
that   s knowledge of language. 
       note that the definition of    word    embodied in wc doesn   t 

work for chinese or other languages that don   t delimit 
words with spaces 

!   when it counts lines and bytes: no 

"    lines and bytes are computer artifacts, not 
linguistic entities

caveat 

nlp has an distinct ai aspect to it 

!   we   re often dealing with ill-defined problems 
!   we don   t often come up with exact solutions/
algorithms 
"    that is, we   re dealing with algorithms that don   t 
work. 

!   to make progress we need to have concrete 
metrics that tell us how well we   re doing, or at 
least whether our systems are improving or 
not

editor called idle. it   s a serviceable 
development environment.

   each kind of knowledge has associated with 

it an encapsulated set of processes that 
make use of it. 
 interfaces are defined that allow the 
various levels to communicate. 
 this often leads to a pipeline architecture.

dealing with ambiguity 

       four possible approaches: 

1.    tightly coupled interaction among 
processing levels; knowledge from 
other levels can help decide among 
choices at ambiguous levels. 

2.    pipeline processing that ignores 

ambiguity as it occurs and hopes that 
other levels can eliminate incorrect 
structures.

dealing with ambiguity 

3.    probabilistic approaches based on making the 

most likely choices 
1.    or passing along n-best choices 

4.    don   t do anything, maybe it won   t matter 

1.    we   ll leave when the duck is ready to eat. 
2.    the duck is ready to eat now. 

       does the    duck    ambiguity matter with respect to whether 

we can leave?

models and algorithms 
       by models we mean the formalisms that 
are used to capture the various kinds of 
linguistic knowledge we need. 
       algorithms are then used to manipulate 
the id99s needed to 
tackle the task at hand.

algorithms 

       many of the algorithms that we   ll study will 
turn out to be transducers; algorithms that 
take one kind of structure as input and 
output another. 
       unfortunately, ambiguity makes this process 
difficult. this leads us to employ algorithms 
that are designed to handle ambiguity of 
various kinds
