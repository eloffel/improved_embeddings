meaning representations 

semantic processing 

       what does this mean    

      representations of linguistic inputs that 
capture the meanings of those inputs 

       for us it means 

      representations that permit or facilitate 
semantic processing 

       ok, so what does that mean? 
       representations that 

      permit us to reason about their truth (i.e.,  
their relationship to some world) 
      permit us to answer questions based on their 
content 
      permit us to perform id136 (answer 
questions and determine the truth of things 
we don   t already know to be true)

semantic processing 

we   ll add a 3rd way 

       the book discusses 2 ways to attack this 

problem (just as we did with parsing) 
      there   s the principled, theoretically motivated 
approach    
       computational/id152 

       chapters 17 and 18 

      and there are limited, practical approaches 
that have some hope of actually being useful

semantic analysis 

       compositional analysis 

      create a fol representation that accounts for 
all the entities, roles and relations present in a 
sentence. 
       similar to our approach to full parsing 

       information extraction 

      do a superficial analysis that pulls out only 
the entities, relations and roles that are of 
interest to the consuming application. 
       similar to chunking

representational schemes 
!    we   re going to make use of first order 

logic (fol) as our representational 
framework 
!    not because we think it   s ideal 
!    many of the alternatives turn out to be either 
too limiting or too complex or 
!    they turn out to be notational variants 

fol 

!    allows for    

!    the analysis of truth conditions 

!    allows us to answer yes/no questions 

!    supports the use of variables 

!    allows us to answer questions through the use of 
variable binding 

!    supports id136 

!    allows us to answer questions that go beyond what 
we know explicitly

       usually, quakers are pacifist 
       usually, republicans are not pacifist 
       richard is both a quaker and a 

republican 

       since richard can be proved to be a 

pacifist in at least one case, he is believed 
to be a pacifist; however, since he can 
also be proved not to be a pacifist, he is 
also believed not to be a pacifist.
