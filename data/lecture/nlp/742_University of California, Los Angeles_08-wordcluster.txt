v similar to language model

but, basic unit is    word clusters   

v intuition: again, similar words appear in similar context
v recap: bigram language  models

v        #,    %,    &,   ,    (	
=         %     #         &    %             (     (+%
=  -.%	/ p(w3       3+%)
    # is	a	dummy	word	representing	   begin	of	a	sentence

algorithm 1 

v start with |v| clusters 

each word is in its own cluster

v pick 2 clusters and merge them

v the goal is to get k clusters
v we run |v|-k merge steps:

v each step pick the merge maximizing	        (    ,    )
v cost?  (can be improved to 			    (    g))
o(|v|-k)						    (    &)						    	(    &) = 			    (    h)

#iters

#pairs   compute ll

them in its own cluster     %,    &,    g,       i
v for     =     +1    |    |
v create a new cluster     il%	 (we have m+1 clusters)

v carry out (m-1) final merges     full hierarchy
