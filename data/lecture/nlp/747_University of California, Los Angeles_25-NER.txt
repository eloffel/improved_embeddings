challenging

v dealing with ambiguity of natural language

v mentions of entities and concepts could have multiple 

meanings

v dealing with variability of natural language 

v a given concept could be expressed in many ways

v wikification addresses these two issues in a specific 

way:

v the reference problem

v what is meant by this concept? (wsd + grounding)
v more than just co-reference (within and across documents)

wikification: subtasks

v wikification and entity linking requires 

addressing several sub-tasks:
v identifying target mentions 

v mentions in the input text that should be wikified

v identifying  candidate titles

v candidate wikipedia titles that could correspond to each 

mention   

v candidate title ranking 

v rank the candidate titles for a given mention

v nil detection and id91

v identify mentions that do not correspond to a wikipedia title
v entity linking: cluster nil mentions that represent the 

same entity.

high-level algorithmic approach. 

v input: a text document d;              output: a set of pairs (mi ,ti) 

v mi are mentions in d; tj(mi	) are corresponding wikipedia titles, or 

nil. 

v (1) identify mentions mi in d 
v (2) local id136
v for each mi in d: 

v identify a set of relevant titles t(mi	)    
v rank titles ti     t(mi	)

[e.g., consider local statistics of edges [(mi ,ti) , (mi ,*), and  (*, ti )] 
occurrences in the wikipedia graph] 

v (3) global id136

v for each document d: 

v consider all mi     d; and all ti     t(mi	)
v re-rank titles ti     t(mi	)

[e.g., if m, m    are related by virtue of being in d, their corresponding 
titles t, t    may also be related]

local approach 

      is	a	solution	to	the	problem

   a	set	of	pairs	(m,t)	

   m:	a	mention	in	the	document
   t:	the	matched	wikipedia	title

a	text	document

identified	
mentions

wikipedia	articles

local	score	of	matching
the	mention	to	the	title
(decomposed	 by	mi)	

13cs6501-nlp

global approach: using additional structure

text	document(s)   news,	blogs,   

wikipedia	articles

adding	 a	   global   	term	to	evaluate	how	
good	the	structure of	the	solution	 is.
    use	the	local	solutions	      	(each	

mention	considered	independently.
    evaluate	the	structure	based	on	pair-

wise	coherence	scores	  (ti,tj)

    choose	those	that	satisfy	 document

coherence	conditions.
