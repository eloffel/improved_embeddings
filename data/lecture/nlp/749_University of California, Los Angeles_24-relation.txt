how to build relation extractors (closed domain)

v hand-written patterns
v supervised machine learning 

v take each sentence as input
v identify name entities (mentions) 
v perform multi-class classifications

v + constraints or features to model correlations

how to build relation extractors (open domain)

v bootstrap learning [brin 98,    ]

v use seed instances to extract a set of relational 

patterns

v unsupervised learning

v cluster sentences based on relational  patterns 

v distant supervision

distant supervision for id36 without labeled data [mintz 09+]
v combine the above approaches

v a follow-up approach:

id36 with id105 and universal 
schemas [riedel 13+]
