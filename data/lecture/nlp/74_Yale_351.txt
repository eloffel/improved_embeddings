nous   tions    l     tude, quand le proviseur entra, suivi d   un nouveau habill   en bourgeois et d   un gar  on de classe qui portait un grand pupitre. ceux qui dormaient se r  veill  rent, et chacun s      leva comme surpris dans son travail.    
translation 1 (eleanor marx-aveling)
we were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new fellow," not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just surprised at his work.
translation 2
we were in the study-hall when the headmaster entered, followed by a new boy not yet in school uniform and by the handy man carrying a large desk.  their arrival disturbed the slumbers of some of us, but we all stood up in our places as though rising from our work.
translation 3
we were in the prep.-room when the head came in, followed by a new boy in 'mufti' and a beadle carrying a big desk. the sleepers aroused themselves, and we all stood up, putting on a startled look, as if we had been buried in our work.
