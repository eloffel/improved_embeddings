v pronouns: i, you, she, mine, his, them,

choosing a tagset

v could pick very coarse tagsets

v n, v, adj, adv, other

v more commonly used set is finer grained

v e.g.,    id32 tagset   , 45 tags: prp$, wrb, 

wp$, vbg

v brown cropus, 87 tags.

v prague dependency treebank (czech)

v 4452 tags
v aafp3----3n----: (nejnezaj  mav  j    m)
