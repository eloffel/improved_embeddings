smart
the most influential ir system/toolkit
developed at cornell since 1960   s 
vector space model with lots of weighting options
written in c 
the cornell/at&t groups have used the smart system to achieve top trec performance
mg
a highly efficient toolkit for retrieval of text and images 
developed by people at univ. of waikato, univ. of melbourne, and rmit in 1990   s
written in c, running on unix
vector space model with lots of compression and speed up tricks
people have used it to achieve good trec performance
lemur/indri
an ir toolkit emphasizing language models
developed at cmu and univ. of massachusetts in 2000   s
written in c++, highly extensible
vector space and probabilistic models including language models
achieving good trec performance with a simple language model
terrier
a large-scale retrieval toolkit with lots of applications (e.g., desktop search) and trec support
developed at university of glasgow, uk
written in java, open source
   divergence from randomness    retrieval model and other modern retrieval formulas

lucene
open source ir toolkit 
initially developed by doug cutting in java
now has been ported to some other languages
good for building ir/web applications
many applications have been built using lucene (e.g., nutch and solr)
