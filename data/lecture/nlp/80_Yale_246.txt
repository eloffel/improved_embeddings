example sentence
wsj/12/wsj_1273.mrg, sentence 11 
because the cd had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the cd 's increased market value .

peculiarities
complementizers
e.g.,    that   
gaps
*none*
sbar
sbar     comp s
e.g.,    that *none* represented the cd    market value   

tgrep
a < b    a immediately dominates b
a << b   a dominates b
a <- b   b is the last child of a
a <<, b  b is a leftmost descendant of a
a <<` b  b is a rightmost descendant of a
a . b    a immediately precedes b
a .. b   a precedes b
a $ b    a and b are sisters
a $. b   a and b are sisters and a immediately precedes b
a $.. b  a and b are sisters and a precedes b 
the use of treebanks
disadvantages
a lot more work to annotate 40k+ sentences than to write a grammar.
advantages
statistics about different constituents and phenomena
training systems
evaluating systems
multilingual extensions
introduction to nlp
issues with context-free grammars
agreement
number
chen is/people are
person
i am/chen is
tense
chen was reading/chen is reading/chen will be reading
case
not in english but in many other languages such as german, russian, greek
gender
not in english but in many other languages such as german, french, spanish
combinatorial explosion
many combinations of rules are needed to express agreement
s     np vp
s     1sgnp 1sgvp
s     2sgnp 2sgvp
s     3sgnp 3sgvp
   
1sgnp     1sgn
...
subcategorization frames
direct object

prepositional phrase

bare infinitive

to-infinitive

id18 independence assumptions
non-independence
all nps
11% np pp, 9% dt nn, 6% prp
nps under s
9% np pp, 9% dt nn, 21% prp
nps under vp
23% np pp, 7% dt nn, 4% prp

conclusions
syntax helps understand the meaning of a sentence.
bob gave alice a flower
who gave a flower to alice?
what did bob give to alice?
context-free grammars are an appopriate representation for syntactic information
id145 is needed for efficient parsing
cubic time to find one parse
still exponential time to find all parses
why?
answer
why does it still take an exponential time to find all parses?
very simple     because the number of parses can be exponential
