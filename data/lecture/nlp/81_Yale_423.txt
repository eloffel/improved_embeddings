summarization techniques 2/3
mani/bloedorn (1997, 1999)
graph-based method for identifying similarities and differences between documents
single event or sequence of events
content entities (nodes) and relations (edges)
relation types
same, adjacent, alpha (id138, netowl), coref
spreading activation


barzilay & m. elhadad (1997)
lexical chains
mr. kenny is the person that invented the anesthetic machine which uses micro-computers to control the rate at which an anesthetic is pumped into the blood. such machines are nothing new. but his device uses two micro-computers to achieve much closer monitoring of the pump feeding the anesthetic into the patient. 





barzilay and m. elhadad (1997)
id138-based
three types of relations:
extra-strong (repetitions)
strong (id138 relations)
medium-strong (link between synsets is longer than one + some additional constraints)
barzilay and m. elhadad (1997)
scoring chains:
length
homogeneity index:
= 1     (# distinct words in chain, divided by length)

score = length * homogeneity

score > average + 2 * st.dev.
