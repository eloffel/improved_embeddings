path similarity
version 1
sim (v,w) = - pathlength (v,w)
version 2
sim (v,w) = - log pathlength (v,w)
problems with this approach
there may be no tree for the specific domain or language
a specific word (e.g., a term or a proper noun) may not be in any tree
is-a (hypernym) edges are not all equally apart in similarity space

path similarity between two words
version 3 (philip resnik)
sim (v,w) = - log p(lcs(v,w))
where lcs = lowest common subsumer, e.g.,
	ungulate for deer and horse
	deer for deer and elk
information content
version 4 (dekang lin)
id138 augmented with probabilities (lin 1998)
ic(c) = -log p(c)
sim (v,w) = 2 x log p(lcs(v,w)) / (log p(v) + log p(w))
