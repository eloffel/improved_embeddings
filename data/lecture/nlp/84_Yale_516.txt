nlp
introduction to nlp
id28
example with interpolation
linear interpolation for id38
estimating the trigram id203 p(c|ab) using pid113(c|a), pid113(c), etc.
weights    1,    2, etc.
we may want to consider other features
e.g., pos tags of previous words, heads, word endings, etc.
general idea
compute the id155 p(y|x)
p(y|x) = sum of weights*features
label y for a given history x in x
id28
id28
similar to na  ve bayes (but discriminative!)
log-linear model
features don   t have to be independent
examples of features
anything of use
linguistic and non-linguistic
count of    good   
count of    not good   
sentence length
classification using lr
compute the feature vector x
multiply with weight vector w


compute the logistic function
examples
example 1
x = (2,1,1,1)
w = (1,-1,-2,3)
z = 2-1-2+3=2
f(z) = 1/(1+e-2)
example 2
x = (2,1,0,1)
w = (0,0,-3,0)
z = 0
f(z) = 1/(1+e0) = 1/2
