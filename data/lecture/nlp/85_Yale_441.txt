discourse analysis
issues with discourse
anaphora
i went to see my grandfather at the hospital. the old man has been there for weeks. he had surgery a few days ago.
entities, referring expressions and antecedents
issues with both single sentences and multi-sentential text, e.g., coherence
needed
models of discourse
cohesion
cohesion (halliday and hasan 1976)
text units must make sense together
different from coherence
example: reference
example: discourse connectors
lexical chains

topic segmentation
identifying where topic shifts occur
examples
text tiling (hearst, 1994, 1997)
lexical chains (galley et al., 2004)
svd (choi et al., 2001)
coreference
sample use of anaphora
john saw mary in the park. as every morning, she was walking her dog.
what does    she    refer to?
candidate referents
john
mary
the park
every morning
her dog

screwdriver on wikipedia
a screwdriver is a tool, manual or powered, for turning (driving or removing) screws. a typical simple screwdriver has a handle and a shaft, and a tip that the user inserts into the screw head to turn it. the shaft is usually made of tough steel to resist bending or twisting. the tip may be hardened to resist wear, treated with a dark tip coating for improved visual contrast between tip and screw   or ridged or treated for additional 'grip'. handles are typically wood, metal, or plastic and usually hexagonal, square, or oval in cross-section to improve grip and prevent the tool from rolling when set down. some manual screwdrivers have interchangeable tips that fit into a socket on the end of the shaft and are held in mechanically or magnetically. these often have a hollow handle that contains various types and sizes of tips, and a reversible ratchet action that allows multiple full turns without repositioning the tip or the user's hand.

coreference resolution
agreement constraints
gender, number, animacy
syntactic constraints
e.g., parallelism
sentence ordering
recency
salience weights
[lappin and leass 1994, example from jurafsky and martin]
lappin and leass (cont   d)
recency handling
weights are cut in half after each sentence is processed.
examples:
an acura integra is parked in the lot. (subject)
there is an acura integra parked in the lot. (existential predicate nominal)
john parked an acura integra in the lot. (object)
john gave susan an acura integra. (indirect object)
in his acura integra, john showed susan his new cd player. (demarcated adverbial pp)
resolution of anaphora procedure (rap) 
collect the potential referents (up to four sentences back).
remove potential referents that do not agree in number or gender with the pronoun.
remove potential referents that do not pass intrasentential syntactic coreference constraints.
compute the total salience value of the referent by adding any applicable values for role parallelism (+35) or cataphora (-175).
select the referent with the highest salience value. in case of a tie, select the closest referent in terms of string position.
when moving to a new sentence, halve all scores for the existing entities on the list.

john saw a beautiful acura integra at the dealership last week. he showed it to bill. he bought it.

centering
goal: understand the local coherence of discourse
why some texts are considered more coherent
id136 load associated with badly chosen referring expressions
too much focus shift makes the text hard to understand.

centering
center: an entity that links an utterance to the next one.
the most salient centers can be used in coreference.
every utterance un has a backwards looking center cb, which connects un with the previous utterance un-1. 
every utterance also has a partially ordered set of forward looking centers cf related to the next utterance un+1. the order depends on syntax (e.g., subject>object)
the preferred center cp is the highest ranking element of cf.
