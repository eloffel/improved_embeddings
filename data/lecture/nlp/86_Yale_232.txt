feature encoding in ner
ner as sequence labeling
many nlp problems can be cast as sequence labeling problems

labeled words
classification methods
can use the categories of the previous tokens as features in classifying the next one
direction matters
ner as sequence labeling

other examples
job announcements
location, title, starting date, qualifications, salary
seminar announcements
time, title, location, speaker
medical papers
drug, disease, gene/protein, cell line, species, substance 

filling the templates
some fields get filled by text from the document
e.g., the names of people
others can be pre-defined values 
e.g., successful/unsuccessful merger
some fields allow for multiple values
perl id157
perl id157
perl id157
sample patterns
price (e.g., $14,000.00)
\$[0-9,]+(\.[0-9]{2})?
