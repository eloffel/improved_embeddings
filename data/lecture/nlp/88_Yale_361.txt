what is the meaning of: (5+2)*(4+3)?
parse tree

semantics
what if we had (5+2)*(4+z)?

mult(add(5,2),add(4,z))
what about (english) sentences?
every human is mortal.

goal
capturing the meaning of linguistic utterances using formal notation
linguistic meaning
   it is 8 pm   
pragmatic meaning
   it is time to leave   
semantic analysis: 
assign each word a meaning
combine the meanings of words into sentences
i bought a book: 
	    x,y: buying(x) ^ buyer(speaker,x) ^ boughtitem(y,x) ^ book(y)
     	buying (buyer=speaker, boughtitem=book)
representing meaning
nlp
introduction to nlp
representing and understanding meaning
understanding meaning
if an agent hears a sentence and can act accordingly, the agent is said to understand it
example
leave the book on the table
understanding may involve id136
maybe the book is wrapped in paper?
and pragmatics
which book? which table?
so, understanding may involve a procedure
properties
verifiability
can a statement be verified against a knowledge base (kb)
example: does my cat martin have whiskers?
unambiguousness
give me the book
which book?
canonical form
expressiveness
can the formalism express temporal relations, beliefs,    ?
is it domain-independent?
id136
representing meaning
one traditional approach
use logic representations, e.g., fol (first order logic)
id136
one can then use theorem proving (id136) to determine whether one statement entails another

syntax of id118
the simplest type of logic
the proposition symbols p1, p2,     are sentences
if s is a sentence,    s is a sentence (negation)
if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1     s2 is a sentence (conjunction)
if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1     s2 is a sentence (disjunction)
if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1     s2 is a sentence (implication)
if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1     s2 is a sentence (biconditional)
id118 in backus naur form
sentence     atomicsentence | complexsentence
atomicsentence     true | false | s | t | u ...
complexsentence     (sentence) 
							|    sentence
							| sentence     sentence
							| sentence     sentence
							| sentence     sentence

translating propositions to english
a = today is a holiday.
b = we are going to the park.

a     b
a        b
   a        b
   b        a
b     a
translating propositions to english
a = today is a holiday.
b = we are going to the park.

a     b 
if today is a holiday, we are going to the park.
a        b 
today is a holiday, and we are not going to the park.
   a        b
if today is not a holiday, then we are not going to the park.
   b        a
if we are not going to the park, then today is not a holiday.
b     a
if we are going to the park, then today is a holiday.


semantics of id118
     s			is true iff 	s is false  
	s1     s2		is true iff 	s1 is true and s2 is true
	s1     s2		is true iff 	s1is true or 	s2 is true
	s1     s2	is true iff	s1 is false or	s2 is true
i.e.s1     s2	is false iff	s1 is true and	s2 is false
	s1     s2	is true iff	s1   s2 is true and s2   s1 is true
recursively, one can compute the truth value of longer formulas
connectives
logical equivalence
