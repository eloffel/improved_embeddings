supervised id36
look for sentences that have two entities that we know are part of the target relation
look at the other words in the sentence, especially the ones between the two entities
use a classifier to determine whether the relation exists


example
english
beethoven was born in december 1770 in bonn
born in bonn in 1770, beethoven    
after his birth on december 16, 1770, beethoven grew up in a musical family
