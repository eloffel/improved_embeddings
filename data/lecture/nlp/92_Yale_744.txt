cats    brains and id98s


with the exception of distinguishing cucumbers from deadly snakes, cats    brains are really good at image classification. 

yann lecun et al. (1998) found that a neural network that works like a cat   s visual cortex was good at digit classification. 

when machines got powerful enough, it also turned out to be great at image classification. (krizhevsky et al. 2012)  
(don   t do this to your cat. 
it can traumatize them.)

how good are id98s? 
   we also entered a variant of this model in the ilsvrc-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.
