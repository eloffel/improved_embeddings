semantics of fol
examples with quantifiers
all cats eat fish
   x:isa(x,cat)   eatfish(x)

representing events
martin ate
martin ate in the morning
martin ate fish
martin ate fish in the morning
one possible representation
fol representations
eating1(martin)
eating2(martin,morning)
eating3(martin,fish)
eating4(martin,fish,morning)
meaning postulates
eating4(x,y,z) -> eating3(x,y)
eating4(x,y,z) -> eating2(x,z)
eating4(x,y,z) -> eating1(x)

example from jurafsky and martin
second possible representation
eating4(x,y,z)
with some arguments unspecified
problems
too many commitments
hard to combine eating4(martin,fish,z) with eating4(martin,y,morning)

example from jurafsky and martin
third possible representation
reification
    e: isa(e,eating)     eater(e,martin)     eaten(e,fish) 

example from jurafsky and martin
representing time
example
martin went from the kitchen to the yard
isa(e,going) ^ goer(e,martin) ^ origin (e,kitchen) ^ target (e,yard)
issue
no tense information: past? present? future?
fluents
a predicate that is true at a given time: t(f,t)
representing time

example from russell and norvig
representing time
example from jurafsky and martin
representing time
    i,e,w,t: isa(w,arriving)     arriver(w,speaker)     destination(w,newyork)     intervalof(w,i)     endpoint(i,e)     precedes (e,now)
    i,e,w,t: isa(w,arriving)     arriver(w,speaker)     destination(w,newyork)     intervalof(w,i)     memberof(i,now)
    i,e,w,t: isa(w,arriving)     arriver(w,speaker)     destination(w,newyork)     intervalof(w,i)     startpoint(i,s)     precedes (now,s)
example from jurafsky and martin
representing time
we fly from san francisco to boston at 10.
flight 1390 will be at the gate an hour now.
use of tenses
flight 1902 arrived late.
flight 1902 had arrived late.
   similar    tenses
when mary   s flight departed, i ate lunch
when mary   s flight departed, i had eaten lunch
reference point
example from jurafsky and martin
aspect
stative
i know my departure gate
activity
john is flying
(no particular end point)
accomplishment 
sally booked her flight
(natural end point and result in a particular state)
achievement 
she found her gate
figuring out statives:
i am needing the cheapest fare.
i am wanting to go today.
need the cheapest fare!

example from jurafsky and martin
representing beliefs
example
milo believes that martin ate fish
one possible representation
    e,b: isa(e,eating)     eater(e,martin)     eaten(e,fish)     isa(b,believing)     believer(b,milo)     believed(b,e)
however this implies (by dropping some of the terms) that    martin ate fish    (without the belief event)
modal logic
possibility, temporal logic, belief logic



representing beliefs
want, believe, imagine, know - all introduce hypothetical worlds
i believe that mary ate british food.
reified example:
    u,v: isa(u,believing)     isa(v,eating)     believer (u,speaker)     believedprop(u,v)     eater(v,mary)     eaten(v,britishfood)
however this implies also:
    u,v: isa(v,eating)     eater(v,mary)     eaten(v,britishfood)
modal operators:
believing(speaker,eating(mary,britishfood))    - not fopc!     predicates in fopc hold between objects, not between relations.
believes(speaker,     v: isa(v,eating)     eater(v,mary)     eaten(v,britishfood))
modal operators
beliefs
knowledge
assertions
issues: 
if you are interested in baseball, the red sox are playing tonight.
