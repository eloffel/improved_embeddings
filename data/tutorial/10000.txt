abstract

   in this article, we investigate the application of entity type models
   in extractive multi   document summarization using automatic caption
   generation for images of geo   located entities (e.g., westminster   abbey)
   as an application scenario. entity type models contain sets of patterns
   aiming to capture the ways geo   located entities are described in
   natural language. they are automatically derived from texts about
   geo   located entities of the same type (e.g., churches, lakes). we
   integrate entity type models into a multi   document summarizer and use
   them to address the 2 major tasks in extractive multi   document
   summarization: sentence scoring and summary composition. we experiment
   with 3 different representation methods for entity type models:
   signature words, n   gram language models, and dependency patterns. we
   evaluate the summarizer with integrated entity type models relative to
   (a) a summarizer using standard text   related features commonly used in
   text summarization and (b) the wikipedia location descriptions. our
   results show that entity type models significantly improve the quality
   of output summaries over that of summaries generated using standard
   summarization features and wikipedia summaries. the representation of
   entity type models using dependency patterns is superior to the
   representations using signature words and n   gram language models.
