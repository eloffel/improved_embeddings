abstract

   this article analyzes the appropriateness of a text summarization
   system, compendium, for generating abstracts of biomedical papers. two
   approaches are suggested: an extractive (compendium[e]), which only
   selects and extracts the most relevant sentences of the documents, and
   an abstractive-oriented one (compendium[e   a]), thus facing also the
   challenge of abstractive summarization. this novel strategy combines
   extractive information, with some pieces of information of the article
   that have been previously compressed or fused. specifically, in this
   article, we want to study: i) whether compendium produces good
   summaries in the biomedical domain; ii) which summarization approach is
   more suitable; and iii) the opinion of real users towards automatic
   summaries. therefore, two types of evaluation were performed:
   quantitative and qualitative, for evaluating both the information
   contained in the summaries, as well as the user satisfaction. results
   show that extractive and abstractive-oriented summaries perform
   similarly as far as the information they contain, so both approaches
   are able to keep the relevant information of the source documents, but
   the latter is more appropriate from a human perspective, when a user
   satisfaction assessment is carried out. this also confirms the
   suitability of our suggested approach for generating summaries
   following an abstractive-oriented paradigm.
