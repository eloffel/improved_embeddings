query relevance ranking and sentence saliency ranking are the two main tasks in extractive
query-focused summarization. previous supervised summarization systems often perform the
two tasks in isolation. however, since reference summaries are the trade-off between relevance
and saliency, using them as supervision, neither of the two rankers could be trained well. this pa-
per proposes a novel summarization system called attsum, which tackles the two tasks jointly.
it automatically learns distributed representations for sentences as well as the document clus-
ter. meanwhile, it applies the attention mechanism to simulate the attentive reading of human
behavior when a query is given. extensive experiments are conducted on duc query-focused
summarization benchmark datasets. without using any hand-crafted features, attsum achieves
competitive performance. we also observe that the sentences recognized to focus on the query
indeed meet the query need.
introduction

1
query-focused summarization (dang, 2005) aims to create a brief, well-organized and    uent summary
that answers the need of the query. it is useful in many scenarios like news services and search engines,
etc. nowadays, most summarization systems are under the extractive framework which directly selects
existing sentences to form the summary. basically, there are two major tasks in extractive query-focused
summarization, i.e., to measure the saliency of a sentence and its relevance to a user   s query.

after a long period of research, learning-based models like id28 (li et al., 2013) etc.
have become growingly popular in this area. however, most current supervised summarization systems
often perform the two tasks in isolation. usually, they design query-dependent features (e.g., query word
overlap) to learn the relevance ranking, and query-independent features (e.g., term frequency) to learn
the saliency ranking. then, the two types of features are combined to train an overall ranking model.
note that the only supervision available is the reference summaries. humans write summaries with the
trade-off between relevance and saliency. some salient content may not appear in reference summaries
if it fails to respond to the query. likewise, the content relevant to the query but not representative of
documents will be excluded either. as a result, in an isolated model, weights for neither query-dependent
nor query-independent features could be learned well from reference summaries.

in addition, when measuring the query relevance, most summarization systems merely make use of
surface features like the tf-idf cosine similarity between a sentence and the query (wan and xiao,
2009). however, relevance is not similarity. take the document cluster    d360f    in duc1 2005 as an ex-
ample. it has the following query: what are the bene   ts of drug legalization? here,    drug legalization   
are the key words with high tf-idf scores. and yet the main intent of the query is to look for    bene   t   ,
which is a very general word and does not present in the source text at all. it is not surprising that when
measured by the tf-idf cosine similarity, the sentences with top scores all contain the words    drug   
or    legalization   . nevertheless, none of them provides advantages of drug legalization. see section 4.6

for reference. apparently, even if a sentence is exactly the same as the query, it is still totally useless
in the summary because it is unable to answer the query need. therefore, the surface features are in-
adequate to measure the query relevance, which further augments the error of the whole summarization
system. this drawback partially explains why it might achieve acceptable performance to adopt generic
summarization models in the query-focused summarization task (e.g., (gillick and favre, 2009)).

intuitively, the isolation problem can be solved with a joint model. meanwhile, neural networks
have shown to generate better representations than surface features in the summarization task (cao et
al., 2015b; yin and pei, 2015). thus, a joint neural network model should be a nice solution to ex-
tractive query-focused summarization. to this end, we propose a novel summarization system called
attsum, which joints query relevance ranking and sentence saliency ranking with a neural attention
model. the attention mechanism has been successfully applied to learn alignment between various
modalities (chorowski et al., 2014; xu et al., 2015; bahdanau et al., 2014). in addition, the work of
(kobayashi et al., 2015) demonstrates that it is reasonably good to use the similarity between the sen-
tence embedding and document embedding for saliency measurement, where the document embedding
is derived from the sum pooling of sentence embeddings. in order to consider the relevance and saliency
simultaneously, we introduce the weighted-sum pooling over sentence embeddings to represent the doc-
ument, where the weight is the automatically learned query relevance of a sentence. in this way, the
id194 will be biased to the sentence embeddings which match the meaning of both
query and documents. the working mechanism of attsum is consistent with the way how humans read
when having a particular query in their minds. naturally, they pay more attention to the sentences that
meet the query need. it is noted that, unlike most previous summarization systems, our model is totally
data-driven, i.e., all the features are learned automatically.
we verify attsum on the widely-used duc 2005     2007 query-focused summarization benchmark
datasets. attsum outperforms widely-used summarization systems which rely on rich hand-crafted fea-
tures. we also conduct qualitative analysis for those sentences with large relevance scores to the query.
the result reveals that attsum indeed focuses on highly query relevant content.

the contributions of our work are as follows:
    we apply the attention mechanism that tries to simulate human attentive reading behavior for query-

focused summarization;

    we propose a joint neural network model to learn query relevance ranking and sentence saliency

ranking simultaneously.

2 query-focused sentence ranking
for generic summarization, people read the text with almost equal attention. however, given a query,
people will naturally pay more attention to the query relevant sentences and summarize the main ideas

from them. similar to human attentive reading behavior, attsum, the system to be illustrated in this
section, ranks the sentences with its focus on the query. the overall framework is shown in fig. 1. from
the bottom to up, attsum is composed of three major layers.

id98 layer use convolutional neural networks to project the sentences and queries onto the embed-

dings.

pooling layer with the attention mechanism, combine the sentence embeddings to form the document

embedding in the same latent space.

ranking layer rank a sentence according to the similarity between its embedding and the embedding

of the document cluster.

the rest of this section describes the details of the three layers.

2.1 id98 layer
convolutional neural networks (id98s) have been widely used in various natural language processing
(nlp) areas including summarization (cao et al., 2015b; yin and pei, 2015). they are able to learn
the compressed representations of id165s effectively and tackle the sentences with variable lengths
naturally. we use id98s to project both sentences and the query onto distributed representations, i.e.,

v(s) = id98(s)
v(q) = id98(q)

a basic id98 contains a convolution operation on the top of id27s, which is followed
by a pooling operation. let v(wi)     rk refer to the k-dimensional id27 corresponding
to the ith word in the sentence. assume v(wi : wi+j) to be the concatenation of id27s
t     rl  hk, which is applied to a
[v(wi),       , v(wi+j)]. a convolution operation involves a    lter wh
window of h words to produce the abstract features ch

i     rl:

ch
i = f (wh

(1)
where f (  ) is a non-linear function and the use of tanh is the common practice. to simplify, the bias
term is left out. this    lter is applied to each possible window of words in the sentence to produce
a feature map. subsequently, a pooling operation is applied over the feature map to obtain the    nal
features   ch     rl of the    lter. here we use the max-over-time pooling (collobert et al., 2011).

t    v(wi : wi+j)),

  ch = max{ch

2 ,      }

1 , ch

(2)

the idea behind it is to capture the most important features in a feature map.   ch is the output of id98
layer, i.e., the embeddings of sentences and queries.

2.2 pooling layer
with the attention mechanism, attsum uses the weighted-sum pooling over the sentence embeddings
to represent the document cluster. to achieve this aim, attsum    rstly learns the query relevance of a
sentence automatically:

r(s, q) =   (v(s)mv(q)t ),

(3)
where v(s)mv(q)t , m     rl  l is a tensor function, and    stands for the sigmoid function. the tensor
function has the power to measure the interaction between any two elements of sentence and query
embeddings. therefore, two identical embeddings will have a low score. this characteristic is exactly
what we need. to reiterate, relevance is not equivalent to similarity. then with r(s, q) as weights, we
introduce the weighted-sum pooling to calculate the document embedding v(d|q):

(cid:88)

v(d|q) =

r(s, q)v(s)

s   d

(4)

notably, a sentence embedding plays two roles, both the pooling item and the pooling weight. on
the one hand, if a sentence is highly related to the query, its pooling weight is large. on the other
hand, if a sentence is salient in the document cluster, its embedding should be representative. as a
result, the weighted-sum pooling generates the id194 which is automatically biased
to embeddings of sentences match both documents and the query.

attsum simulates human attentive reading behavior, and the attention mechanism in it has actual
meaning. the experiments to be presented in section 4.6 will demonstrate its strong ability to catch
query relevant sentences. actually, the attention mechanism has been applied in one-sentence summary
generation before (rush et al., 2015; hu et al., 2015). the success of these works, however, heavily
depends on the hand-crafted features. we believe that the attention mechanism may not be able to play
its anticipated role if it is not used appropriately.

2.3 ranking layer
since the semantics directly lies in sentence and document embeddings, we rank a sentence according to
its embedding similarity to the document cluster, following the work of (kobayashi et al., 2015). here
we adopt cosine similarity:

cos(d, s|q) =

v(s)     v(d|q)t
||v(s)||     ||v(d|q)||

(5)

compared with euclidean distance, one advantage of cosine similarity is that it is automatically scaled.
according to (k  ageb  ack et al., 2014), cosine similarity is the best metrics to measure the embedding
similarity for summarization.

in the training process, we apply the pairwise ranking strategy (collobert et al., 2011) to tune model
parameters. speci   cally, we calculate the id8-2 scores (lin, 2004) of all the sentences in the training
dataset. those sentences with high id8-2 scores are regarded as positive samples, and the rest as
negative samples. afterwards, we randomly choose a pair of positive and negative sentences which
are denoted as s+ and s   , respectively. through the id98 layer and pooling layer, we generate the
embeddings of v(s+), v(s   ) and v(d|q). we can then obtain the ranking scores of s+ and s    according
to eq. 5. with the pairwise ranking criterion, attsum should give a positive sample a higher score in
comparison with a negative sample. the cost function is de   ned as follows:

 (d, s+, s   |q)
= max(0,         cos(d, s+|q) + cos(d, s   |q)),

(6)

where     is a margin threshold. with this cost function, we can use the id119 algorithm to up-
date model parameters. in this paper, we apply the diagonal variant of adagrad with mini-batches (duchi
et al., 2011). adagrad adapts the learning rate for different parameters at different steps. thus it is less
sensitive to initial parameters than the stochastic id119.
3 sentence selection
a summary is obliged to offer both informative and non-redundant content. while attsum focuses on
sentence ranking, it employs a simple greedy algorithm, similar to the mmr strategy (carbonell and
goldstein, 1998), to select summary sentences. at    rst, we discard sentences less than 8 words like the
work of (erkan and radev, 2004). then we sort the rest in descending order according to the derived
ranking scores. finally, we iteratively dequeue the top-ranked sentence, and append it to the current
summary if it is non-redundant. a sentence is considered non-redundant if it contains signi   cantly new
bi-grams compared with the current summary content. we empirically set the cut-off of the new bi-gram
ratio to 0.5.
4 experiments
4.1 dataset
in this work, we focus on the query-focused id57 task. the experiments are
conducted on the duc 2005     2007 datasets. all the documents are from news websites and grouped

into various thematic clusters. in each cluster, there are four reference summaries created by nist asses-
sors. we use stanford corenlp2 to process the datasets, including sentence splitting and id121.
our summarization model compiles the documents in a cluster into a single document. table 1 shows the
basic information of the three datasets. we can    nd that the data sizes of duc are quite different. the
sentence number of duc 2007 is only about a half of duc 2005   s. for each cluster, a summarization
system is requested to generate a summary with the length limit of 250 words. we conduct a 3-fold
cross-validation on duc datasets, with two years of data as the training set and one year of data as the
test set.

4.2 model setting
for the id98 layer, we introduce a id27 set which is trained on a large english news corpus
(1010 tokens) with the id97 model (mikolov et al., 2013). the dimension of id27s is
set to 50, like many previous work (e.g., (collobert et al., 2011)). since the summarization dataset is
quite limited, we do not update these id27s in the training process, which greatly reduces
the model parameters to be learned. there are two hyper-parameters in our model, i.e., the word window
size h and the id98 layer dimension l. we set h = 2, which is consistent with the id8-2 evaluation.
as for l, we explore the change of model performance with l     [5, 100]. finally, we choose l = 50 for all
the rest experiments. it is the same dimension as the id27s. during the training of pairwise
ranking, we set the margin     = 0.5. the initial learning rate is 0.1 and batch size is 100.

4.3 evaluation metric
for evaluation, we adopt the widely-used automatic evaluation metric id8 (lin, 2004) 3. it measures
the summary quality by counting the overlapping units such as the id165s, word sequences and word
pairs between the peer summary and reference summaries. we take id8-2 as the main measures due
to its high capability of evaluating id54 systems (owczarzak et al., 2012). during
the training data of pairwise ranking, we also rank the sentences according to id8-2 scores.

4.4 baselines
to evaluate the summarization performance of attsum, we implement rich extractive summarization
methods. above all, we introduce two common baselines. the    rst one just selects the leading sentences
to form a summary.
it is often used as an of   cial baseline of duc, and we name it    lead   . the
other system is called    query sim   , which directly ranks sentences according to its tf-idf cosine
similarity to the query. in addition, we implement two popular extractive query-focused summarization
methods, called multimr (wan and xiao, 2009) and svr (ouyang et al., 2011). multimr is a graph-
based manifold ranking method which makes uniform use of the sentence-to-sentence relationships and
the sentence-to-query relationships. svr extracts both query-dependent and query-independent features
and applies support vector regression to learn feature weights. note that multimr is unsupervised while
svr is supervised. since our model is totally data-driven, we introduce a recent summarization system
docemb (kobayashi et al., 2015) that also just use deep neural network features to rank sentences.
it initially works for generic summarization and we supplement the query information to compute the
id194.

to verify the effectiveness of the joint model, we design a baseline called isolation, which per-
forms saliency ranking and relevance ranking in isolation. speci   cally, it directly uses the sum pool-
ing over sentence embeddings to represent the document cluster. therefore, the embedding similarity
between a sentence and the document cluster could only measure the sentence saliency. to include
the query information, we supplement the common hand-crafted feature tf-idf cosine similarity to
the query. this query-dependent feature, together with the embedding similarity, are used in sentence
ranking. isolation removes the attention mechanism, and mixtures hand-crafted and automatically
learned features. all these methods adopt the same sentence selection process illustrated in section 3
for a fair comparison.

4.5 summarization performance
the id8 scores of the different summarization methods are presented in table 2. we consider
id8-2 as the main id74, and also provide the id8-1 results as the common prac-
tice. as can be seen, attsum always enjoys a reasonable increase over isolation, indicating that the
joint model indeed takes effects. with respect to other methods, attsum largely outperforms two base-
lines (lead and query sim) and the unsupervised neural network model docemb. although attsum
is totally data-driven, its performance is better than the widely-used summarization systems multimr
and svr. it is noted that svr heavily depends on hand-crafted features. nevertheless, attsum almost
outperforms svr all the time. the only exception is duc 2005 where attsum is slightly inferior to
svr in terms of id8-2. over-   tting is a possible reason. table 1 demonstrates the data size of duc
2005 is highly larger than the other two. as a result, when using the 3-fold cross-validation, the number
of training data for duc 2005 is the smallest among the three years. the lack of training data impedes
the learning of sentence and document embeddings.

it is interesting that isolation achieves competitive performance but docemb works terribly. the
pre-trained id27s seem not to be able to measure the sentence saliency directly. in compari-
son, our model can learn the sentence saliency well.

4.6 query relevance performance
we check the feature weights in svr and    nd the query-dependent features hold extremely small
weights. without these features, the performance of svr only drops 1%. therefore, svr fails to
learn query relevance well. the comparison of attsum and isolation has shown that our method

can learn better query relevance than hand-crafted features. in this section, we perform the qualitative
analysis to inspect what attsum actually catches according to the learned query relevance. we randomly
choose some queries in the test datasets and calculate the relevance scores of sentences according to
eq. 3. we then extract the top ranked sentences and check whether they are able to meet the query need.
examples for both one-sentence queries and multiple-sentence queries are shown in table 3. we also
give the sentences with top tf-idf cosine similarity to the query for comparison.

with manual inspection, we    nd that most query-focused sentences in attsum can answer the query
to a large extent. for instance, when asked to tell the advantages of drug legalization, attsum catches the
sentences about drug traf   cking prevention, the control of marijuana use, and the economic effectiveness,
etc. all these aspects are mentioned in reference summaries. the sentences with the high tf-idf
similarity, however, are usually short and simply repeat the key words in the query. the advantage of
attsum over tf-idf similarity is apparent in query relevance ranking.

when there are multiple sentences in a query, attsum may only focus on a part of them. take the
second query in table 3 as an example. although the responses to all the four query sentences are
involved more or less, we can see that attsum tends to describe the steps of wetland preservation more.
actually, by inspection, the reference summaries do not treat the query sentences equally either. for
this query, they only tell a little about frustrations during wetland preservation. since attsum projects a
query onto a single embedding, it may augment the bias in reference summaries. it seems to be hard even
for humans to read attentively when there are a number of needs in a query. because only a small part
of duc datasets contains such a kind of complex queries, we do not purposely design a special model
to handle them in our current work.

5.1 extractive summarization
work on extractive summarization spans a large range of approaches. starting with unsupervised meth-
ods, one of the widely known approaches is maximum marginal relevance (mmr) (carbonell and
goldstein, 1998). it used a greedy approach to select sentences and considered the trade-off between
saliency and redundancy. good results could be achieved by reformulating this as an integer linear
programming (ilp) problem which was able to    nd the optimal solution (mcdonald, 2007; gillick and
favre, 2009). graph-based models played a leading role in the extractive summarization area, due to its
ability to re   ect various sentence relationships. for example, (wan and xiao, 2009) adopted manifold
ranking to make use of the within-document sentence relationships, the cross-document sentence rela-
tionships and the sentence-to-query relationships. in contrast to these unsupervised approaches, there
are also various learning-based summarization systems. different classi   ers have been explored, e.g.,
conditional random    eld (crf) (galley, 2006), support vector regression (svr) (ouyang et al., 2011),
and id28 (li et al., 2013), etc.

many query-focused summarizers are heuristic extensions of generic summarization methods by in-
corporating the information of the given query. a variety of query-dependent features were de   ned
to measure the relevance, including tf-idf cosine similarity (wan and xiao, 2009), id138 similar-
ity (ouyang et al., 2011), and word co-occurrence (prasad pingali and varma, 2007), etc. however, these
features usually reward sentences similar to the query, which fail to meet the query need.

5.2 deep learning in summarization
in the summarization area, the application of deep learning techniques has attracted more and more
interest. (genest et al., 2011) used unsupervised auto-encoders to represent both manual and system
summaries for the task of summary evaluation. their method, however, did not surpass id8. re-
cently, some works (cao et al., 2015a; cao et al., 2015b) have tried to use neural networks to complement
sentence ranking features. although these models achieved the state-of-the-art performance, they still
heavily relied on hand-crafted features. a few researches explored to directly measure similarity based
on distributed representations. (yin and pei, 2015) trained a language model based on convolutional
neural networks to project sentences onto distributed representations. (cheng and lapata, 2016) treated
single document summarization as a sequence labeling task and modeled it by the recurrent neural net-
works. others like (kobayashi et al., 2015; k  ageb  ack et al., 2014) just used the sum of trained word
embeddings to represent sentences or documents.

in addition to extractive summarization, deep learning technologies have also been applied to com-
pressive and abstractive summarization. (filippova et al., 2015) used id27s and long short
term memory models (lstms) to output readable and informative sentence compressions. (rush et
al., 2015; hu et al., 2015) leveraged the neural attention model (bahdanau et al., 2014) in the machine
translation area to generate one-sentence summaries. we have described these methods in section 2.2.

6 conclusion and future work

this paper proposes a novel query-focused summarization system called attsum which jointly han-
dles saliency ranking and relevance ranking. it automatically generates distributed representations for
sentences as well as the document cluster. meanwhile, it applies the attention mechanism that tries to
simulate human attentive reading behavior when a query is given. we conduct extensive experiments on
duc query-focused summarization datasets. using no hand-crafted features, attsum achieves competi-
tive performance. it is also observed that the sentences recognized to focus on the query indeed meet the
query need.

since we have obtained the semantic representations for the document cluster, we believe our system
can be easily extended into abstractive summarization. the only additional step is to integrate a neural
language model after document embeddings. we leave this as our future work.
