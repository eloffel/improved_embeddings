abstract

we show how eye-tracking corpora can be
used to improve sentence compression mod-
els, presenting a novel id72 al-
gorithm based on multi-layer lstms. we ob-
tain performance competitive with or better
than state-of-the-art approaches.

introduction

1
sentence compression is a basic operation in text
simpli   cation which has the potential to improve
id151 and automatic sum-
marization (berg-kirkpatrick et al., 2011; klerke et
al., 2015), as well as helping poor readers in need of
assistive technologies (canning et al., 2000). this
work suggests using eye-tracking recordings for im-
proving sentence compression for text simpli   cation
systems and is motivated by two observations: (i)
sentence compression is the task of automatically
making sentences easier to process by shortening
them. (ii) eye-tracking measures such as    rst-pass
reading time and time spent on regressions, i.e., dur-
ing second and later passes over the text, are known
to correlate with perceived text dif   culty (rayner et
al., 2012).

these two observations recently lead klerke et
al. (2015) to suggest using eye-tracking measures as
metrics in text simpli   cation. we go beyond this by
suggesting that eye-tracking recordings can be used
to induce better models for sentence compression
for text simpli   cation. speci   cally, we show how
to use existing eye-tracking recordings to improve
the induction of long short-term memory models
(lstms) for sentence compression.

our proposed model does not require that the gaze
data and the compression data come from the same
source. indeed, in this work we use gaze data from
readers of the dundee corpus to improve sentence
compression results on several datasets. while not
explored here, an intriguing potential of this work
is in deriving sentence simpli   cation models that
are personalized for individual users, based on their
reading behavior.

several approaches to sentence compression have
been proposed, from id87s (knight
and marcu, 2002) over conditional random    elds
(elming et al., 2013) to tree-to-tree machine trans-
lation models (woodsend and lapata, 2011). more
recently, filippova et al. (2015) successfully used
lstms for sentence compression on a large scale
parallel dataset. we do not review the literature here,
and only compare to filippova et al. (2015).
our contributions

    we present a novel id72 ap-
proach to sentence compression using labelled
data for sentence compression and a disjoint
eye-tracking corpus.

    our method is fully competitive with state-of-

the-art across three corpora.

    our code is made publicly available at
https://bitbucket.org/soegaard/
gaze-mtl16.

2 gaze during reading
readers    xate longer at rare words, words that are
semantically ambiguous, and words that are mor-

phologically complex (rayner et al., 2012). these
are also words that are likely to be replaced with
simpler ones in sentence simpli   cation, but it is not
clear that they are words that would necessarily be
removed in the context of sentence compression.

demberg and keller (2008) show that syntac-
tic complexity (measured as dependency locality) is
also an important predictor of reading time. phrases
that are often removed in sentence compression   
like fronted phrases, parentheticals,    oating quanti-
   ers, etc.   are often associated with non-local de-
pendencies. also, there is evidence that people are
more likely to    xate on the    rst word in a con-
stituent than on its second word (hy  on  a and pol-
latsek, 2000). being able to identify constituent
borders is important for sentence compression, and
reading    xation data may help our model learn a rep-
resentation of our data that makes it easy to identify
constituent boundaries.

in the experiments below, we learn models to pre-
dict the    rst pass duration of word    xations and the
total duration of regressions to a word. these two
measures constitute a perfect separation of the to-
tal reading time of each word split between the    rst
pass and subsequent passes. both measures are de-
scribed below. they are both discretized into six
bins as follows with only non-zero values contribut-
ing to the calculation of the standard deviation (sd):

0: measure = 0 or
1: measure < 1 sd below reader   s average or
2: measure < .5 sd below reader   s average or
3: measure < .5 above reader   s average or
4: measure > .5 sd above reader   s average or
5: measure > 1 sd above reader   s average

first pass duration measures the total time spent
reading a word    rst time it is    xated, including
any immediately following re-   xations of the same
word. this measure correlates with word length, fre-
quency and ambiguity because long words are likely
to attract several    xations in a row unless they are
particularly easily predicted or recognized. this ef-
fect arises because long words are less likely to    t
inside the fovea of the eye. note that for this mea-
sure the value 0 indicates that the word was not    x-
ated by this reader.

regression duration measures the total
time
spent    xating a word after the gaze has already left
it once. this measure belongs to the group of late
measures, i.e., measures that are sensitive to the later
cognitive processing stages including interpretation
and integration of already decoded words. since
the reader by de   nition has already had a chance to
recognize the word, regressions are associated with
semantic confusion and contradiction, incongruence
and syntactic complexity, as famously experienced
in garden path sentences. for this measure the value
0 indicates that the word was read at most once by
this reader.

see table 1 for an example of    rst pass duration
and regression duration annotations for one reader
and sentence.

prediction and id35-tag prediction are auxiliary training tasks,

3 sentence compression using multi-task

deep bi-lstms

most recent approaches to sentence compression
make use of syntactic analysis, either by operating
directly on trees (riezler et al., 2003; nomoto, 2007;
filippova and strube, 2008; cohn and lapata, 2008;
cohn and lapata, 2009) or by incorporating syn-
tactic information in their model (mcdonald, 2006;
clarke and lapata, 2008). recently, however, filip-
pova et al. (2015) presented an approach to sentence
compression using lstms with id27s,
but without syntactic features. we introduce a third
way of using syntactic annotation by jointly learning
a sequence model for predicting id35 supertags, in
addition to our gaze and compression models.

bi-directional

recurrent neural networks (bi-
id56s) read in sequences in both regular and re-
versed order, enabling conditioning predictions on
both left and right context. in the forward pass, we
run the input data through an embedding layer and
compute the predictions of the forward and back-
ward states at layers 0, 1, . . ., until we compute the
softmax predictions for word i based on a linear
transformation of the concatenation of the of stan-
dard and reverse id56 outputs for location i. we
then calculate the objective function derivative for
the sequence using cross-id178 (logistic loss) and
use id26 to calculate gradients and up-
date the weights accordingly. a deep bi-id56 or k-
layered bi-id56 is composed of k bi-id56s that feed
into each other such that the output of the ith id56
is the input of the i + 1th id56. lstms (hochreiter
and schmidhuber, 1997) replace the cells of id56s
with lstm cells, in which multiplicative gate units
learn to open and close access to the error signal.

bi-lstms have already been used for    ne-
grained id31 (liu et al., 2015), syntac-
tic chunking (huang et al., 2015), and semantic role
labeling (zhou and xu, 2015). these and other re-
cent applications of bi-lstms were constructed for
solving a single task in isolation, however. we in-
stead train deep bi-lstms to solve additional tasks
to sentence compression, namely id35-tagging and
gaze prediction, using the additional tasks to regu-
larize our sentence compression model.

speci   cally, we use bi-lstms with three lay-
ers. our baseline model is simply this three-layered

model trained to predict compressions (encoded as
label sequences), and we consider two extensions
thereof as illustrated in figure 2. our    rst exten-
sion, multi-task-lstm, includes the gaze pre-
diction task during training, with a separate logistic
regression classi   er for this purpose; and the other,
cascaded-lstm, predicts gaze measures from
the inner layer. our second extension, which is su-
perior to our    rst, is basically a one-layer bi-lstm
for predicting reading    xations with a two-layer bi-
lstm on top for predicting sentence compressions.
at each step in the training process of multi-
task-lstmand cascaded-lstm, we choose a
random task, followed by a random training instance
of this task. we use the deep lstm to predict a label
sequence, suffer a loss with respect to the true labels,
and update the model parameters. in cascaded-
lstm, the update for an instance of id35 super tag-
ging or gaze prediction only affects the parameters
of the inner lstm layer.

both multi-task-lstm and cascaded-
lstm do id72 (caruana, 1993). in
id72, the induction of a model for one
task is used as a regularizer on the induction of a
model for another task. caruana (1993) did multi-
task learning by doing parameter sharing across sev-
eral deep networks, letting them share hidden layers;
a technique also used by collobert et al. (2011) for
various nlp tasks. these models train task-speci   c
classi   ers on the output of deep networks (informed
by the task-speci   c losses). we extend their models
by moving to sequence prediction and allowing the
task-speci   c sequence models to also be deep mod-
els.

4 experiments

4.1 gaze data
we use the dundee corpus (kennedy et al., 2003) as
our eye-tracking corpus with id121 and mea-
sures similar to the dundee treebank (barrett et al.,
2015). the corpus contains eye-tracking recordings
of ten native english-speaking subjects reading 20
newspaper articles from the independent. we use
data from nine subjects for training and one subject
for development. we do not evaluate the gaze pre-
diction because the task is only included as a way of
regularizing the compression model.

4.2 compression data
we use three different
sentence compression
datasets, ziff-davis (knight and marcu, 2002),
broadcast (clarke and lapata, 2006), and the
publically available subset of google (filippova et
al., 2015). the    rst two consist of manually com-
pressed newswire text in english, while the third is
built heuristically from pairs of headlines and    rst
sentences from newswire, resulting in the most ag-
gressive compressions, as exempli   ed in table 1.
we present the dataset characteristics in table 2. we
use the datasets as released by the authors and do
not apply any additional pre-processing. the id35
id55 data comes from id35bank,1 and we
use sections 0-18 for training and section 19 for de-
velopment.

4.3 baselines and system
both the baseline and our systems are three-layer
bi-lstm models trained for 30 iterations with pre-
trained (senna) embeddings. the input and hid-
den layers are 50 dimensions, and at the output
layer we predict sequences of two labels, indicating
whether to delete the labeled word or not. our base-
line (baseline-lstm) is a id72

1http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/id35/

bi-lstm predicting both id35 supertags and sen-
tence compression (word deletion) at the outer layer.
our    rst extension is multitask-lstm predict-
ing id35 supertags, sentence compression, and read-
ing measures from the outer layer. cascaded-
lstm, on the other hand, predicts id35 supertags
and reading measures from the initial layer, and sen-
tence compression at the outer layer.

4.4 results and discussion
our results are presented in table 3. we observe
that across all three datasets,
including all three
annotations of broadcast, gaze features lead to
improvements over our baseline 3-layer bi-lstm.
also, cascaded-lstm is consistently better than
multitask-lstm. our models are fully compet-
itive with state-of-the-art models. for example, the
best model in elming et al. (2013) achieves 0.7207
on ziff-davis, clarke and lapata (2008) achieves
0.7509 on broadcast,2 and the lstm model in
filippova et al. (2015) achieves 0.80 on google
with much more training data. the high numbers on
the small subset of google re   ects that newswire
headlines tend to have a fairly predictable relation to

2on a    randomly selected    annotator; unfortunately, they do
not say which. james clarke (p.c) does not remember which
annotator they used.

table 3: results (f1). for all three datasets, the inclusion of gaze measures (   rst pass duration (fp) and regression duration (regr.))
leads to improvements over the baseline. all models include id35-id55 as an auxiliary task. note that broadcastwas
annotated by three annotators. the three columns are, from left to right, results on annotators 1   3.

the    rst sentence. with the harder datasets, the im-
pact of the gaze information becomes stronger, con-
sistently favouring the cascaded architecture, and
with improvements using both    rst pass duration
and regression duration, the late measure associated
with interpretation of content. our results indicate
that id72 can help us take advantage
of inherently noisy human processing data across
tasks and thereby maybe reduce the need for task-
speci   c data collection.
