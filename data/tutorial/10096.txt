abstract

we study the problem of generating abstrac-
tive summaries for opinionated text. we pro-
pose an attention-based neural network model
that is able to absorb information from multi-
ple text units to construct informative, concise,
and    uent summaries. an importance-based
sampling method is designed to allow the en-
coder to integrate information from an impor-
tant subset of input. automatic evaluation in-
dicates that our system outperforms state-of-
the-art abstractive and extractive summariza-
tion systems on two newly collected datasets
of movie reviews and arguments. our system
summaries are also rated as more informative
and grammatical in human evaluation.

introduction

collecting opinions from others is an integral part
of our daily activities. discovering what other peo-
ple think can help us navigate through different as-
pects of life, ranging from making decisions on reg-
ular tasks to judging fundamental societal issues and
forming personal ideology. to ef   ciently absorb the
massive amount of opinionated information, there is
a pressing need for automated systems that can gen-
erate concise and    uent opinion summary about an
entity or a topic. in spite of substantial researches
in opinion summarization, the most prominent ap-
proaches mainly rely on extractive summarization
methods, where phrases or sentences from the origi-
nal documents are selected for inclusion in the sum-
mary (hu and liu, 2004; lerman et al., 2009). one
of the problems that extractive methods suffer from

movie: the martian
reviews:
- one the smartest, sweetest, and most satisfyingly suspenseful
sci-       lms in years.
- ...an intimate sci-    epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring.
- the martian is a thrilling, human and moving sci-    picture
that is easily the most emotionally engaging    lm ridley scott
has made...
- it   s pretty sunny and often funny, a space oddity for a director
not known for pictures with a sense of humor.
- the martian highlights the book   s best qualities, tones down
its worst, and adds its own style...
opinion consensus (summary): smart, thrilling, and sur-
prisingly funny, the martian offers a faithful adaptation of
the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man
matt damon and director ridley scott.
topic: this house supports the death penalty.
arguments:
- the state has a responsibility to protect the lives of innocent
citizens, and enacting the death penalty may save lives by re-
ducing the rate of violent crime.
- while the prospect of life in prison may be frightening, surely
death is a more daunting prospect.
- a 1985 study by stephen k. layson at the university of north
carolina showed that a single execution deters 18 murders.
- reducing the wait time on death row prior to execution can
dramatically increase its deterrent effect in the united states.
claim (summary): the death penalty deters crime.
figure 1: examples for an opinion consensus of pro-
fessional reviews (critics) about movie    the martian    from
www.rottentomatoes.com, and a claim about    death

tent with similar meaning is highlighted in the same color.

is that they unavoidably include secondary or redun-
dant information. on the contrary, abstractive sum-
marization methods, which are able to generate text
beyond the original input, can produce more coher-
ent and concise summaries.

in this paper, we present an attention-based neu-
ral network model for generating abstractive sum-
maries of opinionated text. our system takes as in-
put a set of text units containing opinions about the
same topic (e.g. reviews for a movie, or arguments

for a controversial social issue), and then outputs a
one-sentence abstractive summary that describes the
opinion consensus of the input.

speci   cally, we investigate our abstract genera-
tion model on two types of opinionated text: movie
reviews and arguments on controversial topics. ex-
amples are displayed in figure 1. the    rst exam-
ple contains a set of professional reviews (or crit-
ics) about movie    the martian    and an opinion con-
sensus written by an editor. it would be more use-
ful to automatically generate    uent opinion consen-
sus rather than simply extracting features (e.g. plot,
music, etc) and opinion phrases as done in previous
summarization work (zhuang et al., 2006; li et al.,
2010). the second example lists a set of arguments
on    death penalty   , where each argument supports
the central claim    death penalty deters crime   . ar-
guments, as a special type of opinionated text, con-
tain reasons to persuade or inform people on certain
issues. given a set of arguments on the same topic,
we aim at investigating the capability of our abstract
generation system for the novel task of claim gener-
ation.

existing abstract generation systems for opinion-
ated text mostly take an approach that    rst identi-
   es salient phrases, and then merges them into sen-
tences (bing et al., 2015; ganesan et al., 2010).
those systems are not capable of generating new
words, and the output summary may suffer from
ungrammatical structure. another line of work re-
quires a large amount of human input to enforce
summary quality. for example, gerani et al. (2014)
utilize a set of templates constructed by human,
which are    lled by extracted phrases to generate
grammatical sentences that serve different discourse
functions.

to address the challenges above, we propose to
use an attention-based abstract generation model    
a data-driven approach trained to generate informa-
tive, concise, and    uent opinion summaries. our
method is based on the recently proposed frame-
work of neural encoder-decoder models (kalchbren-
ner and blunsom, 2013; sutskever et al., 2014a),
which translates a sentence in a source language
into a target language. different from previous
work, our summarization system is designed to sup-
port multiple input text units. an attention-based
model (bahdanau et al., 2014) is deployed to al-

low the encoder to automatically search for salient
information within context. furthermore, we pro-
pose an importance-based sampling method so that
the encoder can integrate information from an im-
portant subset of input text. the importance score
of a text unit is estimated from a novel regression
model with pairwise preference-based regularizer.
with importance-based sampling, our model can be
trained within manageable time, and is still able to
learn from diversi   ed input.

we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
two newly collected datasets for movie reviews and
arguments. automatic evaluation by id7 (pap-
ineni et al., 2002) indicates that our system outper-
forms the state-of-the-art extract-based and abstract-
based methods on both tasks. for example, we
achieved a id7 score of 24.88 on rotten toma-
toes movie reviews, compared to 19.72 by an ab-
stractive opinion summarization system from gane-
san et al. (2010). id8 evaluation (lin and hovy,
2003) also indicates that our system summaries have
reasonable information coverage. human judges
further rated our summaries to be more informative
and grammatical than compared systems.

2 data collection

we collected two datasets for movie reviews
and arguments on controversial topics with gold-
standard abstracts.1
rotten tomatoes (www.
rottentomatoes.com) is a movie review web-
site that aggregates both professional critics and
user-generated reviews (henceforth rottentoma-
toes). for each movie, a one-sentence critic con-
sensus is constructed by an editor to summarize the
opinions in professional critics. we crawled 246,164
critics and their opinion consensus for 3,731 movies
(i.e. around 66 reviews per movie on average). we
select 2,458 movies for training, 536 movies for val-
idation and 737 movies for testing. the opinion con-
sensus is treated as the gold-standard summary.

we also collect an argumentation dataset from
idebate.org (henceforth idebate), which is a
wikipedia-style website for gathering pro and con
arguments on controversial issues. the arguments
under each debate (or topic) are organized into dif-

1the datasets can be downloaded from http://www.

ccs.neu.edu/home/luwang/.

ferent    for    and    against    points. each point con-
tains a one-sentence central claim constructed by the
editors to summarize the corresponding arguments,
and is treated as the gold-standard. for instance, on
a debate about    death penalty   , one claim is    the
death penalty deters crime    with an argument    en-
acting the death penalty may save lives by reducing
the rate of violent crime    (figure 1). we crawled
676 debates with 2,259 claims. we treat each sen-
tence as an argument, which results in 17,359 argu-
ments in total. 450 debates are used for training, 67
debates for validation, and 150 debates for testing.

3 the neural network-based abstract

generation model

in this section, we    rst de   ne our problem in sec-
tion 3.1, followed by model description.
in gen-
eral, we utilize a long short-term memory network
for generating abstracts (section 3.2) from a latent
representation computed by an attention-based en-
coder (section 3.3). the encoder is designed to
search for relevant information from input to bet-
ter inform the abstract generation process. we also
discuss an importance-based sampling method to al-
low encoder to integrate information from an impor-
tant subset of input (sections 3.4 and 3.5). post-
processing (section 3.6) is conducted to re-rank the
generations and pick the best one as the    nal sum-
mary.

3.1 problem formulation
in summarization, the goal is to generate a summary
y, composed by the sequence of words y1, ...,|y|.
unlike previous neural encoder-decoder approaches
which decode from only one input, our input con-
sists of an arbitrary number of reviews or arguments
(henceforth text units wherever there is no ambigu-
ity), denoted as x = {x1, ..., xm}. each text unit xk
is composed by a sequence of words xk
1, ..., xk|xk|.
each word takes the form of a representation vector,
which is initialized randomly or by pre-trained em-
beddings (mikolov et al., 2013), and updated during
training. the summarization task is de   ned as    nd-
ing   y, which is the most likely sequence of words
  y1, ...,   yn such that:

  y = argmaxy log p (y|x)

(1)

where log p (y|x) denotes the conditional
log-
likelihood of the output sequence y, given the input
text units x. in the next sections, we describe the
attention model used to model log p (y|x).
3.2 decoder
similar as previous work (sutskever et al., 2014b;
bahdanau et al., 2014), we decompose log p (y|x)
into a sequence of word-level predictions:

log p (y|x) =

log p (yj|y1, ..., yj   1, x)

(2)

(cid:88)

j=1,...,|y|

where each word yj is predicted conditional on the
previously generated y1, ..., yj   1 and input x. the
id203 is estimated by standard word softmax:

p(yj|y1, ..., yj   1, x) = sof tmax(hj)

(3)

hj is the recurrent neural networks (id56s) state
variable at timestamp j, which is modeled as:

hj = g(yj   1, hj   1, s)

(4)

here g is a recurrent update function for generating
the new state hj from the representation of previ-
ously generated word yj   1 (obtained from a word
lookup table), the previous state hj   1, and the input
text representation s (see section 3.3).

in this work, we implement g using a long short-
term memory (lstm) network (hochreiter and
schmidhuber, 1997), which has been shown to be ef-
fective at capturing long range dependencies. here
we summarize the update rules for lstm cells, and
refer readers to the original work (hochreiter and
schmidhuber, 1997) for more details. given an ar-
bitrary input vector uj at timestamp j     1 and the
previous state hj   1, a typical lstm de   nes the fol-
lowing update rules:

ij =   (wiuuj + wihhj   1 + wiccj   1 + bi)
fj =   (wf uuj + wf hhj   1 + wf ccj   1 + bf )
cj = fj (cid:12) cj   1 + ij (cid:12) tanh(wcuuj + wchhj   1 + bc)
oj =   (wouuj + wohhj   1 + woccj + bo)
hj = oj (cid:12) tanh(cj)

(5)

   is component-wise logistic sigmoid function, and
(cid:12) denotes hadamard product. projection matrices

w       and biases b    are parameters to be learned dur-
ing training.

long range dependencies are captured by the cell
memory cj, which is updated linearly to avoid the
vanishing gradient problem. it is accomplished by
predicting two vectors ij and fj, which determine
what to keep and what to forget from the current
timestamp. vector oj then decides on what infor-
mation from the new cell memory cj can be passed
to the new state hj. finally, the model concatenates
the representation of previous output word yj   1 and
the input representation s (see section 3.3) as uj,
which serves as the input at each timestamp.

3.3 encoder
the representation of input text units s is computed
using an attention model (bahdanau et al., 2014).
given a single text unit x1, ..., x|x| and the previous
state hj, the model generates s as a weighted sum:

aibi

(6)

(cid:88)

i=1,...,|x|

where ai is the attention coef   cient obtained for
word xi, and bi is the context dependent repre-
sentation of xi.
in our work, we construct bi by
building a bidirectional lstm over the whole in-
put sequence x1, ..., x|x| and then combining the for-
ward and backward states. formally, we use the
lstm formulation from eq. 5 to generate the for-
ward states hf
1 , ..., hf|x| by setting uj = xj (the pro-
jection word xj using a word lookup table). like-
wise, the backward states hb|x|, ..., hb
1 are generated
using a backward lstm by feeding the input in the
reverse order, that is, uj = x|x|   j+1. the coef   -
cients ai are computed with a softmax over all input:

ai = sof tmax(v(bi, hj   1))

(7)
where function v computes the af   nity of each
word xi and the current output context hj   1    
how likely the input word is to be used to gener-
ate the next word in summary. we set v(bi, hj   1) =
ws    tanh(wcgbi + whghj   1), where w    and w      
are parameters to be learned.

3.4 attention over multiple inputs
a key distinction between our model and ex-
isting sequence-to-sequence models
(sutskever
et al., 2014b; bahdanau et al., 2014) is that

1, ..., xk|xk|}n

given an input of n text units,

input consists of multiple separate text
our
i.e.
units.
{xk
k=1, a simple extension would be
to concatenate them into one sequence as z =
1 , ..., xn|xn|,
1, ..., x1|x1|, seg, x2
x1
where seg is a special token that delimits inputs.

1, ..., x2|x2|, seg, xn

however, there are two problems with this ap-
proach. firstly, the model is sensitive to the order
of text units. moreover, z may contain thousands of
words. this will become a bottleneck for our model
with a training time of o(n|z|), since attention co-
ef   cients must be computed for all input words to
generate each output word.

we address these two problems by sub-sampling
from the input. the intuition is that even though the
number of input text units is large, many of them
are redundant or contain secondary information. as
our task is to emphasize the main points made in the
input, some of them can be removed without los-
ing too much information. therefore, we de   ne an
importance score f (xk)     [0, 1] for each document
xk (see section 3.5). during training, k candidates
are sampled from a multinomial distribution which
is constructed by normalizing f (xk) for input text
units. notice that the training process goes over the
training set multiple times, and our model is still
able to learn from more than k text units. for test-
ing, top-k candidates with the highest importance
scores are collapsed in descending order into z.

3.5

importance estimation

we now describe the importance estimation model,
which outputs importance scores for text units. in
general, we start with a ridge regression model,
and add a regularizer to enforce the separation of
summary-worthy text units from others.
given a cluster of text units {x1, ..., xm} and their
summary y, we compute the number of overlapping
content words between each text unit and summary
y as its gold-standard importance score. the scores
are uniformly normalized to [0, 1]. each text unit xk
is represented as an d   dimensional feature vector
rk     rd, with label lk. text units in the training data
are thus denoted with a feature matrix   r and a label
vector   l. we aim at learning f (xk) = rk   w by mini-
mizing ||   rw       l||2
2. this is a standard
formulation for ridge regression, and we use fea-

2 +       ||w||2

units:     (cid:80)t (cid:80)

tures in table 1. furthermore, pairwise preference
constraints have been utilized for learning ranking
models (joachims, 2002). we then consider adding
a pairwise preference-based regularizing constraint
to incorporate a bias towards summary-worthy text
xp,xq   t ,lp>0,lq=0 ||(rp     rq)   w    1||2
2,
where t is a cluster of text units to be summa-
rized. term (rp     rq)    w enforces the separation
of summary-worthy text from the others. we further
construct   r(cid:48) to contain all the pairwise differences
(rp     rq).   l(cid:48) is a vector of the same size as   r(cid:48) with
each element as 1. the objective function becomes:

2 +     ||   r(cid:48)w      l(cid:48)||2

j(w) = ||   rw      l||2
2 (8)
  ,    are tuned on development set. with      =       id
and      =       i|r(cid:48)|, closed-form solution for   w is:

2 +     ||w||2

  w = (   rt   r +   r(cid:48)t       r(cid:48) +     )   1(   rt   l +   r(cid:48)t      l(cid:48)) (9)

3.6 post-processing
for testing phase, we re-rank the n-best summaries
according to their cosine similarity with the input
text units. the one with the highest similarity is in-
cluded in the    nal summary. uses of more sophis-
ticated re-ranking methods (charniak and johnson,
2005; konstas and lapata, 2012) will be investi-
gated in future work.

4 experimental setup
data pre-processing. we pre-process the datasets
with stanford corenlp (manning et al., 2014) for
id121 and extracting pos tags and depen-
dency relations. for rottentomatoes dataset, we re-
place movie titles with a generic label in training,
and substitute it with the movie name if there is any
generic label generated in testing.

pre-trained embeddings and features. the size
of word representation is set to 300, both for in-
put and output words. these can be initialized
randomly or using pre-trained embeddings learned
from google news (mikolov et al., 2013). we also
extend our model with additional features described
in table 2. discrete features, such as pos tags, are
mapped into word representation via lookup tables.
for continuous features (e.g tf-idf scores), they
are attached to word vectors as additional values.

hyper-parameters and stop criterion. the
lstms (equation 5) for the decoder and encoders
are de   ned with states and cells of 150 dimensions.
the attention of each input word and state pair is
computed by being projected into a vector of 100
dimensions (equation 6).

training is performed via adagrad (duchi et al.,
2011). it terminates when performance does not im-
prove on the development set. we use id7 (up to
4-grams) (papineni et al., 2002) as evaluation met-
ric, which computes the precision of id165s in gen-
erated summaries with gold-standard abstracts as the
reference. finally, the importance-based sampling
rate (k) is set to 5 for experiments in sections 5.2
and 5.3.

decoding is performed by id125 with a
beam size of 20, i.e. we keep 20 most probable out-
put sequences in stack at each step. outputs with
end of sentence token are also considered for
re-ranking. decoding stops when every beam in
stack generates the end of sentence token.

importance estimation evaluation

5.1
we    rst evaluate the importance estimation compo-
nent described in section 3.5. we compare with
support vector regression (svr) (smola and vap-
nik, 1997) and two baselines: (1) a length baseline
that ranks text units based on their length, and (2)
a centroid baseline that ranks text units according

to their centroidness, which is computed as the co-
sine similarity between a text unit and centroid of the
cluster to be summarized (erkan and radev, 2004).

figure 2: evaluation of importance estimation by mean re-
ciprocal rank (mrr), and normalized discounted cumulative
gain at top 3 and 5 returned results (ndcg@3 and ndcg@5).
our regression model with pairwise preference-based regular-
izer uniformly outperforms baseline systems on both datasets.

we evaluate using mean reciprocal rank (mrr),
and normalized discounted cumulative gain at top 3
and 5 returned results (ndcg@3). text units are
considered relevant if they have at least one overlap-
ping content word with the gold-standard summary.
from figure 2, we can see that our importance es-
timation model produces uniformly better ranking
performance on both datasets.

5.2 automatic summary evaluation

for automatic summary evaluation, we consider
three popular metrics. id8 (lin and hovy,
2003) is employed to evaluate id165s recall of
the summaries with gold-standard abstracts as ref-
erence. id8-su4 (measures unigram and skip-
bigrams separated by up to four words) is reported.
we also utilize id7, a precision-based metric,
which has been used to evaluate various language
generation systems (chiang, 2005; angeli et al.,
2010; karpathy and fei-fei, 2014). we further
consider meteor (denkowski and lavie, 2014).
as a recall-oriented metric, it calculates similarity
between generations and references by considering
synonyms and paraphrases.

for comparisons, we    rst compare with an ab-
stractive summarization method presented in gane-
san et al. (2010) on the rottentomatoes dataset.
ganesan et al. (2010) utilize a graph-based algo-
rithm to remove repetitive information, and merge
opinionated expressions based on syntactic struc-

tures of product reviews.2 for both datasets, we con-
sider two extractive summarization approaches: (1)
lexrank (erkan and radev, 2004) is an unsuper-
vised method that computes text centrality based on
id95 algorithm; (2) sipos et al. (2012) propose
a supervised submodular summarization model
which is trained with support vector machines. in
addition, longest sentence is picked up as a base-
line.

four variations of our system are tested. one uses
randomly initialized id27s. the rest of
them use pre-trained id27s, additional
features in table 2, and their combination. for all
systems, we generate a one-sentence summary.

results are displayed in table 3. our system with
pre-trained id27s and additional fea-
tures achieves the best id7 scores on both datasets
(in boldface) with statistical signi   cance (two-tailed
wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05). notice that
our system summaries are conciser (i.e. shorter on
average), which lead to higher scores on precision
based-metrics, e.g. id7, and lower scores on
recall-based metrics, e.g. meteor and id8.
on rottentomatoes dataset, where summaries gen-
erated by different systems are similar in length, our
system still outperforms other methods in meteor
and id8 in addition to their signi   cantly bet-
ter id7 scores. this is not true on idebate, since
the length of summaries by extract-based systems is
signi   cantly longer. but the id7 scores of our
system are considerably higher. among our four
systems, models with pre-trained id27s
in general achieve better scores. though additional
features do not always improve the performance, we
   nd that they help our systems converge faster.

5.3 human evaluation on summary quality
for human evaluation, we consider three aspects: in-
formativeness that indicates how much salient infor-
mation is contained in the summary, grammaticality
that measures whether a summary is grammatical,
and compactness that denotes whether a summary
contains unnecessary information. each aspect is
rated on a 1 to 5 scale (5 is the best). the judges are

2we do not run this model on idebate because it relies on
high redundancy to detect repetitive expressions, which is not
observed on idebate.

and compactness (comp) are rated on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5
as the best. our system achieves the best informativeness and
grammaticality scores among the three learning-based systems.
our summaries are ranked as the best in 18% of the evaluations,
and are also ranked higher than compared systems on average.

also asked to give a ranking on all summary varia-
tions according to their overall quality.

we randomly sampled 40 movies from rotten-
tomatoes test set, each of which was evaluated by
5 distinct human judges. we hired 10 pro   cient en-
glish speakers for evaluation. three system sum-
maries (lexrank, opinosis, and our system) and
human-written abstract along with 20 representative
reviews were displayed for each movie. reviews
with the highest gold-standard importance scores
were selected.

results are reported in table 4. as it can be
seen, our system outperforms the abstract-based sys-
tem opinosis in all aspects, and also achieves bet-
ter informativeness and grammaticality scores than
lexrank, which extracts sentences in their origi-
nal form. our system summaries are ranked as the
best in 18% of the evaluations, and has an average
ranking of 2.3, which is higher than both opinosis
and lexrank on average. an inter-rater agree-
ment of krippendorff   s    of 0.71 is achieved for

overall ranking. this implies that our attention-
based abstract generation model can produce sum-
maries of better quality than existing summarization
systems. we also    nd that our system summaries are
constructed in a style closer to human abstracts than
others. sample summaries are displayed in figure 3.

5.4 sampling effect
we further investigate whether taking inputs sam-
pled from distributions estimated by importance
scores trains models with better performance than
the ones learned from    xed input or uniformly-
sampled input. recall that we sample k text units
based on their importance scores (importance-based
sampling). here we consider two other setups: one
is sampling k text units uniformly from the in-
put (uniform sampling), another is picking k text
units with the highest scores (top k). we try vari-
ous k values. results in figure 4 demonstrates that
importance-based sampling can produce compara-
ble id7 scores to top k methods, while both of
them outperform uniform sampling. for meteor
score, importance-based sampling uniformly out-
performs the other two methods3.

5.5 further discussion
finally, we discuss some other observations and po-
tential improvements. first, applying the re-ranking
component after the model generates n-best ab-
stracts leads to better performance. preliminary ex-
periments show that simply picking the top-1 gener-

3we observe similar results on the idebate dataset

movie: the neverending story
reviews: (1) here is a little adventure that fed on our uncul-
tivated need to think, and wonder... (2) magical storytelling
targeted at children still fascinates. (3)...the art direction in-
volved a lot of imagination.
human: a magical journey about the power of a young boy   s
imagination to save a dying fantasy land, the neverending
story remains a much-loved kids adventure.
lexrank: it pokes along at times and lapses occasionally into
dark moments of preachy philosophy, but this is still a charm-
ing, amusing and harid113ss    lm for kids.
opinosis: the neverending story is a silly fantasy movie that
often shows its age .
our system: the neverending story is an entertaining chil-
dren   s adventure, with heart and imagination to spare.
movie: joe strummer: the future is unwritten
reviews:
(1) the late punk rock legend joe strummer is
rendered fully human in julian temple   s engrossing and all-
encompassing portrait. (2) the movie fascinates not so much
because of strummer... but because of the way temple or-
ganized and edited the    lm. (3) one of the most compelling
documentary portraits of a musician yet made.
human: displaying joe strummer warts and all, the fu-
ture is unwritten succeeds as both an engrossing documen-
tary and a comprehensive examination of one of music   s most
legendary    gures.
lexrank: joe strummer: the future is unwritten is a    lm
for fans     really big fans .
opinosis: joe strummer: the future is unwritten is for fans
    really big fans .
our system: fascinating and insightful, joe strummer: the
future is unwritten is a thoroughly engrossing documentary.
topic: this house would detain terror suspects without trial.
arguments: (1) governments must have powers to protect
their citizens against threats to the life of the nation.(2) every-
one would recognise that rules that are applied in peacetime
may not be appropriate during wartime.
human: governments must have powers to protect citizens
from harm.
lexrank: this is not merely to directly protect citizens from
political violence, but also because political violence handi-
caps the process of reconstruction in nation-building efforts.
our system: governments have the obligation to protect cit-
izens from harmful substances.
topic: this house would replace christmas with a festival for
everyone.
arguments:
(1) christmas celebrations in the western
world... do not respect the rights of those who are not reli-
gious. (2) states should instead be sponsoring and celebrating
events that everyone can join in equally, regardless of religion,
race or class.
human: states should respect the freedom from religion, as
well as the freedom of religion.
lexrank: for school children who do not share the majority-
christian faith, christmas celebrations require either their par-
ticipation when they do not want to, through coercion, or their
non-participation and therefore isolation whilst everyone else
celebrations their inclusiveness.
our system: people have a right to freedom of religion.

ations produces inferior results than re-ranking them
with simple heuristics. this suggests that the current
models are oblivious to some task speci   c issues,
such as informativeness. post-processing is needed
to make better use of the summary candidates. for
example, future work can study other sophisticated
re-ranking algorithms (charniak and johnson, 2005;
konstas and lapata, 2012).

furthermore, we also look at the dif   cult cases
where our summaries are evaluated to have lower in-
formativeness. they are often much shorter than the
gold-standard human abstracts, thus the information
coverage is limited. in other cases, some generations
contain incorrect information on domain-dependent
facts, e.g. named entities, numbers, etc. for in-
stance, a summary    a poignant coming-of-age tale
marked by a breakout lead performance from cate
shortland    is generated for movie    lore   . this sum-
mary contains    cate shortland    which is the direc-
tor of the movie instead of actor. it would require
semantic features to handle this issue, which has yet
to be attempted.

6 related work

our work belongs to the area of opinion summa-
rization. constructing    uent natural language opin-
ion summaries has mainly considered product re-
views (hu and liu, 2004; lerman et al., 2009), com-
munity id53 (wang et al., 2014), and
editorials (paul et al., 2010). extractive summariza-
tion approaches are employed to identify summary-
worthy sentences. for example, hu and liu (2004)
   rst identify the frequent product features and then
attach extracted opinion sentences to the corre-
sponding feature. our model instead utilizes ab-
stract generation techniques to construct natural lan-
guage summaries. as far as we know, we are also

the    rst to study claim generation for arguments.

recently, there has been a growing interest in
generating abstractive summaries for news arti-
cles (bing et al., 2015), spoken meetings (wang
and cardie, 2013), and product reviews (ganesan et
al., 2010; di fabbrizio et al., 2014; gerani et al.,
2014). most approaches are based on phrase extrac-
tion, from which an algorithm concatenates them
into sentences (bing et al., 2015; ganesan et al.,
2010). nevertheless, the output summaries are not
guaranteed to be grammatical. gerani et al. (2014)
then design a set of manually-constructed realization
templates for producing grammatical sentences that
serve different discourse functions. our approach
does not require any human-annotated rules, and can
be applied in various domains.

our task is closely related to recent advances in
id4 (kalchbrenner and blun-
som, 2013; sutskever et al., 2014a). based on the
sequence-to-sequence paradigm, id56s-based mod-
els have been investigated for compression (filip-
pova et al., 2015) and summarization (filippova et
al., 2015; rush et al., 2015; hermann et al., 2015)
at sentence-level. built on the attention-based trans-
lation model in bahdanau et al. (2014), rush et al.
(2015) study the problem of constructing abstract for
a single sentence. our task differs from the mod-
els presented above in that our model carries out ab-
stractive decoding from multiple sentences instead
of a single sentence.

7 conclusion
in this work, we presented a neural approach to
generate abstractive summaries for opinionated text.
we employed an attention-based method that    nds
salient information from different input text units to
generate an informative and concise summary. to
cope with the large number of input text, we de-
ploy an importance-based sampling mechanism for
model training. experiments showed that our sys-
tem obtained state-of-the-art results using both au-
tomatic evaluation and human evaluation.
