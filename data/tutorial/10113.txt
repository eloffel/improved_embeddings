              reversible markov chains and id93 on graphs

   (by aldous and fill: unfinished monograph)

   in response to many requests, the material posted as separate chapters
   since the 1990s (see bottom of page) has been recompiled as a single
   pdf document which nowadays is searchable. here it is

   [1]reversible markov chains and id93 on graphs (pdf, 516
   pages).

   also, peter ralph has kindly run it through latexml, to make a nice
   html version, and here it is

   [2]reversible markov chains and id93 on graphs (html).

   some things to note
     * the content has not been changed.
     * the chapters which previously had integer numbers have retained the
       same numbers; other chapters have now acquired integer numbers, as
       indicated below.
     * cross-refs between chapters are neither explicit nor reliable.
     * there is some minor duplication of sections.
