   online social networking sites have become increasingly popular with
   college students. the networks we studied are defined through
   ``friendships'' indicated by facebook users from unc, oklahoma,
   caltech, georgetown, and princeton. we apply the tools of network
   science to study the facebook networks from these five different
   universities at a single point in time. we investigate each
   single-institution network's community structure, which we obtain
   through partitioning the graph using an eigenvector method. we use both
   graphical and quantitative tools, including pair-counting methods,
   which we interpret through statistical analysis and permutation tests
   to measure the correlations between the network communities and a set
   of characteristics given by each user (residence, class year, major,
   and high school). we also analyze the single gender subsets of these
   networks, and the impact of missing demographical data. our study
   allows us to compare the online social networks for the five schools as
   well as infer differences in offline social interactions. at the
   schools studied, we were able to define which characteristics of the
   facebook users correlate best with friendships.
