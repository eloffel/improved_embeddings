abstract

   given a large and complex network, we would like to find the best
   partition of this network into a small number of clusters. this
   question has been addressed in many different ways. here we propose a
   strategy along the lines of optimal prediction for the markov chains
   associated with the dynamics on these networks. we develop the
   necessary ingredients for such an optimal partition strategy, and we
   compare our strategy with the previous ones. we show that when the
   markov chain is lumpable, we recover the partition with respect to
   which the chain is lumpable. we also discuss the case of well-clustered
   networks. finally, we illustrate our strategy on several examples.

   in recent years we have seen an explosive growth of interest and
   activity on the structure and dynamics of complex networks (see refs.
   [147]1[148]      [149]3 for a review of these activities). this growth is
   partly due to the influx of new ideas, particularly ideas from
   statistical mechanics, to the subject and partly due to the emergence
   of interesting and challenging new examples of complex networks, such
   as the internet and wireless communication networks. network models
   have also become popular tools in social science, economics, the design
   of transportation and communication systems, banking systems,
   powergrid, etc, due to our increased capability of analyzing these
   models. on a related but different front, recent advances in computer
   vision and data mining have also relied heavily on the idea of viewing
   a data set or an image as a graph or a network, in order to extract
   information about the important features of the images or more
   generally, the data sets ([150]4[151]      [152]6).

   since these networks are typically very complex, it is of great
   interest to see whether they can be reduced to much simpler systems.
   such issues have been addressed before. in particular, much effort has
   gone into partitioning the network into a small number of clusters
   (see, e.g. refs.
   [153]4[154]   [155]   [156]   [157]   [158]   [159]   [160]   [161]   [162]   [163]   [164]
      [165]   [166]   [167]   [168]   [169]   [170]   [171]   [172]   [173]      [174]25 for a
   recent comparative review). a popular approach is to associate the
   network with some markov chains. information on the topology and
   dynamics of the network can then be extracted by analyzing this markov
   chain, and this can be used to partition the network
   ([175]4,[176]5,[177]9[178]   [179]      [180]12,[181]16,[182]19,[183]24).
   particularly relevant to our work is the approach of lafon and lee
   ([184]24) in which the stochastic matrix of the markov chain is used to
   introduce a metric on the network, the diffusion distance, which can
   then be used to partition the network into important components (see
   comparison with other partitioning strategies for details).

   in this paper, we will address such questions using the framework of
   optimal prediction introduced by chorin and coworkers
   ([185]26[186]      [187]28). in particular, we will look for the optimal
   partition of a large network. for that purpose, we will define distance
   between networks instead of distance on networks. our strategy is
   different from existing approaches to graph partitioning developed in
   the computer science literature, such as the mncut algorithm of meila
   and shi ([188]5) and the algorithm of lafon and lee ([189]24). it is
   also different from the approaches developed by physicists for network
   analysis (see ref. [190]25 for a recent review). these differences will
   be elucidated comparison with other partitioning strategies.

   in what follows we develop optimal prediction theory in the context of
   networks and show how this framework can be used to optimally reduce
   the dimensionality of the network. in particular, we show how optimal
   prediction can be used for partitioning the networks into communities
   and we will compare our strategy with other dimension reduction
   techniques currently used in network partitioning. we also show that
   our approach becomes asymptotically equivalent to approaches based on
   spectral partitioning in the simple case when the network is well
   clustered, in the sense that the markov chain presents a spectral gap
   with a few nearly piecewise constant eigenvectors with eigenvalues
   close to one. finally, we propose an algorithm to partition networks
   according to our strategy and illustrate it with several examples.

networks and markov chains

   let g(s,e) be a network (or a finite weighted directed graph) with n
   nodes, where e = {e(x,y)}[x,y   s] is the weight matrix and e(x,y) is the
   weight for the edge connecting the nodes x and y. a simple example of
   the weight matrix is given by the adjacency matrix: e(x,y) = 0 or 1,
   depending on whether x and y are connected.

   assuming that e(x,y)     0 for any x,y     s, one can relate this network
   to a discrete-time markov chain with stochastic matrix p with entries
   p(x,y) given by embedded image embedded image where d(x) is the degree
   of the node x ([191]29,[192]30). if the network is not directed, i.e.,
   if e(x,y) = e(y,x), and if we define embedded image embedded image then
      satisfies the detailed balance condition embedded image embedded
   image and embedded image embedded image i.e.,   (x) is a stationary
   distribution of this markov chain. for simplicity, throughout this
   paper we will assume that the network is undirected, although most of
   our results can be easily generalized to directed networks.

   a basic idea is to infer properties of the network from those of the
   random walkers moving on it, and this is the idea that we will exploit.
   we will use the following elementary facts about markov chains. assume
   that the initial distribution of the walkers on s is   [0](x). at a
   later time t        , their id203 distribution is   [t](x) =    [y   s]
     [0](y)p[t](y,x), where p[t](x,y) denote the entries of the matrix p^t.
   to compute p^t, it is convenient to use the spectral representation.
   let {  [k]}[k=0]^n   1 and {  [k]}[k=0]^n   1 be the right and left
   eigenvectors of p, respectively: embedded image embedded image in the
   reversible case, all eigenvalues and eigenvectors are real and lie in
   the interval [   1, 1]. we will order them such that 1 =   [0]     |  [1]|    
              |  [n   1]|. note that   [0] =    and   [0] is a constant vector. we
   also have   [k](y) =   [k](y)  (y). the spectral decomposition of p^t is
   given by embedded image embedded image

optimal prediction

   the main question we will address is the following: given n, which is
   much smaller than n, how do we find a markov chain on a network with n
   nodes that best represent the dynamics of the original markov chain? we
   will address this question from the viewpoint of optimal prediction
   introduced by chorin and coworkers ([193]26[194]      [195]28). this is a
   framework for carrying out model reduction from a variational
   viewpoint. the idea is to find a reduced model that best approximates
   the original model in the sense that some objective function is
   minimized. we will develop a framework for optimally partitioning a
   complex network along these lines. the space of models will be the
   space of markov chains on the network s, represented by their
   associated stochastic matrices. the reduced models will be the lumped
   markov chains on partitions of s with n elements. such markov chains
   are naturally embedded into the space of markov chains on s itself.

   let us introduce a notion of metric on the space of markov chains
   (stochastic matrices) on s with stationary distribution   . if p[1](x,y)
   [not necessarily equal to p(x,y)] is a stochastic matrix with
   stationary distribution   , we define its norm as embedded image
   embedded image it is easy to see [see [196]supporting information (si)
   text)] that if p[1] satisfies detailed balance this norm is in fact the
   sum of the amplitude square of the eigenvalues of p[1]. the norm
   ([197]eq. 7) allows one to define the distance between two stochastic
   matrices, p[1] and p[2], both with invariant distribution   , as
   embedded image embedded image taking p[1] = p (the stochastic matrix of
   the original markov chain) and p[2] to be a stochastic matrix in a
   certain class, we can then find the stochastic matrix in this class,
   which best approximates the original one by minimizing the distance
   ([198]8).

   next take a partition of s as s =    [i=1]^ns[i] with s[i]     s[j] =     if
   i     j. let p  (s[i],s[j]) be a stochastic matrix on the state space      =
   {s[1],    , s[n]}. this matrix can be naturally lifted to the space of
   stochastic matrices on the original state space s via embedded image
   embedded image where 1[s[i]](x) = 1 if x     s[i] and 1[s[i]](x) = 0
   otherwise, and embedded image embedded image [199]eq. 9 says that the
   id203 of jump from any state in s[i] is the same, and the walker
   enters s[j] according to the equilibrium distribution. this idea is
   consistent with trying to coarsen the original dynamics onto the new
   state-space      = {s[1],   ,s[n]} and ignore the details of the dynamics
   within the sets s[i]. note that p   is a stochastic matrix on s with
   stationary distribution    if p   is a stochastic matrix on      with
   equilibrium distribution      (see [200]si text).

   we now ask: given the partition      and given some t     1, what is the p  
   that best approximates p[t]? if optimality is understood in terms of
   the metric ([201]eq. 7), the best p   is the minimizer of embedded image
   embedded image over all p   of the form ([202]eq. 9). a direct
   calculation (see [203]si text) shows that the minimizer of e(p  ) is one
   in which p   is given by embedded image embedded image where [204]eq. 6
   was used and where embedded image embedded image we also have e(p  *)    
   e* with embedded image embedded image it can be checked (see [205]si
   text) that p  * and, hence, embedded image embedded image are both
   stochastic matrices and that      is an equilibrium distribution for the
   markov chain on      with transition matrix p  *. it can also be checked
   that p  * satisfies a detailed balance condition with respect to     . the
   matrix p  * is the stochastic matrix in the class ([206]eq. 9) that best
   approximates the original one.

   notice that the rank of the matrix p   in [207]eq. 9 is at most n. thus,
   the residual e*     0 obtained by using [208]eq. 12 in [209]eq. 9 cannot
   be less than what is obtained by minimizing [210]eq. 11 over all rank-n
   matrices p  (x,y). a direct calculation shows that the minimizer of
   [211]eq. 11 over all such matrices is embedded image embedded image
   note that, in general, [212]eq. 16 is not a stochastic matrix because
   some of the entries p  ** (x,y) can be negative. nevertheless, e** =
      p[t]     p  **   [  ]^2 gives a lower bound for the residual e*.

lumpability

   a chain with stochastic matrix p(x,y) is lumpable with respect to the
   partition      = {s[1],   ,s[n]} iff the law of a walker (in the original
   chain) on these sets is itself markov. we have the following.

theorem 1.

   assume that p  * defined by [213]eq.12 is nonsingular. then e*     e**,
   and e* = e** iff the markov chain is lumpable with respect to the
   partition     . in this case, we also have p  **(x,y) = p  *(x,y).

   this theorem is an easy consequence of a result by meila and shi
   ([214]5) who proved that the markov chain with stochastic matrix p is
   lumpable on the sets {s[1], s[2],   ,s[n]} iff either of the following
   two conditions is satisfied:
    1. for each s[i],    [y   s[j]] p(x,y) is independent of x     s[i] and the
       matrix p  *(s[i], s[j]) =    [y   s[j]] p(x,y) with x     s[i] is
       nonsingular.
    2. the first n eigenvectors   [k](x), k = 0,   ,n     1, are piecewise
       constant with respect to the partition {s[1], s[2],   ,s[n]}.

   this case, it is easy to see that   [k](x) for k = 0,   ,n     1 must be of
   the form embedded image embedded image where c[0,j] = 1 and, for k =
   1,   ,n     1, the coefficients c[k,j] satisfy embedded image embedded
   image the orthogonality condition of the eigenvectors implies that, for
   k = n,   ,n     1 and any j = 1,   ,n, we have embedded image embedded image
   consequently, we have embedded image embedded image which, from
   [215]eqs. 12 and [216]15, implies that embedded image embedded image

   in the general case, the markov chain will not be lumpable with respect
   to the partition {s[1], s[2],   ,s[n]} and [217]eq. 16 will not be a
   stochastic matrix and, hence, not an acceptable approximation. however,
   [218]eq. 15 remains the optimal approximation of the stochastic matrix
   of the original markov chain, and e*     e** gives a measure of the
   quality of this approximation in terms of lumpability. later, we will
   see that the condition of theorem 1 are approximately satisfied for
   well clustered networks.

optimal partitioning

   the next question we address is: given n, what is the best partition
   {s[1],   ,s[n]}? to answer this question, we view [219]eq. 14 as a
   function of {s[1],   ,s[n]}, e*     e(s[1],   ,s[n]) and compute embedded
   image embedded image as a direct generalization of theorem 1, we have
   the following.

theorem 2.

   denote by {s[1]^*,   ,s[n]^*} the partition that minimizes [220]eq.22 and
   let e** =    p[t]     p  **   [  ]^2 where p  **(x,y) is given by [221]eq.16.
   then e(s[1]^*,   ,s[n]^*)     e** and e(s[1]^*,   ,s[n]*) = e** iff the
   markov chain is lumpable with respect to the partition     * =
   {s[1]^*,   ,s[n]^*}.

   in other words, if the markov chain is lumpable with respect to a
   partition with n sets, then the minimization problem in [222]eq. 22
   will identify these sets. below, we propose a variant of a id116
   algorithm to solve this minimization problem. but before doing so, let
   us compare our criterion with other criteria introduced before for
   partitioning networks.

comparison with other partitioning strategies

   in ref. [223]24, a unified framework for partitioning networks is
   proposed. the basic idea is to introduce the following diffusion
   distance between nodes on the network (this should be contrasted with
   [224]eq. 8, which is a distance between networks): embedded image
   embedded image based on this diffusion distance, lafon and lee
   ([225]24) suggest to partition the network by minimizing the following
   distortion: embedded image embedded image where     [k](s[i]) is defined
   in [226]eq. 13. this object, or more precisely the vector embedded
   image embedded image is called the geometric centroid in ref. [227]24.
   by expanding [228]eq. 24 and using [229]eqs. 6 and [230]12, it is easy
   to see that [231]eq. 24 can be reexpressed as embedded image embedded
   image or, equivalently, embedded image embedded image this criterion is
   also the one used in the mncut algorithm proposed in ref. [232]5 and
   the one of almost (or most) invariant sets introduced in ref. [233]31
   and further developed and used in refs. [234]32 and [235]33.

   to see the difference between [236]eqs. 27 and [237]22, we note that in
   the case when the markov chain is lumpable with respect to
   {s[1],   ,s[n]}, the minimizer of [238]eq. 27 might be a partition
   {s   [1],   ,s   [n]}, which is different from {s[1],   ,s[n]}, unlike the
   minimizer of [239]eq. 22.

   here is a simple example which illustrates this point. suppose that s =
   {1,   2n} and assume that p(x,y)=    if x = 2,   ,2n     1 and y = x    1,
   p(1,2) = 1 = p(2n, 2n     1) = 1, and p(x,y) = 0 in all other cases
   (i.e., each node is connected to its two direct neighbors on the line).
   this chain is lumpable onto a two-state chain with s[1] = {1,3,   ,2n    
   1} and s[2] = {2,4,   ,2n} with embedded image embedded image and indeed
   the residual e(s[1], s[2]) = e** with this choice, consistent with
   theorem 2. on the other hand, [240]eq. 27 leads to the optimal
   partition s   [1] = {1,2,   ,n} and s[2   ] = {n + 1, n + 2,   ,2n}, and the
   markov chain is not lumpable with respect to this partition. thus
   partition algorithms based on [241]eqs. 22 and [242]27 are indeed
   different. we suspect that [243]eq. 27 might be more useful in the
   context of data segmentation (i.e., if the dynamics on the network is
   irrelevant), and [244]eq. 22 is more preferable if one is interested in
   dynamical properties of the network.

   finally, it is interesting to note that although [245]eqs. 22 and
   [246]27 are different, they become equivalent for well clustered
   networks, as shown below.

the case of well clustered networks

   by definition, we call a network well clustered if the associated
   markov chain has a spectral gap, i.e., if the eigenvalue of p defined
   in [247]eq. 5 satisfy embedded image embedded image where 0 <        1,
   and   [k] > 0 and   [*]     (0,1) are o(1) in   . one can show that, in this
   case, there exists a partition of s in n sets, {s[1],   ,s[n]}, such that
   the first n eigenvectors of p are approximately piecewise constant over
   these sets embedded image embedded image where c[0,i] = 1 and the
   coefficients c[k,i] satisfy [248]eq. 18 for k = 1,   ,n     1. this shows
   that the markov chain is approximately lumpable over the sets
   {s[1],   ,s[n]} and, by theorem 2, the residual over these sets,
   e(s[1],   ,s[n]), tends to e** as        0. in fact, in this case, we have
   that embedded image embedded image where t(  ) = 1/   and p  *(x,y) is
   given by [249]eq. 15. this is khasminskii's averaging theorem ([250]34)
   in the discrete-time setting.

   a similar calculation shows that {s[1],   ,s[n]} is also the optimal
   partition according to [251]eq. 24 with t(  ) = 1/   in p[t](x,y). thus,
   for well clustered networks, [252]eqs. 22 and [253]24 are
   asymptotically equivalent.

algorithmic aspects

   in practice, it is important that the minimization problem in [254]eq.
   22 be tractable. in ref. [255]24, it is shown that minimization problem
   [256]eq. 24 can be solved using the id116 algorithm ([257]35). here
   we show that a variant of this algorithm can also be used to handle
   [258]eq. 22. given an initial partition {s[i]^(0)}[i=1]^n, for n     0
   use embedded image embedded image where embedded image embedded image
   this algorithm has the advantage that it converges very fast even
   though, like all id116 algorithms, it may not converge to the global
   minimum. in fact, the situation is slightly worse than usual here
   because   (x, s[j]) depends implicitly on the previous partition due to
   the presence of s[k] in [259]eq. 33. as a result, the objective
   function e(s[1],   ,s[n]) is not guaranteed to decrease at every
   iteration. this problem can be solved by terminating the iteration if
   the objective function increases or remains constant, then repeat the
   calculation with several initial partitions, {s[i]^(0)}[i=1]^n and keep
   the best result (as is usually done with id116 algorithms). this is
   the procedure we used on the examples results.

results

zachary's karate club network

   as a first test, we used the well known example of the karate club
   network ([260]36). this network was constructed by wayne zachary after
   he observed social interactions between members of a karate club at an
   american university. soon after, a dispute arose between the club's
   administrator and main teacher and the club split into two smaller
   clubs. we used zachary's original network in our procedure. as an
   initial condition for the id116 algorithm, we took random partitions.
   the partition that we obtained is shown in [261]fig. 1 and corresponds
   to s[1] = {1:8,10:14,17,18,20,22} and s[2] = {9,15,16,19,21,23:34}.
   this is very similar to the actual structure of the smaller clubs
   observed by zachary after the split: s[1] = {1:8,11:14,17,18,20,22} and
   s[2] = {9,10,15,16,19,21,23:34}. only one node, node 10, is
   misclassified.

   the two clusters identified by our approach in zachary's karate club
   network ([266]36). the administrator and the instructor are represented
   by nodes 1 and 33, respectively. as initial condition for our id116
   algorithm, we took random partitions. we obtained s[1] = {1 : 8, 10 :
   14, 17, 18, 20, 22} and s[2] = {9, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23 : 34}, which is
   very similar to zachary's actual observation: only one node, node 11,
   is misclassified.

ad hoc networks

   as second test, we used the example of the ad hoc networks which were
   originally proposed in ref. [267]16 and were used to compare the
   performances of various partitioning strategies in ref. [268]25. these
   networks have a known community structure and are constructed as
   follows. they have n = 128 nodes, split into 4 communities containing
   32 nodes each. pairs of nodes belonging to the same communities are
   linked with id203 p[in], and pairs belonging to different
   communities with id203 p[out]. these values are chosen so that
   the average node degree, k, is fixed at k = 16. in other words, p[in]
   and p[out] are related as embedded image embedded image typically, we
   define z[out] as the average number of links a node has to nodes
   belonging to any other communities, i.e. z[out] = 96p[out], and we use
   this quantity as a control parameter. the larger the z[out], the more
   diffuse the communities become.

   we first used our strategy to partition the network by assuming that
   the number of communities is known, n = 4. we considered several values
   of z[out] between 0 and 8 and calculated the fraction f of correctly
   identified nodes by our procedure (to compute this fraction f, we used
   the criterion proposed in ref. [269]16 and used in ref. [270]25 for a
   comparative study). to make our results less dependent on the specific
   network chosen, for each value of z[out], we took 100 realizations of
   the network and computed the mean and standard deviation of f over
   these 100 realizations. to apply our id116 algorithm, in each case,
   we took 100, 300, 500, and finally 1,000 random initial partitions and
   kept the best result (i.e., the one with the smallest residual e*). the
   final result for the mean of f is shown in [271]fig. 2. it shows that
   our procedure performs very well at identifying the right communities
   all the way up to z[out] = 7.5 (where z[out]/k = 0.4688 and f = 0.93
   with 500 trials) and only deteriorates for z[out] = 8 (where z[out]/k =
   0.5 and f = 0.7367 with 500 trials). even in this case, however, our
   method remains very competitive compared with the techniques listed in
   ref. [272]25, being outperformed only by two of these techniques at the
   last data point, z[out]/k = 0.5. next, we discuss in more details the
   performance of our technique in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

   the mean fraction of correctly identified nodes versus the proportion
   of links towards the other communities. the four curves show the
   results of our id116 algorithm with 100, 300, 500, and 1,000 random
   initial partitions. as can be seen, the results improve as the number
   of initial conditions is increased, but the results eventually saturate
   (the curve with 500 trials can barely be distinguished below the one
   with 1,000 trials). the results show that our algorithm is among the
   very best of those compared in ref. [277]25.

accuracy

   the results shown in [278]fig. 2 indicate that our technique identifies
   a fraction f of >90% of the modes correctly up to z[out] = 7.5. our
   method does deteriorate, however, when z[out] = 8, and it is
   interesting to investigate what happens then. the first issue that we
   need to address is whether our id116 algorithm does identify the
   minimum e* of the objective function ([279]eq. 22) because this depends
   on the number of random initial partitions used. the result in
   [280]fig. 2 indicates that this is indeed the case, at least if the
   number of initial partitions is >500. the result shown in [281]fig. 3
   also corroborates this finding by displaying the residual e* of the
   id116 algorithm obtained for 100 independent realizations of the ad
   hoc network with z[out] = 8 using 100, 300, 500, and finally 1,000
   random initial partitions. [282]fig. 3 also explains the difficulty
   inherent in partitioning networks with a diffuse community structure
   such as the ad hoc networks when z[out] = 8. indeed, it can be seen
   that the residual e* calculated from the known community structure is
   typically larger than the residual identified by our id116 algorithm.
   thus, at least in terms of lumpability, the community structure has
   often become so diffusive when z[out] = 8 that another set of
   communities is actually better, and this is why the fraction f of
   correctly identified nodes becomes smaller in that case.

   and finally 1,000 random initial partitions. also shown is the residual
   e* calculated with the known partition of the network. as can be seen,
   the actual residual e* identified by our id116 algorithm is often
   smaller than the one computed with the known community. this result
   reflects the very diffuse nature of the community structure in the ad
   hoc network when z[out] = 8. the vertical lines on the graph act as a
   visual aid to identify the various points associated with the different
   realizations.

efficiency

   our procedure is very competitive with respect to those compared in
   ref. [287]25 in terms of accuracy, but how does it do in terms of
   efficiency? it can be shown (see [288]si text) that the cost of every
   iteration in our id116 algorithm (i.e., the cost of evaluating
   [289]eqs. 32 and [290]33) is o(n(n + m)), where n is the number of
   communities, n is the number of nodes in the network, and m is the
   numbers of edges. this number thus provides a lower bound on the cost
   of our id116 algorithm. to estimate the algorithm's actual cost, we
   still need to estimate how many random initial partitions must be used
   to identify the actual minimum and how many iterations the algorithm
   takes before reaching a local minimum. these numbers are much harder to
   compute analytically. in tests with ad hoc networks of increasing
   sizes, we observed that these numbers seem to depend only weakly on the
   size of the network: typically, 500 random initial partitions are
   enough, and for each the algorithm converges in a few tenths of an
   iteration, even for large networks (i.e., with n between 128 and
   1,280). should these results be generic, this would make our method one
   of the least expensive among the techniques compared in ref. [291]25.
   this point, however, requires further study.

determining the number n of communities

   so far, we have assumed that the number of communities, n, was given.
   in many applications, however, this number is unknown beforehand and
   needs to be determined by the partitioning technique itself. one way to
   do so with our method is to apply it with several values of n and
   compare the results. for instance, setting z[out] = 6 and applying our
   method with n = 2,3,    , 8 communities, we observed the following. when
   n = 2, our technique identified one community with 32 nodes which was
   one of the correct communities, and one with 96 nodes, which was the
   union of the remaining three correct communities. when n = 3, our
   technique correctly identified two communities with 32 nodes and lumped
   together the other two. when n = 4, we got the correct classification.
   when n = 5, we got the correct classification, except that one of the
   communities of 32 nodes was split into two. similarly, when n = 6, n =
   7, and n = 8, two, three, and four of the correct communities,
   respectively, with 32 nodes were split into two.

   how can we a priori identify which value of n was the actual one from
   these results? the most natural method is to look at the relative
   residual, e*     e**, in each case. in the example of the ad hoc network
   with z[out] = 6, we observed that e*     e** increases slightly from n =
   2 to n = 4, then faster when n > 4. this result seems to corroborate
   that n = 4 is the optimal choice (because using more communities worsen
   the result more significantly), but this point too deserves further
   study.

discussion

   in summary, we have proposed an approach to partition complex networks
   based on the framework of optimal prediction. the approach is tailored
   to situations for which the dynamics on the network matters and it
   gives the coarse network which respects best the dynamics on the
   original network. as we have shown, however, our approach can also be
   used in the context of network partitioning. in this context, it may be
   an attractive alternative to existing techniques both in terms of
   accuracy and computational cost.
