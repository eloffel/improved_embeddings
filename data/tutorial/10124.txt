abstract

   we examined the entire network of creative artists that made broadway
   musicals, in the post-war period, a collaboration network of
   international acclaim and influence, with an eye to investigating how
   the network's structural features condition the relationship between
   individual artistic talent and the success of their musicals. our
   findings show that some of the evolving topographical qualities of
   degree distributions, path lengths and assortativity are relatively
   stable with time even as collaboration patterns shift, which suggests
   their changes are only minimally associated with the ebb and flux of
   the success of new productions. in contrast, the id91 coefficient
   changed substantially over time and we found that it had a nonlinear
   association with the production of financially and artistically
   successful shows. when the id91 coefficient ratio is low or high,
   the financial and artistic success of the industry is low, while an
   intermediate level of id91 is associated with successful shows.
   we supported these findings with sociological theory on the
   relationship between social structure and collaboration and with tests
   of statistical id136. our discussion focuses on connecting the
   statistical properties of social networks to their performance and the
   performance of the actors embedded within them.
