abstract

   recent studies have demonstrated that human societies are
   hierarchically structured with a consistent scaling ratio across
   successive layers of the social network; each layer of the network is
   between three and four times the size of the preceding (smaller)
   grouping level. here we show that similar relationships hold for four
   mammalian taxa living in multi-level social systems. for elephant
   (loxodonta africana), gelada (theropithecus gelada) and hamadryas
   (papio hamadryas hamadryas) baboon, successive layers of social
   organization have a scaling ratio of almost exactly 3, indicating that
   such branching ratios may be a consistent feature of all hierarchically
   structured societies. interestingly, the scaling ratio for orca
   (orcinus orca) was 3.8, which might mean that aquatic environments
   place different constraints on the organization of social hierarchies.
   however, circumstantial evidence from a range of other species suggests
   that scaling ratios close to 3 may apply widely, even in species where
   hierarchical social structures have not traditionally been identified.
   these results identify the origin of the hierarchical, fractal-like
   organization of mammalian social systems as a fundamental question.

1. introduction

   human networks appear to be hierarchically structured ([104]binford
   2001; [105]hill & dunbar 2003; [106]maschner & bentley 2003), and
   [107]zhou et al. (2005) showed that these hierarchical societies were
   arranged in a coherent set of characteristic group sizes organized
   according to a geometric series with a preferred scaling ratio close to
   3. more recently, [108]hamilton et al. (2007) have found that within a
   large sample of hunter   gather societies, the population structure had a
   scaling ratio closer to 4. within such hierarchies, it may be that the
   absolute values of the group sizes are less important than the ratios
   between successive group sizes; that is, the minimum    nucleation    size
   may vary but the ratio (of between 3 and 4) might be universal. claims
   for this universality among small-scale, hunter   gatherer societies have
   raised the possibility of a fractal organization underlying human
   social groups ([109]mosko 1995; [110]hamilton et al. 2007). two key
   questions remain, however. firstly, if such hierarchical structures
   exist within human societies, then what is the actual scaling ratio
   between successive levels of the network? secondly, what is the origin
   of this discrete hierarchy?

   humans are not the only species to live in hierarchical societies, and
   many animal species have social organizations with a number of
   identifiable network levels (primates: [111]kummer 1968, [112]dunbar &
   dunbar 1975; proboscideans: [113]wittemyer et al. 2005; cetaceans:
   [114]ford et al. 2000; birds: [115]hegner et al. 1982). a key question,
   therefore, is to determine whether these hierarchical networks have a
   scaling ratio similar to those observed in humans. for a wide range of
   primate species, preliminary supporting evidence shows a consistent
   scaling relationship of 3.15 between grooming clique size (the number
   of core grooming partners that an average individual has) and total
   group size ([116]kudo & dunbar 2001). nevertheless, as this is across
   only two network levels, a more comprehensive analysis is required. to
   address this, we followed the methodology of [117]hamilton et al.
   (2007) to examine the fractal structure of social groups of four
   mammalian taxa for which appropriate data were available: elephants
   (loxodonta africana), gelada (theropithecus gelada), hamadryas baboons
   (papio hamadryas hamadryas) and orca (orcinus orca). since there are
   differences in the fundamental social unit for each of these species
   (see electronic supplementary material), such an analysis will provide
   useful insights into the origins of structured societies.

2. material and methods

(a) data

   data were collected from published and unpublished sources for all
   populations of elephants, gelada, hamadryas and orca where detailed
   information were available on group sizes from at least two levels of
   the hierarchical network ([118]table 1). the observed group sizes for
   hamadryas were also supplemented with additional data on grooming
   cliques from a captive population ([119]kudo & dunbar 2001).

(b) analysis

   we used horton   strahler scaling to test for fractal patterns within the
   data and followed methods similar to that of [121]hamilton et al.
   (2007), who used generalized horton laws ([122]horton 1945) for
   calculating the branching ratio (the characteristic ratio of the number
   of groups of one order to the number of groups in the next higher
   order). this is done by categorizing the group sizes, g, into numerical
   orders from the first order (individual animals) to the highest order
     . for elephant, the orders are (g[1]) individual, (g[2])
   mother   offspring unit, (g[3]) family, (g[4]) bond group, (g[5]) clan
   and (g[6]) sub-population. for gelada and hamadryas, the first five
   orders are (g[1]) individual, (g[2]) grooming clique, (g[3]) one-male
   unit, (g[4]) team and (g[5]) band, with the sixth and top level being
   community for geladas and troop for hamadryas. for orca, the orders
   correspond to (g[1]) individual, (g[2]) matrilines, (g[3]) pods, (g[4])
   clan and (g[5]) community.

   following [123]hamilton et al. (2007), we determine the scaling
   relation between group sizes across hierarchical orders first by
   determining the average group size    g    within order    across n
   populations, using inline formula to denote a group of size g in the
   ith population, at order    ([124]hamilton et al. 2007). in order to
   find the average branching ratio b, we first determine the mean number
   of groups per community/troop, and then plot the horton order    versus
   the number of groups per order. the branching ratio is the slope of the
   semi-log plot of ln[n(g^(  ))], the average number of groups of size g,
   versus the order    (cf. [125]hamilton et al. 2007), with errors
   estimated by the jackknife technique. following [126]hamilton et al.
   (2007) we estimated the number of groups of size g by dividing the
   entire population size by the average group size g.

3. results

   as an initial quantitative analysis, we constructed a series of ratios
   between the mean group sizes at successive levels of the hierarchy for
   each species, following [127]zhou et al. (2005). for elephants the mean
   scaling ratio from mother   offspring unit to subpopulation is 3.25 (2.5,
   2.5, 2.76, 4.52), for gelada from grooming clique to community it is
   2.94 (2.39, 2.29, 3.60, 3.48), for hamadryas from grooming clique to
   troop it is 3.06 (2.41, 3.43, 3.57, 2.84) and for orca from matriline
   to community the mean ratio is 3.40 (3.52, 3.77, 2.89). this suggests
   that, like humans ([128]zhou et al. 2005), multi-layered animal
   societies form groups according to a discrete hierarchy with a
   preferred scaling ratio of close to 3.

   in testing for fractal patterns, [129]figure 1 shows the relationship
   between horton order    and number of groups. in all cases, the number
   of groups follows a declining exponential form with respect to   
   (elephant: r^2=0.992; gelada: r^2=0.991; hamadryas: r^2=0.997; orca:
   r^2=0.993). the linear fits on a semi-log plot indicate that the
   branching ratio between all levels is consistent, and that the network
   structure is self-similar for all species. the calculated branching
   ratios were 2.99  0.10 for elephant, 3.05  0.09 for gelada, 3.04  0.04 for
   hamadryas and 3.80  0.24 for orca. if mean group sizes are determined
   via a lognormal mean (the mean of the logged group size values), rather
   than the arithmetic mean reported above, the branching ratios are
   virtually identical (gelada: 2.98  0.09; hamadryas: 2.81  0.02; orca:
   3.82  0.14; elephant: analysis not possible since only summary dataset
   is available). overall, therefore, three species show branching ratios
   very close to 3, while orcas have a branching ratio between 3 and 4.
   these findings suggest that consistent branching ratios may be a
   ubiquitous feature of all hierarchically structured mammalian
   societies.

4. discussion

   we have demonstrated that multi-level social systems in four mammalian
   taxa follow a scaling law similar to that reported recently for humans
   ([133]hamilton et al. 2007). previous studies on humans had reached
   conflicting conclusions about the precise scaling ratio, however;
   [134]zhou et al. (2005) reported a scaling ratio across human group
   levels of 3, while [135]hamilton et al. (2007) reported a ratio closer
   to 4 across a large sample of hunter   gatherers. our results are
   consistent with the findings of [136]zhou et al. (2005), suggesting
   that a scaling ratio of 3 may be universal across mammalian
   hierarchical societies.

   there is, however, variation in the scaling ratios across species.
   elephant, gelada and hamadryas have scaling ratios of almost exactly 3,
   but in orcas successive layers of the social hierarchy have a scaling
   ratio of 3.8. orcas obviously stand out as an aquatic species, and the
   constraints imposed by their three-dimensional marine environment might
   create selective pressures on network structure different from those
   experienced by terrestrial mammals inhabiting an ostensibly
   two-dimensional world. comparable information on network structure from
   further orca populations or other cetacean species such as dolphins
   ([137]lusseau et al. 2006), or from non-terrestrial species such as
   birds ([138]hegner et al. 1982) may help to elucidate how
   three-dimensional environments constrain social networks.

   however, there is some circumstantial evidence from other mammal
   species to suggest that a scaling ratio of 3 may be more widespread.
   [139]popa-lisseanu et al. (2008) reported that a population of giant
   noctule bats (nyctalus lasiopterus) consisted of three distinct but
   cryptic social groups suggesting a scaling ratio of 3 from population
   to social group. furthermore, the recent proliferation of the
   application of social network analysis to studies of sociality
   ([140]wey et al. 2008) is identifying preliminary evidence for similar
   patterns in species where hierarchical social structures have
   previously not been considered. for example, [141]wolf et al. (2007)
   used network analysis to identify a social hierarchy with at least
   three levels in gal  pagos sea lions (zalaphus wollebaeki) with an
   apparent scaling ratio of 3.7 between community and clique. similarly,
   [142]manno (2008) reported a captive population of colombian ground
   squirrels (spermophilus columbianus) composed of separate communities
   and subcommunities, with a mean scaling ratio of 2.67 between these
   levels. although more systematic analyses for a range of species are
   clearly required, scaling ratios of close to 3 may be fundamental to
   mammalian social organization.

   what do these consistent scaling ratios mean? [143]hamilton et al.
   (2007) suggested that scaling ratios of close to 4 among humans could
   be derived from an average family size of 4 (two parents and two
   children). although this interpretation for humans seems unlikely (such
   nuclear families are not a universal in human prehistory: [144]fox
   1983), we cannot rule out discrete hierarchies having their origins in
   the fundamental organization of any social structure (see also
   [145]zhou et al. 2005). what remains unclear, however, is whether the
   constraint that creates the fractal structuring is cognitive (animals
   can only manage a certain number of relationships at a given level of
   relationship intensity: see [146]kudo & dunbar 2001) or a time
   constraint (a functional relationship requires a minimum time
   investment, and constraints on available social time limit the number
   of relationships an individual can have at a given level of
   relationship quality: [147]seyfarth 1977; [148]dunbar 1996).
   determining the origin of these discrete hierarchies thus remains a
   question of enormous importance that warrants substantial further
   research.

   we thank two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on an earlier
   version of the manuscript.
