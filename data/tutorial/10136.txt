abstract

many recent models of trade dynamics use the simple idea of wealth exchanges
among economic agents in order to obtain a stable or equilibrium distribution of
wealth among the agents. in particular, a plain analogy compares the wealth in
a society with the energy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to
the energy exchange between molecules during collisions. in physical systems,
the energy exchange among molecules leads to a state of equipartition of the
energy and to an equilibrium situation where the id178 is a maximum. on
the other hand, in the majority of exchange models, the system converges to
a very unequal condensed state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the
wealth of the society while the wide majority of agents shares zero or almost
zero fraction of the wealth. so, in those economic systems a minimum id178
state is attained. we propose here an analytical model where we investigate the
e   ects of a particular class of economic exchanges that minimize the id178.
by solving the model we discuss the conditions that can drive the system to
a state of minimum id178, as well as the mechanisms to recover a kind of
equipartition of wealth.

1. introduction

the second law of thermodynamics states that isolated systems always tend
to an equilibrium state of maximum id178, where equilibrium means that the
macroscopic properties of the system are the same in any part of it. the second
law of thermodynamics can also be deduced from an analysis of the e   ciency
of a thermal engine, and according to clausius:    no process is possible whose
sole result is the transfer of heat from a body of lower temperature to a body

of higher temperature    [1] in modern statistical physics the second law may be
inferred from boltzmann h-theorem [1] and it is generally accepted as a natural
consequence of the energy exchange among molecules in the kinetic theory of
gases: when molecules collide in a gas there is a transfer of kinetic energy from
the more energetic to the less energetic molecules and, as a consequence, after
a transient, all molecules share, in average, the same energy. this result is the
theorem of equipartition of energy that characterizes the maxwell-boltzmann
equilibrium distribution of velocities, and it is associated with the maximum
id178 state. however, in particular situations, it may happen that the en-
tropy decreases as a function of time; examples are self-organized systems and
biological organisms. one common characteristic of those systems is that they
are not in equilibrium even if they seem stable or stationary in time [2].

the idea that economic systems also possess some kind of equilibrium state
is an underlying concept in classical economic theory, going from pareto opti-
mality to nash equilibrium [3]. the edgeworth box model is an example of
how a simple exchange conservative model can lead two consumers to optimize
their respective utility [3]. but in other cases there are symptomatic evidences
that economic systems can be out of equilibrium and/or exhibit metastable
equilibrium states. this is the case when studying the wealth and income dis-
tribution. fluctuations around an equilibrium state behave in a gaussian or
normal way: the id203 of rare events is very small, as the gaussian distri-
bution exhibits exponential tails. on the other hand, empirical studies focusing
the income distribution of workers, companies and countries were    rst presented
more than a century ago by vilfredo pareto and he discovered that the income
distribution does not behave in a gaussian way but exhibits    heavy tails   , i.e.
the cumulative id203 p (w) of workers whose income is at least w follows
a power law [4] given by p (w)     w      . nowadays, this power law distribution
is known as pareto distribution, and the corresponding exponent    is named
pareto exponent. however, recent data indicates that, even though pareto dis-
tribution provides a good    t in the high income range, it does not agree with
the observed data over the middle and low income range. for instance, data
from japan [5, 6], italy [7], india [8], the united states of america and the
united kingdom [9, 10, 11] are    tted by a log-normal or boltzmann distribu-
tion with the maximum located at the middle-income region plus a power law
for the high-income strata. the existence of these two regimes may be justi   ed
in a qualitative way by stating that in the low and middle income classes the
process of wealth accumulation is additive (and mainly due to wages), causing
a gaussian-like distribution, while in the high income range, wealth grows in a
multiplicative way, generating the observed power law tail [6].

in recent years physicists and economists working in complexity science pro-
posed di   erent mathematical models of wealth exchange among economic agents
in order to try to explain these empirical data (for a review see refs. [12, 13, 14]).
quoting ref. [12]: inspired by boltzmann   s kinetic theory of collisions in gases,
econophysicists introduced an alternative two-body approach, where agents per-
form pairwise economic transactions and transfer money from one agent to
another. actually, this approach was pioneered by the sociologist john an-

2

gle [15, 16]. most of these models consider an ensemble of interacting eco-
nomic agents, each one possessing a given amount of endowments, money[9] or
assets[14, 17] that represents its economics resources and that we will describe
as    wealth   . most of these models focus on one particular aspect of economic
processes: the competition among di   erent agents (countries, enterprises, etc.)
acting in an environment where all exchanges of wealth between agents take
place in a conservative manner, i.e., a conservative exchange market model
(cemm)[18]. this restriction has several motivations: on the one hand, it can
be argued that resources are material objects, and consequently they cannot be
created or destroyed by means of exchanging them. on the other hand, the use
of the cemm implies that the exchange model is a zero-sum game, something
that may seem at odds with usual economic orthodoxy. however, the results
also hold for systems in which the total amount of wealth increases uniformly
and smoothly in time. the interaction among agents consists in a exchange of a
   xed [9] or random [14, 17] amount of their wealth. the process of exchange is
similar to the collision of molecules in a gas and the amount of exchanged wealth
when two agents interact corresponds to some economic    energy    that may be
transferred for one agent to another. if this exchanged amount corresponds to
a    xed or random fraction of one of the interacting agents wealth, the resulting
wealth distribution is     unsurprisingly     a gibbs exponential distribution [9].

aiming at obtaining distributions with power law tails, in order to describe
the higher income region of the wealth distribution histogram, several methods
have been proposed mostly introducing a multiplicative risk aversion that acts
as a multiplicative noise. numerical results[14, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], as well
as some analytical calculations [25, 26], indicate that a frequent outcome in
these models is condensation, i.e. concentration of all available wealth in just
one or a few agents. this    nal state corresponds to a kind of equipartition
of poverty: all agents (except for a set of zero measure) possess zero wealth
while one, or a few ones, concentrate all available resources. in any case the
   nal con   guration is a stationary state of    equilibrium   , since agents with zero
wealth cannot participate in further exchanges. several methods have been
proposed to avoid this situation, for instance, exchange rules where the poorer
agents are favored [8, 14, 24, 26, 27] or taxes and regulations [28, 29]. here,
instead, we are mainly interested in the condensed state and in the dynamics
driving the system to this condensed state, as well as in the id178 behavior
when the system approaches condensation.

as previously stated, exchange rules are determinant of the long-time be-
havior of the system. while we can obtain an exponential boltzmann-gibbs
distribution - and consequently a maximum id178 state - if the exchanged
fraction is    xed or determined at random, condensation is the outcome when
exchange rules are so that, when two agents interact, the exchanged amount
   w is proportional to the wealth of one of the participants or to both [25] but
in no case one participant can win more that the value he put in stake. so, the
exchange process is a kind of lottery where no agent can win more than his own
possessions. one particular and widely used exchange rule is to consider that
the fraction of transferred wealth from agent x    to agent x      , or vice versa, is:

3

   w = min{(1       )w   ; (1       )w      }, where w    and w       are the respective wealth of
the two interacting agents, and    is a risk-aversion factor, so the capital frac-
tion that the agents risk during the exchange is 1        [14, 24, 26]. it is worth
noting that even approaching a condensed state, in the intermediate stages the
wealth distribution goes through a series of power law distributions where the
pareto exponent increases as a function of time [26]. the problem with the
previous de   nition of    w is that it involves a logical comparison that is di   cult
to be treated analytically. here we consider another form of    w. we de   ne
an analytical expression of    w that guarantees that no agent participating in
the exchange risk more than the quantity he can win. to do that we de   ne
   w = w   w      
w   +w       , that presents similar properties and is equal to the wealth of the
poorer partner when the wealth of the richer agents is much bigger than the
other. notice also that we eliminated the risk-aversion factor, just by consider-
ing    = 0, because we have veri   ed that one does not need the multiplicative
noise to obtain the condensed state. using this exchange rule and the methods
of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics we show in this paper that the id178
decreases in the intermediate stages leading to a condensed state of minimum
id178 (and maximum inequality, gini coe   cient equal to 1).

the text is organized as follows: in the next section we write the exchange
model in the form of a master equation that is solved by numerical iteration in
section 3. next in section 4 we calculate the id178 of the system as well as
the theil coe   cient and we discuss why in this case the boltzmann h-theorem
is not veri   ed. finally the results are discussed and the conclusions presented
in section 5.

2. the evolution equation

we consider a collection of r individuals, each one characterized by a given
value of a continuous variable w. this variable can represent the wealth, cash,
properties, or some other measure of the agent   s fortune, but it can also repre-
sent a physical scalar quantity, as energy. like in the kinetic theory of gases,
agents may interact and exchange any fraction of w. in the standard kinetic
theory the exchange of random fractions of energy leads to an equilibrium state
described by maxwell-boltzmann distribution[1]. in the same way, considering
w as representing the money owned by an agent, and random exchanges between
agents, a maxwellian money distribution is also found[9, 10, 18, 19]. however,
as previously stated, di   erent exchange mechanisms can be considered. several
of them are in some way proportional to the wealth owned by the participating
agents and leads to a condensed state[14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. here we study
a very simple non-linear exchange rule. let us consider two agents, with wealth
w    and w      , respectively. we assume that when they interact they exchange
   w = (w   w      )/(w    + w      ). it implies that when the two agents have very simi-
lar wealth, the exchanged amount is approximately half of each agent wealth,
while if the possessions are very di   erent, the transferred amount is equal to the
poorer agent   s wealth. this expression yields a fair exchange rule in the sense
that no agent risks more that the amount he can win. indeed the rule is very

4

similar to the one used in refs. [14, 24], i.e. w = min{w, w   } but here we avoid
the logical operator using an analytical expression.

we also aim at investigating the e   ect of favoring the poorer agent in an in-
teraction. condensation of wealth is an undesirable e   ect in models describing
wealth distribution and many authors proposed di   erent ingredients to avoid
this e   ect. one of the most popular recipes is to de   ne a wealth-dependent
id203 of winning a transaction. for example in refs. [8, 14, 24, 26, 27] it
is assumed that the winning id203 is higher for the poorer participating
agent. even if this recipe seems counterintuitive, favoring the poorer agent in
every transaction somehow emulates a regulatory policy imposed by a govern-
ment. to assess the e   ects of this kind of policy, we assume that in an interaction
between two agents with wealth w    and w      , the id203 p  (w   |w      ) that the
agent with wealth w    wins the exchanged amount,    w = (w   w      )/(w    + w      ), is
given by

p  (w   |w      ) =

[1        tanh (w        w      )] ,

(1)

where    may assume any value in the interval [0, 1]. this winning id203
has the following properties

    p  (w   |w      ) = 1

    p  (w   |w      ) = 1

    p  (w   |w      ) = 1

2 , if w    = w       for all   .
2 , if    = 0 for all w    and w      .
2 (1       ), if w        w                , so 0            1.

    p  (w   |w      ) + p  (w      |w   ) = 1, for all 0            1, w   , and w      .

hence, by varying    we can investigate the e   ects of a varying the winning
id203 on the wealth distribution.

we de   ne n (w, t)dw as the id203 of    nding an agent with wealth
in the interval [w, w + dw] at time t or, alternatively, as the relative number
of agents with wealth in that interval. from now on, we consider the limit
where there is an in   nite number of agents, such that n (w, t) is a continuous
function of w. the wealth evolution of such agents depend on their transactions.
assuming that i) the id203 per unit time that two agents of wealth w and
w    perform a transaction is given by k n (w, t) n (w   , t) dw dw   , with k being the
transaction frequency; ii) the exchanged wealth in that transaction is    w =
(w   w      )/(w    + w      ); and iii) the id203 of gaining or loosing that amount
is given by a regulatory function p  (w   |w      ) given by eq.(1); we may write the
evolution equation for n (w, t) as

n (w, t +    t)     n (w, t) =    2 k n (w, t)

this is a non-linear id203 conservation equation. the    rst term in the
right hand side of eq.(2) gives the amount of agents that have changed from
w to some other value. this term is proportional to the total number k(w) of
transactions involving agents with wealth in the range (w, w + dw), during the
time interval dt, which is given by

that is, r    

and where we have explicitly taken into account the id172 of n (w, t),
0 dwn (w, t) = 1. the other four terms in eq.(2) describe the in-
crement in n (w, t) due to agents that changed their wealth to w (by winning
money,    rst and third terms, or by losing money, second and fourth terms) dur-
ing dt. the conservation of number of agents is easily veri   ed by integrating
eq.(2) in w. the total wealth is also conserved. as the number of agents is con-
served, wealth conservation is demonstrated by showing that the time derivative
of the average wealth is zero:

3. numerical iteration

the evolution equation, eq.2, has been numerically iterated by dividing the
w axis in bins of width < w > /100, while the exchange rate k is taken as
k = 0.01/   with    being the simulation time step. we have considered two
di   erent initial conditions:

    a normal distribution with average hwi and variance hwi/6.

6

    an uniform distribution in the interval [0, 2hwi].

we    rst analyze the symmetric case, where    = 0, such that in each transaction
the winning id203 is 1/2 for both agents. fig. 1 shows the time evolution
in both cases, fig. 1(a) for a normal initial distribution and fig. 1(b) for a
uniform initial distribution.
it is interesting to note that after some initial
oscillations, more pronounced for the case of the normal distribution (because
at the beginning of the simulation the exchanged amounts are always very near
< w > /2) the system arrives to the same distribution. this    nal distribution
evolves to the condensed state. it is characterized by a very small fraction of
agents with wealth above < w >, and an ever increasing number of agents with
wealth very near zero. however, it is worth to note that the transient states
present a clear exponential tail (and not power law), as one can see in the log-
linear plots presented in fig. (2, where the distributions are represented by a
linearly decreasing function with an slope,      , that corresponds to the exponent
of the distribution. this exponent decreases with time as shown in fig. (2).
one expects that for t         the exponent goes to zero, indicating that all the
agents have zero wealth. nevertheless, as the total wealth is conserved a    nite
set of agents (one or a few, but in any case a zero-measure set) possess all the
available resources on the other hand, the interval on the w axis where n (w, t)
is described by an exponential increases with time, and ranges from w of the
order of hwi to a higher value of w that increases in time. after that, n (w, t)dw
decreases very fast to values much smaller than 10   9 implying that it is very
unlikely that a system described by that n (w, t) would present agents in the
high wealth interval. we call this distribution, where the number of agents
goes to in   nity for w going to zero, and goes to zero for any    nite wealth, an
l   shaped distribution.

condensation of wealth is an e   ect undesirable in models describing wealth
distribution as well as in real societies. so, many authors proposed di   erent
mechanisms in order to avoid or compensate this e   ect. one of the most    pop-
ular    recipes is to de   ne a wealth-dependent id203 of being the winner
in the transaction. for example in refs. [27, 24, 14, 8, 26] it is assumed that
the id203 of being the winner in a transaction is higher for the agent with
the lower wealth in each interaction. even if this recipe seems counterintuitive,
increasing the id203 of favoring the poorer agent is a way to simulate the
action of the state or of some another type of regulatory tool aiming to re-
distribute the resources. in order to verify the e   ect of this kind of measure,
here we will consider an asymmetric winning id203, by taking 0            1
in eq.(1). the iteration results for a uniform initial distribution are shown in
fig. 4, where we extended the iteration time from 800 to 3200 timesteps. the
results for other initial conditions are similar, as it was for the    = 0 case. how-
ever, even considering values of    6= 0, as time evolves the distribution n (w)
tends to an l-shaped distribution where all agents concentrate at w = 0, with
an in   nitesimal number of agents presenting w > 0: all distributions exhibit
peaks for w = 0 as time increases. the exception happens for    = 1, when the
peak in the distribution located at w > 0, is stable and increases as time goes

by. in this case the wealth distribution approaches a shape that is well    tted by
a gaussian or lognormal function. nevertheless, it is clear from fig. 4 that for
bigger enough values of    the time for arriving to condensation is also bigger,
so, for    nite periods of time, increasing    diminish inequality.

the fact that for    < 1 the system converges to condensation when t        
can be explained because when an agent reaches the miserable state, with w    = 0,
it no longer participates in the transactions, since in transactions involving
w = 0-agents the exchanged amounts are always zero. it means that the w = 0
state acts as a trap of zero escaping id203: and it is just a question of
time for the system to reach a state where all agents concentrate at the total
misery state. the only case when this situation does not happen is when    = 1
because, in this case, the poorer agent always wins such that the system is
driven towards a kind of equipartition of wealth. fig. 5 illustrates this point by
presenting the evolution of n (w = 0) with time, for di   erent values of   . the
fraction of miserable agents remains    nite, as in the initial state, only for    = 1.

3.1. id178 evolution: the second law

to quantitatively characterize the degree of inequality of the distribution we
consider di   erent estimators. inequality is generally estimated by either using
gini coe   cient [31], whose calculation is presented at the end of this section, or
the shannon id178, known by economists as the theil coe   cient [32]. here, in
order to compare with a more typical thermodynamical variable, we also calcu-
late the usual id178 of the system. we begin by calculating the conventional
id178, in the way it is de   ned in statistical physics textbooks [1]:

s =    z    

0

n (w, t) log n (w, t).

the time evolution of the id178 is given by

even if, for    = 0, a boltzmann-like distribution with an e   ective temperature
proportional to < w >, that is, n (w) = e    w
= 0, a visual inspec-
tion of fig. 2 suggests that this is not the stationary solution for long times
even for    6= 0: the wealth distribution clearly exhibits an exponential behavior
for intermediate and low values of w. alternatively, there exists another type
of function that presents norm 1, average hwi = 1, and leads to ds
= 0. this
dt
function is also compatible with the asymptotic stationary solution (as indicated
by numerical simulations for    < 1), and is a stationary solution of eq..(2). one
possible function with these properties type is:

nst(w, t) = lim

if w = 0
if 0 < w     wmax
if w > wmax

(8)

         
      

this solution describes condensation that, even if from an economic point of view
is the worst possible scenario, corresponds to the numerical results obtained in
this work as well as in the references quoted above. the solution is also the
attractor of the dynamic of the system:

    due to the dynamics of the system wmax is always increasing. so it tends

to in   nity for time going to in   nity.

    the fraction of the agents populations with w = 0 grows as 1     2hwi
wmax

hence tends to 1 as wmax        .

and

    the total wealth concentrates in the in   nitesimal population fraction,
having w > 0, which goes to zero as time goes to in   n-

given by 2hwi
wmax
ity.

we call this solution    condensate solution   . the id178 evolution for the
iterated distributions is presented in fig.
6. for    < 1 the id178 initially
increases, corresponding to the spreading of the distribution function. however,
when the number of agents with zero wealth increases to very high values, the
id178 decreases, indicating an ordered state: condensation of the agents in the
w = 0 state. this is compatible with the proposed attractor, eq.. 8. it is worth
to note that the id178 decreases, and not increases, in time. we may explain
this by the fact that for any initial w, an agent has a non-zero id203 of
continuously loosing wealth, being attracted to the total misery condition with
w = 0 when t        . from that state it is not possible to escape. thus, the
condensed state plays the role of a zero escaping id203 trap in a random
walk and is also an ordered state with minimum id178.

of    nding an agent with a given wealth:
it corresponds to the integral of the
product of the wealth distribution times its logarithm. an alternative id178
function may be de   ned considering the id203 of    nding a given fraction
of wealth with a given agent. to do this we consider the summation (or the
integral) of the wealth times its logarithm, and this is the id178 (or inequality
coe   cient) de   ned by theil [32] that we will call here theil id178, represented
as sw .

consider wt as the total wealth of the system and wi as the wealth belonging
to agent i. hence wi
is the fraction of the total wealth that belongs to agent
wt
i, or the id203 that a given portion of wealth belongs to agent i. this
distribution function is normalized:

wi
wt

xi

= 1,

(9)

and we may de   ne the theil id178, sw , regarding this distribution function:

sw =    xi

wi
wt

log(cid:18) wi

wt (cid:19) .

sw may be calculated using n (w, t) as follows:

sw =    nt z    

0

dwn (w, t)

w
wt

log(cid:18) w

wt (cid:19),

(10)

(11)

since wt =< w > nt , where nt is the total number of agents. then, the theil
id178 can be written as:

sw =    z    

0

dwn (w, t)

w
hwi

log(cid:18) w

hwi(cid:19) + log(nt ),

(12)

that is a more appropriate form for numerical purposes. fig. (7) presents the
evolution of the theil id178 for di   erent initial conditions and values of   .
except for    = 1, dsw
< 0 for all times. this implies a di   erent second law
dt
for the exchanges de   ned above. this second law where the id178 decreases
instead of increasing characterizes the wealth concentration process (or conden-
sation) and it is the opposite of the    equipartition of energy    obtained in the
kinetic theory of gases. this point will be discussed in detail below and we will
try to built possible physical systems with a similar behavior.

if the second law of thermodynamics, when applied to the whole universe,
has as a corollary the    thermal death of the universe   , the concentration - or
condensation - of wealth leads to a    thermal death of the market   , since the
market needs exchanges, or    ux of capital, to survive. if all agents, with a few
exceptions, have zero wealth, there is almost no exchanges. this can be veri   ed
if we calculate the    liquidity   , or the money being exchanged in the system. we
de   ne the liquidity of the market as the amount of money exchanged per unit
time:

figure 7: time evolution of the id178 for di   erent values of    and two di   erent initial
conditions.

the liquidity has been numerically calculated for di   erent times and it is rep-
resented in fig. 8. the liquidity is also a decreasing function of time for    < 1.
one can argue that this behavior of the w -id178 and of the liquidity are
artifacts because we have considered a wealth conserving system, and this is
not realistic. however, within a very simpli   ed description of the wealth gener-
ation process one can expect that the wealth production should be proportional
to the circulating capital: wealth must be exchanged to generate more wealth.
(adam smith said that trade and exchange are emblematic of the nature of
men:    nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone
for another with another dog.    [33]) in this case it is interesting to investigate
the dependence of the total exchanged wealth, c(t), with the wealth distribu-
tion. wealth concentration is supposed to decrease with w -id178 sw , then,
we represented in fig. 9 c versus sw for all times and for both initial condi-
tions. the circulating capital is an increasing function of sw , which means that
the more concentrated the wealth is, the smaller wealth production should be
expected, con   rming that even for a non-conservative market this alternative
second law is still valid.

4.2. why the market condenses?

we focus now on the characteristics of the dynamics that explain conden-
sation as the attractor of the evolution equation. the    rst reason is that the
state of total misery, that is, agents with w = 0, is a trapping state with zero
escaping id203. the second point is that, regardless an agent wealth, the
id203 that eventually it approaches w = 0 is non-null. on the other hand,
as wealth is conserved, the accumulation of agents near w = 0 implies few agents
with very large w. to further illustrate this point, we calculated the average

a transaction and of approaching the total misery state. this total misery state
is a    nancial hell, as once there, in the words of dante: lasciate ogni speranza,
voi che entrate, i.e. there are no chances to escape. the wealth distribution will
approach the condensate    l   -shape con   guration. only for    = 1 the dynamics
guarantees that the id203 of loosing wealth is zero for the poorest. this
is the one case where the    l   -solution is not the attractor of the dynamics. the
stationary regime in this model and the condition of conservation of the total
wealth implies that there are a few in   nitely rich agents, since there is not a
bound in the maximum possible wealth. as wealth is conserved that implies
many poor agents, and a very unfair wealth distribution.

4.3. lorenz curves and gini coe   cient

in the previous section we have de   ned the w -id178 or theil coe   cient.
another useful and current measure of inequality is the gini coe   cient [31]. to
evaluate this coe   cient, we    rst construct the lorenz curves by de   ning x(wz )
as the fraction of the agent population with wealth lower or equal to wz , that
is,

x(wz ) = z wz

0

n (w, t)dw,

and the fraction of wealth f (wz ) belonging to this population as

f (wz ) = z wz

0

n (w, t)

w
hwi

dw

(15)

(16)

as both x(wz ) and f (wz ) are uniquely de   ned by wz we may build a function
l(x), called the lorenz curve, as the fraction of wealth f (wz ) calculated at
a value of wz that corresponds to the population fraction x. fig. 10 shows
the time evolution of the lorenz curves corresponding to the runs with uniform
initial conditions. it is clear from the    gure that the lorenz curves present a
negative curvature whose absolute value increases in time for    < 1 and, as
one should expect, the limit for t         is a condensed state, or an almost l-
distribution for zero or a small value of   , while the share of the wealth is rather
stable and even improves for high values of   .

on the other hand when all wealth belong to just one agent, g = 1. fig. 11
shows the evolution of the gini coe   cient for the iterations starting from a nor-
mal distribution and from a uniform distribution. the initial value of the gini
coe   cient is higher in the case of the uniform distribution but for t     1000 time
steps the system already    forgot    the initial conditions and the gini coe   cient
monotonically increases asymptotically approaching 1 for t        .

5. discussion and conclusion

we have shown, both by analytical and numerical methods that exchange
models where the exchange fraction cannot be bigger than the capital of any
of the participants, leads to a condensed state and so, to a state of minimum
id178, in disagreement with the second law of thermodynamics. however, this
state is a state of equilibrium and a state that represents a kind of thermal dead

of markets, as no more exchanges are possible when all, or almost all agents
(with the exception of a set of zero measure), have wealth equal to zero. that
means that this kind of exchange rule induces a behavior completely di   erent
of the one predicted by boltzmann h-theorem. the main di   erence comes from
the quantity of wealth, (or of the exchanged resource), that the agents can
exchange. as we discussed previously, if the exchange assets are determined
completely at random, the boltzmann-gibbs distribution is recovered [9]. also,
if an    unfair    rule of exchange is introduced, for instance allowing one agent
to take all the assets of the other partner, a distribution with a higher gini
coe   cient is obtained and there is no condensed state [30, 14].

thus, it seems that condensation emerges from the fact that it is impossible
to receive more money that the quantity already owned. what seems to be a fair
exchange rule has the implication of spreading misery. to avoid condensation
and the thermal death of markets some regulation, or some minimum allowance
is necessary to favor the poorer agents. when there are no regulations and/or
when no one can win more than he has, the dynamics leads to a condensed state
and to a frozen economy. this result emphasize the importance of regulations
and also of loans, as they permit to invest more capital than the one owned
by each agent. also, politics of acting on the poorest agent, as described in an
extremal dynamics model [19], tend to avoid this condensed state.

if one wants to compare this result with the second law of thermodynamics
applied to physical systems, or to thermodynamic models for economic systems
as the ones described, for example, by mimkes [35] then random or unfair ex-
changes are essential features to recover the second law. this e   ect may seem
awkward but we can think of physical systems where the exchange rule is similar
to the one proposed here and, indeed, there exist physical systems that behave

19

in a similar way. maybe the best known example are the moderators used
in nuclear reactors, where particular materials are used to thermalize neutrons
transforming a wide distribution of energy into a distribution with a pronounced
peak in the region of energy of interest. one can argue that even if the id178
of the neutrons decreases, the total id178 of the system increases. that is a
good clue to better understand the behavior of the exchange model for markets.
if the studied exchange model leads to a decrease of id178 and then to an
ordered state of minimum id178, this is because a) each agent is described by
a single parameter, his wealth, and b) because poor agents have no possibility
of recovery. this last item is important when considering policies to improve
the wealth distribution. concerning the    rst item we should be aware that a
pure exchange models provides a limited description of markets and trade, as
they do not consider neither regulatory policies, nor production of goods and
commodities, nor salaries, nor banks, nor debts. the limitation of those models
was extensively discussed by gallegati et. al. [34]. nevertheless, in spite of their
simplicity, we think that exchange models capture an essential characteristic of
economical activity, and, in particular, of markets, i.e. accumulation of wealth
in a few hands, on the other hand they show that equilibrium is probably not
an essential ingredient in the description of markets. however, in the same way
that uniform temperature leads a physical system to thermal death, in economic
systems the thermal death is a consequence of a extreme inequality in revenues
and wealth, and we hope to have exhaustively demonstrated this point in this
article.
