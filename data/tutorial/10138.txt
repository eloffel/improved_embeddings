abstract. - we introduce a framework for network analysis based on id93 on directed
acyclic graphs where the id203 of passing through a given node is the key ingredient. we
illustrate its use in evaluating the mutual in   uence of nodes and discovering seminal papers in a
citation network. we further introduce a new similarity metric and test it in a simple personalized
recommendation process. this metric   s performance is comparable to that of classical similarity
metrics, thus further supporting the validity of our framework.

the past two decades have witnessed a network rev-
olution [1] fueled by the ever-increasing computer com-
putational power at our disposal and by the availability
of rich datasets mapping virtually all    elds of human ac-
tivity [2, 3]. complex networks and algorithms based on
these resources found their application in the most diverse
   elds, ranging from nonlinear dynamics and critical phe-
nomena [4,5] to social and economic systems [6]. random
walks are among the most prominent classes of processes
taking place on networks, being employed in importance
rankings for the world wide web [7], recommender sys-
tems [8], disease transmission models [9], nodes similar-
ity [10] and many other areas [11].

a relatively less-studied class of networks is represented
by directed acyclic graphs (dags) which occur in both
natural and arti   cial systems. their acyclicity (absence of
directed cycles) stems either from an implicit time order-
ing (as in id191 where only past papers can
be cited) or from natural constraints (as in food webs).
even when nodes of a dag do not have time stamps at-
tached, a causal structure with all edges pointing from
later to earlier nodes can always be recovered. theoret-
ical models exist for building random dags with    xed
degree sequences or with    xed expected degrees [12, 13].

acyclicity turns out to be highly advantageous to    lter
information through a random walk process. if we con-
sider a random walk on a generic network, the id203
of passing through a given node   which we refer to as pas-
sage id203   is usually not a meaningful quantity as

it may well be equal to one for all nodes in the network.
the situation is rather the opposite if we instead consider
a dag, as every random walk along the network   s edges
comes to an end when a root node with zero out-degree is
reached.

in this letter we introduce an analytical framework for
dags to quantify the in   uence of one node over another
based on the passage id203 and discuss its applica-
tions. in particular we propose a method to identify pa-
pers fundamental to the growth of a given research area
and de   ne a new similarity metric. relation to id95,
which has been used to citation data before [14] (see [15]
for a historical perspective of id95 and other    elds
of its applicability), is also discussed. we test our frame-
work on citation data provided by the american physical
society and we show that: i) the proposed method is able
to uncover seminal papers even if they do not have partic-
ularly high citation counts, (ii) the similarity metric per-
forms well when used as a component of a simple recom-
mendation algorithm [16]. note that the time dimension,
neglected by many information    ltering techniques, is im-
plicitly taken into account by acting on a dag. while we
use academic citation data to test our model and often
refer to papers and citations instead of nodes and edges,
majority of this work is general and applicable to other
dags such as those representing family trees and refer-
ence networks of patents [17] and legal cases [18].

consider a directed acyclic graph composed of n nodes
and l directed edges pointing from newer to older nodes.

x and kout
in- and out-degree of node x are denoted as kin
x ,
respectively. we further denote by ax the set of nodes
that can be reached from node x (x   s ancestors) and by
px the set of nodes from which x can be reached (x   s
progeny). since the network is acyclic,    x : ax     px =    .
a random walk starting in node x can be encoded in an
n -dimensional vector gx whose ith component represents
the id203 of passing through node i (see fig. 1a for
an illustration). thanks to the network   s acyclicity, gx
ful   lls the equation

gx = wgx

(1)

i

where w is the transition matrix with elements wij =
1/kout
if i cites j and wij = 0 otherwise. the boundary
condition for eq. (1) is given by (gx)x = 1 which re   ects
that any random walk certainly passes through its starting
point. (one can also obtain gx by simply following the
random walk starting at node x as it is done in fig. 1a.)
elements of gx are by de   nition positive for all nodes in
ax and zero for all other nodes. nodes without out-going
links are represented by a zero column in w and act as
sinks for the random walk.

to obtain a compact formalism, we construct an n    n
matrix g where column x is equal to gx. elements of
this matrix have simple interpretation: gyx represents
the id203 of passing through node y when starting
in node x. one may check that gyx = p   
n=0(wn)yx
(since w is a transition matrix, (wn)yx is the probabil-
ity of moving from x to y over a path of length n). note
that while eq. (1) reminds an equation for stationary oc-
cupation probabilities, this not the case: unlike the clas-
sical random walk utilized by id95, the stationary
occupation id203 here is zero for all nodes due to
the presence of sinks (the relation between our framework
and id95 is discussed in detail below). this concept
can be readily generalized for a weighted dag by assum-
ing that the id203 of choosing an outgoing edge is

proportional to the edge   s weight.

it is instructive to complement the above random walk
approach with an analogy based on genes spreading in a
population. in the context of citation data, consider vec-
tors of    genetic    composition of papers and assume that
each paper   s vector is obtained by averaging the vectors of
the cited papers (inherited knowledge) and by adding the
paper   s contribution (new knowledge). a similar model
based on genetic composition of scienti   c papers has been
shown to reproduce many quantitative features of sci-
ence [19]. fig. 1 illustrates this process on a toy net-
work. for example, c6 = 1
3 (c1 + c4 + c5) + e6 where e6
represents contribution of paper 6 which is, by de   nition,
orthogonal to contribution vectors of all previous papers.
vectors e1, e2, . . . therefore constitute a basis of a space
of growing dimension. the accumulation of knowledge is
re   ected in the lack of id172 of the composition
vectors cx which are of greater magnitude for recent pa-
pers than for old ones. from a correspondence between all
possible paths from x to y and possible ways how compo-
sition cy can propagate to x, it is straightforward to show
that when composition of a paper is written in terms of
the base vectors, coe   cients of respective base vectors are
equal to the passage probabilities obtained by the random
walk approach and hence cx = gx (see fig. 1). we can
say that the previously introduced passage probabilities
gx represent in   uence of past papers on paper x and, at
the same time,    genetic    composition of paper x.

given our understanding that gxy quanti   es the in   u-
ence of x on y, we may introduce the total aggregate im-
pact of node x

ix = x

gxy.

y

(2)

where the number of non-zero terms in the summation is
px := |px| (which we refer to as the progeny size of node
x). the value ix is not meaningful by itself because it is
naturally biased by the size of px. this makes it sensitive
to the time of the paper   s appearance (old nodes tend to
have greater progenies) and to the amount of literature in
this paper   s research    eld. it is therefore more informative
to plot ix vs px. a large value of ix/px is achieved when
the in   uence of x is e   ectively channeled to the papers
in px:
for example when even papers that do not cite
x directly refer mostly to papers citing x. therefore we
expect outliers in the plane (px, ix) to be seminal papers
which founded new branches of research.

it is illustrative to discuss the relation between the ag-
gregate impact ix and the google id95 score. to do
that, we combine eqs. (1) and (2) to write ix as a solution
of the self-consistent equation

ix = 1 + x

wyxiy

y

(3)

where ix := 1 for all nodes without progeny (i.e., kin
x = 0).
the structure of this equation resembles that of the clas-
sical id95 equation. the similarity can be enhanced

ix > 20+px/400 are shown). details about the marked outliers
are given in tab. 1.

further if instead of the    gene    composition spreading dis-
cussed above, we consider its normalized version. this
normalized spreading is achieved by assuming that each
paper   s genetic vector is composed by a fraction (1       )
of its original contribution plus a fraction    of the average
over its parents    genetic vectors (thus the vector   s norm
is    xed to one for all papers with at least one ancestor).
hence we obtain a new matrix of genetic composition, g  
which in turn can be used to compute new aggregate im-
pact i

where i   
x := 1        for all nodes without progeny. up to re-
placing 1      with (1     )/n (which only a   ects the overall
scale of i   
x ), this equation is identical to the equation of
the id95:    and 1        are the probabilities that the
random walk follows an existing link and jumps, respec-
tively, and i   
x is the id95 value of node x. since the
term 1        only sets the scale of i   
x and in the limit        1
the propagation term    py wyxi   
y in eq. (4) is equal to
that in eq. (3), we see that rankings of nodes according
to the aggregate impact ix and the limit id95 value
lim     1 i   

x are equivalent.

both ix and i   

x are naturally biased by the progeny size
of node x. in the case of i   
x , this bias can be partially re-
moved by setting    < 1 which leads to impact spreading
mainly over a local neighborhood. in the case of ix, we
remove the bias by placing the nodes in the plane (ix, px)
which allows us to better distinguish exceptional nodes
than the one-dimensional id95 value with one pa-
rameter (  ). while id95 certainly has its merit for
the www, in what follows we attempt to show that in   u-
ence and impact propagating without damping are useful
for dags.

we now illustrate our ideas on the citation data pro-
vided by the american physical society (aps). this data
contains all 449 705 papers published by the aps from

1893 to 2009 together with their citations to the aps jour-
nals. to make the data strictly acyclic, we do not consider
a small number of citations that are between papers of
the same print date; we are then left with 4 672 812 cita-
tions. fig. 2 shows all papers published by the aps after
1940 and reveals an expected linear relationship between
ix and px with several outstanding papers whose in   u-
ence is much greater than that of other papers of the same
progeny size. (papers published before 1940 are omitted
because of the data sparseness which is ampli   ed by the
limitation of our data to citations to and from the aps
journals.) table 1 lists the outliers together with scienti   c
prizes as a proxy for their quality. while our results are af-
fected by using only the aps citations1, one can conclude
that majority of these outlying papers really represents
exceptional research. while it is not our goal to rank the
papers, one could achieve that for example by dividing ix
by the average ix of papers with the same progeny size
px, thus making papers of di   erent age comparable.

outliers in the (px, ix) plane often do not have partic-
ularly high citation counts. when we apply the classical
id95 algorithm to our data as in [14], we observe than
many of them do not receive high id95 values. the
di   erences stem, of course, from di   erences between the
algorithms. while id95 is a reputation metric [20]
awarding papers cited by other reputable papers, our ap-
proach focuses on the progeny created by each individual
paper. in consequence, even a paper which is not directly
cited by popular papers can score high if it establishes
a new research direction or a school of thought. in this
sense, our approach evaluates originality of papers. on
the other hand, interdisciplinary works necessarily focus
the    ow of in   uence less and hence they are not likely to
score high with respect to the ix/px criterion.

x , kin

we    nally note that the de   nition of the id95 score
i   
x in eq. 4 allows for a meaningful research of outliers in
the (i   
x ) plane (see [14]), similarly as we do in the
(ix, px) plane for the aggregate impact ix. while some
papers appear as outliers in both planes, there are some
signi   cant di   erences which further demonstrate the dis-
tinction between our evaluation metric and the id95
(see fig. 3). these di   erences, marked with bold letters
in table 1, correspond to relatively recent but seminal
papers, suggesting that our method is more e   ective in
removing the inherent time bias of citation data discussed
above.

after showing that our concept of in   uence quanti   ed
by the g matrix has its merit, we use it to evaluate simi-
larity of papers. the basic idea is that papers x and y are

1for example, paper p which is not (to the best of our knowledge)
particularly outstanding owes its high total impact to the fact that
it is the only paper in the aps data cited by the high-impact paper
q. since paper q in reality cites many more papers, paper p prob-
ably wouldn   t excel if complete citation data would be used for the
analysis (this has been already discussed in [14]). similar problems
arise for those research    elds where the original work was not pub-
lished on aps journals (take high-temperature superconductivity,
for example).

table 1: an approximately time-ordered list of the papers marked in fig. 2 (labels agree with those marked in the    gure).
to evaluate the quality of the list, we indicate the most important prize received by the authors for research pertinent to the
listed papers (lm=lorentz medal, np=nobel prize, mpm=max planck medal, dm=dirac medal, vnm=john von neumann
medal). important prizes are rarely awarded soon after a discovery is made and this bias is well visible in our table. to overcome
this, we add an additional distinguishing criterion for prize-free papers: if they are described as pioneering works in a certain
domain on wikipedia, we mark them with +. the last two columns show the paper   s ranking given by the page rank score
when    = 0.5 (pr) and the citation count (cr). bold labels correspond to the papers not detectable as outliers in fig. 3.

we take

s    (x, y) = x

it is also possible to base the similarity on min{gix, giy}
or gixgiy, for example   we present here the choice per-
forming best in our numerical tests. note that this sim-
ilarity is not normalized: its lower bound is zero but the
upper bound is bounded only by ax     ay. we stress that
s     is parameter-free and hence practical to use.

the standard way to evaluate a similarity metric is to
test how well it is able to reproduce missing links in a
network [21, 22]. in practice this means that small part of
links (usually 10%) is removed from the network and one
attempts to guess the removed links by seeing which sim-
ilar nodes are not connected. a similarity metric which is
able to    repair    well the network presumably captures well
the network   s structure and one may use it also for other
purposes than link prediction. in the case of our similar-
ity metric s    , we adopt a slightly di   erent approach: we
test how good recommendations it is able to provide to se-
lected individuals. this change is motivated by potential
practical use of such recommendations for scientists who
often face the problem of searching for relevant literature

fig. 3: id95 with    = 0.5 vs citation count (with an older
version of the aps data, a similar plot was already presented in
[14]). outliers from fig. 2 are marked either with red squares
(if they can be considered as outliers also in this    gure) and
with blue crosses (if they are not outliers here   these papers
have their number written in bold in table 1).

similar    genetic    composition). to evaluate this similarity

in their research    eld [24].

our tests are done as follows. we    rst divide the data
in two parts: papers published until year 2003 (the sam-
ple set   it contains approximately 75% of all papers) and
those published after 2003 (the probe set). then we    nd
20 most-cited articles published in each core aps journal
in 2003 (we consider seven journals: phys. rev. lett.,
rev. mod. phys. and phys. rev. a   e) and take their
last authors if they published at least one paper with the
aps after 2003. recommendations are made for each test
author separately on the basis of papers published by this
author in 2003. denoting the set of papers published by
author    in 2003 as u  , the recommendation score of pa-
per x is given by its similarity with all y in this set

rx = x

s    (x, y).

y   u  

(6)

papers that haven   t been cited by author    until 2003 are
then sorted according to their score in a descending order
and those at the top represent personalized recommenda-
tion for this author.

resulting recommendations are evaluated using the
probe set which allows us to label as    relevant    those pa-
pers that were eventually cited by a given author after
2003. to curb the level of noise in the results, we discard
authors with less than 10 relevant papers to be guessed.
then we are left with the    nal set of 99 test authors who
have on average 116 relevant items to be guessed out of
almost 340 000 papers published until 2003. to assess the
recommendations, we use metrics often used in the    eld of
recommender systems [16]: (i) precision p100 (the fraction
of the top 100 places of the recommendation list occupied
by the relevant papers), (ii) recall r100 (the fraction of
the relevant papers appearing at the top 100 places of the
recommendation list), (iii) the average ranking of the rel-
evant papers qr (expressed as a fraction of all potentially
relevant papers), and (iv) the fraction of the relevant pa-
pers with non-zero score fr. a good recommendation list
should have relevant papers at the top, i.e., high p100 and
r100 and low qr, and it should assign non-zero scores to
most relevant papers, e.g. high fr (all these quantities lie
in the range [0, 1]).

to test our similarity, we compare its performance in
a recommendation process with other similarity metrics.
based on results presented in [22], we have selected three
highly performing metrics: the common neighbors simi-
larity (cn), the resource allocation index (ra), and the
katz-based similarity (ka). since they are all de   ned on
undirected networks, we evaluate them assuming that all
links in our data are undirected. cn simply counts the
number of common neighbors for a pair of nodes. ra
does the same but it values less common neighbors with
many connections,

it represents a transition between local and global similarity
metrics. when all powers of a are included, ska performs
poorly with respect to all measured characteristics but fr. by
contrast, the performance of s     decreases only slightly when
the maximal distance is above eight.

where   (x) is the set of direct neighbors of node x. we
   nally employ a commonly used similarity, ka, which
counts the number of paths between two given nodes with
individual paths weighted exponentially less according to
their length (this similarity has a close relation with the
katz centrality measure [23]). denoting the network   s ad-
jacency matrix with a, ka can be written in the form of
a series

   

ska(x, y) =

  i(ai)xy.

x

i=1

(8)

in our case, we use    = 0.75 which yields slightly superior
performance. local similarities scn and sra are compu-
tationally considerably less demanding than global (based
on the whole network) similarities s     and ska. for prac-
tical reasons, we limit the computation of s     to papers
that are not more than six steps from both x and y. for
ska, we limit its summation to the order a12 (see fig. 4
for how these restrictions a   ect the results).

similarities described above can be substituted for

s. gualdi et al.

s    (x, y) in eq. (6), leading to recommendations which can
be in turn compared with those obtained with s    . test
results can be found in fig. 4 where we plot performances
of di   erent algorithms vs the maximal distance used to
compute global similarities. results for the resource al-
location index are indicated with    at lines while results
for the common neighbor similarity are omitted because
they are always worse than for ra. in general we see a
good performance of sra with respect to precision and
recall. this is because local metrics rank only a small set
of papers (local neighborhoods) where there is high prob-
ability of    nding relevant papers. the drawback is that
only a minor part of relevant papers is found (fr     0.4)
and their average ranking is poor (qr     0.3).

at the same time, global metrics s     and ska are able
to rank almost all relevant objects and achieve much lower
average ranking, but they pay for this enhanced    variety   
with worse performance at top places of their recommen-
dation lists. when the maximal distance of    ve or more
is considered (which is necessary for making ska a truly
global similarity metric with fr     1, s     signi   cantly out-
performs ska and, from the point of view of recommen-
dation, provides a good compromise between global and
local metrics. this is despite the fact that ska and sra
are computed on undirected data which gives them access
to more information: they assign similarity also to nodes
with overlapping progeny, not only to those with overlap-
ping ancestors as s     does. further tests show that if we
prevent sra(x, y) from accessing this information, its pre-
cision and recall decrease to 0.104 and 0.124 respectively
which is comparable to the results obtained with s    . we
may conclude that s     is a reliable similarity metric which
is able to compete with other known metrics.

in conclusion, our results unveil the value of the passage
id203 in id93 on dags. on the example
of scienti   c citations we showed that it allows us to quan-
tify the in   uence of a given paper (node) on the others, to
identify seminal and innovative papers (i.e., instrumental
nodes of the network), and to introduce a similarity metric
whose performance is comparable with that of other state-
of-the-art metrics. in this letter, we aimed at simplicity
and hence we didn   t consider additional e   ects that may
have impact on the interpretation of the analyzed citation
data. for example, we didn   t consider that every paper re-
lies on general knowledge which is however never cited. to
re   ect that, one could for example add an arti   cial node
referred by every other node in the network and repeat the
same analysis as we did. further, similarly as for pager-
ank [25], our framework also lends itself to generalizations
based on assigning past citations with lower weights to
better re   ect current relevance or, more generally, trends.
we believe that our framework might prove useful well
beyond id191 as it opens possibilities for the
investigation of asymmetric interactions in dags by ex-
ploiting their intrinsic acyclic nature. the presented ideas
and tools can be readily applied to id191 re-
lated to any kind of intellectual production such as patents

and legal cases. similar networks of dependency relations
can also be found in biology (phylogenetic networks and
food webs, for example) as well as in other systems that
can be mapped into a dag, where individuation of fun-
damental nodes and estimation of dependency relations
within the graph can be useful and non-trivial tasks.
