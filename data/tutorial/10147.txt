the number of citations is a widely used metric to evaluate the scienti   c credit of papers, scientists
and journals. however, it does happen that a paper with fewer citations from prestigious scientists
is of higher in   uence than papers with more citations. in this paper, we argue that from whom
the paper is being cited is of higher signi   cance than merely the number of received citations.
accordingly, we propose an interactive model on author-paper bipartite networks as well as an
iterative algorithm to get better rankings for scientists and their publications. the main advantage of
this method is twofold: (i) it is a parameter-free algorithm; (ii) it considers the relationship between
the prestige of scientists and the quality of their publications. we conducted real experiments on
publications in econophysics, and applied this method to evaluate the in   uences of related scienti   c
journals. the comparisons between the rankings by our method and simple citation counts suggest
that our method is e   ective to distinguish prestige from popularity.

introduction

how to measure the scienti   c in   uence of scientists
and their publications is a long-term debate. although
many metrics have been introduced, their objectiveness
and e   ectiveness are always questioned [1   5]. without
a clear-cut criteria, nobody can tell whether it is fair
enough to re   ect the truth.
it is well-known that the
number of citations is the simplest indicator of scienti   c
impact [6   8]. previous studies showed that the number
of citations has certain correlation with the quality of
research [9   11], which has thus been widely used to assess
the scienti   c productions of individuals or institutions
as well as the scientists    in   uence [12   14]. however, the
value of each citation is indeed dependent on the quoters,
i.e. the researchers who cited the paper [15]. if a paper
is cited by prestigious scientists, it is probably a gem
(i.e., high quality) and is thus highly appreciated. this
important perspective is not considered in many citation-
based ranking methods. even the well-known h index,
de   ned as the number of papers with citation number
    h, also treats each citation equally no matter who is
the contributor [16, 17].

in general, if a scientist cites a paper, it indicates that
she endorses this paper as well as its authors. this can
be considered as a spread of prestige (i.e., quality, will be
quanti   ed later) which cannot be re   ected by the mere
number of citations, since citation counts only re   ect the
popularity, but not the quality or prestige [18]. as in-
spired by the success of google   s ranking system for web
pages, the popular id95 algorithm as well as some

   electronic address: linyuan.lue@unifr.ch

of its variants have been used to re   ect the prestige in ci-
tation network of journals [19], publications [20   22] and
scientists [15, 23]. since the network analyzed is a par-
ticular projection of citation network, the result depends
on how weights are assigned to links.
in addition, the
choice of damping factor in the id95-based meth-
ods also a   ects the results [23]. it has been pointed out
that di   erent from the boredom attrition factor 0.15 of
web surfers, the appropriate factor is 0.5 in the context of
citations, corresponding to a citation chain to two links
[20].

all previous studies focused on the ranking of either
scientists or publications, while totally neglecting the fact
that these two sides are interacting with each other. in
other words, the scientists    prestige and quality of their
publications are strongly correlated. it is obvious that
a paper is expected to be of high quality if it was cited
by prestigious scientists, meanwhile a high quality paper
can raise prestige of its authors. from this perspective,
we propose an iterative algorithm to quantify the qual-
ity of papers and scientists    prestige via considering their
relationship on an author-paper bipartite network. the
network is a directed bipartite network with two kinds of
links. the link from author to paper represents the citing
relationship while the link from paper to author indicates
the authorship. our method is parameter-free and can
simultaneously obtain the ranking lists of papers and sci-
entists. we perform our method on the dataset consists
of 1990 scientists in the    eld of econophysics and their
2012 papers which are published between april 1995 and
september 2010, and compare the results with citation
counts (cc rank). although our method has overlap
with cc rank, it also reveals signi   cant and meaning-
ful di   erences. the outliers indicate that some scientists
or papers with low cc rank have higher in   uence than

their citations indicate, while some are over evaluated by
merely counting the number of citations.

ii. data description

our database consists of a set of papers in the    eld of
econophysics which are published between april 1995 and
september 2010 in 78 scienti   c journals and an e-print
server (i.e., arxiv.org). the data is obtained by    ltering
the whole set of papers with keywords econophysics, mar-
ket,    nance, stock, price, minority game, money, wealth,
trade and gdp. finally, we have 2012 papers and 1990
distinct authors. actually, this data is an extension of
the dataset analyzed in refs.
[24, 25]. among the 78
journals, more than half of them contain only one or two
papers, and more than half of the papers are published
in physica a. table i summaries the journals that pub-
lished more than    ve papers in our dataset. the list of
references at the end of each paper is used to construct a
paper citation network. note that only the papers within
this dataset are considered in the citation network. thus
the degree of a paper in this citation network is indeed
smaller than its actual number of citations according to
the isi web of science. unless otherwise stated, citation
in our context always refers to the case within the paper
citation network.

from an author to papers denote that this author cites
these papers, while the directed links from a paper to
authors represent that the paper is co-authored by these
scientists. denote by s and p the sets of scientists and
papers, respectively, there are in total m = |s| scientists
and n = |p | papers. a is an m    n adjacency matrix
representing the cite relations between authors and pa-
pers, with element ai   = 1 if author si cites paper p  , and
0 otherwise. similarly, b is an n    m adjacency matrix
representing the written relation, with element b  i = 1 if
author si is one of the authors of paper p  , and 0 oth-
erwise. consider a paper p   written by n authors s1,
s2,         ,sn, citing paper p  , then there will be n directed
links from paper p   respectively to n authors of p  , and
n directed links from n authors to paper p  . note that
self-citations are not included in the network. figure 1
shows an illustration of how the author-paper bipartite
network is constructed. in this example, there are    ve
scientists and four papers with citation relation shown
in fig. 1 (a). paper p1 cites papers p2 and p4, paper
p2 cites paper p3. since p1 is co-authored by scientists
a1 and a2, there are two links from p1 respectively to a1
and a2 indicating that a1 and a2 are the authors of paper
p1. according to the citation relation between paper p1
and p2 (i.e., p1 cites p2), there are two links respectively
from a1 and a2 to p2. by following the same rules, we    -
nally obtain the author-paper directed bipartite network
as shown in fig. 1(b).

corresponding author-paper interactive network of (a), where
the directed links from an author to papers indicate that the
author cites these papers, and the directed links from a paper
to authors mean that this paper is written by these scientists.
here self-citations are not included.

iii. construction of the

author-paper interactive network

according to the paper citation relations and the au-
thors of each paper, we can obtain a directed author-
paper interactive bipartite network. the directed links

the advantage to use author-paper bipartite network
is signi   cant. it utilizes the interactions between reputa-
tion and publications of a scientist. normally, a paper is
expected to have high quality if it was cited by prestigious
scientists, while high quality papers raise the scientists   

iv. ranking algorithm

prestige accordingly. based on this assumption, we de-
   ned an iterative algorithm on the author-paper bipartite
network (ap rank) to evaluate the impact and prestige
of papers and scientists. our method can simultaneously
obtain the ranking lists of papers and scientists.

we denote qsi as the score of author si to quantify si   s
prestige, and qp   the score of paper p   to evaluate the
quality of p  . for simplicity, we consider the contribution
of each author on a paper to be the same regardless of
order. and of course, one can assign weight on author   s
importance according to her author rank in the paper.
the score of a paper will be evenly distributed to all
its co-authors. this implies that if a paper has more
authors, each of them obtains less. thus the score of
author si is counted by summing over the scores that
distributed from all his papers. mathematically, it reads

qsi = x

     p

qp  
kout
p  

   b  i,

(1)

where kout
p   = pi   s b  i is the number of authors of paper
p  . we will show later that qp   should be a normalized
score. this step is equivalent to mass di   usion from pa-
per to author on the bipartite network, which is indeed
a conservative process. we de   ne a process to be conser-
vative if the initial mass of the network is equal to the
   nal mass after the process has taken place.

unlike the di   usion process from paper to author, we
adopt a non-conservative process from author to paper.
we assume that if an author cites a paper, this means
the author votes for (i.e., gives approval to the impact of
this paper) this paper with score equals to his score qs.
clearly, if two papers have identical citation, the paper
cited by prestigious scientists (i.e., authors with higher
score) is more signi   cant than the other papers. here we
assume that each paper inherently hold one score. by do-
ing this, we are able to compare the performance of two
authors who have zero citation according to their pro-
ductivity. accordingly, the score of paper p   is equal to
the summation of its inherent score and the total voting
scores from the authors who cite it, namely

qp   = 1 + x

qsi    ai  .

i   s

(2)

to avoid the exponential increasing of the total score, we
normalize the score in the following way,

  qp   = qp     

c
qp  

,

(3)

p

     p

where c is the initial total score. at the beginning, we as-
sign to each paper one unit of score. thus c = n . then
the scores iterate following the link direction according
to the above rules. we de   ne the deviation of the two
score vectors of paper between two iteration steps as

   (t) = |   qp(t)      qp(t   1)| =

1
n x

     p

[   qp   (t)       qp  (t     1)]2.

(4)

the    nal scores are obtained when    (t) <   , where   
represents the a priori    xed precision. here, we set    =
10   4.

points would fall on the diagonal. the outliers indicate the
signi   cant di   erence between ap rank and cc rank. we label
some typical examples in red. the kendall   s    coe   cient is
0.784.

to test the above algorithm, we apply it to rank sci-
entists and papers in the    eld of econophysics. we have
tested that the ranking results are the same no matter
the iteration start from the author side or from the pa-
per side. for an author, her citation is the total number
of citations received from other papers. similarly, for a
paper, its citation is the number of papers that cite this
paper (i.e., the in-degree in the paper citation network).

a. ranking of scientists

figure 2 shows the scatter plot of ap rank versus
cc rank for authors.
if the two methods provide the
same ranking, all the points would fall on the diagonal.
it shows that ap rank can provide a score that is in
general proportional to cc rank. however, there are
some deviations. we apply kendall   s tau (   ) coe   cient
[26] to measure their correlation, which is de   ned as

   =

where nc and nd are the numbers of concordant pairs and
discordant pairs, respectively. nt is the total number of
pairs. the rank correlation between ap rank and cc
rank is 0.784. the points below the diagonal are the sci-
entists that have higher scores by ap rank while a smaller

score by cc rank, which means that these scientists are
more important in this    eld than merely the number of
citations indicate. for example, j. d. farmer who owns
19 papers in our dataset has only been cited 197 times
and has a cc rank of 30, while his ap rank is 13. the
reason is that most of his citations come from prominent
scientists and thus his prestige is improved.

the co-authorship network in the    eld of econophysics
is shown in fig. 3 where the top-150 scientists ranked by
ap method are presented. the size of the    lled circle
indicates the ap score of author. the higher an author   s
ap score, the larger the circle. the color of the circle
represents the number of citations, namely author   s cc
score. the higher an author   s cc score, the darker the
color of the circle. the width of the edge between two
nodes is proportional to the number of papers that these
two authors collaborated. from this    gure, we can    nd a
very clear community structure. the largest community
is lead by h. e. stanley from boston university. the
corresponding big and red circle indicates that he is a
prominent scientist in the    eld of econophysics.

another interesting thing is to investigate the role of
a scientist in his/her community. figure 4 shows the
author   s score as a function of the average score of all
his/her co-authors.
if an author   s score is larger than
the average of his/her co-authors (i.e., below the diago-
nal), it means that his/her overall in   uence is more than
his/her co-authors    and thus he/she may probably play
a leading role in the group. on the contrary, if an au-
thor   s score is much lower than the average of his/her
co-authors, he/she is more likely to be a follower (e.g.,
a student). therefore, this method provides a potential
way to identify the supervisor-supervisee relationship.

cc rank

fig. 5: (color online) scatter plot of ap rank vs. cc rank
for papers. if the two methods provide the same ranking all
the points would fall on the diagonal. the outliers indicate
the remarkable di   erence between ap rank and cc rank. the
kendall   s    coe   cient is 0.644.

b. ranking of papers

figure 5 shows the comparison of the ap rank and
cc rank for papers. the kendall   s    coe   cient of ap
rank and cc rank is 0.644. comparing with the re-
sult on ranking authors, the di   erence between the re-
sults ranked by ap and cc is comparatively larger when
ranking papers. some typical outliers are labeled by
stars with their publication information, including the
journal, volume and starting page. for example,    na-
ture 397 498    indicates that this paper is published in
volume 397 of nature and starts from page 498. as ap
algorithm mainly focuses on the interactions between pa-
pers and authors, the citations of a paper from some low-
score authors have small in   uence to the paper   s ranking
result. in contrast, the citations from the prominent sci-
entists will contribute more to the paper   s score. we give
two typical examples in fig. 6. although the    rst paper
shown in fig. 6(a) [epl 40 (1997) 479] has only been
cited by 38 times and has a cc rank of 52, we rank it
the third since it was cited by many high credit authors
indicated by large circles. in contrast, although the paper
in fig. 6(b) [physica a 299 (2001) 213] has 70 citations
and has been ranked 19 by cc rank, most of these cita-
tions come from papers written by low-score authors, it   s
ranked only 158 by ap.

in general, the papers published years ago are more
likely to attract attentions and cumulate citations than
the recently published papers. the most cited papers,
which are usually considered as the representative or im-
portant works in the related    eld, will further receive
more and more citations. as a result, old papers tend
to obtain higher ranks than the fresh papers due to the
cumulative e   ect as time goes on. we therefore de   ne a
time-dependent ap rank method (tap), with the score

where qap
p   is the    nal score of paper    obtained by ap
rank. the denominator is the number of months between
the publication month of paper    (i.e., t  ) and the ob-
serving month (i.e., t0). for our dataset, t0 is septem-
ber 2010. figure 7 shows the scatter plot of ap rank
versus tap rank for papers. the papers of both high
ap and high tap rank are usually the prominent works
and have long-term in   uence in the related research    eld.
one typical example is the paper    scaling and criticality
in a stochastic multi-agent model of a    nancial market   
written by t. lux and m. marchesi in 1999. this paper is
the    rst of both ap rank and tap rank. moveover, some
works with very high ap rank while a relative low tap
rank are usually the pioneer works that published many
years ago with overall high in   uence, such as the papers
   epjb 6 (1998) 543   ,    epl 40 (1997) 479   ,    epjb 3
(1998) 139    and    physica a 246 (1997) 430   , etc.
in
contrast, the papers with not very low ap rank but very
high tap rank (see the outliers in the top left corner
of fig. 7) are usually recently published papers and po-
tentially high in   uence papers in the future. typical ex-
amples are    pre 80 (2009) 016112   ,    pre 79 (2009)
068101    and    quantitative finance 8 (2008) 41   . in ad-
dition, some works which already have a high ap rank,
are ranked even higher when publication date is consid-
ered. for example,    nature 423 (2003) 267   ,    nature
421 (2003) 129    and    quantitative finance 4 (2004) 7   
are respectively ranked 14, 26 and 29 by ap method, in-
dicating their high in   uence in the    eld of econophysics,
and their corresponding tap ranks are 2, 7 and 4. these
works are very promising and may become more in   uen-
tial in the future.

c. evaluation of journals

we further investigate the correlation between qual-
ity of the papers and the quality of their corresponding
published journals. as we know, the isi impact factor
(if) which is de   ned as the mean number of citations a
journal receives over a 2 year period is widely used to
evaluate the quality, importance or in   uence of journals.
however, we argue that since if is based solely on the
number of citations regardless of the prestige of citing
sources, it can only be considered as a metric of popular-
ity, and thus is inappropriate to be used to quantify the
quality or prestige of journals [19]. therefore we consider
another metric, the article in   uencet m score (ais) [27],
as an indicator to re   ect the quality of a journal. unlike
if, ais weights each citation by the quality of the citing
journals. in fig. 8, we compare the 5-year if and ais of
eighteen selected journals, including nature, science and
the journals listed in table i. the data, shown in table
ii, is obtained from the thompson reuters    2010 journal

descending order according to their ais. for most jour-
nals, the 5-year if and the ais are positively correlated,
but there are a few exceptions. pre has higher 5-year if
than epl while with lower ais. although qf has a low
5-year if, its ais is even higher than some journals with

larger 5-year if. on the contrary, cpl has high 5-year if
while with very low ais. more detailed comparison and
discussion of these two measures can be found in ref.
[28].

than that published in low ais journals. the average
score of papers in each journal is presented in fig. 10.
it shows that the average score of papers in high ais
journal is likely to be higher than in low ais journal.
interestingly, we    nd that the journal qf has even lower
average rank and higher average score than some high
ais journals, such as pre, epl, etc. this may indicate
that    quantitative finance    is a mainstream journal of
econophysics, and thus its papers are likely to have larger
in   uence in this    eld. finally, we use the product of aver-

vi. discussion

in this paper, we proposed an iterative algorithm
named ap rank to quantify the scientists    prestige
and the quality of their publications via their inter-
relationship on an author-paper bipartite network. the
rationale behind this method is that a paper is expected
to be of high quality if it was cited by prestigious sci-
entists, while high quality papers will in turn raise its
authors    prestige. it is thus clear that ap rank weighs
the prestige of quoters more than the number of cita-
tions. the former is referred to the prestige while the
latter to the popularity. we conducted the experiment
on the dataset consists of 1990 scientists and their 2012
papers in econophysics, and compared the ranking re-
sults with the citation counts. although these two meth-
ods have overlap to some extent (for authors, kendall   s
   = 0.784, for papers, kendall   s    = 0.644), the outliers
reveal the remarkable and meaningful di   erences. we
found that some scientists with lower cc rank may have
higher in   uence than that indicated by their citations,
because they are appreciated by prestigious scientists.
some papers with large number of citations are ranked
lower by ap rank, indicating that they are over evalu-
ated by merely counting the number of citations. in other
words, these papers are popular, but not prestigious. the
fact that a paper can only cite earlier papers makes the
publishing time an important factor in the paper citation
network. therefore, the old papers will have larger op-
portunity to accumulate more citations than fresh works.
with this consideration, we proposed a time-dependent
ap rank (tap rank). the papers can be classi   ed by
synthetically considering their ap rank and tap rank.
we further evaluated the in   uence of journals by the total
ranking score of its publications. top-5 mainstream jour-
nals in econophysics were founded:    physica a   ,    phys
rev e   ,    eur phys j b   ,    quant financ    and    phys
rev lett   .
in reality, our method can be directly ap-
plied to quantify the journals    quality by constructing a
journal-paper bipartite network where the citations be-
tween journals are considered.

the main advantages of ap rank are obvious: i) it is
parameter-free; ii) it considers the interaction between
the prestige of scientists and the quality of their publi-
cations; iii) it is e   ective to distinguish the prestige from
popularity. in addition, like id95 algorithm or its

variants for ranking task in other systems ranging from
social webs [29] to ecosystem [30], the ap rank method
can also be generalized to applications in a wide range
of systems. the modi   cations and extensions of this
method are easy to be implemented. take the micro-
blog web (e.g., twitter, sina, etc.) as an example, under
the framework of ap rank we can build an online reputa-
tion system to identify the in   uential users and evaluate
the quality of their blogs (e.g., tweets) via constructing a
bipartite network where the forwarding relation between
micro-blogs (e.g., retweet) can be considered as a kind of
citation.

how to well utilize the available information to de-
vise a good evaluation or ranking method has been a
long-lasting challenge. as an issue of ranking metrics,
problems arise: is it simple to calculate? dose it re   ect
the intrinsic value? is it robust against manipulations?
since every indictor will have its own strengths and weak-
nesses, it is di   cult to design a panacea-like metric that
covers all aspects. for instance, citation counts is very
simple but not robust against manipulations. the rank
can be easily increased by the abuse of self-citations or

8

cross-citations within a small group. this is the short-
coming of all citation-based metrics, including the h in-
dex and the impact factor of journals. in addition, how
to make comparison in di   erent scienti   c    elds is also im-
portant when designing a metric. some progresses have
been made in this direction [31, 32]. for sure in the near
future, with the advance of technology, more information
and data can be conveniently obtained, and are expected
to foster the design of better ranking metrics to face these
challenges.
