abstract existing centrality measures for  social network analysis suggest the im-
portance of an actor and give  consideration to  actor   s given structural position in 
a  network.  these  existing  measures  suggest  specific  attribute  of  an  actor  (i.e., 
popularity, accessibility,  and brokerage behavior). in this study, we propose new 
hybrid  centrality  measures  (i.e.,  degree-degree,  degree-closeness  and  degree-
betweenness),  by  combining  existing  measures  (i.e.,  degree,  closeness  and  bet-
weenness)  with  a  proposition  to  better  understand  the  importance  of  actors  in  a 
given  network.  generalized  set  of  measures  are  also  proposed  for  weighted  net-
works. our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset suggests significant corre-
lation  of  our  proposed  new  centrality  measures  (especially  weighted  networks) 
than  traditional  centrality  measures  with  performance  of  the  scholars.  thus,  they 
are  useful  measures  which  can  be  used  instead  of  traditional  measures  to  show 
prominence of the actors in a network.   

1 introduction 

social network analysis (sna) is the mapping and measuring of relationships and 
flows between nodes of the social network. sna provides both a visual and a ma-
thematical  analysis  of  human-influenced  relationships.  the  social  environment 
can  be  expressed  as  patterns  or  regularities  in  relationships  among  interacting 
units [1]. each social network can be represented as a graph made of nodes or ac-
tors (e.g. individuals, organizations, information) that are tied by one or more spe-
cific types of relations (e.g., financial exchange, trade, friends, and web links). a 
link between any two nodes exists, if a relationship between those nodes exists. if 
the nodes represent people, a linid116 that those two people know each other in 
some way.

measures of sna, such as network centrality, have the potential to unfold ex-
isting  informal  network  patterns  and  behavior  that  are  not  noticed  before  [2].  a 
method used to understand networks and their participants is to evaluate the loca-
tion of actors within the network. these measures help determine the importance 
of  a  node  in  the  network.  bavelas  [3]  was  the  pioneer  who  initially  investigates 
formal properties of centrality as a relation between structural centrality and influ-
ence in group process. to quantify the importance of an actor in a social network, 
various  centrality  measures  have  been  proposed  over  the  years  [4].  freeman  [5] 
defined centrality in terms of  node degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and 
closeness, each having important implications on outcomes and processes.  

while these defined measures are widely used to investigate the role and im-
portance of networks but each one is useful based on especial cases, as discussed 
below:  

(i) degree centrality is simply the number of other nodes connected directly to 
a node. it is an indicator of an actor   s communication activity and shows populari-
ty of an actor;  

(ii) closeness centrality is the inverse of the sum of distances of a node to oth-
ers (   farness   ). a node in the nearest position to all others can most efficiently ob-
tain information; 

(iii) betweenness centrality of a node is defined as the portion of the number 
of shortest paths that pass through the given node divided by the number of short-
est path between any pair of nodes (regardless of passing through the given node) 
[6]. this indicates a node   s potential control of communication within the network 
and highlights brokerage behavior of a node;  

(iv)  eigenvector  centrality is  a  measure  of  the  importance  of  a node in 
a network. it assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the prin-
ciple  that  connections  to  high-scoring  nodes  contribute  more  to  the  score  of  the 
node  in  question  than  equal  connections  to  low-scoring  nodes. bonacich 
[7] defines the centrality of a node as positive multiple of the sum of adjacent cen-
tralities. 

for detail explanations and equations for the centrality measures please refer to 

[8]. 

in  this  study,  we  propose  new  centrality  measures  (i.e.,  degree-degree,  de-
gree-closeness  and  degree-betweenness),  which  combines  existing  measures 
(i.e., degree, closeness and betweenness) for improving our understanding of the 
importance  of  actors  in  a  network.  to  show  the  significance  of  proposed  new 
measure  in  evaluating  actors     importance  in  the  network,  we  first  compare  our 
proposed measures with  a sample simple network and then we test it with a real 
co-authorship network having performance measure of nodes (scholars).

2 hybrid centrality measures 

to  investigate  the  role  and  importance  of  nodes  in  a  network,  the  traditional 
(popular)  centrality  measures  could  be  applied  in  especial  cases.  by  developing 
hybrid  (combined)  centrality  measures,  we  are  expecting  to  have  a  better  under-
standing of importance of actors (nodes) in a network which can assist in explor-
ing different characteristics and role of the actors in the network. 

the proposed new measures work in combining (at least) two of the most pop-
ular  and  basic  existing  centrality  measures  of  each  actor.  thus,  to  achieve  our 
goal,  we propose three  measures  with an emphasis on degree, closeness and bet-
weenness centralities of the direct neighbors of an actor. this will support in iden-
tifying the nodes which are central themselves and also connected to direct central 
nodes, which demonstrates strategic positions for controlling the network.  

to define new hybrid centrality measures, we consider a network having cen-
trality measures of each node as the attribute of the node. then, we define hybrid 
centrality  measures  of  a  node  as  sum  of  centrality  measure  of  all  directly  con-
nected  nodes.  thus,  the  degree-degree  (dd),  degree-closeness  (dc)  and  de-
gree-betweenness (db) centralities of node a is given by: 

 

, 

 

, 

 

 

 
where  n  is  the  number  of  direct  neighbors  of  node  a  (degree  of  node  a)  and 
cd(i)  is  the  degree  centrality  measure,  cc(i)    is  the  closeness  centrality  measure 
and cb(i)  is the betweenness centrality measure of node i (as a representation of 
direct neighbors of node a).  

to  have  generalized  measures,  considering  weighted  networks  which  their 
links have different strengths, we can extend definitions by considering the weight 
of the links. thus, the general hybrid centrality measures of node a are given by: 

 

, 

 

, 

 

 

 

where n is the number of direct neighbors of node a and w(a,i) is the weight of 

the link between node a and its neighbors i.  

degree-degree (dd) centrality indicates the actors who are connected better to 
more  actors.  it  reflects  the  theory  that  connecting  to  more  powerful  actors  will 
give you more power. so, it indicates the popularity of an actor based on populari-
ty of its direct neighbors. degree-closeness (dc) centrality indicates not only an 

4  

 

actors     power  and  influence  on  transmitting  and  controlling  information  but  also 
efficiency  for  communication  with  others  or  efficiency  in  spreading  information 
within  the  network.  it  indicates  popularity  and  accessibility  of  an  actor  simulta-
neously.  also,  degree-betweenness  (db)  centrality  indicates  not  only  an  actors    
power and influence on transmitting and controlling information but also potential 
control of communication and information flow within the network. it shows pop-
ularity and brokerage attitude of an actor in the network simultaneously. 

4 applicability of new measures for analyzing nodes in networks 

4.1 simple examples 

to  compare  our  new  proposed  centrality  measures  and  traditional  centrality 
measures, we consider a simple network (figure 1) and calculate nodes centrality 
measures (table 1) and show the different ranks of the nodes based on each cen-
trality measures in table 2.

as  we  expect  the  results  and  even  ranks  between  traditional  centrality  meas-
ures are different except for eigenvector centrality (ce, dd and almost dc). that 
is because the hybrid centralities can be considered as variants of eigenvector cen-
trality.

4.2 a real co-authorship network 

several studies have been shown the applicability of centrality measures for co-
authorship  networks  for  demonstrating  how  centrality  measures  are  useful  to  re-
flect  the  performance  of  scholars  (i.e.,  scholars     position  within  their  co-
authorship network) [8-10]. here, also in another attempt, to assert the applicabili-
ty of new hybrid centrality measures, we study a real co-authorship network hav-
ing  performance  measure  of  actors  (scholars)  and  their  centrality  measures,  and 
test the correlation between centrality measures and performance measures.  

4.2.1 data  

we analyzed  the dataset which has been  used in [8-9], publication list of  five 
information schools: university of pittsburgh, uc berkeley, university of mary-
land, university of michigan, and syracuse university. the data sources used are 
the  school  reports,  which  include  the  list  of  publications  of  researchers,  dblp, 
google scholar, and acm portal. citation data has been taken from google scho-
lar and acm portal. our data covered a period of five years (2001 to 2005), ex-
cept for the university of maryland ischool, which had no data for the year 2002 
in  their  report.  we  followed  google  scholars  approach  and  did  not  differentiate 
between the different types of publications. after the cleansing of the publication 
data  of  the  five  ischools,  2139  publications,  1806  authors,  and  5310  co-
authorships were finally available for our analysis.

4.2.2 measuring scholars    performance 

to assess the performance of scholars, many studies suggest quantifying scho-
lars    publication activities (mainly citations count) as a good measure for the per-
formance of scholars. hirsch [11] introduced the h-index as a simple measure that 
combines in a simple way the quantity of publications and the quality of publica-
tions (i.e., number of citations). the h-index is defined as follows:    a scientist has 
an h-index of h, if h of her np papers have at least h citations each, and the other 
(np - h) papers have at most h citations each    [11]. in other words, a scholar with 
an index of h has published h papers, which have been cited at least h times.  

4.2.3 results  

the  result  of  spearman  correlation  rank  test  between  centrality  measures  and 
scholars    performance (e.g., sum of citations and h-index) has been shown in ta-
ble 3. as it shows all traditional and new centrality measures are significantly cor-
related  to  performance  measure  except  for  eigenvector  centrality  and  closeness 
which have weak or not significant correlations.

all  new  hybrid  centrality  measures  of  scholars  have  high  positive  significant 
association with their performance rather than traditional centrality measures. that 
is  because  the  new  measures  combined  two  centrality  measures     attributes  and 
highlights the importance of the nodes in the network more than traditional ones.

the  new  centrality  measures  considering  weighted  links  have  higher  correlation 
coefficients. this is due to taking into account scholar   s repeated collaborations. 

another  outcome  of  this  result  is  that  new  centrality  measure  are  different 
from eigenvector centrality and to support this we also applied non-parametric in-
dependent t-test (mann-whitney u test) to compare the distribution of eigenvector 
centrality  measure  between  two  groups  (lower  than  mean  of  h-index  and  above 
mean) and it was not significant while the t-test was significant for new centrality 
measures.  so,  this  also  supports  that  new  centrality  measures  are  different  from 
eigenvector centrality.  

5 conclusions  

in this paper, we proposed a new class of hybrid centrality measures (i.e., dd, 
dc,  db).  we  illustrated  similarities  and  dissimilarities  with  respect  to  the  tradi-
tional (standard) measures considering a sample network and a real co-authorship 
network. our analysis showed that they are good indicators of the importance of 
an actor in a social network by combing traditional centrality measures: degree of 
each  node  with  degree,  closeness  and  betweenness  of  its  direct  contacts  for  de-
gree-degree,  degree-closeness,  degree-betweenness  measures  respectively.  as 
each  of  them  combines  two  different  attributes  (characteristics)  of  traditional 
measures, they could be a good extension of traditional centrality measures. 

to demonstrate that the new measures are useful in practice to evaluate actors    
importance in the network, we test it with having performance measures (e.g., sum 
of  citations,  h-index)  of  scholars.  the  results  highlighted  that  degree-degree 
(dd),  degree-closeness  (dc)  and  degree-betweenness  (db)  centralities  have 
significant  correlation  with  performance  of  the  actors.  based  on  the  results,  we 
suggest that dd, dc and db centralities of an actor are good measures to demon-
strate the importance of an actor (e.g., performance, power, social influence) in a 
network.  

it has been shown that in complex networks, betweenness centrality of an ex-
isting node is a significantly better predictor of preferential attachment by new en-
trants  than  degree  or  closeness  centrality  [12].  we  expect  that  the  new  proposed 
measure may be a better driver of attachment of new added nodes to the existing 
ones during the evolution of the network. 

the  computational  complexity  for  calculating  the  proposed  measure  can  be 
considered as one of the limitations of these new proposed measures which needs 
more research in future works. also to generalize the applicability of the new hy-

8  

 

brid measures, it is needed to apply them in different (complex) networks in future 
works.
