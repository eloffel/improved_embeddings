abstract

in this work we consider the in   uence of mass media in the dynamics of the
two-dimensional sznajd model. this in   uence acts as an external    eld, and it is
introduced in the model by means of a id203 p of the agents to follow the media
opinion. we performed monte carlo simulations on square lattices with di   erent
sizes, and our numerical results suggest a change on the critical behavior of the
model, with the absence of the usual phase transition for p >    0.18. another e   ect
of the id203 p is to decrease the average relaxation times    , that are log-
normally distributed, as in the standard model. in addition, the    values depend
on the lattice size l in a power-law form,        l  , where the power-law exponent
depends on the id203 p.

introduction

social dynamics have been studied through statistical physics techniques
in the last twenty years. among the studied problems, we can cite models of
cultural [1], language [2] and opinion dynamics [3,4,5] (for a recent review, see
[6]). these kinds of models are interesting to physicists because they present
order-disorder transitions, scaling and universality, among other typical fea-
tures of physical systems [6].

one of the most studied models of opinion dynamics in the last years is the
sznajd model [5,7]. the original sznajd model [5] consists of a chain of sites
with periodic boundary conditions where each site (individual opinion) could
have two possible states (opinions) represented in the model by ising spins
(   yes    or    no   ). a pair of parallel spins on sites i and i + 1 forces its two
neighbors, i     1 and i + 2, to have the same orientation (opinion), while for an
antiparallel pair (i, i + 1), the left neighbor (i     1) takes the opinion of the spin
i + 1 and the right neighbor (i + 2) takes the opinion of the spin i. in this    rst
formulation of the model two types of steady states are always reached: com-
plete consensus (ferromagnetic state) or stalemate (anti-ferromagnetic state),
in which every site has an opinion that is di   erent from the opinion of its
neighbors. however, the transient displays an interesting behavior, as pointed
by stau   er et al. [8].

a more interesting situation was studied in [8], where the model was de   ned
on a l  l square lattice. the authors in [8] considered not a pair of neighbors,
but a 2    2 plaquette with four neighbors. considering that each plaquette
convince its eight neighbors if all four center spins are parallel, and that the
initial density of up spins is d = 0.5, the authors found that the system reaches
the    xed points with all up or all down spins with equal id203. for d < 0.5
(> 0.5) the system goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down (up) in
all samples, which characterizes a phase transition at d = 0.5 in the limit
of large l. this phase transition separates two distinct states of the system:
for d < 0.5 the system never reaches full-consensus states with all spins up,
whereas for d > 0.5 the consensus is always reached. other formulations of the
two-dimensional model, considering for example memory [9], reputation [10],
di   usion of agents [11] or a random dilution of the lattice [12], also present
similar phase transitions.

the utility of the sznajd model goes beyond the basic description of a commu-
nity [7]. it was applied, for example, to politics. in 1999, costa-filho et. al. [13]
showed that distribution of votes per candidate for the 1998 elections in brazil
follow a power law with exponent        1.0. based on the sznajd model, two
models with more than two opinions were proposed, considering the dynamics
on square and cubic regular lattices, and also in complex barab  asi networks
[14]. the authors successfully reproduced the distribution of the number of
candidates according the number of votes they received in brazilian elections
[15,16,17]. the sznajd model was also applied to marketing, where it was
considered advertising and a competition of two di   erent products, and to
   nance, where the authors found a good agreement between some characteris-
tics of the price trajectories (like returns, for example) and the simulations [7].
it was also claimed that some other characteristic of sznajd-like models may
also be present in real social systems, like the power-law relationship between
the time need to reach the    xed point (the complete consensus), called the
relaxation time, and the system size [11].

however, we can observe that the above-mentioned works did not take into
account the e   ects of an external    eld in this phase transition. in a real com-
munity, external e   ects may be, for example, the mass-media in   uence. it is
well-known that, in real life, the mass media (television, radio, ...) has a great
in   uence in the population, and people tend to keep or change their opinions
on any question according to that in   uence. these e   ects were considered
in some social models, specially in the axelrod model of cultural diversity
[18,19,20,21,22,23], and interesting results were found. thus, in this work we
consider the e   ects of mass media in the opinion dynamics of the sznajd so-
ciophysics model. this in   uence is introduced in the model by means of a
id203 p of the agents to follow the media opinion. we performed monte
carlo (mc) simulations for di   erent lattice sizes, and our results suggest that
the system undergoes a phase transition, as well as in the original sznajd
model, for values of the id203 p <    0.18, and that the relaxation times
are log-normally distributed. in addition, the average relaxation times    de-
pend on the lattice size l in a power-law form        l  , where    is a function
of p.

this work is organized as follows. in section 2 we present the microscopic
rules that de   ne the model. the numerical results are discussed in section 3,
and our conclusions are presented in section 4.

2 model

we have considered the sznajd model de   ned on a square lattice with linear
size l and periodic boundary conditions. the lattice sites were numbered by
one index i, i = 1, 2, ..., n, where n = l2 is the total number of agents in
the population. we assign an ising variable to each site, si =   1, representing
the two possible opinions of each agent. at each time step, the following 3
microscopic rules control our model (see the schematic representation of fig.
1):

(1) we randomly choose a 2    2 plaquette of four neighbors.
(2) if all four center spins are parallel, the eight nearest neighbors are per-

suaded to follow the plaquette orientation.

(3) if not all four center spins are parallel, we consider the in   uence of mass
media: each one of the eight neighbors follows, independently of the oth-
ers, the media opinion with id203 p.

notice that we update the agents    states in a random sequential order (asyn-
chronous updating). after the above three steps, we count one mc step in
our model. in addition, we will consider that the mass media is favorable to
the opinion +1, i.e., in the above-mentioned rule (3), each neighbor (inde-

pendently of the others) will change his opinion to +1 with id203 p if
he was not persuaded by the plaquette agents (i.e., if not all four plaquettes   
spins are parallel). in other words, we will take into account that the in   uence
of a group of agents is stronger than the in   uence of media. in fact, we can
imagine that in the real world people tend to be more in   uenced by friends,
relatives and colleagues (represented in the model by the plaquettes    agents),
among others, in comparison with the in   uence of the media (represented in
the model by the id203 p). notice that for p = 0 we recover the standard
sznajd model de   ned on the square lattice [8].

as pointed by stau   er in [24], we can imagine that each agent in the sznajd
model carries an opinion, that can either be +1 or    1 and that represents
one of two possible opinions on any question. for example, in an election, the
opinion +1 may represent the intention of an individual to choose a certain
candidate a, whereas the opinion    1 may represent the intention to choose
another candidate b. thus, the inclusion of the id203 p in the model will
take into account the in   uence of tv and/or advertisement, for example, to
provoke a change in the choice (i.e., the candidate) of that individual.

fig. 2. (color online) time evolution of the magnetization per site m, eq. (1), for
l = 73 and di   erent samples. the parameters are p = 0.03, d = 0.38 (a) and
p = 0.1, d = 0.13 (b). observe that in both    gures the consensus with all spins
pointing up is achieved in some samples, even for d << 0.5, that is the critical
density for the standard model [8].

parallel persuades its eight neighbors, the system reaches the    xed points with
all up or all down spins with equal id203. for d < 0.5 (> 0.5) the system
goes to a ferromagnetic state with all spins down (up) in all samples, which
characterizes a phase transition at a critical value dc = 0.5 in the limit of
large l. we can observe that for p > 0 this result changes (see fig. 2). in
fig. 2(a) we exhibit the simulation data for p = 0.03 and initial density of
up spins d = 0.38. in this case, we observe that in some realizations of the
dynamics the system reaches consensus with all spins up, even for d < 0.5. in
the case of a greater value of p, for example p = 0.1, the di   erence between our
model and the standard one [8] is more pronounced, and a strong e   ect of the
media in   uence is observed: even for a very small value of the initial density
of up spins (d = 0.13) we observe that the full-consensus state with m = 1
is obtained in some samples [see fig. 2(b)]. notice that as in the original 2d
sznajd model [8], the system always reaches consensus states with all up or
all down spins, i.e., there are no states with magnetization per spin |m| < 1.
however, the presence of an external    eld (mass media) changes the critical
behavior of the 2d sznajd model. in addition, if a phase transition also occurs
in our case, the position of the transition points dc will depend on p.

the next step is to analyze if the phase transition observed in the standard
2d sznajd model also occurs in our version of the model. in other words,
given a certain value of the id203 p, we want to determine if there is a
critical value dc above which the system always reaches full-consensus states
with m = 1. for this purpose, we have simulated the system for di   erent
lattice sizes l and typical values of the id203 p, and we have measured
the fraction of samples which show all spins up when the initial density of up
spins d is varied in the range 0.0     d     1.0. in other words, this quantity
f gives us the id203 that the population reaches consensus for a given
value of d. the results for the largest size considered, l = 121, are exhibited in

values of the id203 p. in the inset we show results for values in the range
0.12     p     0.2. observe that the transition does not occur for p = 0.2, i.e., we have
f (d = 0) = 0 and f (d > 0) = 1. we have considered 300 samples for each point in
the graphics.

fig. 3, where we have considered 300 samples for each point. we can observe
the transition from f = 0 to f = 1 at di   erent values of d, for a given value of
p. however, for p = 0.2 the transition does not occur, i.e., we have that f = 1
even for very small values of the initial density of up spins like d = 0.01 (see
the inset of fig. 3). the exact threshold value pthres above which the system
does not present the phase transition is di   cult to determine numerically.
nonetheless, our simulations suggest that the phase transition only occurs in
our formulation of the sznajd model for p <    0.18.

to see this picture in more details, we performed simulations for l = 121
and d = 0.01, and the results obtained were f = 0.97 for p = 0.18, f     0.98
for p = 0.19 and f = 1.0 for p = 0.2, whereas for p = 0.16 and p = 0.15
we obtained f = 0.69 and f = 0.46, respectively. we can obtain the same
conclusion monitoring the time evolution of the magnetization per site m.
for example, in fig. 4 we exhibit the magnetization m as a function of the
mc time for d = 0.01, p = 0.2 and di   erent samples. observe that even
for a very small value of the initial density of up spins the full consensus is
achieved in all samples, suggesting the absence of a phase transition (similar
results were found for 0.18 and 0.19). in other words, the mass media (i.e.,
the id203 p) acts in the system in a way that it changes the opinion of
the majority of the agents in the population, and the full-consensus steady
states with m = 1 are always achieved for p >    0.18. as above-discussed,
we are interested in the transition between a phase where the full-consensus
states with all spins pointing up never occur and a phase where this consensus
always occurs. in this sense, the main e   ect of the mass media is to eliminate

an usual quantity measured in mc simulations of sznajd models is the re-
laxation time, i.e., the time needed to    nd all the agents at the end having
the same opinion. the distribution of the number of sweeps through the lat-
tice, averaged over 104 samples, needed to reach the    xed point is shown in
fig. 5. we can see that the relaxation times distribution is compatible with
a log-normal one for all values of p, which corresponds to a parabola in the

power-law form        l  , where    is a function of p.

log-log plot of fig. 5. in addition, the e   ect of the id203 p is to decrease
the relaxation times. in fact, the peaks of the distributions in fig. 5 move to
lower values of the relaxation times when we increase p. notice that relaxation
times log-normally distributed were observed in other versions of the sznajd
model [8,10,11,25].

based on the relaxation times distribution, we measured the average relaxation
times    (also over 104 samples) as a function of the lattice size l. the results
are exhibited in fig. 6, in the log-log scale. as in previous works on the sznajd
model [10,11], we have found a power-law relation between these quantities,

       l  

(2)

but with di   erent exponents   , depending on the value of the id203 p.
observe in fig. 6 that the average relaxation times are smaller for increasing
values of the id203 p, which is a consequence of the e   ects of p on the
distribution of the relaxation times. in fact, we can observe that the peaks of
the distributions in fig. 5 move to lower values of the relaxation times when
we increase p, as discussed above.

in fig. 7 we exhibit the exponent    as a function of p, and we can observe
that    decreases for increasing values of p. it is also shown (see the inset of
fig. 7) the same data in the log-log scale. fitting data, we obtained another
power-law behavior,

       p   0.05 .

it is important to say that the results presented in this work are robust against
changes in some details of the model. for example, if we consider plaquettes
with two agents (instead of four) that try to convince their six neighbors
(instead of eight), we also observe the same results.

4 conclusions

in this work, we have studied a modi   ed version of the two-dimensional sznajd
consensus model. in particular, we have introduced the e   ects of mass media
on the opinion dynamics of the model. this in   uence acts as an external
   eld, and it is introduced in the model by means of a id203 p of the
agents to follow, independently of the others, the media opinion. the standard
sznajd model is recovered for p = 0. we performed monte carlo simulations
of the model de   ned on square lattices, and our results are summarized in the
following.

we have analyzed in detail the time evolution of the magnetization per spin
for di   erent values of the id203 p. the simulations suggest that the sys-
tem undergoes a phase transition only for values of p <    0.18. this result was
con   rmed by measurements of the fraction of samples which show all spins up
when the initial density of up spins d is varied, that is the usual order param-
eter for the sznajd model. thus, the main e   ect of the id203 p, that acts
in the model as a mass-media (external) in   uence, is to eliminate the phase
transition. this behavior is similar to the e   ect of an external uniform mag-
netic    eld h on the 2d ising model. the di   erence is that for the ising model
any value h > 0 provokes the destruction of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic
phase transition [26], whereas in our case it is necessary an    external    eld   

9

p     0.18 to eliminate the phase transition of the 2d sznajd model.

observe that the inclusion of simple ingredients modify drastically the be-
havior of the sznajd model. in fact, as discussed in the introduction, the
one-dimensional sznajd model does not present a phase transition. however,
the inclusion of a temperature provokes the appearance of a transition even
in the 1d case [27]. considering the two-dimensional model, the simplest for-
mulation exhibits a phase transition [8], whereas the inclusion of an external
   eld destroys this transition, as discussed in this work.

in order to measure the relaxation times of the model, we performed monte
carlo simulations on square lattices with linear sizes up to l = 121 and typi-
cally 104 samples. as in the standard model [8], we found that the relaxation
times are log-normally distributed. in addition, the average relaxation times
   could be characterized by power laws,        l  , where    depends on p. based
on the numerical values of   , we found that the dependency is also a power
law,        p   0.05, which implies that the average relaxation times decrease for
increasing values of p.
