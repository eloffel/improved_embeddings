abstract 

we  analyze  whether  preferential  attachment  in  scientific  coauthorship  networks  is  different  for  authors  with 

different  forms  of  centrality.  using  a  complete  database  for  the  scientific  specialty  of  research  about     steel 

structures,    we show that betweenness centrality of an existing node is a significantly better predictor of preferential 

attachment  by  new  entrants  than  degree  or  closeness  centrality.  during  the  growth  of  a  network,  preferential 

attachment shifts  from (local) degree centrality to betweenness centrality as a  global  measure.  an interpretation is 

that  supervisors  of  phd  projects  and  postdocs  broker  between  new  entrants  and  the  already  existing  network,  and 

thus  become  focal  to  preferential  attachment.  because  of  this  mediation,  scholarly  networks  can  be  expected  to 

develop  differently  from  networks  which  are  predicated  on  preferential  attachment  to  nodes  with  high  degree 

centrality.

introduction 

collaboration is one of the defining features of modern science in recent decades (milojevic, 

2010;  persson  et  al.,  2004;  wagner,  2008).  although  the  concept  is  perhaps  difficult  to  define 

(woolgar, 1976), hara et al. (2003) suggested that collaboration presumes at least two common 

elements:  (1)  working  together  for  a  common  goal  and  (2)  sharing  knowledge.  in  our  opinion, 

collaboration  can be  considered  as a social  process (bordons & g  mez, 2000;  milojevic 2010;

knowledge-based and intelligent information & engineering systems, kaiserslautern, germany, sep 12-14, 2011.

shrum,  genuth,  &  chompalov,  2007).    as  milojevic  (2010  at  p.  1410)  formulated,     the  most 

commonly used methods for studying collaboration networks have been: bibliometrics (bordons 

&  g  mez,  2000;  gl  nzel,  2002;  gl  nzel  &  schubert,  2004);  social  network  analysis/network 

science  (barab  si  et  al.,  2002;  kretschmer,  1997;  newman,  2001c,  2004a;  wagner,  2008; 

wagner  &  leydesdorff,  2005);  qualitative  methods  of  observation  and  interviews  (hara  et  al., 

2003; shrum et al., 2007); and surveys (birnholtz, 2006; lee & bozeman, 2005).  

in  academia,  co-authorship  is  the  most  visible  and  accessible  indicator  of  scientific 

collaboration (abbasi, altmann & hwang, 2010) and    has thus been frequently used to measure 

collaborative activity    (milojevic 2010), especially in  bibliometric  (borgman and furner 2002) 

and  network-analysis  studies  (milojevic  2010).  bibliometric  studies  of  co-authorship  have 

emphasized the effects of collaboration on scientific productivity (publications and citations) as 

well  as  on  organizational  and  institutional  aspects  of  collaboration  applied  to  different  units  of 

analysis  (authors,  institutions,  and  countries)  (milojevic,  2010)  (for  example  see  abbasi, 

hossain, uddin, rasmussen, 2011) . on the other hand, network studies have focused primarily 

on the mechanisms in the formation of    collaboration networks and understanding the underlying 

structures and processes leading to the observed structures    (milojevic, 2010) (for example see 

abbasi, altmann & hossain, 2011).  

moody (2004) indicated that authors with many collaborators and high scientific prestige 

gain  connections  from  authors  that  are  newly  entering  the  network  more  than  their  colleagues. 

recently,  some  studies  used  collaboration  networks  to  study  network  dynamics  (barab  si  & 

albert, 1999; barab  si et al., 2002; newman, 2001a) in order to reveal the existence of specific 

network topologies and preferential attachment as a structuring mechanism (milojevic, 2010).  

barab  si  and  albert  (1999)  originally  proposed  preferential  attachment  as  a  key 

mechanism  in  the  development  and  evolution  of  networks:  new  nodes  attach  preferentially  to 

existing  nodes  that  are  already  well  connected;  in  other  words,  to  nodes  with  a  high  degree 

centrality.  this  suggests  that  the  evolution  and  expansion  of  networks  not  only  depend  on  the 

growth  of  network  (adding  more  nodes  and  links  to  the  network)  but  also  follows  a  specific 

(   scale-free   )  pattern.  whereas  many  networks,  (e.g.,  world  wide  web,  citation  networks) 

 

2 

follow this model of competition, it has remained a matter of debate whether the model applies 

to social networks (newman, 2008; wagner & leydesdorff, 2005). 

scientific  collaboration  networks  are  a  complex  kind  of  social  networks  since  both  the 

numbers  of  authors  (nodes)  and  co-authorship  links  among  them  are  growing  over  time. 

additionally, the structure of the network (the way the authors are connected) and the positions 

of authors in the network may vary over time. analysis of the attachment behaviour of authors 

(as  nodes)  in  terms  of  the  nodes     positional  properties  may  help  to  explore  the  dynamics  of 

structural change and evolutionary behaviour in scientific collaboration networks.  

in this paper, we present a study of a collaboration (co-authorship) network and investigate 

how authors behave during evolution (expansion) of this co-authorship network. we focus on a 

specific  field  of  science   namely,  research  about     steel  research      with  which  one  of  us  is 

intimately familiar, to investigate authors    attachments to specific positions in the network. the 

positions  are  indicated  using  centrality  metrics  from  social  network  analysis  studies.  the  three 

main  standard  centrality  measures   degree,  closeness  and  betweenness   reflect  different 

positions and consequently roles of the actors in a network.  

in  other  words,  we  hypothesize  that  authors  attach  differently  to  authors  who  are  already 

well  connected  (high  degree  centrality),  close  to  all  others  (high  closeness  centrality),  or  well 

bridging  (brokering)  between  authors  (high  betweenness  centrality).  can  the  general  notion  of 

   preferential  attachment     thus  be  refined?  we  envisage  extending  this  model  in  search  of  the 

favorable  positions  of  researchers  in  their  collaboration  networks  which  give  them  capacity  to 

attract more co-authors in a next stage. 

during  evolution  of  a  collaboration  network,  attachments  (new  links)  can  happen:  (1) 

between  new  authors  (that  is,  authors  added  in  a  next  period)  and  already  existing  authors;  (2) 

among  new  authors;  (3)  among  existing  authors  who  were  not  connected  previously;  and  (4) 

among existing authors who already had at least one previous collaboration. our objective is to 

find  these  behavioral  attachment  patterns  particularly  identifying  which  characteristics  of 

existing  authors  attract  new  authors  (or  cause  new  authors  to  attach  to  them).  in  particular,  we 

investigate the following research questions:  

     how do authors behave during the evolution of their collaboration network?  

 

3 

     do  positions  (roles)  of  existing  authors  in  a  coauthorship  network  associate  with  the 

number of new authors collaborating with them at a next moment of time?  

     what types of positions are most attractive for preferential attachment?  

 

after  reviewing  the  literature  on  social  network  analysis  and  preferential  attachment  in 

section 2, we describe data sources and our collection methods in addition to the measures that 

will be used in section 3. section 4 provides the results of our analysis and finally the paper ends 

with conclusions and a discussion of implications of this study.

social network analysis and preferential attachment  

2.1 

social network analysis 

a social network is a set of individuals or groups each of which has connections of some kind to 

some or all of the others. in the language of social network (that is, graph) analysis, the people or 

groups  are  called  vertices,  actors  or  nodes  and  the  connections  are  edges,  ties  or  links.  both 

actors and ties can be defined in different ways depending on the research questions of interest. 

an actor can be a single person, a team, or a company. a tie could be a friendship between two 

people, collaboration or common member between two teams, or a business relationship between 

companies.  

social  network  analysis  has  produced  many  results  concerning  social  influence,  social 

groupings,  inequality,  disease  propagation,  communication  of  information,  and  indeed  almost 

every topic that has interested 20th century sociology (newman, 2001b; 2004b). social network 

analysis  enables  us  to  study  the  networks  and  their  participants  (nodes)  and  relations  among 

them. social network analysts argue that networks operate on many levels, from friends up to the 

level  of nations. the networks play  a critical  role in  determining the way  problems are solved, 

organizations are run, markets evolve, and the extent to which individuals succeed in achieving 

their  goals.  social  networks  have  been  analyzed  to  identify  areas  of  strengths  and  weaknesses 

within and among research organizations, businesses, and nations as well as to  direct  scientific 

 

4 

development  and  funding  policies  (owen-smith,  riccaboni,  pammolli,  &  powell,  2002; 

sonnenwald, 2007).  

in a scientific collaboration network, nodes are authors and ties (links) are co-authorship 

relations among them. a tie exists between each two authors (scholars) if they have at least one 

co-authored  publication.  in  general,  scientific  collaboration  (co-authorship)  networks  can  be 

represented  as  a  graph.  figure 1  shows  an  example.  the  nodes  (actors,  vertices)  of  the  graph 

represent  authors  and  the  links  (ties,  edges)  between  each  two  nodes  indicate  a  co-authorship 

relationship  between  them.  the  weights  of  links  denote  the  number  of  publications  that  two 

authors (co-authors) have jointly published.

recently,  the  analysis  of  networks  and  particularly  the  dynamics  in  the  evolution  of  large 

networks  has  become  of  greater  interest  to  more  authors.  given  the  increasing  evidence  that 

networks  obey  unexpected  scaling  laws  (albert,  jeong,  &  barab  si,  1999;  barab  si  &  albert, 

1999)  that  can  be  interpreted  as  signatures  of  deviation  from  randomness  (jeong,  n  da,  & 

barab  si,  2003),  there  have  been  efforts  resulting  in  a  class  of  models  that  view  networks  as 

evolving dynamical systems, rather than as static. these approaches, look for universalities in the 

dynamics governing network evolution (jeong et al., 2003).  

most models of evolving network are based on two ingredients (barab  si & albert, 1999): 

growth  and  preferential  attachment.  the  growth  hypothesis  suggests  that  networks  tend  to 

expand by the addition of both new nodes and links between the nodes, while the hypothesis of 

 

5 

preferential attachment states that new nodes attach preferentially to existing (old) nodes that are 

already  well  connected.  in  other  words,  a  new  node  is  connected  to  some  old  nodes  in  the 

network based on its number of links; that is, degree centrality. these models indicate that   as 

barab  si  &  albert  (1999,  at  p.  509)  formulated      the  development  of  large  networks  is 

governed by  robust self-organizing phenomena that  go beyond the particulars of the individual 

systems.     

2.2 

preferential attachment 

the    preferential attachment    process is based on the principle that    the rich get richer    or more 

generally    cumulative advantage.    this mechanism was originally proposed by yule (1925) (and 

is therefore known as leading to the yule distribution) and is also known as    the matthew effect    

which  was  originally  formulated  by  merton  (1968).  the  mechanism  was  elaborated  by  price 

(1965 and 1976) who used the terminology of    cumulative advantage.    all these processes with 

different names are based on a general mechanism through which a relatively favorable position 

can  be  considered  as  a  resource  to  generate  further  gains  (diprete  &  eirich,  2006).  the 

terminology  of     preferential  attachment     itself  was  originally  used  by  barab  si  and  albert 

(1999) who made the concept basic to the emerging    network science.     

according  to  newman  (2008),  the  application  of     preferential  attachment     to  processes  in 

the new network science helps to model    a quantitative mechanism or mechanisms by which a 

network forms, usually in an effort to explain how the observed structure of the network arises.    

the  specification  of  a  dynamic  mechanism  makes  it  into  one  of  the  most  important  classes 

among  the  network  models.  the  focus  is  thus  on  modeling  the  network  generation  and  its 

evolution rather than modeling the network topology (kronegger, mali, ferligoj, & doreian, in 

press).

data and measures 

3.1.  data sample 

for  our  analysis,  we  used  a  portion  of  a  large  longitudinal  dataset  which  has  been  used  to 

study the evolutionary dynamics of scientific collaboration networks of a research field indicated 

 

6 

here as    steel structures    (abbasi, hossain, uddin, & rasmussen, 2011). to construct the dataset, 

we extracted publications using the string    steel structure    in the titles, keywords, or abstracts in 

the  top  15  specified  journals  of  the  field  (shortlisted  by  one  of  the  authors  as  an  expert  of  the 

field) and restricting the search to publications in english.  

after  extracting  meta-data  of  these  publications  from  scopus  12(one  of  the  main  sources  of 

bibliometric data), we imported the information into a relational database. upon comparison with 

our originally data, we found the affiliation information to be messy with  several fields missing 

for some of publication and with different spellings of names of institutions, cities, and countries 

in  the  address  information.  therefore,  in  a  second  step  we  carefully  undertook  manual  checks 

(using  google)  to  fill  out  the  missing  fields.  additionally,  we  merged  the  universities  and 

departments that had different names (e.g., misspellings or using abbreviations) in  the originally 

extracted  records.  the  database  was  thus  made  complete  so  that  the  author  names  are 

disambiguated. 

for this study, we use only the publications published between 1999 and 2009. after cleaning 

the  publication  data,  the  resulting  database  contained  1,869  publications  reflecting  the 

contributions of 3,004 authors from 1,324 institutes in 77 countries.  

 

3.2.  measures 

a common method used to understand networks and their nodes in a static design is to evaluate 

the location of nodes in the network in terms of strategic positions. node centrality concepts and 

measures help determine the importance of a node in a network. bavelas (1950) was the pioneer 

in  this  field  who  initially  investigated  formal  properties  of  centrality  as  a  relation  between 

structural  centrality  and  influence  in  group  process.  he  proposed  several  centrality  concepts. 

later,  freeman  (1979)  argued  that  centrality  is  an  important  structural  factor  influencing 

leadership,  satisfaction,  and  efficiency.  to  quantify  the  importance  of  an  actor  in  a  social 

network, various centrality measures have been proposed over the years (scott, 1991):

     degree centrality 

the simplest and easiest way of measuring a node   s centrality is by counting the number of other 

nodes connected directly to this node. this    degree    of a node can be regarded as a measure of 

local centrality (scott, 1991). it is worth to note that a central node is not necessarily at the center 

of the network physically. the degree centrality of node k (i.e., pk) is defined as follows: 

 

(1) 

where n is the number of nodes in the network and a(pi, pk) = 1 if and only if node i and k (i.e., pi 

and pk) are connected; a(pi, pk) = 0 otherwise. 

the  concept  of  node  centrality  originated  in  the  sociometric  literature  of  the     star     (scott, 

1991)  which  is  a  central  node  with  many  direct  connections  to  other  nodes.  the  simplest  and 

easiest  way of measuring node  centrality is  accordingly  by the degree of the  different  nodes in 

the  network.  a  node  in  a  position  with  high  degree  centrality  can  influence  the  group  by 

withholding  or  distorting  information  in  transmissions  (bavelas,  1948;  freeman,  1979).  thus, 

degree  centrality reflects the node   s position and role in  terms  of popularity  and activity of the 

node  (freeman,  1979)  through  knowing  more  people.  furthermore,  nodes  with  high  degree 

centrality could be identified as the informal leaders of the group (krackhardt, 2010). 

     closeness centrality 

freeman  (1979,  1980)  proposed  closeness  as  a  measure  of  global  centrality  in  terms  of  the 

distances  among  various  nodes.  sabidussi  (1966)  originally  had  suggested  this  concept  in  his 

work as a    sum distance   , that is, the sum of the    geodesic    distances (the shortest path between 

any  particular  pair  of  nodes  in  a  network)  to  all  other  nodes  in  the  network.  by  simply 

calculating the sum of distances of a node to others we will have    farness   : how far the node is 

from other nodes. thus, one needs to use the inverse of the farness as a measure of closeness. so, 

a  node  can  be  considered  as  globally  central  if  it  lies  at  the  shortest  distance  from  many  other 

nodes; in other words, it is    close    to many of the other nodes in the network. 

in unconnected networks, every  node is  at  an infinite distance from  at  least  one  other node, 

and  the  closeness  centrality  of  all  nodes  is  then  0.  to  solve  this  problem,  freeman  (1979) 

proposed  another  way  for  calculating  closeness  of  a  node  as  the     sum  of  the  reciprocal 

 

8 

         nikikdppapc1),()(distances    of that node to all other nodes. so, closeness centrality of node k (i.e., pk) is defined 

by freeman as follows: 

 

(2) 

where d(pi, pk) is the geodesic distance (shortest paths) linking pi and pk.  

a  node  with  the  nearest  position  (on  average)  to  all  others  can  most  efficiently  obtain 

information and disseminate information quickly through the network. thus, closeness centrality 

is  a  proxy  for  the  independence  and  efficiency  for  communicating  with  other  nodes  in  the 

network.  

     betweenness centrality 

another  global  measure  of  centrality  is  betweenness  which  was  also  proposed  by  freeman 

(1979).  one  considers  the  number  of  times  a  particular  node  lies     between     the  various  other 

nodes in the network. betweenness centrality of a node is defined as the portion of the number of 

shortest  paths  (between  all  pairs  of  nodes)  that  pass  through  the  given  node  divided  by  the 

number  of  shortest  path  between  any  pair  of  nodes  (regardless  of  passing  through  the  given 

node)  (borgatti,  1995).  more  precisely,  the  betweenness  of  node  k  (i.e.,  pk)  is  formulated  as 

follows: 

 

(3) 

where  gij  is  the  geodesic  distance  (shortest  paths)  linking  pi  and  pj  and  gij(pk)  is  the  geodesic 

distance linking pi and pj that contains pk.  

nodes with high betweenness centrality play the role of a broker or gatekeeper to connect 

the nodes and sub-groups. so, they can most frequently control information flows in the network 

(burt, 1995). due to dependency of others on nodes with high betweenness centrality, the latter 

is  often  considered  as  an  indicator  of  the  power  and  influence  these  actors  have  in  a  group  or 

organization (krackhardt, 2010).

analysis and results 

table 1 indicates the growth of the coauthorship  network in this set by showing the number of 

publications, the number of authors, the number of links among them, and the average links per 

author during network evolution between 1999 and 2009. it also shows the cumulative  number 

of  publications,  authors,  and  links  for  each  year.  the  number  of  links  reflects  the  sum  of  the 

frequency of collaborations among each pair of co-authors.  

the results indicate that the growth of the number of new links is higher than the growth 

of  the  number  of  new  authors  during  the  period  1999-2009.  the  number  of  authors  has  been 

almost doubled (from 229 authors in 1999 to 409 authors in 2009) but the number of links has 

increased  more  than  three  times  from  234  links  in  1999  to  788  links  in  2009.  this  increase 

reflects  the  new  links  (collaborations)  among  existing  authors  in  each  period  in  addition  to  the 

new links with and among the new authors. for all years after 1999, the number of links is larger 

than  the  number  of  authors,  and  the  proportion  of  the  number  of  new  links  per  new  author 

increases (albeit with fluctuations) during the period under study.

interestingly the average number of links per author almost doubled from 1.02 (in 1999) 

to 1.96 (in 2009). this shows the increasing trend of collaborations  among authors in this field 

over  time.  although  2007  is  the  most  productive  year  of  the  field  (with  the  largest  number  of 

publications), the number of new authors, the number of new links, and also the average number 

of links per author is the highest  in  2009. using cumulative numbers of authors and links over 

time (right side of table 1), the number of authors and links among them is increasing rapidly, 

and also the average number of links per author increases continuously from 0.96 in 1999 to 1.42 

in 2009.  

 

4.1. 

the attachment behavior of authors and links  

in order to answer our first research question of how nodes (authors) behave during the evolution 

of  the  coauthorship  network,  we  evaluate  different  forms  of  attachments  between  new  and 

existing  authors  and  within  these  two  subsets.  since  during  evolution  of  the  co-authorship 

network both new authors and new links are adding to the network, we investigate  authors and 

links attachment behaviour first separately over time. 

 

4.1.1. 

the attachment behaviour of authors 

as an example, figure 2 shows the co-authorship network for the year 2000 which includes 

existing authors in 1999 (red diamonds inside the oval)   this is the co-authorship network in the 

year 1999   and the newly attached authors in 2000 (blue circles). the thickness of the links is 

proportionate  to  the  number  of  collaborations  between  each  pair  of  co-authors.  the  co-

authorship  network  shows  just  a  few  links  between  new  authors  and  existing  authors  when 

compared  to  grouping  among  the  new  authors  or  existing  authors.  thus,  there  are  many  new 

authors who are not connected to any of the previously existing authors.

figure  2. authors    collaboration network 1999-2000 (red diamonds: existing authors  in 1999; blue circles:  newly 

added researchers in 2000) 

table  2  shows  the  number  of  authors,  the  number  of  new  authors,  and  the  number  of  new 

authors who have attached to at least: (i) another new author and (ii) an existing author. it also 

shows  the  number  of  existing  (old)  authors  (up  to  the  previous  year)  who  have  attached  to  at 

least: (i) a new author; (ii) another existing author; and (iii) any author (that is, independently of 

whether  this  is  a  new  or  old  author).  since  in  a  co-authorship  network   we  ignore  single-

authored  publications   a  new  author  will  be  added  to  the  network  because  of  connecting  to 

either  an  existing  author  or  another  new  author,  we  did  not  add  this  frequency  of  attachment 

between a new author and any author as it is by definition 100%.

for example, the last row of table 2 shows that 373 of the newly attached authors in 2009 

(out  of  409  authors)  have  been  attached  to  at  least  another  new  author.  but  only  92  existing 

authors  (out  of  2595  authors  up  to  2008)  have  been  attached  to  at  least  one  of  the  409  newly 

attached authors in 2009. 

the results show that a minority of the new authors attach to existing authors, while most of 

them  attach  to  other  new  authors.  studying  attachment  behaviour  of  existing  authors, 

interestingly shows relatively few of them connect to any other authors (no matter whether s/he 

is a new or existing author). this rate decreases as the network grows over time. the attachments 

of  existing  authors,  however,  are  almost  equally  attached  to  other  existing  authors  or  new 

authors.  

 

4.1.2.  different types of new links (attachments) 

during the evolution of a co-authorship network, several types of new links may form: (i) 

among new authors; (ii) between new authors and existing authors; (iii) among existing authors 

who had no collaboration (link) before; and (iv) among existing authors already linked (i.e., the 

new links at time t among existing authors who had at least one collaboration at any time before 

t).  table  3  shows  the  number  of  links  (collaborations)  and  new  links  per  year  followed  by  the 

frequency of four different types of new links.

the results indicate  that most of the new links  (attachments) occur  among newly added 

authors  and  then  between  new  and  existing  authors,  and  among  existing  (old)  co-authors, 

respectively. although very few disconnected existing authors attach to each other, existing co-

authors  tend  to  coauthor  more  frequently.  it  follows  from  table  3  that  existing  authors 

collaborate  either  to  new  authors  (most  possibly  in  supervision  relations)  or  with  previous 

coauthors.  the  previous  collaboration  can  be  expected  to  have  generated  trust  among  these 

authors which in turn facilitates their new collaboration. 

the  number  of  new  links  among  new  authors  and  between  new  and  existing  authors  is 

almost equal with the exception of 2000 when there was an exceptionally high number of links 

among new authors.  

 

4.2. 

preferential attachment behavior during network evolution 

in  order  to  answer  our  second  and  third  research  questions  about  the  behaviours  of  new 

authors     attachments  to  existing  authors  based  on  their  positional  characteristics,  first  we 

calculate existing centrality measures (i.e., degree, closeness and betweenness for each year) for 

all authors, and correlate these values with the frequencies of new authors and links attached to 

them  in  the  year  thereafter.  using  spearman  rank  correlations,  we  measure  the  correlations 

between existing authors    centrality measures and the numbers of attached authors and links to 

them in the following year between 1999 and 2009. 

table  4  shows  that  the  existing  authors     centrality  measures  positively  and  significantly 

correlate  with  the  numbers  of  new  authors  attaching  to  them  (except  for  degree  and  closeness 

centrality  measures  in  1999  and  2000).  results  of  the  correlation  test  not  only  support  the 

preferential  attachment process for this  scientific  collaboration network   new authors prefer to 

attach  to  well-connected  authors  (having  high  degree  centrality)   but  also  asserts  that  the  new 

authors  prefer  to  attach  to  the  authors  who  are  close  to  all  other  authors  in  the  co-authorship 

 

14 

network  (having  high  closeness  centrality)  and  the  authors  who  entertain  the  role  of  brokering 

(and bridging) in the network (having high betweenness centrality).

we also examined the correlations between the existing authors    centrality measures and the 

number of links attached to them. the number of new links attach to an existing author considers 

both the number of newly attached authors and also recurrent collaborations with other existing 

nodes (no matter the other existing author was connected before or not). however, the results of 

correlation test were virtually similar to those in table 4.  

the results reveal that the correlation between betweenness centrality of existing authors and 

their  attachment  frequency  (the  number  of  new  authors  and  links  attached  to  them)  in  the 

following  year  is  always  significant  and  much  higher  than  the  degree  and  closeness  centrality 

measures  during  the  evolution  of  this  collaboration  network  over  time.  in  other  words,  authors 

with high betweenness centrality attract more new co-authors than the well-connected authors or 

the authors who are close to all others.  

it  is  worth  to  note  that  looking  at  each  centrality  measure  values  over  time,  the  correlation 

between  the  number  of  newly  attached  authors  and  degree  centrality  remains  almost  constant 

(with  some  fluctuation).  but  for  closeness  centrality,  the  correlation  is  fluctuating  and  for 

betweenness  centrality  it  is  increasing  over  time.  therefore,  we  may  infer  that  as  the 

collaboration  network  grows,  betweenness  centrality  becomes  increasingly  important  for 

attachments  or,  in  other  words,  authors  with  high  betweenness  centrality  gain  more  power  and 

influence  to  attract  new  co-authors.  an  increasing  number  of  authors  prefer  to  attach  to  the 

 

15 

existing  authors  who  are  controlling  the  flow  of  information  (communication)  by  having  a 

brokering (or bridging) role in the collaboration network. 

in  table  5,  we  provide  the  (rank-order)  correlations  between  existing  authors     centrality 

measures for each year and their number of co-authors in the next year. the results indicate that 

the  correlation  coefficient  is  highest  for  degree  centrality  (as  expected  because  of  the 

accumulative  design)  followed  by  closeness  centrality  and  thereafter  betweenness  centrality. 

these results show that authors who have a larger number of co-authors can be expected to have 

many  co-authors in  the following period.  furthermore, authors with  higher  closeness  centrality 

measures  can  be  expected  to  have  more  co-authors  (in  the  following  period)  than  the  authors 

with higher betweenness centrality measure.

while  the  coefficient  values  follow  an  increasing  trend  over  time  for  degree  centrality,  this 

trend is negative for closeness and is  approximately  stable for betweenness centrality  (ignoring 

the first  period).  one  can  consider that authors     degree centrality is  always increasing  over the 

evolution  of  their  co-authorship  network  considering  an  accumulative  design.  but  authors    

closeness  and  betweenness  measures  vary  in  each  period  as  these  are  global  measures  which 

depend on the topology of the network in each period. therefore, it follows from the design that 

the correlation coefficients for degree centrality are very high and increasing. 

 

16 

furthermore, in order to see how the position of existing authors in terms of these centrality 

measures  have  an  impact  on  the  number  of  newly  attached  authors  to  them,  we  compared  the 

average numbers of new authors relative to authors with low and high centrality measures. the 

mean of each centrality measure is used as a threshold for dividing authors  into two categories 

having  low  or  high  centrality  measure.  table  6  shows  the  average  number  of  new  authors  for 

each category in each period.

the  results  in  table  6  show  that  authors  with  high  values  for  degree  centrality  have  on 

average larger number of new co-authors compared to low-degree authors. this is the same for 

the  authors  with  high  closeness  and  betweenness.  authors  with  on  average  high  betweenness 

centrality values have the largest number of new co-authors in each period. this effect increases 

over time.  

furthermore,  authors  with  low  degree  centrality  have  the  lowest  number  of  new  co-authors 

(on  average)  in  each  period.  these  results  not  only  confirm  our  previous  findings  that  the 

betweenness centrality of authors is more important than their degree or closeness, but also show 

a large gap in preferential attachment between  authors with high betweenness centrality, on the 

one side, and high degree or closeness centrality, on the other.

discussion and conclusion 

in order to investigate the attachment behaviour of authors during the temporal evolution of their 

co-authorship networks, we examined whether central positions (and roles) in the collaboration 

network  generate  further  gains  in  attractivity  to  new  nodes.  network  science  has  introduced 

centrality measures as proxies for specific positions and roles of the nodes in a network. in this 

study  of  the  evolution  of  the  co-authorship  relations  among  researchers  in     steel  structure    

(between  1999  and  2009)  we  assessed  the  extent  to  which  the  main  centrality  measures  (i.e., 

degree, closeness and betweenness) associated with the expectation of new co-authorships. 

the results show that all three centrality values of existing authors correlate to the attachment 

frequency of new authors to them. however, more authors prefer to attach to authors who have 

higher  betweenness  centrality  rather  than  those  with  higher  degree  or  closeness  centrality.  in 

other  words,  during  network  evolution  existing  authors  who  have  the  power  of  controlling  the 

communication  and  information  flow  (that  is,  higher  betweenness  centrality),  attract  more  new 

co-authors than authors who have more co-authorship links (degree centrality) or those who have 

more direct connection to all other nodes in the network (closeness centrality).  

our results also indicate that a relatively small number of new authors attach to the existing 

authors.  during  the  evolution  of  scientific  collaboration  networks,  new  authors  not  necessarily 

attach  to  existing  authors  and  thus  add  to  the  coherence  in  the  network.  we  find  that  also  few 

existing authors have a new collaboration (to any author) in the following year (on average 8%); 

this percentage is almost equal to that for new authors. existing authors prefer to coauthor with 

others  with  whom  they  already  coauthored  before.  furthermore,  we  found  that  authors  rarely 

initiate coauthorship relations with other authors who have already published in their domain, but 

prefer  to  have  collaboration  with  new  authors.  probably,  a  large  proportion  of  this  category 

consists  of  collaborations  between  supervisors  and  their  students.  in  a  co-authorship  network, 

authors  with  high  betweenness  centrality  seem  to  be  supervisors,  since  they  usually  have 

publications  with  both  other  colleagues  and  their  graduate  students  during  their  academic  life. 

this gives them the brokering (bridging) role to connect students to other colleagues or students. 

 

18 

one  of  our  questions  was  to  examine  whether  preferential  attachment  played  a  role  in  the 

temporal  evolution  of  scientific  collaboration  networks  following  previous  studies  in  which 

preferential attachment was found in the evolution of a large number of network types, including 

scientific  collaboration  networks.  whereas  this  was  shown,  our  main  novel  contribution, 

however, is  that we found another property of authors than their degree, namely,  the brokering 

role, based on their position in their of co-authorship networks (i.e., betweenness centrality) to be 

driving  the  coauthorship  network.  betweenness  centrality  indicates  the  preferential  attachment 

process  among  authors  during  the  network  evolution  more  than  the  number  of  links  one  has 

accumulated (i.e., degree centrality).  

a limitation of this study remains that we studied the single case of one field, namely research 

about     steel  structures   .  our  contribution,  therefore,  provides  mainly  a  hypothesis.  in  order  to 

generalize  these  findings,  one  would  need  to  investigate  other  scientific  domains.  if  this 

relationship  between  betweenness  centrality  in  coauthorship  networks  and  new  entrants  to  the 

field is systematic, it might help policy and decision makers to identify key actors who facilitate 

the  flow  of  information  by  attaching  new  actors  during  the  evolution  and  expansion  of  the 

networks.  this  helps  to  control  the  distribution  of  resources,  information  dissemination,  and 

propagation based on a typology of network positions.
