the study of human interactions is of central importance for understanding the behavior of
individuals, groups and societies. here, we observe the formation and evolution of networks by
monitoring the addition of all new links and we analyze quantitatively the tendencies used to create
ties in these evolving online a   liation networks. we    rst show that an accurate estimation of
these probabilistic tendencies can only be achieved by following the time evolution of the network.
for example, the actions that are attributed to the usual friend of a friend mechanism through
a statistical analysis of a static snapshot of the network are overestimated by a factor of two. a
detailed analysis of the dynamic network evolution shows that half of those triangles were generated
through other mechanisms, in spite of the characteristic static pattern. id136s about the reason
for the existence of links using statistical analysis of network snapshots must therefore be made with
great caution. here, we start by characterizing every single link when the tie was established in the
network. this information allows us to describe the probabilistic tendencies of tie formation and
extract sociological conclusions as follows. the tendencies to add new links di   er signi   cantly from
what we would expect if they would have not been a   ected by the individuals    structural position
in the network, i.e., from random link formation. we also    nd signi   cant di   erences in behavioral
traits in the social tendencies among individuals according to their degree of activity, gender, age,
popularity and other attributes. for instance, in the particular datasets analyzed here, we    nd that
women reciprocate connections three times as much as men and that this di   erence increases with
age. men tend to connect with the most popular people more often than women across all ages. on
the other hand, triangular ties tendencies are similar, independent of gender, and show an increase
with age. our    ndings can be useful to build models of realistic social network structures and to
discover the underlying laws that govern establishment of ties in evolving social networks.

i.

introduction

uncovering patterns of human behavior addresses fun-
damental questions about the structure of the society we
live in. the choices made at the individual level deter-
mine the emergent complex global network underlying a
given social structure [1]. conversely, the structure of the
social network that constitutes an individual   s commu-
nity also a   ects to a large extent the individual   s ability
to act. for instance, the position in the network struc-
ture may facilitate one   s ability to interact with others by
providing information of possible choices and their conse-
quences [2], or by supplying the individual with di   erent
kinds of material and immaterial resources [3]. on the
other side, this structure may also limit this individual   s
ability to act by excluding information [2] through local
social norms and through social control.

detecting regularities and motifs in the development
of social networks provides signi   cant tools for the un-
derstanding of the structure of society. thus, a number
of statistical association models have been proposed to
link a social network structure to a statistically signi   -
cant social mechanism of interaction [4]. social theoreti-
cal frameworks [5], like the multitheoretical multilevel
(mtml) formalism [6], have proposed a set of mecha-
nisms of social interaction to describe the probabilistic
tendencies of creation, maintenance, dissolution, and re-
constitution of interpersonal ties during the evolution of

a social network. examples of mechanisms include (see
fig 1a): 1) reciprocity (named social exchange after the
most likely social mechanism), 2) friend of a friend ties
or closing triangles (balance), 3) exploration of distant
network areas which require at least 3 steps from the po-
sition of the person in the current network (self-interest
theories), 4) ties facilitating dissemination of information
by linking to well-connected people (named collective ac-
tion or preferential attachment [7]), and 5) links that act
as bridges between two sub-networks that are not directly
linked (structural hole mechanism). contractor et al. [6]
have further identi   ed a set of probabilistic tendencies
for ties to be present or absent in networks that the dif-
ferent families of theoretical mechanisms may cause. one
important conclusion [6] is that a given family of theo-
retical mechanisms may generate di   erent probabilistic
tendencies for ties to be present or absent. furthermore,
the same probabilistic tendency may be caused by sev-
eral di   erent families of theoretical mechanisms. in the
present study we aim to unravel signi   cant patterns in
these social mechanisms of human interaction by mon-
itoring and analyzing the time evolution of the actions
of members of two online a   liation networks. the term
a   liation refers to data based on co-membership or co-
participation in events, where here members use the in-
ternet to interact with each other through the online sites
[8]. a connection in such sites may indicate underlying
social ties [9].

2

in principle, a formal statistical analysis, such as ex-
ponential random graph models [4, 10] would search for
regularities or motifs in the social structure by comparing
a static snapshot of the network with a suitable ensemble
of equiprobable random con   gurations. however, this
approach cannot characterize the decisions taken (con-
sciously or not) at the individual level on the type of
mechanism used for an established connection. a direct
application of a statistical analysis to evolving networks
may not be able to resolve the full spectrum of human in-
teractions. this is due to the inherent history-dependent
nature of social interactions, i.e., the interaction mech-
anisms determine the evolving network, which, in turn,
conditions the human choices of interaction. figures 1b
and 1c illustrate this point during the generation of a hy-
pothetical triangular xyz relation at time t. this static
pattern may be associated with a balance mechanism for
the tie xz (friend of a friend) as a result of closing the tri-
angle as shown in fig. 1b. however, a closer inspection of
the time evolution of tie formation reveals the possibility
of a di   erent classi   cation of the xz link, where agent x
has used the distant mechanism at time t     2 to connect
with z as in fig. 1c. as we show later, in fig. 7, the ac-
tual number of balance links is over-estimated by a factor
of 2 when we use static snapshots of real communities.

the above example can be generalized to the global
network level. for instance, an agent may decide to con-
nect to agents that are far away in the network (distant
mechanism). eventually, individuals are brought closer
to each other to form a tightly connected cluster. the
evolving nature of the network may change those initial
distant interactions into balance, as new relations are cre-
ated in the network. therefore, the precise knowledge of
the time evolution of each tie in the network is crucial
to unravel the relevant behavioral mechanisms in a real
community.

here, we present a microscopic and temporal statisti-
cal analysis of the evolution of two online social networks;
one from its original inception and the other after it is
well developed. we aim to uncover how the combination
of di   erent social mechanisms eventually shapes the in-
teraction network. our longitudinal approach focuses on
characterizing each interpersonal tie at the time when it
is established. the knowledge of the order in which each
link was formed allows us to characterize social patterns
that cannot be derived from statistical analysis of static
snapshops of the networks.

ii. datasets and methods

we study the a   liation networks of two online social
networking sites in sweden, pussokram.com [11] and qx.se
[12]. both datasets were de-identi   ed in their source.
the pussokram community (pok for brevity) is used
mainly by swedish young adults for friendship, including
dating and non-romantic relations. activity in the com-
munity was recorded for 512 consecutive days, starting

fig. 1. (a) the    ve probabilistic tendencies we used to clas-
sify the interactions. black arrows indicate existing links and
red arrows are the possible options for a new link, according
to the following tendencies: 1. social exchange, which corre-
sponds to establishing a reciprocal link, i.e. add as favorite
someone who has already added us to their favorite lists, 2.
balance, where we select a favorite who is in the list of one of
our existing favorites (friend of a friend), 3. distant connec-
tion, where the connection is to a member with whom there
is no proximity, i.e., one needs at least three links to reach
this member, 4. collective action, where we connect to a per-
son whose connectivity is well above the average connectivity
in the community (we quantify this behavior by examining
whether the total degree of the receiving agent belongs to the
upper 5% of the degree distribution at the given time), and
5. structural hole, where a link connects two otherwise not
connected clusters of at least 3 members each, and which are
otherwise not directly linked to each other (in the picture this
link would connect the cluster of people in hats with the red-
haired cluster). (b,c) why we cannot extract tendencies from
a static snapshot: in the presented example a triangle relation
is built from time t     2 to time t under two di   erent scenarios
that lead to the same resulting triangle. (b) the ties x-y and
y-z can be formed, at times t     2 and t     1 respectively, via
distant mechanisms resulting in a balance mechanism for the
formation of x-z at time t. here x uses a friend of a friend
to be introduced to z. (c) a di   erent path, though, would
classify the x-z tie di   erently.
if x connected to z before
connecting to y, then the x-z link represents a distant ten-
dency, since there is no close connections between them. a
static network analysis would suggest that x used balance to
connect to z, instead.

on the day that the site was created in 2001. at the end
of recording, the community had 28,876 members with a
mean user age of 21 years who have performed    190,000
interactions. the qx site is the nordic region   s largest
and most active web community for homosexual, bisex-
ual, transgender, and queer people. the site is also fre-
quently used by heterosexual men and women. activity
among the users was recorded during two months starting
november, 2005. at that time there were     180, 000 reg-
istered members; 80,426 of them were active during the
recording period establishing more than 1 million ties.

there are many types of interactions between mem-
bers in the two communities under study, but we focus
on those which imply a    rmer commitment than, e.g.,
simply sending a message [13]. such interactions are (a)
the favorites list in qx, and (b) the guestbook signing in
qx and pok. the former interaction represents a clear
declaration of approval and/or interest, while the latter
is a communication publicly accessible to all community
members where a link does not necessarily indicate a par-
ticularly close relationship. we compare two means of
interaction in one community (favorites list and guest-
book signing in qx) and the same type of interaction
(guestbook signing) in two communities (qx and pok).
we use the guestbook signing to test consistent trends in
the results.

in the qx dataset, it is possible that a user can remove
a contact at any point. there was a small number of
such links, in total less than 1% of the total links, that
were removed during our monitoring window.
it may
be interesting to study the conditions of ties removal in
parallel with the addition process, but the small number
of removed contacts does not in   uence our results here,
and we do not further pursue this topic.

each individual knows the following structural infor-
mation from the a   liation network: (a) who has added
her in their favorites list or who has written in her guest-
book, (b) the members that she has added in her favorites
list and, (c) the friends of her friends since the user can
access the favorite list of friends. this subnetwork de-
   nes the immediate neighborhood of a member. actions
involving this neighborhood are captured by social ex-
change and balance mechanisms. the members situated
farther away than this immediate neighborhood are con-
sidered to belong to the rest of the network for which the
user has no direct information. interactions with these
members are classi   ed as distant. a collective action can
also be a conscious choice, since a member can assess the
popularity of others through access to their favorite list,
but it is also possible that this action may not be con-
scious. structural hole requires a much wider knowledge
of the network structure, and thus is the only mechanism
that a member does not realize that is using.

our analysis can be readily extended to treat more
general situations. for simplicity, though, here we will
not evaluate exogenous mechanisms where interactions
are based on attributes of the actors, such as homophily,
common interests, etc [6]. we will further not study the

3

e   ect of focus constraints, i.e., the increased likelihood
of a tie being present among people that share a social
context, for example, living close to each other geograph-
ically or working at the same o   ce [14]. the crux of the
matter is to quantify the di   erent probabilistic tenden-
cies about the actions of the users as they are determined
by the knowledge of the user about the structure of the
a   liation network that is the vital part of his/her social
life in the community.

the detailed quality of our longitudinal data allows
us to identify the precise probabilistic tendencies for tie
formation that a newly established link corresponds to,
when an actor adds a new favorite in his list (or signs
a guestbook). every interaction that occurred between
two members was recorded together with the timestamp
when the event took place. we create the evolving net-
work of interacting agents by adding the directed links in
sequential order. for example, at the time when a mem-
ber x adds a member y in the favorite list of x, we create
a directional link from x to y. similarly, in guestbook
signing, the directional link from x to y corresponds to
x writing in y   s guestbook (we take into account only
the    rst time x signs y   s guestbook and ignore repeated
signings). every time we add a link, we characterize this
action according to the probabilistic tendencies described
in fig. 1a, as dictated by the network con   guration at
the given moment. every link is therefore assigned to
one or more probabilistic tendencies: exchange, balance,
distant, collective action, and structural hole. we de   ne
the probabilities of each tendency pexc, pbal, pdis, pca,
and psh respectively, as the number of links that were
created using the corresponding tendency normalized by
the total number of links created up to a given time t.

a newly formed link is assigned to the exchange ten-
dency when it is established in the opposite direction
of an existing link. the balance tendency corresponds
to a directed network distance     = 2, i.e. when a link
points to a friend of a friend (    is the directed distance
between two nodes just before the link is formed - de-
   ned as the shortest path with all arrows pointing to the
same direction, so that a directed path exists between
these two nodes). if the distance between the two nodes
is         3, the link represents the distant tendency. a link
is considered as collective action when the chosen node
is a hub. we de   ne a hub as a node whose total degree
(counting both incoming and outgoing links) belongs to
the upper 5% of the degree distribution as measured at
the time of link formation. a link represents the struc-
tural hole tendency when this link connects two clusters
of at least three members each that would otherwise be
disconnected. table 1 summarizes these de   nitions.

in general, the increase in the id203 of a tie form-
ing under a given tendency will not necessarily be com-
pensated for by a tie with decreased id203 under
another tendency. the relative probabilities between ten-
dencies do not necessarily present competing risks and
di   erent tendencies may act at the same time. it is then
possible that one link jointly represents more than one

type of tendency in tie formation. in this case, we assign
this action to all involved tendencies. for instance, a bal-
ance tie could be also catalogued as collective action if the
agent closes a triangle by connecting to a hub. based on
the de   nitions, only balance and distant tendencies are
complementary to each other (pbal +pdis = 1) so that the
presence of one excludes the presence of the other. the
other tendencies are normalized as, e.g., pca+pnot   ca = 1
(pnot   ca is the id203 of not performing a collective
action).

by establishing all links in the order they appeared, we
can recreate the entire history of the directed network of
interactions. while pok starts at t = 0 from an empty
network, qx has a large part of the network already in
place at t = t0, our initial recording date. in this case,
we know all the existing links at t = t0. thus, in qx,
we characterize only the network links that were added
during the monitoring period.

figure 2 presents the fraction of appearance of each
tendency when considering all recorded interactions in
the studied datasets, qx and pok, and the means of
interaction, guestbook and favorite list.

the results are fairly independent of the speci   c com-
munity and the means of interaction. the probabilities
pexc, pbal, and pca, appear each at approximately 15-30%
of all actions. the distant mechanism is dominant, with
pdis     80% of the established links. collective action re-
mains low at pca     20% considering that this tendency
is considered the main driver in some models of network
formation through preferential attachment [7, 15]. a very
small fraction of links psh       lls    the structural holes. this
is a result of the small numbers of clusters that exist in
each community, so that the chances to connect isolated
clusters are small. in particular, comparison to the ran-
dom case (where the same members act at each time
step, but instead of the established link they choose a
random connection, fig. 2, yellow bars) reveals that the
structural hole tendency is more probable when an agent
connects to a random member. in other words, although
there exist opportunities for structural hole, the mem-
bers tend to stay within their own sub-networks, despite
the lack of knowledge on the global structure. the per-
centages for the other tendencies are also very di   erent

dencies in the actions of the community members in qx using
favorites (red), in qx using guestbook (green), and in pok
using guestbook (blue). these tendencies are compared to a
completely random selection (yellow). exchange and balance
are practically non-existent in random selections, but carry
signi   cant weight in the interactions of the real communities.
connecting to distant members appears in the community
much less frequently than in random, while the preference to-
wards well-connected agents (collective action) is signi   cantly
more prominent. finally, structural hole is signi   cantly sup-
pressed in the real communities compared to the randomized
case.

from random selections. this implies that community
members follow social criteria when adding new favorite
members (or sign guestbooks). we veri   ed the robust-
ness of our results by comparing the percentages of the
links at the early stages of network formation with those
of the links that were established later in the process.
for example, in qx favorites the    rst half of the actions
dataset gives practically the same result as the second
half: exchange was 13.8% for the    rst half and 13.9% for
the second, balance was used 22.1% versus 22.4%, and
collective action was used 18.8% versus 19.7%. further-
more, the stability of this result over the evolution of the
links is veri   ed later, in fig. 7.

our analysis has shown that the direct calculation of
the tendencies of link formation from the time evolution
of the network provides a consistent characterization of
the social mechanisms involved, which is di   erent from
a static snapshot. furthermore, the present analysis al-
lows to determine if the found tendencies are in   uenced
by important actor attributes that are hypothesized to
have an association with ties formation [16]. these at-
tributes include age, gender, popularity and activity in-
tensity measured as the number of links developed at a
given time. next, we incorporate these attributes in our
analysis to attempt to understand how di   erent factors
in   uence the behavior of the actors. we show that the

to a di   erent id203 of using a given tendency.

iii. results

a. gender in   uence

our analysis reveals that gender is an important at-
tribute determining the social tendencies. analysis of
the qx community (the only one reporting gender) re-
veals that men do not use some mechanisms in the same
way as women (fig. 3). using the gender information in
the qx favorite lists, we    nd that a female member is al-
most three times more probable to have an exchange ten-
dency compared to male members and three times more
probable to    ll structural holes (men, on the other side,
perform distant and collective actions at higher percent-
ages). the signi   cant di   erence in exchange, for exam-
ple, reveals a di   erent approach of online communication
between men and women [17]. our result is in agree-
ment with the self-reported tendency of women users
to exchange more private e-mails than participating in
public discussions [18]. the stronger preference for ex-
change of female users in the qx community can also
be seen as a similar trait where women tend to develop
stronger inter-personal relations by frequently reciprocat-
ing friendships.

b. age in   uence

in the databases that we studied, members of di   er-
in fig. 4

ent age tend to present di   erent behaviors.

age of the member (in years)

fig. 4. variation of the average tendency percentage with the
self-reported age of the qx members. (a) the exchange ten-
dency decreases with age. (b) the balance tendency is sharply
increasing with age in younger ages, and slowly declines for
ages above 20. we do not observe any strong dependence
on age for (c) collective action or (d) structural hole (bottom
right). the insets show the di   erences between males and
females of the same age for each tendency.

we calculate the fraction of actions that correspond to
a tendency as a function of the self-reported age of the
qx members. in the insets, we separate the correspond-
ing probabilities for male and female members. we    nd
that while reciprocity in women remains high as they age,
men instead reduce it by a factor of 2 as they reach 40.
this shows that younger male members are more eager
to reciprocate their connections.
in contrast, the level
of balance is roughly constant for both genders and in-
dependently of age, with an important exception at the
youngest ages, where members younger than 20 years old
are using systematically less balance links. this could be
because it is more di   cult for them to develop a sta-
ble local network in an adult-oriented community. there
are no signi   cant trends with age for collective action
or structural hole, although the latter tendency is rarely
used. the gender-based trends shown in fig. 3 are con-
sistent with the age-based results. women of a given age
are always using more exchange and less collective action
tendencies than men of the same age (insets of fig. 4).

c. activity in   uence

communities include members of varying activity [13].
in order to study the e   ect of the di   erent activity levels,
we address the question of whether a higher involvement
in a community is accompanied by a di   erent pattern
in the probabilistic tendencies of social mechanisms. we
calculate the di   erent probabilities of social mechanisms
as a function of the number of kout outgoing links for

each member. for instance, p  (kout) (where    denotes
exchange, balance, etc) measures the id203 that the
next action will correspond to   , when the member has
kout outgoing links. we measure p  (kout) through all
the actions of members when they increase the number
of outgoing links from kout to kout + 1, irrespectively of
the time that the action was performed. interestingly, we
   nd that a member typically modi   es his/her behavior
according to its current degree of activity kout. as a
member becomes more involved in the community and,
as a consequence, increases the size of his/her favorites
list or signs more guestbooks, the member switches to a
di   erent relative percentage of using each tendency.

we identify the following pattern which is very con-
sistent across the two datasets and di   erent types of in-
teractions (see fig. 5). the    rst tie of a new member is
always distant since the member has no network estab-
lished. however, even at this stage, 20-30% of these links
are also exchange    meaning that a new member readily
   responds    to the incoming link by established members   
and collective action, meaning that the member immedi-
ately searches for popular members in the community. at
this earlier stage, balance tendency is suppressed, since
linking to friends of friends requires    rst a    rm establish-
ment of the immediate neighborhood.

an interesting crossover appears when the members
arrive to a size kout     10 in their favorites list (see for
example fig. 5a for qx favorites). the percentage of all
tendencies up to that value is approximately constant. at
around 10 interactions in qx favorites, balance overtakes
both exchange and collective action in the behavioral ten-
dencies. as the members keep adding more links, the
distant mechanism drops signi   cantly to approximately
60% after kout     100, and the balance tendency grows in-
creasingly stronger consequently. similarly, the exchange
tendency declines steadily towards 0 as the size of the fa-
vorites list increases towards the hundreds. collective
action leading to preferential attachment seems to be the
most stable over a longer kout-range. finally, the rela-
tive id203 of psh(kout) peaks at low and large values
of kout. the structural holes are    lled mainly by either
new members or well-established members, with a signif-
icantly smaller fraction of structural holes performed in
the intermediate kout regime. this interesting behavior
reveals trends in the social tendencies across the individ-
ual users as they enter the network.

the choice of di   erent tendencies is, thus, shown to
have a complex dependence on the individual   s level of
activity. in addition to external attributes, such as gen-
der and age, we    nd that very active members have dif-
ferent tendencies than the less active ones. such features
can only be extracted by following the entire time evolu-
tion of each member   s connections.

tion of the adding member   s list size, at the time of addition.
qualitatively, all three datasets are in agreement with each
other. the small quantitative di   erences may be due to the
di   erent means of interaction and/or the design of each plat-
form.

d. popularity attributes

so far, our analysis focused on quantifying the di   erent
probabilistic tendencies as seen from the member that
establishes a link. we characterized the outgoing links
which can be controlled by their initiator, in the sense
that any member can choose where, when, and how often
connects to other members. however, the popularity (or
attractiveness) of a member cannot be adjusted at will.
we characterize the popularity based on the number of
incoming links. using the same methodology as above,
we can now study how di   erent tendencies determine the
popularity of a member.

for each relationship between two people we assign
the initiator, i.e. the member who contacted the other

member    rst, and the receiver, i.e. the member who was
contacted.
in the case of a reciprocal relation we only
characterize the link that was established    rst. given the
list of a member   s connections, we can then know what
fraction of those connections is due to the initiative of
this member and what fraction originated from the other
side. thus, if someone very often reciprocates but seldom
initiates links, she will have a small value of initiated
links although she may have a large number of incoming
and/or outgoing links.

in fig. 6a we present the histogram of how many mem-
bers fall into each category. the diagram is roughly di-
vided into three areas: a) members who initiate a lot of
connections but are    rst contacted by very few members
(   spammers   ) b) members who on average equally initiate
and receive contacts, and c) members who receive many
more contacts than they initiate (   popular   ).

the importance of using the time evolution of prob-
abilistic tendencies to determine behavior is re   ected in
this popularity classi   cation.
in figs. 6b-d we present
the average percentage for each category and for each
tendency that the members use when they add friends
themselves. the exchange tendency shows a clear vari-
ation with respect to this classi   cation. the    popular   
members in the upper diagonal part of the distribution
use a lot of exchange, which can be understood since
they respond to friendship requests but rarely start new
connections. as we move towards the    spammers    the
exchange tendencies almost disappear, since very few
people approach those members and therefore they have
small chance to use exchange. on the contrary, the spam-
mers tend to use balance more,
they connect to
friends of friends, since they try to access the largest
possible number of the accessible members (fig. 6c). fi-
nally, connecting to distant parts of the network (fig. 6d)
has a more uniform behavior, although the popular mem-
bers seem to use it more, pointing to a    rich-club    phe-
nomenon [19].

i.e.

the above described trends demonstrate the richness
of information that becomes accessible by following the
evolution of link formation. nevertheless, we next show
that even in the absence of the network history, we can
still deduce some useful conclusions on the probabilistic
tendencies.

(solid lines) or at the time of observation (dashed lines) in
the pok community.

e. neighborhood landscape change

as discussed above, the presented analysis would not
be possible without continuously monitoring the time
evolution of the links. the characteristics of a given link
with time do not remain necessarily the same as when
the connection was established, but they can change due
to the addition of more links or the removal of existing
ones. for example, a friendship that starts between two
isolated individuals may evolve into a densely connected
neighborhood, so that a link that started as distant may
eventually switch with time to either balance, exchange,

collective action, structural hole, or any combination of
them.

in order to study how signi   cant the evolution of the
link formation tendencies is, we compare the probabilistic
tendencies obtained above following the time evolution
with those obtained by a statistical analysis of a snap-
shot of the network. the statistical analysis of the static
snapshot is done by characterizing all existing links at
the given time without using the information from the
time when the link was established. thus, we remove a
link and characterize it as if it was just established, and

immediately re-insert it back in the network. thus, each
link is assigned to the speci   c probabilistic tendencies ac-
cording to the current neighborhood environment of each
agent, independently of the time it was established. we
repeat this process for all links in the static snapshot and
we calculate the relative percentage for each mechanism.
in fig. 7 we compare the running percentages for each
tendency at the moment of addition, such as those mea-
sured in fig. 2, to those of the corresponding static net-
work. all tendencies are di   erent in these two measure-
ments. exchange is the only predictable tendency, since
by de   nition it appears two times more at the time of
observation compared to the time of addition. the other
tendencies cannot be predicted from the static measure-
ments. for example, although a member is typically us-
ing the balance tendency to add links at a percentage
of around 10%,
if she tries to evaluate her neighbor-
hood at any point in time she will    nd out that now
approximately 20% of her acquaintances fall under the
balance theory. similarly, the central hubs seem to be re-
enforced, since collective action is used in less than 30%
of the total actions, but eventually more than 45% of
the links are directed towards the biggest hubs. in other
words, members are ultimately attached to hubs more
often than we could conclude from characterizing their
original actions only, due to the dynamic environment.
this quanti   es and generalizes the situation depicted in
figs. 1b and 1c: the knowledge of the network struc-
ture at a given time is not su   cient for characterizing
the probabilistic tendencies.

another aspect of this plot (fig. 7) is that the tenden-
cies at the time of addition reach their asymptotic values
quite fast and they remain roughly constant with time.
the corresponding values extracted from the static net-
works are also quite robust and follow closely the vari-
ations of the values in the evolving networks, creating
a constant gap between the two curves. since there is
currently no method to estimate the magnitude of the
di   erence between the two cases by static information
only, it is still not possible to extract the percentage of
the probabilistic tendencies without following the net-
work evolution.

next, we compare our results with other directed
social
interaction networks from the literature, such
as the epinions [20], slashdot [21] and livejournal
[22] communities. the datasets were downloaded from
http://snap.stanford.edu/data. the epinions dataset is
a directed network of trust from epinions.com, where a
user can declare her trust towards another user, based
on submitted reviews. this trust creates a directed link
between the two users. the network has 75879 nodes
and 508837 links. slashdot.com is a technology-oriented
news site, where users can tag each other as friends or
foes.
in our analysis we only use the friendship links.
we use two snapshots of the network, on november 6,
2008 (77360 nodes and 905468 links) and on february 2,
2009 (82168 nodes and 948464 links) [21]. finally, live-
journal.com is a social networking site, where users can

declare who they consider as their friends. the network
that we use has 4847571 nodes and 68993773 links. for
these networks we only have the static snapshots. there-
fore, we can only study the exchange tendency, which is
the only one that remains unmodi   ed in a static network
(we can always measure the existence of reciprocity, in-
dependently of the time it was established).

the id203 to use the exchange tendency among
the di   erent social networks (fig. 8) depends on the spe-
ci   c features of each community. for example, in the
slashdot and in the livejournal communities, where a
link shows that a user declares another user as being
his/her friend, there is a large degree of the exchange
tendency because mutual relations are favored in these
social networking environments. in contrast, in the qx
database the exchange tendency is quite smaller due to
the nature of this community. similarly, in the epinions
database a link shows that a member trusts the tech re-
views of the other member, but this relation is usually
not mutual (if i trust the reviews of an expert reviewer,
this reviewer may not necessarily trust my reviews).

iv. discussion

the wealth of information obtained by our longitudi-
nal analysis can complement other statistical analysis for
probabilistic tendencies [6, 10]. the family of exponen-
tial random graph models [23] (p   ), and in particular the
logit p    models [4], have been very successful in analyz-
ing network snapshots at a given moment in time. these
methods detect network patterns that appear more fre-
quently than a random null hypothesis would assume.
in this way, the underlying mechanisms of network cre-
ation are inferred from the resulting motifs. our present
analysis goes beyond this approach by directly facing a
number of key issues: we can follow the entire network
evolution, we can characterize individual actions, and we

can also assign known mechanisms to any given action.
the results of these actions often yield network patterns
where an individual contribution may be lost in the static
snapshot pattern, due to the e   ect of subsequent connec-
tions. in broad terms, our analysis compared to exponen-
tial random graph models may be considered to be the
analogue of a microscopic statistical physics description
compared to a macroscopic thermodynamic approach.

here, we have shown that following the order of links
establishment at the microscopic level in a social net-
work provides a direct measurement of the probabilistic
tendencies. this allows both the quanti   cation of the rel-
ative strength between tendencies in a given community,
and the extraction of useful sociological conclusions. for
example, in the communities that we studied, we show
that women tend to use the exchange mechanism more
frequently than men. this tendency is more pronounced
with age since reciprocity in older men largely declines
while in women it remains stable across all ages. in these
communities, also, men tend to connect to the hubs more
often than women, independently of age. the use of tri-
adic closures is almost constant for both genders and all
ages, except for the youngest members with ages below
20. this may be a consequence of the more adult-oriented
character of the community. similarly, we capture a dif-
ferent use of the tendencies between the more active and
less active members. the basis of our    ndings is that
these results cannot be derived analyzing a snapshot of a
static network. as shown in figs. 1b and 1c and quan-
ti   ed in the preceding section, it is not possible to make
assumptions of why a link exists a long time after the
link was established.

our    ndings re   ect the behavior of users in the online

9

networking sites that we studied. the suggested method
of following the dynamic evolution, though, represents
a consistent method which can be applied to other net-
works. further studies in di   erent online communities
should elaborate on whether the trends reported here
with respect to sex, age, etc, are generic to other types
of networks.

the present analysis complements other approaches in
the literature [24] by focusing on individual actions and
the study of how the underlying mechanisms behind these
actions are driving the evolution of the large-scale social
network. the ability to isolate individual actions can be
also very useful in studying behaviors that are unusual,
and help characterize idiosyncratic ways of building the
friendship network. the present analysis can be extended
to exogenous mechanisms, as well, by incorporating in-
formation from other aspects of the activity in the com-
munity (e.g. joining speci   c clubs, participating in forum
discussions, communities, etc).
