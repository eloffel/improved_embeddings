abstract

we study the detailed growth of a social networking site with full temporal information by examining the creation process of each
friendship relation that can collectively lead to the macroscopic properties of the network. we    rst study the reciprocal behavior of
users, and    nd that link requests are quickly responded to and that the distribution of reciprocation intervals decays in an exponential
form. the degrees of inviters/accepters are slightly negatively correlative with reciprocation time. in addition, the temporal feature
of the online community shows that the distributions of intervals of user behaviors, such as sending or accepting link requests,
follow a power law with a universal exponent, and peaks emerge for intervals of an integral day. we    nally study the preferential
selection and linking phenomena of the social networking site and    nd that, for the former, a linear preference holds for preferential
sending and reception, and for the latter, a linear preference also holds for preferential acceptance, creation, and attachment. based
on the linearly preferential linking, we put forward an analyzable network model which can reproduce the degree distribution of
the network. the research framework presented in the paper could provide a potential insight into how the micro-motives of users
lead to the global structure of online social networks.

1. introduction

at present the world wide web (www) is undergoing a
landmark revolution from the traditional web 1.0 to web 2.0
characterized by social collaborative technologies, such as so-
cial networking sites (snss), blogs, wiki, and folksonomy [1].
as a fast growing business, many snss of di   erent scopes and
purposes have emerged in the internet, many of which, such as
myspace [2, 3], facebook [4-7], and orkut [2, 8], are among
the most popular sites on the web according to alexa.com.
users of these sites, by establishing friendship relations with
other users, can form online social networks (osns), which
provide an online private space for individuals and tools for in-
teracting with other people over the internet. both the popu-
larity of these sites and availability of network data sets o   er
a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of osns at scale.
it is believed that having a proper understanding of how osns
evolve can provide insights into the network structure, allow
predictions of future growth, and enable exploration of human
behaviors on networks [9-13].

recently, the structure and evolution of osns have been ex-
tensively investigated by scholars of diverse disciplines. golder
et al. studied the structural properties of facebook and found
that the tail of its degree distribution is a power law which is
di   erent from the traditional exponential distribution of real-
life social networks [4]. however, a mean of 179.53 friends per
user for facebook [4] or a mean of 137.1 friends per user for
myspace [2] is close to dunbar   s number of 150, which is a
limit on the number of manageable relations by human based
on their neocortex size [14]. holme et al. studied the structural

evolution of pussokram and found that its degree correlation
coe   cient is always negative over time, i.e. disassortative mix-
ing [15], which is in stark contrast to the signi   cant assortative
mixing for real-world social networks [16]. viswanath et al.
studied the structural evolution of the activity network of face-
book and found that the average degree, id91 coe   cient,
and average path length are all relatively stable over time [6].
hu & wang studied the evolution of wealink [17, 18] and found
that many network properties show obvious non-monotone fea-
ture, including a sigmoid growth of network scale which was
also observed by chun et al. in cyworld [19], and a transition
from degree assortativity characteristic of real social networks
to degree disassortativity characteristic of many osns which
was also observed by szell & thurner in pardus [20].

despite the advancement, we    nd that to date most research
on osns has focused on either the structural properties of a
certain snapshot of networks or the multi-snapshots of evolving
networks rather than detailed microscopic growth dynamics.
for the research framework of network evolution from a macro-
scopic viewpoint it is usually hard to reveal underlying mecha-
nisms and growth processes governing the large-scale features
of the observed network structure. in this paper, to gain better
insight into the growth of networks, based on empirical data,
we study the detailed process of people making friends in an
osn from a microscopic point of view. instead of investigating
the global network structure or structural metric evolution, we
focus directly on the microscopic user behaviors per se, i.e., we
study the properties of a sequence of the arrivals of each edge
or the formations of each friend relation.

2. data set

in this paper, we will focus on wealink, a large sns in china
whose users are mostly professionals, typically businessmen
and o   ce clerks [17, 18]. each registered user has a pro   le,
including his/her list of friends. if we view the users as nodes
v and friend relations as edges e, an undirected friendship net-
work g(v, e) can be constructed from wealink. for privacy
reasons, the data, logged from 0:00:00 h on 11 may 2005 (the
inception day for the internet community) to 15:23:42 h on 22
august 2007, include only each user   s id and list of friends,
and the time of sending link invitations and accepting requests
for each friend relation.

the    nial data format, as shown in fig. 1, is a time-ordered
list of triples <from, t o, when>. for instance, <u1, u2, t1>
indicates that, at time t1, user u1 sends a link request to user
u2, i.e., sends a friendship invitation to u2, while <u2, u1,
t6> indicates that, at t6, u2 accepts u1   s request and they be-
come friends, i.e., a new edge connecting u2 and u1 appears in
the osn. thus only when the sent invitations are accepted will
the friend relations or network links be established. the online
community is a dynamically evolving one with new users join-
ing the community and new connections established between
users.

3. reciprocal behavior

like most osns, in wealink, a user invites another user to be
his/her friend; if the invited user accepts the invitation, a friend
relation is established between them and a new edge connecting
them appears (see fig. 1). thus the friendship is constructed
by bilateral agreement. the degree of a user, i.e., the number of
friends, will appear on his/her pro   le, which can be browsed by
all the other users. during our data collection period, 273 209
sent link requests have been accepted and only 186 ones have
not yet been accepted. thus, in the following analysis, we will
focus on the 273 209 sent link requests and their corresponding
accepted ones with full temporal information.

we    rst scrutinize the reciprocation of users, i.e., the send-
ing of a link request from one user to another (as happens at
t1 in fig. 1) causes following acceptance of the request (t6).
fig. 2(a) shows the complementary cumulative distribution
of the intervals between sending and accepting link requests
in wealink.
it is clear that users often quickly responded to
link requests and reciprocated them. the interval distribution
decays approximately exponentially. the least squares    tting
gives pc(t)     e   0.011t with r2 = 0.958. in fact, as shown in
fig. 2(b), 67.04% of all reciprocal behavior occurred within
one day (24 hours) after the initial link requests and 84.25% of
sent link requests were accepted within one month (30 days).
wealink informs users by email of new incoming link requests.
it is quite possible that many users reciprocated requests as a
matter of courtesy and respect.

recently inspired by the pioneering works of barab  asi et al.,
there has been increasing interest for physicists and computer
scientists in the research of human dynamics [21, 22], which fo-
cuses on the time interval distribution between two consecutive

actions performed by individuals. the examples of such tem-
poral statistics include the inter-event time distribution between
two consecutive emails sent out by users, two consecutive vis-
its to a web portal by users, and two consecutive library loans
made by individuals. empirical studies have shown that many
distributions of inter-event time follow a power law. however,
the exponential reciprocation interval distribution is in distinct
contrast to the power law distribution of waiting time in emails
(i.e., the time taken by users to reply to received emails). the
importance of di   erent emails is di   erent. a reasonable hy-
pothesis is that there can be correlation between the importance
of emails and reputation/status of senders or    social closeness   
to senders. thus users can reply to received emails based on
some perceived priority, and the timing of the replies will be
heavy tailed. in contrast, there is no obvious priority for the
reciprocal behavior of users in osns; thus an exponential dis-
tribution will well characterize the reciprocation interval distri-
bution.

an interesting question is whether the users tended to recip-
rocate incoming link requests quickly regardless of how many
friends the inviters or accepters had. to answer the question,
we study the correlation between reciprocation time and the de-
grees of inviters/accepters at the time of sending link requests.
fig. 3(a) shows the density plot based on hexagonal binning for
the relation between degrees of inviters k and reciprocation time
t, where the cases with small k and t dominate. the pearson cor-
relation coe   cient between k and t is -0.02, indicating slightly
negative correlation. fig. 3(b) shows the relation between k and
mean reciprocation time hti with logarithmic binning and error
bars. hti exhibits mild descending trend as k increases. fig. 4
shows the relation between degrees of accepters k and recipro-
cation time t, which is similar to that shown in fig. 3. the
pearson correlation coe   cient between k and t is -0.05, also
indicating mildly negative correlation.

4. types of users and edges

the total number of users during the data collection period
is n=223 482. obviously the users can be divided into three
classes: active users who sent link requests but have never re-
ceived ones, passive users who received requests but have never
sent ones, and mixed users who both sent and received requests.
as shown in tab. 1, we    nd that most users belong to the former
two classes. for the very popular snss, such as facebook and
myspace, due to the high activity and degree values of users,
most users could be mixed ones. however, wealink is a very
professional osn with a mean degree of only 2.53. the activ-
ity of most users is low; after joining in the osn they either
send link requests to a few old users (acquaintance in real life
very likely) or receive link invitations from several old users.
among the mixed users, there exists obvious positive correla-
tion between the numbers of times of sending invitations and
accepting invitations, and the pearson correlation coe   cient is
0.48. as shown in fig. 5, we    nd that the more link requests
a user sends, the more requests he/she will receive, and vice
versa.

the    nial network density is only 1.09    10   5, and what re-
sults in the sparseness? as shown in tab. 2, the e=273 209
edges can be divided into four classes, and a   b type expresses
that initially a users sent link requests to b users.    old    means
that the users have been in the network; they joined in the net-
work some time ago and they either have sent at least one link
request to other users or have received at least one link request
from other users.    new    means that the users have joined in the
network; however, they neither have sent link requests to other
users nor have they received link requests from other users. it
is shown that in wealink most links are established by old users
sending requests to new users (more than 30%) and new users
sending requests to old users (approximately 50%). the num-
ber of edges of old-old type is relatively small, leading to the
sparseness of the network.

5. temporal characteristics of linking

we study the time interval distribution between two link
events. as shown in fig. 6, the distributions of intervals be-
tween consecutive sending link requests (i.e., between t1 and
t2, t2 and t4, and so on in fig. 1), accepting requests (i.e.,
between t3 and t5, t5 and t6, and so on in fig. 1) and any two
events (i.e. between ti and ti+1 (i     1) in fig. 1) all follow a
power law with a universal exponent 1.89, which diverges from
the exponential distribution predicted by a traditional poisson
process and indicates bursts of rapidly occurring events sepa-
rated by long periods of inactivity. several peaks appear for
intervals of an integral day in the tails of the distributions, indi-
cating the daily periodicity corresponding to human life habits.

6. preferential selection

preferential selection means that, for a time-ordered list of
individual appearance, the more likely an individual appeared
before, the more possibly the individual will occur once again.
we separate the preferential selection into two aspects: prefer-
ential sending and preferential reception. preferential sending
describes the mechanism by which users send new link requests
with id203 proportional to some power of the numbers of
their sent link invitations before, and preferential reception de-
scribes the mechanism by which users receive new link requests

with id203 proportional to some power of the numbers of
their received link invitations before.

fig. 7 presents the schematic illustration of sending and re-
ception sequences of osns. the former is a time-ordered list
of users sending link invitations, and the latter is a time-ordered
list of users receiving link invitations. in both sequences, the
more frequently a user appeared before, the more likely the user
will occur once again.

let ki be the number of sent or received link invitations for
user i. the id203 that user i with frequency ki is chosen to
send or receive a link request once again can be expressed as

k  
i

.

y(ki) =
thus we can compute the id203 q(k) that an old user

of frequency k is chosen, and it is normalized by the number of
users of frequency k that exist just before this step [23, 24]:

p j k  

(1)

j

y(k) = pt [et = v     kv(t     1) = k]
pt |{u : ku(t     1) = k}|

    k  ,

(2)

where et = v     kv(t     1) = k represents that at time t the old
user whose frequency is k at time t     1 is chosen. we use [  ] to
denote a predicate (which takes a value of 1 if the expression

particularly for large k. to reduce the noise level, instead of

is true, else 0). generally, q(k) has signi   cant    uctuations,
q(k), we study the cumulative function:

  (k) = z k

0 y(k)dk     k  +1.

(3)

fig. 8 shows how the frequency k of users is related to the
preference metric   .        1 for both preferential sending and
preferential reception, indicating linear preference.

it is natural that, in the sending or reception sequence, the
number of distinct users n increases with sequence length t .
fig. 9 shows the growth pattern of n with t for wealink.
n     t , indicating that the appearance id203 of new
users is a constant,    = n/t . according to the simon model
[25], based on linear preferential selection and constant ap-
pearance id203 of new users, the complementary cumu-
lative distributions of the numbers of sent invitations and re-
ceived invitations for the users of wealink follow a power law
1      ). based on empirical data, for the inviters, we
pc(n)     n   ( 1
obtain    = 0.53 and pc(n)     n   2.13, and for the receivers,
   = 0.35 and pc(n)     n   1.54. fig. 10 shows the distribution
functions of the frequencies of inviters and receivers, and the
tails of both distributions show power law behavior. the power
law exponents achieve proper agreement with the predicted val-
ues of the simon model, 1/(1       ).

7. preferential linking

the degree distribution of wealink shows power law features
[17]. this kind of distribution can be produced, as indicated
by the barab  asi-albert (ba) model [26], through linear pref-
erential attachment, where new users tend to attach to already
popular old users. in wealink, as shown in fig. 1, only when the
sent link invitations are accepted can the inviters and receivers

become friends and new edges appear in the social network.
when new users establish friend relationship with old users, or
new edges are established between old users, the old users with
large degrees could be preferentially selected.

to test the preference feature for di   erent types of link estab-
lishment, we separate the preferential linking into three aspects:
preferential acceptance, creation, and attachment. preferential
acceptance implies that, the larger an old user   s degree is, the
more likely he/she will accept link invitations from other old
users. preferential creation implies that, the larger an old user   s
degree is, the more likely his/her link invitations will be ac-
cepted by the other old users. and preferential attachment im-
plies that new users tend to attach to already popular old users
with large degrees.

for instance, in fig. 1, at time t6, a new edge appears be-
tween two old users u1 and u2. old user u2 who accepts a
link invitation can be chosen by preferential acceptance, and
old user u1 who sends a link invitation can be chosen by pref-
erential creation. at time t8, a new edge appears between old
user u2 and new user u5, and old user u2 can be chosen by
preferential attachment. fig. 11 shows the relation between the
degree k of users and the preference metric   . we    nd that        1
for preferential acceptance, creation, and attachment, indicating
linear preference.

the property of linear preference for the network can be gen-
eralized to general osns. mislove et al. studied the evolution
of flickr; they de   ned preferential creation as a mechanism
by which users create new links in proportion to their outde-
gree, and preferential reception as a mechanism where users
receive new links in proportion to their indegree [27]. they
found that linear preference holds for both cases, i.e. users
tend to create and receive links in proportion to their outde-
gree and indegree, respectively. leskovec et al. studied the
evolution of flickr, del.icio.us, yahoo!answers, and linkedin,
and examined whether the new users will preferentially link to
the old users with large degrees [24]. they found that flickr

and thus the preference is not obvious; however, for large de-

and del.icio.us show linear preference, q (k)     k, and ya-
hoo!answers shows slightly sublinear preference, q (k)     k0.9.
linkedin has a di   erent pattern: for low degrees k,q (k)     k0.6,
grees, q (k)     k1.2, indicating superlinear preference, i.e., the

edges to higher degree users are more sticky and high-degree
users get super-preferential treatment. even though there are
minor di   erences in the exponents    for di   erent networks, we
can say that        1, implying that linear preference may be uni-
versal for osns.

according to this linear preference, we put forward a realistic
network model. starting with a small network with m0 nodes,
at every time step, there are two alternatives.

a. growth and preferential attachment. with id203 p,
we add a new node with m1 (< m0) edges that will be connected
to the nodes already present in the network based on the prefer-
ential attachment rule of the ba model, i.e., the id203   
that a new node will be connected to old node i with degree ki

is q (ki) = ki.p j k j.

b. preferential creation and acceptance. with id203

8

q = 1     p, we add m2 (m1 + m2     m0) new edges connecting the
old nodes. the two endpoints of the edges are chosen according

to linear preferenceq (ki) = ki.p j k j.

after t time steps, the model leads to a network with average
number of nodes hni = m0+pt. for sparse real-world networks,
p > q. when p = 1, the model is reduced to the traditional ba
model. the model considers the introduction of new nodes and
new edges, which can be established either between new nodes
and old nodes or between old nodes. most importantly, the
model integrates linear preference for acceptance, creation and
attachment found in the evolution process of real networks, and
thus captures realistic features of network growth.

the model has an analytic solution. its stationary average

degree distribution for large k is [28]

p(k)     k   

3pm1+4qm2
pm1 +2qm2 ,

showing a scale-free feature. according to tab. 2, we obtain
p = pold   new + pnew   old = 0.7941 and q = 0.1939. the links
created between two new users are few and thus can be negligi-
ble. in addition, m1 = m2 = 1 for real growth of the network.
based on the parameters and eq. (4), we obtain p(k)     k   2.67.
fig. 12(a) shows the numerical result which is obtained by av-
eraging over 10 independent realizations with p = 0.7941 and
n=223 482. its degree exponent 2.62 agrees well with the pre-
dicted value of 2.67. fig. 12(a) also presents the complemen-
tary cumulative degree distribution of wealink, and we    nd that
the predicted value of the degree exponent 2.67 of the model
achieves proper agreement with the real value 2.91. the dif-
ference between real and theoretical values may arise from the
fact that p and q are time-variant variables and not constants.
fig. 12(b) shows the evolution of p and q and demonstrates the
fact.

8. summary and discussion

to conclude, we have unveiled the detailed growth of an osn
from a microscopic perspective. our study shows that the distri-
bution of intervals between sending and accepting link requests
decays approximatively exponentially, which is in obvious con-
trast to the power law distribution of waiting time in emails,
and there exists a slightly negative correlation between recipro-
cation time and degrees of inviters/accepters. the distributions
of intervals of user behaviors, such as sending or accepting link
requests, follow a power law with a universal exponent, indi-
cating the bursty nature of the user act. we    nally study the
preference phenomena of the osn and    nd that for preferential
selection linear preference holds for preferential sending and re-
ception, and for preferential linking linear preference also holds
for preferential acceptance, creation and attachment. we pro-
pose a network model which captures real features of network
growth and can reproduce the degree distribution of the osn.
it is noteworthy that, although there is a close relation be-
tween the microscopic growth of networks and global network
structure or structural metric evolution, it is still quite hard to
bridge the gap between macro and micro perspectives of osns.

and -1.62 for the model. (b) evolution of the proportion of two kinds of edge. the old-new and new-old types in tab. 2 are integrated into the new-old type and

for instance, preferential linking may possibly supply some in-
formation on the degree distribution of networks; however, it
may not tell us much about the other properties of networks,
such as id91 or community structure. thus to gain an in-
depth comprehension of osns, other microscopic behaviors of
users, such as homophily, need to be studied in detail; a comple-
mentary research framework integrating macro and micro per-
spectives will also be indispensable.
