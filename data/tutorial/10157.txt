abstract

background : the collective browsing behavior of users gives rise to a    ow network transporting attention
between websites. by analyzing the structure of this network we uncovered a non-trivial scaling regularity
concerning the impact of websites.

methodology: we constructed three clickstreams networks, whose nodes were websites and edges were
formed by the users switching between sites. we developed an indicator ci as a measure of the impact
of site i and investigated its correlation with the tra   c of the site (ai) both on the three networks and
across the language communities within the networks.

conclusions: we found that the impact of websites increased slower than their tra   c. speci   cally,
  (   < 1). we suggested that this scaling relationship characterized
there existed a relationship ci     ai
the decentralized structure of the clickstream circulation: the world wide web is a system that favors
small sites in reassigning the collective attention of users.

introduction

the explosive growth of the world wide web in the past two decades presents an urgent challenge
for developing a quantitative, predictive theory of the interaction between the web and users. previous
studies analyzed the structure of the hyperlink network [1   5] and also the individual browsing records [6   9]
in order to investigate the collective sur   ng behavior. while these studies paved way for the following
research, they have limitations restricted by the data. firstly, as pointed out in [10], hyperlinks are too
simple to represent the rich interactions between sites as a result of users    various online activities. from
bookmarks and default home pages to historical viewing records, there are many di   erent ways in which
clickstreams are generated between sites of no hyperlink connections [10]. secondly, although individual
sur   ng records has been extensively investigated [7   9,11], there is still a lack of research studying collective
browsing behavior from a network perspective [12].

there are generally two di   erent opinions concerning the sur   ng dynamics. one is the    rich-get-richer   
paradigm, which suggests that user navigation strengthens the inequality of tra   c among sites [13   15].
the other is the    egalitarian    paradigm arguing that the sur   ng activities of users actually makes the web
a level-play place where new sites have a greater chance of acquiring popularity [16]. in the current study
we investigated clickstreams formed by a large number of users to examine these two e   ects. we collected
data from google (www.google.com) and alexa (www.alexa.com) and constructed three website-level
clickstream networks at di   erent time points [12,16,17]. in each of the networks, the nodes were websites
and the edges showed the daily percentage of global users who visited two websites successively. we
de   ned ai as the tra   c of site i and ci the impact of the site on the rest of sites in clickstream circulation.
if ci increases faster than ai, the    rich-get-richer    e   ect is supported; otherwise, the    egalitarian    e   ect
  (   < 1). this scaling pattern
is supported. it turned out that ci scales sublinearly with ai as ci     ai
was observed to be universal, existing both in the three clickstream networks and across the language
communities within the networks. we suggested that this pattern, as an evidence of the    egalitarian   
e   ect, resulted from the decentralized structure of clickstream networks. that is, compared to large sites,

2

small sites had a disproportionately larger impact in the circulation of clickstreams.

we would like to point out that the presented approach of clickstream network analysis is not only
interesting at its own right, but also provides a new method investigating various online activities. for
example, traditional studies on news di   usion focused on the di   usion of news among users [18, 19], but
from the perspective of this approach, we can also understand the di   usion process in a    reversed    way,
that is, the allocation and transmission of users    attention among news [20]. therefore, the rise and decay
of news is the result of the competition among them for users    collective attention [20]. obviously, news
can also be tags [21], videos [22] or any other type of information resources when clickstream network is
applied to analyze a speci   c type of online activity.

materials and methods

data collection

we at    rst selected three lists of top 1000 sites at di   erent time points. two of them were selected from
google statistics (http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/) and the rest one was selected from
alexa reports (http://www.alexa.com)(please refer to supplemental materials for the detailed information
of these lists). we then downloaded from alexa the clickstreams between the sites on the lists. from the
downloaded data we constructed three clickstream networks (which are called w1, w2, and w3 hereafter),
in which a directed, weighted edge from nodes i to j indicated the daily percentage of the global web
users who visited i and j successively. it should be noted that as alexa only reports a maximum of ten
top inbound and outbound clickstreams for each site, our dataset does not neccessarily include all the
clickstreams between the studied sites. we actually constructed and studied the    backbone networks   
of the clickstreams on the web [23]. that is, we extracted the top clickstreams connecting the largest
sites on the web. essential statistics of the three networks, including degree distribution, distribution of
weights, and weighted degree distribution, are shown in the supplementary materials. in fig.1 we plot
w2 as an example of the clickstream networks, in which we also show the language-based communities of
sites to be introduced in the section of results.

the de   nition of ai, ci, and   

to show how to calculate ai, ci, and    exactly, let us take a look at an example clickstream network
provided by fig.2a. in this network nodes are websites, edges are clickstreams, and the weights of edges
re   ect the number of distinct users that hop between sites. we balance the network (dashed lines) by
adding two arti   cial nodes,    source    and    sink   , to make sure that at each node the sum of inbound and
outbound streams are equal [25]. then we normalize the matrix form of the balanced network f     by row
to obtain the transition matrix m as given by eq.1. an element mij of m denotes the id203 that
a random user visits website i and j successively. note that there are only n + 1 rows (columns) in m
for the row (column) corresponding to    sink    should be removed in order to derive eq.5.

correspond to language communities, and edges show the clickstreams. websites of the same language
are placed together within a big gray circle and are assigned the same color of edges, with their tra   c
being re   ected by the size of small circles. in calculating the coordinates of the websites, we designed a
new algorithm called    two-level spring embedding algorithm   , which used spring embedder for two
times. firstly we aggregated w2 into a community-level network, in which nodes were communities and
edges were the clickstreams transported between them. we visualized this network using a spring
embedding algorithm [24] but only plotted the nodes, which are exactly the gray circles in the    gure,
whose size is proportional to the total amount of clickstream within a community. secondly we applied
the said spring embedding algorithm algorithm on each of the communities and rescaled the coordinates
of websites in order to place them in the gray circles. we found that with the help of the    two-level
spring embedding algorithm    we could show the communities particulary clear while remaining the
topological structure of the entire network.

calculations, which prepares data for the testing of the scaling relationship:

in sum, ai stands for the tra   c of an arbitrary site i in the balanced clickstream network. ci re   ects
the circulated clickstreams moderated by i, in speci   cally, the total number of users who have visited this
site and still remain in the network. therefore, we can treat ci as a measure of the total (both direct and
indirect) impact of site i on the rest of sites in clickstream circulation [27, 28].    measures the increase of
impact with tra   c, averaged over all sites. we can interpret    as the level at which large sites dominate
the circulation of clickstreams [29]. for example, suppose we have two clickstream networks of the same
tra   c distribution but are di   erent in   , ai = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},        = 1/2, and           = 2. we can derive that
c    
i = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}. the impact of the largest node is 2.2 in the former
network, meaning that it controls (2.2/(1 + 1.4 + 1.7 + 2.2))     27% circulated clickstreams. similarly, we
can also derive that in the latter network the largest node controls 45% circulated clickstreams, leading us
to the conclusion that the latter network is more centralized. to conclude,    < 1 implies a    democratic   

i = {1, 1.4, 1.7, 2, 2.2} and c

   ow structure in which the impact of websites are evenly distributed, whereas    > 1 is the signature of
a    oligarchic       ow structure in which a small group of    hubs    controls the entire network.

as suggested in [28,30,31], a scaling relationship between ai and ci, to be existed, allows one to regress
log(ci) on log(ai) and obtain    as the slope of ordinary least square (ols) regression. for example,
figure.1b plots log(ci) against log(ai) in the example network, in which the data point corresponding
to node 2 (a2 = 60; c2 = 125) is colored in red.

respectively. please refer to table.1 for more information concerning the    tting of the three networks.

the tra   c ai of a site is proportional to the id203 that a random user chooses it as the entrance
of the virtual world [5], thus is widely used to indict the website popularity [6, 7]. however, if we want
to study the long-distance, complex interactions between sites, the investigation on the distribution of
tra   c [7   9] is not enough. we should probe into the transportation of tra   c between sites, that is,
the    ow of clickstreams [12, 17].
in the current study, to examine the    rich-get-richer    e   ect against
the    egalitarian    e   ect, we de   ned the impact ci of a arbitrary site as the amount of the circulated
clickstreams controlled by the site and investigated its relationship with the tra   c ai on three clickstream
networks (please refer to the section of data and method for the calculation of ai and ci).

as shown by figure.4, we found a scaling relationship ci     ai

  , in which    was estimated to be in
the range of 0.92     0.96 (table.1). this    nding suggested that the impact of websites increases slower
than its tra   c, which is an evidence of the decentralized structure of the clickstream networks [28, 30].

the scaling pattern across language communities

in the last section, we ignored the di   erences between users in investigating the scaling property of the
clickstream networks. however, this is a naive assumption concerning the di   erent preferences of users in

the web browsing [6,7]. among the various demographic and psychological factors that contribute to the
preferences [16, 32], we chose to control the linguistic variance in the further investigation of the scaling
property. speci   cally, we divided the clickstream networks into language-based website communities and
then observed the scaling pattern across the communities.

with the help of the alchemyapi (http://www.alchemyapi.com/), which turned out to be very e   -
cient in identifying the languages used by sites, we detected 16 language communities from w1, 17 from
w2, and 50 from w3. in table.2 we presented the result of w2 as an example (the result of the rest two
networks were given in the supplementary materials). please note that the communities listed in table.2
is less than those given by figure.1, because there were several communities within which the clickstreams
were too few to support an e   ective estimation of   . as suggested by table.2 and figure.5, in most of
  (   < 1), and the value of    seem to be invariant
the communities there existed the relationship ci     ai
of community size. it means that these communities share the common decentralized structure with the
entire network. this    nding also implies that, despite a variety of demographic and psychological that
shapes the preferences of users [16, 32], there are universal regularities in collective sur   ng behavior [32].
we noted that a majority of clickstreams across communities occurred between the english community
and non-english communities (figure.1). this is because users generally use no more than two languages
(the mother language and english) in sur   ng the web. as a consequence, the clickstream network
formed a    wheel-like    structure. whether this structure contributes to the discussed scaling property is
an interesting question worth further investigation.

the daily clickstreams is derived by summing up the number of unique users over all edges in the
clickstream network.

the robustness of the scaling pattern

the necessity of the work presented in this section is twofold. firstly, to overcome the limitations of
the currently used data sets. as alexa only provides the top ten inbound and outbound clickstreams for
each site, we have to ignore the rest of the potential clickstreams in the data analysis. if the discussed
scaling pattern is sensitive to this missing of clickstreams, our conclusion would probably be biased and
thus can not be generalized to a larger scale of observation. secondly, by testing the robustness of the
scaling pattern against network reconstructions we may obtain the understanding towards the mechanism
leading to the observed pattern.

in the current study, we investigated the robustness of the scaling relationship against two types of
network reconstructions, the selective removal of clickstreams and the reshu   ing of edges and weights.
in both reconstructions we used four statistics to characterize the scaling pattern, including   , r2,   , and
d.    and r2 are the best    tted parameter and the explained variance of the ols regression, respectively.
   is the pearson correlation coe   cient between log(ci/ai) and log(ai) [31]. the reason for introducing
   is because the scaling exponent    was always close to 1 in the current study, to focus on the non-linear
nature of the data we removed the linear dependence between ai and ci by calculating ci/ai and then
observed the direction and strength of the correlation. if ci is irrelevant of ai or has a trivial, linear
  (   < 1), which also reads
relationship with ai,    will approximate 0; if there exists a relationship ci     ai
as log(ci/ai)     (       1)log(ai)(       1 < 0),    will deviate from 0 negatively. d is the kolmogorov-smirnov
statistic that quanti   es the distance between two empirical distribution functions [33, 34]. it can be used
to determine whether two data sets come from populations with the same distribution, which is called the
ks test [33]. we calculated d between the distributions of the empirical and predicted values of ci (the
  , in which    was obtained in the ols regression) and compared it with 0.035, the expected
latter was ai
value of d corresponding to a con   dence level equals 0.1 (as suggested by [34]) and a sample size equals
1200 [33]. the value of d smaller than 0.035 was treated as a    good    result since we could not reject
the null hypothesis that the empirical and predicted values of ci were from the same distribution, in
   was validated. please note that we were using the most rigorous
other words, the prediction of ci by ai
criterion of the ks test in setting the sample size as 1200, because the number of nodes in the three
clickstream networks and their reconstructed versions was actually smaller than this number and thus
allowed a larger expected value of d [33]. finally, we would like to stress that among the four statistics,

8

the ks statistic was the only one based on formal statistical tests [33] thus should be treated as the most
important criterion.

we called the    rst reconstruction    backbone network analysis    [23], in which we gradually removed
edges of small weights from a network and observed the change of the statistics. speci   cally, we de   ned
0        < 1 as the portion of the edges to be kept. for a given   , we removed from every node 1       
incoming and outgoing edges of the least weights. as shown by figure.6, the scaling pattern was very
stable against the removal of edges. in particular, the values of    and r2 did not change much while
the networks lost as much as 70% edges as    decreased from 1 to 0.2. more importantly, during this
process the scaling relationship was validated by the ks test. actually, we can even try to forecast the
scaling pattern given the condition that more clickstreams were retrieved: the value of    would probably
be smaller and the    tting is likely to be better (to be indicated by the smaller d and the larger r2). in
sum, our    nding of    < 1 in the clickstream networks is possible to be generalized into the larger scale
of observation.

ks statistic with the increase of   . the data points from three networks are plotted in di   erent

last    gure shows the critical value of ks statistics as 0.035 given the condition of 1200 sample size and
0.1 level of con   dence.

the second reconstruction was called    reshu   ing analysis   . in this reconstruction we reshu   ed the
clickstream networks (in the ways given by table.3) to examine the contributions of the linking structure
and weights in forming the scaling relationship.

please note that the    randomly shu   ed links    was di   erent from the    randomly connected links    in
table.3, because the former kept the long-tail degree distribution of the original network (as shown in

9

the supplementary materials) whereas the latter lead to a binomial degree distribution. in particular, in
generating randomly connected links we selected w pairs of numbers (with replacement) from n unique
numbers randomly, in which w and n were the number of links and nodes of the network to be recon-
structed, respectively. the readers who are familiar with the theories of complex networks would    nd
that we were actually creating erdos-renyi random graphs, whose degree distribution is binomial [1].
similarly, the    randomly shu   ed weights    was di   erent from the    uniformly distributed weights   , for
we permuted the order of weights and kept their long-tail distribution in the former combination, but
created new weights uniformly distributed (between the minimum and maximum values of the original
weights) in the latter.

for each of the combinations listed in table.3, we ran 100 times of simulations and recorded the mean
and standard deviation of the aforementioned four statistics. after that, we plotted    vs. r2 and   
vs. d as given by figure.7, in which the center of the disks indicated the means and the radius in the
corresponding direction re   ected the standard deviations. we plotted the results of the combinations
in di   erent colors and edge styles and marked the results of the three original networks by    +    (w1),
          (w2), and          (w3). it turned out that across the three clickstream networks, the original networks
always had the smallest d and largest r2. in examining the scaling pattern by the ks test, we ruled
out three combinations whose values of d were greater than 0.035, including f , g, and h. from previous
discussions on    randomly connected links    we know that these types of reconstructed networks shared the
same binomial degree distribution [1]. therefore, we can naively conclude that the change of the degree
distribution from long-tail to binomial blurred the scaling pattern, whereas the change of the weight
distribution did not. in other words, the scaling pattern was determined by the topological structure of
the clickstream networks.

compared with f , g, and h, the rest of combinations were close to the original networks in terms of
d or other statistics. if we continuously lower the level of con   dence in the ks test (e.g., to 0.05), it is
possible to ruled out more combinations. however, we would like to suggest that, before a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanism leading to the scaling pattern is achieved, such a tuning is very trivial
and does not provide much insight. therefore, in the current study we would rather stop at the conclusion
that topological structure matters in the forming of scaling patterns and leave the contribution of other
factors, e.g., the distribution of weights, as a open question.

discussion

we studied collective browsing behavior from a    ow network perspective. we de   ned ci as a measure
of the impact of websites i on other sites through users    collective, continuous sur   ng activities and
found it scaled to website tra   c ai with an exponent smaller than 1. this pattern unrevealed the
decentralized structure of the three clickstream networks. further, we found that this scaling pattern
appeared universally across language-based communities within the clickstream networks and that the
value of    was independent of communities size. finally, we examined the stability of the scaling pattern
against the reconstructions of the clickstream networks. it turned out that the scaling relationship was
robust against the selective removal of edges but sensitive to the permutation on the linking structure.

our    nding has relevant theoretical and practical consequences. although the    rich-get-richer   
paradigm has been widely accepted as a mechanism of hyperlink formations since barabasi et al. [13], we
should not simply assume that this paradigm also suits the dynamics of collective sur   ng behavior [14,15].
it is already pointed out in [16] that the tra   c of websites scaled to its number of inbound links with an
exponent approaches 0.8. in this work we found the sublinear relationship between the impact and the
tra   c. put these    ndings together, we can conclude that the survival id203 of small sites in the
web ecological system is higher than what was suggested by their in-degree [13] or the page rank values
based on hyperlink structure [5, 16]. moreover, we would like to emphasize that it is only by studying
empirical clickstream networks can the rich interactions between sites be comprehensively understood.

the found scaling relationship provide a quantitative prediction of the impact of a website from its
tra   c. online advertising usually measures the impact of websites by their tra   c [35, 36], but our study
o   ers a more precise calculation of the impact of sites based on their role in the circulation of clickstreams.
this approach has potential application in the estimation of the value of sites and also the planning of
online marketing campaigns.
