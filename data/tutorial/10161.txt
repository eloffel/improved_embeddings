abstract

we analyse the large-scale structure of the journal citation network built from
information contained in the thomson-reuters journal citation reports. to
this end, we take advantage of the network science paraphernalia and explore
network properties like density, percolation robustness, average and largest node
distances, reciprocity, incoming and outgoing degree distributions, as well as as-
sortative mixing by node degrees. we discover that the journal citation network
is a dense, robust, small, and reciprocal world. furthermore, in and out node
degree distributions display long-tails, with few vital journals and many trivial
ones, and they are strongly positively correlated.

key words: network science, bibliometrics, journal id191, journal
citation indicators.

1. introduction

the present study is an interdisciplinary research integrating the    elds of
network science and bibliometrics. the    eld of network science     the holistic
analysis of complex systems through the study of the structure of networks that
wire their components     exploded in the last decade, boosted by the availability
of large databases on the topology of various real networks, mainly the web and
biological networks. the network science approach has been successfully applied
to analyse disparate types of networks, including technological, information,
social, and biological networks (brandes and erlebach, 2005; newman et al.,
2006; newman, 2010). network analysis can be performed at di   erent levels of
aggregation:

    node-level analysis. at this level, the goal is to measure the importance
or centrality of a node within the network. centrality here is not an
intrinsic and permanent feature of the node but, instead, it is an extrinsic
and    eeting property that depends on the interactions of the node with
the other nodes in the network. typical node centrality measures include
degree, eigenvector, closeness and betweenness centrality.

    group-level analysis. this investigation involves methods for de   ning and
   nding cohesive groups (clusters) of nodes in the network. the de   nition
of cluster depends only on the topology of the network. clusters are
tightly knit sets of nodes with many edges inside the cluster and only a
few edges between clusters. two typical methods at this level of analysis
are graph partitioning (where the number of clusters is    xed in advance)
and community detection (in which the number of clusters is unspeci   ed).

    network-level analysis. the focus of this analysis is on properties of net-
works as a whole such as connectivity, mean and largest distances among
nodes, distribution of node degrees, frequency of topological motifs, and
assortative/disassortative mixing. it also includes the investigation on the-
oretical models explaining the generation of networks with certain features
(e.g., random, small-world, and scale-free models).

bibliometrics is an older    eld;

it is a branch of information and library
science that quantitatively investigates the process of publication of research
achievements (gar   eld, 1955; de solla price, 1965). networks abound in biblio-
metrics; two important examples are id191 of articles, journals or
disciplines and collaboration networks of scholars. other bibliometric networks
are co-citation and co-reference networks of articles, journals or disciplines.

collaboration networks have been largely studied using the network science
approach (newman, 2004; barab  asi et al., 2002; grossman, 2002; moody, 2004;
radicchi et al., 2004; franceschet, 2011). journal id191 have been
investigated mainly at node- and group-levels. the investigation at the node-
level concerns the proposal of eigenvector-based centrality measures for journals
(pinski and narin, 1976; bollen et al., 2006; west et al., 2010), the id91
of journal bibliometric indicators, including centrality measures, on the basis of
the statistical correlation among them (leydesdor   , 2009; bollen et al., 2009),
as well as the use of betweenness centrality as an interdisciplinary indicator
for journals (leydesdor    and rafols, 2011). the group-level analysis of journal
id191 focuses on the detection, using di   erent methods, of com-
munities of journals, which correspond to    elds of knowledge in the map of
science (leydesdor   , 2004; rosvall and bergstrom, 2008; klanans and boyack,
2009; leydesdor    et al., 2010).

the investigation of journal id191 at the network-level has been
mainly focused on the study of the distribution of citations among papers
and journals (seglen, 1992; redner, 1998; stringer et al., 2008; radicchi et al.,
2008). the aim of the present investigation is to complement this investigation
with additional large-scale structure properties of journal id191.
more speci   cally, we focus on the following network properties: density of cita-
tion links, robustness with respect to the removal of nodes according to di   er-
ent percolation strategies, average and largest path lengths, topological motifs
of reciprocity, incoming and outgoing degree distributions and their statistical
correlations, as well as assortative mixing with respect to incoming and outgoing
node degrees.

2. the large-scale structure of journal id191

we considered all science and social science journals indexed in thomson-
reuters journal citation reports. we built a journal citation network in which
the nodes are the selected journals and there is a directed edge from node a
to node b if journal a published in 2008 a paper that cites a paper printed in
journal b in the temporal window between 2003 and 2007. we only took into
account the document types article and review. we considered the sub-network
corresponding to the largest strongly connected component of the original net-
work, which covers the large majority of the original network.1 the resulting
network is a directed unweighted graph with 6708 nodes and 1,315,238 edges
between journals with the property that there exists a directed path between
any pair of nodes. we loaded the network in the r environment for statisti-
cal computing (r development core team, 2008) and analysed the structure of
the network using the r package igraph developed by g  abor cs  ardi and tam  as
nepusz.

the    rst network property that we analyse is density. graph density is the
relative fraction of edges in the graph, that is the ratio of the actual number of
edges and the maximum number of possible edges in the graph. the density of
the journal citation graph is 3%, meaning that the graph has 3 edges every 100
possible links between nodes. the density is much higher if we consider only top
journals with large total degree, where the total degree of a journal is the sum
of the number of incoming edges (citing journals) and the number of outgoing
edges (cited journals) of the journal in the network. we sorted the journals
in decreasing order of total degree and we computed the density of the graph
containing only an increasing share of top journals; the corresponding plot is
depicted in figure 1. for instance, when only the top-30 journals are considered,
the citation network, which is shown in figure 2, is almost complete2, with a
remarkably high density of 93% (only 64 edges out of the 870 possible edges are
missing). notably, the density is relatively high (32%) also for the network of
top-1000 journals.

the journal citation graph is, by construction, strongly connected. this
means that there exists a directed path of citations between any pair of journals
in the graph: a researcher can start reading any journal in any subject, e.g.,
tribology, and by following links of citations, they can reach any other journal in
any other subject, e.g., mycology. related to connectedness of a network is the
concept of robustness. network robustness is typically investigated with a dy-
namic process called percolation. the percolation process progressively removes
nodes, as long as the edges connected to these nodes, from the network, and
studies how the connectivity of the network changes. in particular, one wants to
   nd the fraction of nodes to remove from the network in order to disintegrate its

1it is typical in network science to focus the analysis on the largest component when this is
a giant one, that is, when it includes the large majority of the nodes of the network (newman,
2010).

giant strongly connected component into small components. if such a fraction
is relatively large, then the network is said to be robust to the process of perco-
lation. to realize the percolation process, we progressively removed nodes from
the collaboration network and, after each removal, we computed the relative
size of the largest strongly connected component of the resulting sub-network.
we tested the following node removal strategies (newman, 2010):

1. degree-driven percolation, in which the nodes are removed in decreasing
order of node total degree (the sum of the in-degree and the out-degree of
the node);

2. eigenvector-driven percolation, in which the nodes are removed in decreas-
ing order of eigenvector centrality scores. a node has high eigenvector
score if it is pointed to by nodes which, recursively, have high eigenvector
scores;

3. closeness-driven percolation, in which the nodes are removed in decreasing
order of closeness centrality scores. a node has high closeness score if the
mean distance from the node to all other nodes in the network is low;

4. betweenness-driven percolation, in which the nodes are removed in decreas-
ing order of betweenness centrality scores. a node has high betweenness
score if the node lies on many geodesics (shortest paths) between other
nodes in the network.

figure 2: the citation network of the top-30 journals. the (almost) complete graph resembles
some escher   s works.

figure 3 shows the outcomes of the described percolation process. a couple
of observations emerge from the plot. first, the best percolation strategy is
based on the removal of nodes in order of betweenness centrality. it dominates
the total degree strategy, which is better than the closeness one. the least ef-
fective percolation strategy is the one based on eigenvector centrality. hence,
when the objective is to dismantle the (strong) connectivity of the network,
removing    broker    nodes (nodes with high betweenness) is more e   ective than
removing nodes with high total degree. nodes with high betweenness score have
been associated with interdisciplinary journals (leydesdor    and rafols, 2011),
while those with high total degree typically correspond to review journals. it
follows that interdisciplinary journals are more responsible to keep the citation
network strongly connected than review publication sources. second, no per-
colation strategy is in fact really e   ective. using the best percolation strategy
(betweenness), 82% of the nodes (almost the entirety of the graph) should be
removed to reduce the largest strongly connected component below 50% of the
graph. this is a distinct sign of the strong robustness of the journal citation
network.

the fact that the journal citation network is strongly connected does not tell
us anything about the lengths of paths in the network. for instance, compare a

graph composed of a circle of nodes and a complete graph in which there is an
edge connecting each pair of nodes. both graphs are strongly connected, but the
average distance between nodes in the    rst graph is of the order of the number
of nodes, while in the second graph it is just 1. the geodesic distance between
two nodes in a graph is the number of edges of a shortest path (also known
as geodesic) connecting the two nodes. we computed the geodesic distance for
any pair of nodes in the graph. figure 4 shows the geodesic distance histogram.
the average geodesic distance is remarkably short: 2.4 edges. this means that
given a random pair of journals, we can expect that in two or three citation hops
we get from one journal to the other. the maximum geodesic distance, known
as the diameter of the network, is just 6 links (there are 20 paths with this
largest length). we may conclude that the journal citation network is a small
world (watts and strogatz, 1998), in the sense that the average node distances
are remarkably short (logarithmic) with respect to the number of nodes of the
network.

it is worth noticing that the average path length on co-reference networks
have been recently proposed by rafols and meyer (2010) in the context of in-
dicators of interdisciplinarity. the authors investigate the interdisciplinary re-
search in terms of two aspects: diversity (the number, balance and degree of
di   erence between the bodies of knowledge integrated) and coherence (the ex-

tent that speci   c topics, concepts, tools and data used in a research process are
related). in particular, they propose the mean path length de   ned on paper
bibliographic coupling networks as a possible operationalization of the concept
of network coherence.

real complex networks possess basic building blocks or motifs: patterns of
interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are signi   cantly
higher than those in randomized networks (milo et al., 2002). such motifs have
been found in diverse networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and
engineering.
it is conjectured that these patterns play the role of functional
circuit elements of the complex system underlying the network. the simplest
motif that can be studied on a directed network is the loop of length two. on the
journal citation network, this corresponds to a pair of journals that reciprocally
cites themselves. this concept is known as reciprocity in network science and
it is operationalized by counting the relative frequency of edges that belong to
a loop of length two in the network (newman, 2010). we computed reciprocity
for the journal citation network and the result is 0.29; this means that 29% of
the times that a journal a cites another journal b we have that b cites back
to a. this high percentage can be explained with the well-known phenomenon
that journals can be partitioned into highly-connected clusters corresponding
to disciplines and    elds of them when journals are displayed on a citation map
(see, for instance, rosvall and bergstrom (2008)).

finally, we investigate the node degree distributions of the journal citation

network. since the citation network is a directed graph, each journal has an
out-degree     the number of distinct journals cited by the journal, or the number
of edges leaving the journal node    , and an in-degree     the number of distinct
journals citing the journal, or the number of edges arriving to the journal node.
figures 5 and 6, respectively, depict the out-degree and the in-degree distribu-
tions for nodes of the journal citation network. both distributions have a clear
long-tail: most of the journals cite and are cited by a relatively small number of
other journals, but there is a signi   cative number of hubs     journals that cite a
large amount of other journals    , and authorities, journals that are cited by a
big number of other journals. the average degree for both distributions is 196.3
the median out-degree is 126, with a maximum out-degree of 2193 (a third
of the total number of journals) accomplished by journal pnas. the median
in-degree is 109, with a maximum in-degree of 3697 (more than half of the total
number of journals) obtained by journal science (pnas is second with 3640).
the in-degree distribution is more skewed and concentrated (skewness index is
3.5 and gini concentration coe   cient is 0.55) than the out-degree distribution
(skewness index is 1.9 and gini concentration coe   cient is 0.49). neither dis-
tribution follow a power-law, so the network cannot be regarded as a scale-free

3this is the same number since each edge leaving a node is arriving at a node; this is also

equal to the ratio of the number of edges and the number of nodes of the network.

network (barab  asi and albert, 1999).4

furthermore, the two distributions (in- and out-degree) are positively cor-
related (spearman and pearson correlation coe   cients are 0.90 and 0.87, re-
spectively): this means that there is a tendency for authority journals to be
also hub journals and vice versa. this outcome is not crucially in   uenced by
the size of the journal (in terms of number of published papers); indeed, the
correlations of journal in-degree and out-degree with journal size are moderate
(spearman and pearson correlation coe   cients are 0.72 and 0.55, respectively).
we also raised the following questions: do authorities prefer to cite other author-
ities/hubs? do hubs prefer to cite other hubs/authorities? in network science,
assortative/disassortative mixing is the tendency of nodes to connect to other
nodes that are like/dislike them in some way (newman, 2010). the concept
is implemented as a pearson correlation coe   cient over the investigated scalar
characteristic (in- or out-degrees in our case) for nodes connected by an edge in
the network. the correlation is positive and statistically signi   cant in all four
cases: 0.08 for authority/authority mixing, 0.14 for hub/hub mixing, 0.11 for
authority/hub mixing, and 0.08 for hub/authority mixing. the low magnitude

4we preliminarily observed a clear curvature of the complementary cumulative distribu-
tion function plotted on a double logarithmic scale; furthermore we performed clauset et al.
(2009) goodness-of-   t test for the power-law and log-normal models. both tests excluded a
(statistically signi   cant)    t of the empirical distributions of degrees to the surveyed theoretical
models (not even in a tail portion of the distribution for the power-law model).

of the correlation coe   cients is not surprising: most networks are naturally
disassortative by degree because they are simple graphs (at most one edge is
possible between two nodes). hence, a positive correlation in this case, although
not large in magnitude, indicates a real assortativity by degree. in particular,
networks having a community structure override this natural bias and become
assortative (newman, 2010).

3. conclusion

we have analysed the journal citation network extracted from thomson-
reuters journal citation reports. our conclusions are summarized in the fol-
lowing:

    the journal citation network has high reciprocity and positive assortativity
by degree, which is coherent with a community structure, in which there
are tightly interconnected sets of journals that most likely represent entire
disciplines or    elds of them;

    the journal citation network is a dense and small world. this means that,
although the network is divided into closely integrated communities, there
are quite intense inter-community    ows of information (citations), and
hence information can spread quickly over the whole academic community;

    the journal citation network is highly robust. these is good news for the
whole academic community, since it means that there exists no restricted
circle of in   uential journals that control the connectivity of the network
and the di   usion of information on the whole academic community, al-
though there are journals that are very in   uential within their local    elds;

    interdisciplinary journals are more crucial than review sources for the
connectivity of the network and for the di   usion of information over the
academic community. the identi   cation of interdisciplinary journals is
a hot, partially open problem; interdisciplinarity is often perceived as a
mark of good research, more successful in achieving breakthroughs and
relevant outcomes (rafols and meyer, 2010);

    the degree distribution of the journal citation network shows a long tail
with many poorly endorsed journals an a signi   cant few highly cited ones;
the empirical distribution, however, does not match well the power-law
model. to test the adherence to the power-law model we used the princi-
pled statistical framework developed by clauset et al. (2009). the same
method is used by the developers to analyse a large number of real-world
data sets from a range of di   erent disciplines, each of which has been
conjectured to follow a power law distribution in previous studies. only
two-third of them passed the test, and all of them showed the best adher-
ence to the model when a (limited) su   x of the distribution is considered.
