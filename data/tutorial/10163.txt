abstract

researchers use community-detection algorithms to reveal large-scale organization in biological and social
networks, but community detection is useful only if the communities are signi   cant and not a result of
noisy data. to assess the statistical signi   cance of the network communities, or the robustness of the
detected structure, one approach is to perturb the network structure by removing links and measure
how much the communities change. however, perturbing sparse networks is challenging because they are
inherently sensitive; they shatter easily if links are removed. here we propose a simple method to perturb
sparse networks and assess the signi   cance of their communities. we generate resampled networks by
adding extra links based on local information, then we aggregate the information from multiple resampled
networks to    nd a coarse-grained description of signi   cant clusters. in addition to testing our method on
benchmark networks, we use our method on the sparse network of the european court of justice (ecj)
case law, to detect signi   cant and insigni   cant areas of law. we use our signi   cance analysis to draw a
map of the ecj case law network that reveals the relations between the areas of law.

introduction

id177 provides a good framework for studying systems composed of many interacting com-
ponents. recently, researchers have been interested in highlighting highly interconnected structures,
communities, in biological and social networks [1   8], because often communities correspond to behavioral
or functional components. for example, in social networks, communities can represent friendship groups;
on the web, they can represent related pages on a speci   c topic; and in metabolic networks, they can rep-
resent cycles or other functional groupings. here we show that communities can also capture disciplines
of judgements in case law systems [9]. however, similar to many real-world networks, the network of
ecj case law is sparse because of missing links. the challenge in    nding signi   cant structures in sparse
networks is twofold: random noise directly propagates to the community results, and communities easily
shatter because of missing links. to    nd reliable communities in sparse networks with missing links,
here we propose a simple method based on link prediction. first we show that our method performs
well on benchmark networks. then we apply our method to the ecj case law network and generate a
signi   cance map of eu law.

researchers use two main approaches to    nd statistically signi   cant communities in networks: ap-
proaches based on explicit underlying null models in the id91 algorithms and approaches based on
perturbation techniques.
in the null-model approaches, communities are signi   cant if the id203
of    nding them in a random network is lower than a given threshold [10   12]. this is a solid approach
when we are interested in how a network was formed. but when researchers are interested in highlighting
functional aspects of an instantiated network, such as dynamics on a given network, they often use per-
turbation techniques [13   16]. taking this approach, researchers assume random noise in the data. when
they perform the statistical analysis, they repeatedly perturb and cluster the data and then aggregate
the results. therefore, they can use any id91 algorithm and are not restricted to a particular null
model. but for many sparse networks, the main source of error is not random noise in the data, but rather

2

missing links with di   erent e   ects on the id91. for example, many id91 algorithms identify
more clusters in sparse networks than in the corresponding networks without missing links [17, 18]. ac-
cordingly, we consider a network to be sparse if a id91 algorithm    nds signi   cantly more modules
after a fraction of the links have been removed. to take this shattering e   ect into account when we
perform signi   cance analysis on sparse networks with missing links, we introduce resampling based on
link prediction.

to assess the signi   cance of sparse networks with missing links, we combine perturbation techniques
and link prediction. in practice, we resample sparse networks by completing triangles. for undirected
networks, completing triangles corresponds to the simple and e   ective link prediction method called
common neighbor [19]. with this approach, our aim is to add links that are missing because of insu   cient
data but avoid connecting nodes that factually are disconnected. after explaining our approach in detail,
   rst we show that we can recover shattered modules in benchmark networks as long as the mixing between
modules is moderate and not too many links are deleted. then we apply the method to identify signi   cant
areas in the network of ecj case law. this network consists of more than 8,000 court cases connected by
about 32,000 citations over the time period 1954   2010, clearly a sparse network. we create a signi   cance
map and connect several insigni   cant clusters into complete areas of eu law.

results and discussion

resampling based on completing triangles

to generate resamples of inherently sensitive sparse networks, we need a method that e   ciently adds
extra links while preserving the core structure of the network. that is, if we apply community detection
algorithms for partitioning sparse networks with missing links, we will often    nd small shattered modules.
on the other hand, if we just add links randomly to prevent shattering, most likely we will connect nodes
that should be disconnected because they are not directly related. accordingly, we note that the problem
of aggregating shattered modules by adding links is similar to the problem of predicting missing links.
missing links prediction methods operate by estimating the likelihood of a link between a pair of vertices
based on their similarity. to evaluate the similarity between vertices based on the structural properties of
the network, indices like common neighbors [19], jaccard coe   cient [20], degree product, shortest paths,
and hierarchical structure [21] have been proposed and used to predict future links on real data [22].
all similarity indices use speci   c assumptions about the positions of the missing links that often make
them complicated and computationally expensive to calculate. but these assumptions might not reveal
meaningful information in all real networks. to signi   cantly analyze networks    communities by generating
resampled networks, however, we do not need to exactly predict missing links; we only need to add extra
links in a non-destructive way so we can measure the robustness of the communities. therefore, we
perturb sparse networks with a simple and general method: triangle completion. that is, we complete a
fraction of open triangles that exist in the original data, see figure 1. by adopting triangle completion,
we assume that communities should have high density of triangles. with this implicit null model, we
can aggregate related shattered communities with a simple and general assumption about the network.
triangles are the smallest unit of communities, and completing them strengthens local connections and
the important core of the communities. as a result, shattered communities combine with each other and
the community size grows.

figure 1 shows an example network in which black links indicate existing links in the network and
the four inner circles correspond to communities in the network. when we add links by completing the
triangles (dashed lines), we aggregate the small communities into two big communities. of course, by
completing triangles we might add links between nodes that should not be connected. if more information
is available about the network, other more sophisticated null models that may work better can be applied
[21,22]. but as we show in the next section, the simple and general triangle completion method performs

well on benchmark networks.

benchmark networks

to validate our method, we tested triangle completion followed by id91 with the infomap algorithm
[23] on arti   cial networks with a built-in community structure. the benchmark graphs that we use
resemble real-world network and was introduced by lancichinetti et al. [24]. the benchmark networks
have tunable exponents and we use exponent    2 for the degree distribution and exponent    1 for the
community size distribution. further, the mixing parameter    determines the ratio between the external
degree of a node with respect to its community and the total degree of that node. we use this framework
to generate undirected networks with built-in community structures. figure 2a schematically shows a
network with 100 nodes and four built-in communities. by removing 50% of the links, communities
fall apart and small modules are detected (figure 2b), but with triangle completion, related shattered
modules are combined with each other (figure 2c).

to quantitatively show that triangle completion perturbs the network in a non-destructive way, we
used normalized mutual information (nmi) to measure the similarity between the community structure
of the original network and the community structure of the perturbed network [25, 26].

figure 3 shows the result of using the perturbation method on benchmark networks with 1000 nodes,
average degree hki = 10, community sizes between 10 and 50, and two di   erent levels of mixing between
communities. we generated sparse networks with missing links by randomly removing 30 and 60 percent
of the links in the benchmark networks. in the    gure, we use relative link perturbation to refer to the
normalized di   erence between the number of links in the perturbed and unperturbed network. the    rst
row shows the result of triangle completion for low mixing,    = 0.25, and well-de   ned communities.
low   , less than 0.5, means that, on average, each node has more links going to nodes within the same
community than to nodes in other communities. so when we use our triangle completion method for
perturbing such networks, we strengthen the structure inside the communities more than the structure
between the communities. therefore, we amplify the coarse-grain structure of the network, and the
community structure of the perturbed network will be similar to the community structure of the original
network, disregarding the number of extra links that we added. this reasoning is valid both when we
perturb the original raw network and when we perturb the reduced networks. by adding extra links
to the reduced networks, shattered and weakly connected modules aggregate and module sizes grow.
for reference, the gray lines in figure 3 show that if we randomly add links, we completely destroy the

community structure of the network.

we use the ratio between the average module size of the perturbed network, < si >link   added, and

the average module size of the original network, < si >original, to quantify module growth:

ms ratio =

< si >link   added

< si >original

(1)

when the built-in community structure is well-de   ned for low   , the module size ratio does not exceed one
and the community structure never collapses. on the other hand, in networks with high    and comparable
number of links within and between communities, we destroy the community structure. that is, when
we use triangle completion to perturb the network, module sizes grow quickly and    nally collapse (figure
3c,d). we have also analyzed networks with large communities, varying in size between 20 and 100 nodes,
and found similar results. when completing triangles, the mutual information remains approximately
constant and module sizes grow toward the original sizes as long as the mixing parameter is su   ciently
low. in general, we    nd that    = 0.5 is the threshold at which triangle completion works (figure 4).
when    is higher than 0.5, there are not enough regularities in the network to use for non-destructive
perturbation. figure 4 also shows that for denser and less challenging networks, the di   erence between
triangle completion and random link addition decreases. for su   ciently dense networks, other methods,
including link removal, can be used. but the more sparse the network is, the better is triangle completion
over random link addition.

by repeatedly completing triangles and id91 link-added networks, we can generate bootstrap
resamples for assessing signi   cant communities in sparse networks with missing links. in the next section,
we use this resampling technique to identify signi   cant and insigni   cant communities in the network of
ecj case law.

ecj case law network

case law is continuously evolving and changing over time. new cases build on old cases and areas of
law emerge, vanish, evolve or remain constant over time. citation patterns between cases allow us to
track and capture the evolution of areas of law. for example, bommarito ii et al. used a dynamic

citation network to    nd meaningful clusters in the network of the united supreme court by means of a
distance measure [27]. here we use approximately 32,000 citations between more than 8,000 court cases
(1954   2010) from the court of justice of the eu to better understand the overall structure of ecj case
law.

the european court of justice ensures the correct interpretation and application of eu law [28]. when
it comes to the judgments of the ecj, legal scholars traditionally begin by distinguishing cases primarily
concerning substantive issues from cases primarily concerning constitutional issues. substantive issues
regard questions about speci   c rights and obligations of individuals, member states, and eu institutions
under eu law. however, constitutional issues regard questions about the division of power between
eu and member states or the duties of member states to enforce substantive rights. we    nd that the
distinction between substantive and constitutional issues is supported by the network of ecj case law.
in addition to being substantive or constitutional, every judgment has also a procedural dimension in
the sense that the ecj enjoys jurisdiction over each case on one of eleven possible grounds [29]. more

and dashed lines and open circles correspond to random link addition. no links were removed prior link
addition and the number of links were doubled in all networks by link addition. each point corresponds
to an average over 100 networks.

information about the court   s cases is available on the eu law website [30].

we generated and clustered bootstrap networks from the network of ecj case law to detect signi   cant
areas of law and to better understand the overall structure. in the time-directed network of ecj case law,
each vertex corresponds to a court case and an arc from case a to case b shows that the newer case a cites
the older case b, as schematically illustrated in figure 5. similar to many other time-directed networks,
the network of ecj case law is sparse, as, in the beginning, there were few cases to cite. however, because
the number of cases increases with time, new cases have more options to cite. completing the triangles in
the time-directed network of ecj case law corresponds to one of the three situations depicted in figure
5. in all three situations, the added citation corresponds to a potential citation that we predict could
have been considered and materialized in the    rst place.

to show that our perturbation method does not destroy the core structure of the law network, we
would like to compare the community structure of the link-added network to the community structure
of the original raw network in terms of nmi. but the actual community structure of the original raw
network is not known in this case. to overcome this problem, we use the case law directory code, the
o   cial classi   cation system of the court, as our reference point. with this reference point, the nmi will
be low but when we complete triangles we can use the trend of the nmi to validate our method. as
figure 6 shows, perturbing the ecj case law network by completing triangles does not destroy the core
structure of the network. for example, even when we make the network 12 times denser, nmi stays
almost constant, but at the same time, the module sizes grow as we desire.

for a signi   cance analysis of the ecj case law network, we    rst partition the network with a id91
algorithm to capture regularities in the raw network. to cluster with respect to citation    ow between
the court cases, we use the map equation framework with a generalized    ow model for time-directed
networks [23]. however, we emphasize that the signi   cance analysis method works for any id91
algorithm. to assess the signi   cance of detected clusters, we generate 100 resample networks by the
triangle completion method without making any assumption about the underlying distribution of the
resampled networks. each resample network has twice the number of links as the raw network. then
we partition all resampled networks by using the same id91 method we used for the raw network.
to identify signi   cant clusters, cluster cores, we search for the biggest subset of nodes in each cluster

that gathered together in more than 90% of the resampled networks. we de   ne the size of a subset to
correspond to the number of nodes in the subset and also to the volume of    ow through the subset,
weighted equally. so by    nding the core of each cluster, we can assess which nodes signi   cantly belong

8

to a cluster and which do not. in addition to identifying signi   cant and insigni   cant nodes within each
cluster, the resampled networks can provide us with information about which clusters are signi   cantly
stand-alone and which are probably subsets of other clusters. we consider a cluster as signi   cantly
stand-alone if its core is not partitioned with another cluster in at least 90% of the resampled networks.
that is, two clusters are mutually insigni   cant if their cores are partitioned together in more than 10%
of the resampled networks. in this regard, each cluster could be insigni   cant with more than one other
cluster, which means there is not enough support from the data for these clusters to exist as signi   cantly
stand-alone.

manually named by analyzing which cases are clustered together. the size of nodes and links represent
the citation    ow within and between clusters, and we have highlighted mutually insigni   cant clusters by

figure 7. map of ecj case law. we partitioned 8,200 court case documents with 32,000 citations.
afterwards, we generated 100 resampled networks using the triangle completion method. by id91
these resampled networks and comparing them to the id91 of the raw network, we can estimate
how much support the data provide in partitioning the raw network. the map represents the 40 top
modules. insigni   cant clusters and their mutually insigni   cant friends are shaded with blue areas.

several of the identi   ed clusters represent well-established areas of law. one example is equal treat-
ment (125 cases with 25 cases in the signi   cant core, or 25/125 cases for short), which aggregates cases
concerning discrimination of individuals based on nationality. less intuitive, but seemingly valid, is the
id91 of cases concerning the justi   cation of such discrimination into a separate cluster, justifying
unequal treatment of persons (113/134 cases). interestingly, completing triangles aggregates not these

9

two clusters but the latter with cases concerning members states    (ms) justi   cation of other violations of
substantive rights in the highlighted area ms justifying restrictions of basic freedoms in figure 7. legal
scholars have speculated in a convergence of these areas of law without being able to conclusively demon-
strate this trend. another example of a structure that does not    t squarely into the traditional legal
classi   cation is borderline cases in the internal market (36/74 cases). the cluster works as a hub between
di   erent areas of law, bringing together cases involving several di   erent substantive issues, including inter
alia equal treatment.

the signi   cance map in figure 7 demonstrates that a single id91 of the sparse network is insuf-
   cient and can be misleading. for example, the map contains two clusters representing cases concerning
value added tax (vat) (83/113 and 89/101 cases, respectively), even though there are no considerable
di   erences between cases belonging to the two clusters. the signi   cance analysis reveals that the two
clusters are not signi   cantly stand alone, because the signi   cant cores are clustered together in 80 per-
cent of all bootstrap networks. by completing triangles and aggregating the clusters, we can resolve the
problem caused by missing links. the same is true for public service contracts (33/60 and 25/46 cases
with 83 percent co-id91 of signi   cant cores). the same is also true for infringement proceedings
(10/58, 34/44, and 2/51 cases with 31 percent co-id91 between the least co-clustered pair of sig-
ni   cant cores) and adoption & review of eu legislation (51/116, 31/43, and 5/38 cases with 31 percent
co-id91 between the least co-clustered pair of signi   cant cores). these clusters are also interesting
because the cases are clustered based on the grounds for jurisdiction (procedural clusters), which would
likely be absent in a more traditional legal categorization of the case law.

we also    nd, somewhat surprising from a legal perspective, that substantive, constitutional, and
procedural clusters are closely related. for example, we    nd that there is a strong relationship between
national procedural autonomy (28/77 cases), which aggregates cases concerning the constitutional issue
of procedural adequacy of national courts enforcing eu law, and the principle of equal pay (74/84 cases),
a cluster representing the substantive issue of the right of men and women to equal pay for equal work.
the pattern of interconnected substantive and constitutional clusters remains on the level of aggregated
clusters. completing triangles and aggregating mutually insigni   cant clusters reveal a strong relationship
between the highlighted constitutional area e   ective enforcement and the highlighted substantive area
equality between men and women.

these results con   rm that combining our resampling method with the signi   cance analysis of the
preliminary clusters can provide reliable aggregated clusters that help us better understand the modular
organization of a system with missing information.

to summarize, using communities as the principal component of complex systems is reliable only if
the communities are statistically signi   cant and not the result of noisy or incomplete data. to assess
the signi   cance of communities in networks with missing links, we have suggested a simple approach
that perturbs the sparse networks in a constructive way by adding links based on triangle completion.
the remaining challenge is to estimate the optimal number of links to be added, but our benchmark
tests indicate that results are insensitive to the number of added links. we used our method to identify
signi   cantly stand-alone communities and aggregate mutually insigni   cant communities in the sparse
network of european court of justice case law. with a signi   cance map of ecj case law, for the    rst
time we can analyze the large-scale organization of european law. we have, for example, identi   ed
structures and relationships that do not    t into the traditional legal classi   cation system and empirically
con   rmed trends that legal scholars have only speculated in.
