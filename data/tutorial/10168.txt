many networks exhibit scale free behaviour where their degree distribution obeys a power law
for large vertex degrees. models constructed to explain this phenomena have relied on preferential
attachment where the networks grow by the addition of both vertices and edges, and the edges attach
themselves to a vertex with a id203 proportional to its degree. simulations hint, though not
conclusively, that both growth and preferential attachment are necessary for scale free behaviour.
we derive analytic expressions for degree distributions for networks that grow by the addition of
edges to a    xed number of vertices, based on both linear and non-linear preferential attachment, and
show that they fall o    exponentially as would be expected for purely random networks. from this
we conclude that preferential attachment alone might be necessary but is certainly not a su   cient
condition for generating scale free networks.

many natural and man made networks possess a scale
free degree distribution where the tail of the distribution
follows a power law [1]. these networks are particularly
interesting because they hint at complicated processes
underlying their generation - processes su   ciently com-
plex that the resulting networks cannot be described by a
few simple parameters like the mean and standard devi-
ation. generative models that have been constructed to
explain this behaviour assume networks grow by adding
vertices one by one, with each vertex having a    xed num-
ber of either directed or undirected edges that connect to
other existing vertices with a id203 proportional to
their degree [2, 3]. for most models, in the limit of large
network size, the distribution for large degrees falls o   
with an exponent that is between 2 and 3. the basic
linear preferential model has been extended to include
the addition and removal of edges after the vertices have
been added and again the networks have been shown to
be scale free [4   7]. finally it has been shown that mod-
els, where the id203 of attachment to a vertex goes
as a power of the degree of the vertex, generate stretched
exponentials when that power is less than one [8]. for
reviews of these and other results on random graphs in
general see [9]. for a particularly readable and pedagog-
ical treatment of these results see [10].

all these models are variants of the basic citation net-
work, where the network grows both by the addition of
vertices and of edges. one of the characteristics of these
models is that older vertices in the network - those added
earlier in the growth process - have more time to acquire
edges than more recent vertices and, in fact, it has been
shown that these vertices on the average have a higher de-
gree [11]. simulations seem to indicate that both growth
(of vertices) and preferential attachment are necessary for
scale free behaviour although the result is not conclusive.
detecting power law behaviours in simulation data or real
world data is di   cult because of the large    uctuations
that occur in the tail of the distribution [1]. while sim-

ulation of the growth of a citation network without pref-
erential attachment clearly shows exponential behaviour,
simulation results for edges attached to a    xed number
of vertices through preferential attachment never seem
to have attained a stationary state - initially the degree
distribution seems to show scale free behaviour but then
the network reaches saturation, where all the vertices are
fully interconnected [3].
in this paper we derive ana-
lytic expressions for the degree distribution of networks
where edges attach themselves to a    xed number of ver-
tices through preferential attachment (both linear and
non-linear) and show that the degree distributions fall
o    exponentially just as you would expect for purely ran-
dom networks. thus preferential attachment might be a
necessary but is certainly not a su   cient condition for
generating networks with scale free degree distributions.
we construct our generative network model by consid-
ering n vertices and then grow the network by attaching
edges to vertices, or more accurately ends of edges (stubs)
to vertices. at each time step we add the end of an undi-
rected edge to one of the n vertices based on some prob-
ability pk. the other end of the edge is then attached
to any of the n vertices with a id203 drawn from
the same distribution pk. at time t, (t even), the stubs
attached to the vertices can be connected randomly to
produce one, among many equally likely, network con   g-
urations all with the same degree sequence and distribu-
tion. in the process of growing, at any given time t, the
network will have t/2 edges. at any time in the growth

of the network, t =

ki where ki is the degree of the

ith vertex. in this model the other end of the edge can
be attached to the same vertex producing self-edges or
   tadpoles   . we also do not rule out multi-edges, where
two vertices can have more than one edge (   melons   ). it
has been shown that the number of either self-edges or
multi-edges remains constant as the network grows if the
second moment of the degree distribution,   k2 =

n

k2
i /n,

is    nite and independent of n. we will show that in our
model the distribution falls o    exponentially for large de-
grees and therefore in the large n limit the presence of
self-edges or multi-edges should not have any bearing on
our fundamental result.

we derive a master equation for the evolution of the
degree distribution by considering an ensemble of net-
works growing in the manner described above. at t = 0,
the network starts o    with n vertices, and no edges. at
every time step, we add a stub, or the end of an edge to
a vertex with id203 given by

pk (  )     (a + k  ) .

(1)

where a is a positive constant (typically set to around
1) which ensures that all vertices, including those with
degree 0 get a base chance at acquiring edges, and    is
a positive constant between 0 and 1. (it has been shown
that for    > 1, a single vertex gains a non-zero fraction
of all edges and we will not be considering it here [8].)
the properly normalized id203 for the attachment
of a stub to a vertex is given by

pk (  ) =

n (k, t) (a + k  )
n [a+ < k   > (t)]

,

k     1

and

(2)

2

pk (  ) =

n (k, t) (a +     ,0)
n [a+ < k   > (t)]

,

k = 0,

(3)

where n (k, t) is the number of vertices of degree k at
time t. in the above equations < k   > (t) =

k  
i /n. in

n

the linear attachment model,    = 1, and

pi=1

< k   > (t) =

n

=   k,

(4)

where   k is the mean degree of a vertex at time t in the evo-
lution of the network. notice that when    = 0 or when
a           , pk = n (k, t) /n, where the stubs are attached
to vertices perfectly randomly and the network generated
will be a completely random graph. (the slightly di   er-
ent form for the id203 for k = 0 ensures that it has
the right limit when    = 0

with the degree distribution given by p (k, t) =
n (k, t) /n, the master equation for the time evolution
of p (k, t) can be shown to be

p (k, t + 1,   ) = p (k, t,   )(cid:26)1    

[a + k  ]

n [a+ < k   >](cid:27) + p (k     1, t,   )

[a + (k     1)  ]
n [a+ < k   >]

,

(5)

with p (k, t) satisfying the initial condition, p (k, 0) =
  k,0. in the equation above, at time step t+ 1, the second
term describes the average loss of the number of vertices
of degree k because of a stub attaching to a vertex of
degree k while the third term describes the gain in the
number of vertices of degree k because of the attachment
of a stub to a vertex of degree k    1. since the maximum
degree of any vertex at time t cannot exceed t, p (k, t) =
0 for k > t.

it is di   cult to solve the master equation exactly for
all   . however in the n            limit, the equation can be
solved exactly for    = 1, the linear preferential attach-
ment model, where it has been argued networks exhibit
power law behaviour for large k. for    < 1, even if we
cannot derive the exact form of the distribution, we will
deduce the leading large k behaviour of the degree distri-
bution in the n            limit. we    rst recast the master
equation in a form that makes it easier to get the lead-
ing terms in an 1/n expansion of the degree distribution.
to do that, notice that it is easy to get the form of the
solution for k = 0 by induction. it is given by

the solution for the    rst few k and t values suggest trying
a general solution of the form

p (k, t,   ) =

k   1

(a + k  )

n [a+ < k   > (j)](cid:27) f (k, t,   )

(7)
where f (k, t,   ) is to be determined. substituting this
form for the solution in the master equation then gives

f (k, t + 1,   ) = f (k, t,   )+

f (k     1, t,   )
n [a+ < k   > (t)]

l (k, t,   ) where

(6)

in eq.(8), the second term explicitly is of o (1/n), and
so we can approximate and keep only the leading term
in l (k, t,   ) in the limit n           . in the large n limit,
the products in the numerator and denominator can be

approximated by exponentials of sums giving

l (k, t,   )     e

(10)

because the    rst exponential
in l (k, t,   ) introduces
higher order 1/n terms it can be set to 1. in the large n
limit we then get for f (k, t,   )

f (k, t + 1,   ) = f (k, t,   ) +

we next look at two special cases of    for solving the
equation for the distribution p (k, t,   ).

the degree distribution function in the n            limit
becomes

preferential linear attachment

in the preferential linear attachment model,    = 1 in
the formulas for pk (  ) in eq. (2) and eq. (3) . setting
   = 1 in eq.
(7), and using the same approximation
for large n we used in eq. (10), and using the fact that
< k >= t/n, the distribution function then becomes

p (k, t, 1) =

   (a + k)

   (a)    (k + 1)

   (a+k)

   f (k, t, 1) ,
(12)

and f is now given by

f (k, t + 1, 1) = f (k, t, 1) +

way as g(k, z, 1) =

which can be solved using generating functions [13].
de   ning the generating function of f (k, t, 1) in the usual
f (k, t, 1) zt with | z |    1, and
g(k, 0, 1) =   k,0, it can be shown that g(k, z, 1) satis   es
the equation

pt=0

   

g (k, z) = (cid:16) z

na(cid:17)k

(1     z)k+1 .

the coe   cient of zt then gives us

f (k, t, 1) =

   (a) (na)k

t!

k! (t     k)! (cid:20) na

na + t(cid:21)a+k

.

(18)
since we are mainly interested in the t            limit, such
that t/n =   k is    nite, we get
1 +   k/a(cid:21)k
(cid:2)1 +   k/a(cid:3)a (cid:20)   k/a

p (k, t,    = 1) =

   (a)    (k + 1)

   (a + k)

.

importantly, in the large k limit, as k           ,
p (k, t,    = 1)     ka   1e   k ln(1+a/  k),

(20)

and the leading k dependence falls o    exponentially
rather than as a power law.

non-linear attachment

we will show that the leading large k dependence falls
o    exponentially for arbitrary 0 <    < 1 even though
we have not been able to get an exact form for the de-
gree distribution. we start with the basic equation for
f (k, t,   ) given by eq. (11) . we already saw that for
   = 1, f is given by eq. (17) . in the opposite limit of
   = 0, < k   >= 1, and the equation for f takes the form

f (k, t + 1, 0) = f (k, t, 0) +

f (k     1, t)
n (a + 1)

,

(21)

which can again be solved easily by the generating func-
tion method to give

f (k, t, 0) =

1

t!

nk (a + 1)k

k! (t     k)!

.

(22)

the solution for the degree distribution for arbitrary   ,
and large t now takes the form

p (k, t,   ) =

  kk
k!

f (k,   )

k   1

yi=0

(a + i  ) e

(a+k   )

n

   

t   1

pj=0

1

[a+<k   >(j)]

,

(23)

where f (k,   ), though an unknown function, goes from
f (k,    = 0) = (a + 1)k to f (k,    = 1) = ak.
since
k   1
(a + i  ) < (k     1)k, for large k, the degree distri-
qi=0

bution becomes

p (k, t,   ) <

  kk

   kf (k,   )

e   k e

(a+k   )

n

   

t   1

pj=0

1

[a+<k   >(j)]

.

(24)
we expect that f (k,   ) is a smooth well-behaved func-
tion of    between the two limits    = 0 and    = 1 in
which case f     ak. since the summation in the expo-
nential is a function only of t, we can conclude that the
leading behaviour of p (k, t,   ) for large k is still a simple
exponential.

in conclusion, we have shown that in models of pref-
erential attachment, the resulting degree distribution for
large degrees falls o    exponentially when the model starts
with a    xed number of vertices and adds edges so that
they attach themselves to the vertices with a id203
proportional to a power of the degree of the vertex. this
is in contrast to preferential attachment models that are
based on id191, where the network is con-
structed by growing both the vertices and the edges and
where it has been shown that the resulting degree distri-
bution for large degree is either scale free or a stretched
exponential. since it is known that in these models ear-

lier vertices acquire excess edges, we conclude that pref-
erential attachment alone is not a su   cient condition for
generating scale free networks.
