we analyze emotionally annotated massive data from irc (internet relay chat) and model
the dialogues between its participants by assuming that the driving force for the discussion is the
id178 growth of emotional id203 distribution. this process is claimed to be correlated to
the emergence of the power-law distribution of the discussion lengths observed in the dialogues. we
perform numerical simulations based on the noticed phenomenon obtaining a good agreement with
the real data. finally, we propose a method to arti   cially prolong the duration of the discussion
that relies on the id178 of emotional id203 distribution.

introduction

the extensive records of data opened new possibilities
of examining communication between humans ranging
from face-to-face encounters [1   4], through mobile tele-
phone calls [5, 6], surface-mail [7] short messages [8] to
typical internet activities such as e-mail correspondence
[9], bulletin board system (bbs) dialogues [10], forum
postings [11] or twitter microblogging [12].

communication and its evolution is one of the key as-
pects of a modern life, which in an overwhelming part is
governed by the circulation of information. in the most
fundamental part, the communication is based on a dia-
logue - an exchange of information and ideas between two
people [13]. assuming an ideal situation, if the highest
priority would be given to acquiring certain information,
from a layman point of view the dialogue should be free
from any additional components that could restrain con-
versation   s participants from achieving the common goal.
in reality, it is extremely di   cult to model the dialogue
complexity which, among others, would need to consider
the dialogues    semantic, pragmatic, social and emotional
context sequences of turn-taking [14, 15], let alone its
attentive [16] or contextual [17] layers.

as compared to the o   -line communication, the ex-
change of information in the internet is claimed to be
more biased toward the emotional aspect [18].
it can
be explained by a online disinhibition e   ect [19]     the
sense of anonymity that almost all internet users pos-
sess while submitting their opinions on various fora or
blogs. nevertheless, it is the very internet that gives the
opportunity to acquire massive data, thus making it pos-
sible to perform a credible statistical analysis of common
habits in communication. as the recent research shows,
it is already possible to spot certain phenomena of the
internet discussion participants while looking just at the
emotional content of their posts [20   24]. one of them is
the collective emotional behavior [23], the other is clear

correlation between the length of discussion and its emo-
tional content [23, 24].

in this paper we argue that a simple physical approach
based on the observation of id178 of emotional prob-
ability distribution during the conversation can serve as
an indicator of a discussion about to    nish. this pro-
cess is claimed to be correlated to the emergence of the
power-law distribution of the discussion length and serves
as a key idea for the numerical simulations of the di-
alogues. the paper is organized as follows: section ii
gives a brief description of the used data as well as of
the emotional classi   cation method, section iii presents
our observations regarding the discussion length distri-
bution, equalization of the emotional probabilities and
id178 growth, in section iv we show the description
of simulations rules which results are given in section v.
finally, section vi describes a potential application of
the observed phenomenon.

ii. data description

as a source of data for analysing online dialogues we
chose the internet relay chat (irc) [25] logs. some
of the the major irc channels are being automatically
archived by the channel operators, the logs are often
accessible to a general public, and include the records

one of the channels, namely #ubuntu [26] in the period
1st january 2007 - 31st december 2009. in this work we
focused on dialogues that included only two participants.
the    nal output, after several levels of data process-
ing (for details see appendix a) consists of n = 93329
dialogues with the length l between lmin = 11 and
lmax = 339 each. each dialogue can be represented as
a chain of messages (see fig. 1) where all odd posts are
submitted by one user and all even by another one.

the emotional classi   er program that was used to an-
alyze the emotional content of the discussions is based
on a machine-learning (ml) approach. the algorithm
functions in two phases: during the training phase, it is
provided with a set of documents classi   ed by humans
for emotional content (positive, negative or objective)
from which it learns the characteristics of each category.
then, during the application phase, the algorithm ap-
plies the acquired sentiment classi   cation knowledge to
new, unseen documents. in our analysis, we trained a hi-
erarchical language model [27, 28] on the blogs06 collec-
tion [29] and applied the trained model to the extracted
irc dialogues, during the application phase. the algo-
rithm is based on a two-tier solution, according to which

a post is initially classi   ed as objective or subjective and
in the latter case, it is further classi   ed in terms of its
polarity, i.e., positive or negative. each level of classi   -
cation applies a binary language model [28, 30]. posts
are therefore annotated with a single value e =    1, 0 or
1 to quantify their emotional content (to be more pre-
cise - their valence [31]) as negative, neutral or positive,
respectively.

iii. common features

the obtained dialogues have been divided into groups
of constant dialogue length l. for such data we follow
the evolution of mean emotional value heil
i and average
emotional probabilities hp(e)il
i . in both cases the

i (heil

h...il
i symbol indicates taking all dialogues with a speci   c
length l and averaging over all comments with number i,
thus, for example, hp(   )il
is the id203 that at the
i
position i in all dialogues of length l there is a negative
statement. the characteristic feature observed regardless
of the dialogue length is that the heil
i at the end of the
dialogue is higher than at the beginning (upper row in
fig. 2). in fact, there is especially a rapid growth close
the very end of the dialogue.

the direct reason for such behavior is shown in the
bottom row of fig. 2, which presents the evolution of
the average emotional probabilities hp(   )il
i and
hp(+)il
i . the observations can be summarized in the
following way:

other manifestation of the system   s features can be
spotted by examining the level of the id178 s of the
emotional probabilities hp(e)il
i . id178 or other infor-
mation theoretic quantities as mutual information [33],
kullback-leiber divergence [34] or jensen-shannon di-
vergence [34] have been already used to quantify certain
aspects of human mobility [35], semantic resemblance or
   ow between wikipedia pages [36, 37] or correlations be-
tween consecutive emotional posts [38]. moreover, bas-
ing on id178, it has also been shown how the coherent
structures in the e-mail dialogues arise [9] or how to pre-
dict conversation patterns in face-to-face meetings [3]. in
this paper, the id178 is used after shannon   s de   nition
[32], i.e.,

i =     x

e=   1,0,1

hp(e)il

here, taking into account the fact that hp(   )il
is con-
i
stant in the course of dialogue, we paid attention only
to hp(+)il
i , thus the observed id178 had a
form of

si =    (cid:2)hp(0)il
plotting the di   erence between terminal and initial en-
tropy    s versus the length of the dialogue l it is possible
to see that for the dialogues up to l     50 this di   erence
is always above zero (see fig. 3). it implies a following

i lnhp(+)il
i (cid:3) .

(2)

likely scenario for the dialogue:
it evolves in the direc-
tion of growing id178. in the beginning of the dialogue,
the probabilities hp(0)il
i are separated from
each other, contributing to low value of initial id178
sp. however, then the id178 grows, the probabilities
hp(0)il
i equalize leading to high value en-
tropy (i.e., higher than the initial one) at the end of the
dialogue.

however, it is essential to notice that the observed be-
havior in the irc data is only one of the possible scenar-
ios of the more general phenomenon of the principle of
maximum id178 [39], governing also certain aspects of
biological [40] or social systems [41] (at the level of social
networks). to be more precise, we performed an anal-
ysis analogous to this for the irc data with respect to
emotionally annotated dataset from the bbc forum (see
[23] and [24]) consisting of over 2    106 comments and
almost 105 discussions. in this case each discussion was
treated as a natural    dialogue   , although it usually con-
sisted of more than 2 users communicating to each other.
following the line of thought presented for irc data we
grouped all discussion of constant length and calculated
the quantities hp(   )il
. the
results, shown in fig. 4, bear close resemblance to those
obtained for irc data: one can clearly see that while the
negative component decreases, the positive and objective
(partially) ones increase. it has an instant e   ect on the
value of id178 which grows during the evolution of the
discussion (topmost row in fig. 4). the main di   er-
ence between irc and bbc forum results concerns the
component whose value decreases during the discussion
evolution: for irc it is the hp(0)il
i while for bbc forum
- hp(   )il
i . it is directly connected to the fact that the
above mentioned components play the role of    discus-
sion fuel    [23] propelling thread   s evolution. bbc forum
data come from such categories as    world news    and
   uk news    and as such may lead the discussion partic-
ipants to place comments of very negative valence. on
the other hand #ubuntu irc channel servers rather as a
source of professional help which is normally expressed
in terms of neutral dialogue. as the discussion lasts, the
topic dilutes (bbc forum) or the problem is being solved
(irc) and the dominating component dies out leading to
maximization of id178.

there is also another process taking place in the sys-
tem in question that displays a non-trivial behavior. as
shown previously in [23], we can talk about grouping of
similarly emotional messages. to quantify the persis-
tence of a speci   c emotion one can consider the condi-
tional id203 p(e|ne) that after n comments with
the same emotional valence the next comment has the
same sign. as it easy to prove, if e were an identical
and independently distributed (i.i.d.) variable the condi-
tional id203 p(e|ne) should be independent of n and
equal to p(e), i.e., the id203 of a speci   c emotion
in the whole dataset (see table i) in the case of the irc
data, the analysis shows (see fig. 5) that p(e|ne) is well

where p(e|e) is the id155 that two con-
secutive messages have the same emotion. the discrep-
ancy between the data and the relation obtained by ran-
dom insertion of emotional comments (see open symbols
in fig. 5) is signi   cant. the exponents    and the condi-
tional probabilities p(e|e) are gathered in table i.

expressing in fact the id178 in the i-th time window.
the practical way of application is shown in fig. 6 for
a dialogue of l = 30 comments. in this case the size of
the time window is set to m = 10.

the data-driven facts presented in the previous section
lie at the basis of the simulation of dialogues in irc chan-
nels data. the key point treated as an input parameter
for this model is the observation of the preferential attrac-
tion of consecutive emotional messages. this idea    runs   
the dialogue, whereas the discussion is terminated once
the di   erence between the id178 in the given moment
and its initial value exceeds certain threshold. those fea-
tures are implemented in the following algorithm:

(1) start the dialogue by drawing the    rst emotional

comment with id203 p(e),

the methodology described above proves to be success-
ful in    nding the prominent characteristic of the data in
question, however it is rather useless if one would like to
perform the simulations of the dialogues. it is crucial to
choose other way for calculating the average emotional
probabilities    on the    y    and, using the results, decide
on the further dialogue evolution. thus, we decided to
work with moving time window, i.e, the probabilities of
the speci   c valences in the i-th timestep are

the next comment one of two other emotional val-
ues (i.e., if the original e = 1, then the next com-
ment valence is 0 with id203 p(0)/[p(0)+p(   )]
or -1 with id203 p(   )/[p(0) + p(   )])

line is for visual guidance.

the observed valence probabilities in this simulation are
always calculated using quantities in a moving time win-
dow given by eqs. (4-5) with m = 10.

there is another crucial parameter connected to the
simulation process, i.e., the initial id178 threshold st .
when time-step i = m is reached, the id178   si is cal-
culated for the    rst time and then decision is taken:
if
  sm < st the simulation runs further, otherwise it is
cancelled and repeated. the total number of successfully
simulated dialogues is equal to this observed in the real
data.

v. simulation results

figure 7 shows a comparison of the average emotional
i for

i and average emotional probabilities hp(e)il

value heil

the real data and simulations performed according to the
algorithm described in the previous section for dialogues
of length l = 50. as one can see the plots bear close
resemblance apart from only one detail, i.e., the rising
value for the hp(   )il

i close to the end of the dialogue.

moreover, the simulation strongly depends on the ex-
act value of the initial id178 threshold st which can
be clearly seen in fig. 8a, where the dialogue length dis-
tribution is presented. if the st is restricted to values
between 0.1-0.5 (empty squares and triangles) the distri-
bution of dialogue lengths is exponential and does not
follow the one observed in the real data (empty circles).
higher values of st (st = 0.6, empty diamonds) shift the
curve closer to the data points, nevertheless the character
is still exponential. it is only after tuning the st parame-
ter to 0.67 that the results obtained from the simulations
(full circles) are qualitatively comparable with the real

data.

vi. application

it is possible to consider a direct application of the
above described model for changing the    trajectory    of
the dialogue. for example let us assume that a dialogue
system [42   44] is included as part of the conversation and
that its task is to prolong the discussion. in such situa-
tion, the system that could rely on the above presented
properties would attempt to detect any signs indicating
that the dialogue might come to an end and react against
it. according to observations presented in section iii a
marker for such event should be the growth of the en-
tropy. in other words the dialogue system should prevent
an increase of the id178 in the consecutive time-steps.
in the described case, such action would be an equiv-
in this
alent to an insertion of an objective comment.
way, an equalization between   pm
i (0) is pre-
vented and dialogue can last further. an implementa-
tion of this rule is presented in fig. 8b, where one can
compare the real data (again empty circles), a simula-
tion including the id178-growth rule (again full circles)
and a simulation following the insertion of objective com-
ments (empty triangles). while there is a drop-down in
the numbers for the small dialogue lengths, the vast ma-
jority of the dialogues has the maximal length (a point
in the top-right corner). in this way the insertion of the
objective comments is in line with the expected idea of
dialogue prolonging.

vii. conclusions

analysis performed on the emotionally annotated dia-
logues extracted from irc data demonstrate that follow-
ing such simple metrics as id203 of speci   c emotion
can be useful to predict the future evolution of the discus-
sion. moreover, all the analysed dialogues share the same
property, i.e., the tendency to evolve in the direction of
a growing id178. those features, combined together
with the observations regarding the preferential growth
of clusters, are su   cient to reproduce the real data by
a rather straightforward simulation model.
in the pa-
per, we also proposed a procedure to directly apply the
observed rules in order to modify the way the dialogue
evolves. it appears, that insertion of comments with emo-
tion that initially had dominated and then started to van-
ish prolongs the discussion by lowering the id178 value.
those observations may be of help for designing the next
generation of interactive software tools[45   47] intended
to support e-communities by measuring various features
of their interactions patterns, including their emotional
state at the individual, group and collective levels.

appendix a: dialogue extraction method

in total, we used 994 daily    les with 4600 to 18000
utterances that share a format presented in the    rst col-
umn from the left in table ii: post number [timestamp]
huser idi sentiment class with the sentimentclass e =
{   1; 0, 1} used as marker for the emotional valence
through this study. moreover, we could also use informa-
tion that speci   es which user communicates, i.e., directly
addresses, another user (see second column in table ii,
shown as haddressing user idi     haddressed user idi).
the discovery of the direct communication links between
two users in the irc channel was based on the dis-
covery of another userid at the beginning of an utter-
ance, followed by a comma or semicolon signs; a scheme
commonly used in various multiple users communication
channels. however, one has to bear in mind that this
kind of information can be sometimes incomplete, i.e., in
many cases users do not explicitly specify the receiver of
his/her post. another issue that arises is that the data
consist of several overlapping dialogues held simultane-
ously on one channel.
it is also sometimes di   cult to
indicate the receiver of the message as only part of them
are annotated with a user id they are dedicated to. we
created an algorithm that addresses this issue. it consists
of two di   erent approaches:

(a) if user a addresses user b in some moment in time
and later a writes consecutive messages without
addressing anybody speci   c we assume that he/she
is still having a conversation with b

(b) if user a addresses user b and then b writes a
message without addressing anybody speci   c we as-
sume that he/she is answering to a.

the main parameter of such algorithm is the time t in
which the searching is being done; in our study we use
t = 5 minutes as the threshold value . an exemplary
output from the algorithm is shown in the third column
in table ii. in this way we are able to extract a set of
dialogues from each of the daily    les. after processing
the    le according to above described rules another issue
emerges: it often happens that a user gives a set of con-
secutive messages directed to one receiver (e.g, the 8th,
10th and 11th line in the third column in table ii). to

table ii: the process of dialogue extraction in the irc channel data. columns from the left show consecutive steps of the
algorithm:    rst and second show the raw data, third is data after application of the searching procedure, fourth is data after
averaging multiple posts from the same user and    fth column gives the    nal output. [hh : mm] de   nes the timestamp in hours
(hh) and minutes (mm), huser idi gives the id of the user that addresses the post, hadressing user idi     haddresed user idi
gives the ids of both addressing and addressed users and value {   1, 0, 1} shows the valence of the post.

create a standardize version of the dialogue (a to b, b
to a, a to b and so on), we decided to accumulate the
consecutive emotional messages of the same user, calcu-
late the average value   e in such series and then transform
it back into a three-sate value according to the formula

ei =    1
ei = 0
ei = 1

in e   ect we obtain the set shown in the fourth column in
table ii. the    nal step of the data preparation is to di-
vide it into separate dialogues as shown in the 5th column
in table ii. in total, the algorithm produces n = 93329
dialogues with the length between l = 11 and l = 339
(all the dialogues with l     10 were omitted).
