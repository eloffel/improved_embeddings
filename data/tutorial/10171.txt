abstract
online social networking technologies enable individuals to
simultaneously share information with any number of peers.
quantifying the causal e   ect of these mediums on the dis-
semination of information requires not only identi   cation
of who in   uences whom, but also of whether individuals
would still propagate information in the absence of social sig-
nals about that information. we examine the role of social
networks in online information di   usion with a large-scale
   eld experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about
friends    information sharing among 253 million subjects in
situ. those who are exposed are signi   cantly more likely to
spread information, and do so sooner than those who are
not exposed. we further examine the relative role of strong
and weak ties in information propagation. we show that,
although stronger ties are individually more in   uential, it
is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the
propagation of novel information. this suggests that weak
ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of
information online than currently believed.

introduction

social in   uence can play a crucial role in a range of behav-
ioral phenomena, from the dissemination of information, to
the adoption of political opinions and technologies [23, 42],
which are increasingly mediated through online systems [17,
   part of this research was performed while the author was
a student at the university of michigan.

38]. despite the wide availability of data from online social
networks, identifying in   uence remains a challenge.
indi-
viduals tend to engage in similar activities as their peers, so
it is often impossible to determine from observational data
whether a correlation between two individuals    behaviors ex-
ists because they are similar or because one person   s behav-
ior has in   uenced the other [5, 32, 39].
in the context of
information di   usion, two people may disseminate the same
information as each other because they possess the same in-
formation sources, such as web sites or television, that they
consume regularly [3, 38].

moreover, homophily     the tendency of individuals with
similar characteristics to associate with one another [1, 28,
34]     creates di   culties for measuring the relative role of
strong and weak ties in information di   usion, since peo-
ple are more similar to those with whom they interact of-
ten [22, 34]. on one hand, pairs of individuals who interact
more often have greater opportunity to in   uence one an-
other and have more aligned interests, increasing the chances
of contagion [11, 27]. however, this commonality ampli-
   es the potential for confounds: those who interact more
often are more likely to have increasingly similar informa-
tion sources. as a result, id136s made from observa-
tional data may overstate the importance of strong ties in
information spread. conversely, individuals who interact
infrequently have more diverse social networks that provide
access to novel information [12, 22]. but because contact
between such ties is intermittent, and the individuals tend
to be dissimilar, any particular piece of information is less
likely to    ow across weak ties [14, 37]. historical attempts to
collect data on how often pairs of individuals communicate
and where they get their information have been prone to
biases [10, 33], further obscuring the empirical relationship
between tie strength and di   usion.

confounding factors related to homophily can be addressed
using controlled experiments, but experimental work has
thus far been con   ned to the spread of highly speci   c in-
formation within limited populations [6, 13].
in order to
understand how information spreads in a real-world envi-
ronment, we wish to examine a setting where a large pop-
ulation of individuals frequently exchange information with
their peers. facebook is the most widely used social net-
working service in the world, with over 800 million people
using the service each month. for example, in the united
states, 54% of adult internet users are on facebook [26].

those american users on average maintain 48% of their real
world contacts on the site [26], and many of these individuals
regularly exchange news items with their contacts [38]. in
addition, interaction among users is well correlated with self-
reported intimacy [18]. thus, facebook represents a broad
online population of individuals whose online personal net-
works re   ect their real-world connections, making it an ideal
environment to study information contagion.

we use an experimental approach on facebook to mea-
sure the spread of information sharing behaviors. the ex-
periment randomizes whether individuals are exposed via
facebook to information about their friends    sharing behav-
ior, thereby devising two worlds under which information
spreads: one in which certain information can only be ac-
quired external to facebook, and another in which informa-
tion can be acquired within or external to facebook. by
comparing the behavior of individuals within these two con-
ditions, we can determine the causal e   ect of the medium
on information sharing.

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. we
further motivate our study with additional related work in
section 2. our experimental design is described in section 3.
then, in section 4 we discuss the causal e   ect of exposure
to content on the newsfeed, and how friends    sharing behav-
ior is correlated in time, irrespective of social in   uence via
the newsfeed. furthermore, we show that multiple sharing
friends are predictive of sharing behavior regardless of expo-
sure on the feed, and that additional friends do indeed have
an increasing causal e   ect on the propensity to share.
in
section 5 we discuss how tie strength relates to in   uence and
information di   usion. we show that users are more likely
to have the same information sources as their close friends,
and that simultaneously, these close friends are more likely
to in   uence subjects. using the empirical distribution of tie
strength in the network, we go on to compute the overall
e   ect of strong and weak ties on the spread of information
in the network. finally, we discuss the implications of our
work in section 6.

2. related work

online networks are focused on sharing information, and
as such, have been studied extensively in the context of in-
formation di   usion. di   usion and in   uence have been mod-
eled in blogs [2, 20, 25], email [31], and sites such as twitter,
digg, and flickr [8, 21, 29]. one particularly salient charac-
teristic of di   usion behavior is the correlation between the
number of friends engaging in a behavior and the proba-
bility of adopting the behavior. this relationship has been
observed in many online contexts, from the joining of live-
journal groups [7], to the bookmarking of photos [15], and
the adoption of user-created content [9]. however, as anag-
nostopoulos, et al. [4] point out, individuals may be more
likely to exhibit the same behavior as their friends because
of homophily rather than as a result of peer in   uence. sta-
tistical techniques such as permutation tests and matched
sampling [5] help control for confounds, but ultimately can-
not resolve this fundamental problem [39].

not all di   usion studies must infer whether one individ-
ual in   uenced another. for example, leskovec et al. [30]
study the explicit graph of product recommendations, sun
et al. [41] study cascading in page fanning, and bakshy et
al. [9] examine the exchange of user-created content. how-
ever, in all these studies, even if the source of a particular

contagion event is a friend, such data does not tell us about
the relative importance of social networks in information dif-
fusion. for example, consider the spread of news. in bradley
greenberg   s classsic study of media contagion [24], 50% of
respondents learned about the kennedy assassination via
interpersonal ties. despite the substantial word-of-mouth
spread, it is clear that all of the respondents would have
gotten the news at a slightly later point in time (perhaps
from the very same media outlets as their contacts), had
they not communicated with their peers. therefore, a com-
plete understanding of the importance of social networks in
information di   usion not only requires us to identify sources
of interpersonal contagion, but also requires a counterfactual
understanding of what would happen if certain interactions
did not take place.

relationships

figure 1:
explain
di   usion-like phenomena. information presented in
users    news feeds and other sharing behavior on
facebook.com are observed. external events that
cause users to be exposed to information outside of
facebook cannot be observed and may explain their
sharing behavior. our experiment blocks the causal
relationship (dashed arrow) between the facebook
newsfeed and user visitation by randomly removing
stories about friends    sharing behavior in subjects   
feeds. thus, our experiment allows us to compare
situations where both in   uence via the feed and ex-
ternal correlations exist (the feed condition), to situ-
ations in which only external correlations exist (the
no feed condition).

3. experimental design and data

facebook users primarily interact with information through
an aggregated history of their friends    recent activity (sto-
ries), called the news feed, or simply feed for short. some of
these stories contain links to content on the web, uniquely
identi   ed by urls. our experiment evaluates how much
exposure to a url on the feed increases an individual   s
propensity to share that url, beyond correlations that one
might expect among facebook friends. for example, friends
with whom a user interacts more often may be more likely
to visit sites that the user also visits. as a result, those
friends may be more likely to share the same url as the

user before she has the opportunity to share that content
herself. additional unobserved correlations may arise due to
external in   uence via e-mail, instant messaging, and other
social networking sites. these causal relationships are illus-
trated in figure 1. from the    gure, one can see that all
unobservable correlations can be identi   ed by blocking the
causal relationship between the facebook feed and sharing.
our experiment therefore randomizes subjects with respect
to whether they receive social signals about friends    sharing
behavior of certain web pages via the facebook feed.

3.1 assignment procedure

subject-url pairs are randomly assigned at the time of
display to either the no feed or the feed condition. stories
that contain links to a url assigned to the no feed condi-
tion for the subject are never displayed in the subject   s feed.
those assigned to the feed condition are not removed from
the feed, and appear in the subject   s feed as normal (fig-
ure 2). pairs are deterministically assigned to a condition at
the time of display, so any subsequent share of the same url
by any of a subject   s friends is also assigned to the same con-
dition. to improve the statistical power of our results, twice
as many pairs were assigned to the no feed condition. be-
cause removal from the feed occurs on a subject-url basis,
and we include only a small fraction of subject-url pairs in

the no feed condition, a shared url is on average delivered
to over 99% of its potential targets.

all activity relating to subject-url pairs assigned to ei-
ther experimental condition is logged, including feed expo-
sures, censored exposures, and clicks to the url (from the
feed or other sources, like messaging). directed shares, such
as a link that is included in a private facebook message or
explicitly posted on a friend   s wall, are not a   ected by the
assignment procedure. if a subject-url pair is assigned to
an experimental condition, and the subject clicks on con-
tent containing that url in any interface other than the
feed, that subject-url pair is removed from the experiment.
our experiment, which took place over the span of seven
weeks, includes 253,238,367 subjects, 75,888,466 urls, and
1,168,633,941 unique subject-url pairs.
3.2 ensuring data quality

threats to data quality include using content that was
or may have been previously seen by subjects on facebook
prior to the experiment, content that subjects may have seen
through interfaces on facebook other than feed, spam, and
malicious content. we address these issues in a number of
ways. first, we only consider content that was shared by
the subjects    friends only after the start of the experiment.
this enables our experiment to accurately capture the    rst
time a subject is exposed to a link in the feed, and ensures

that urls in our experiment more accurately re   ect content
that is primarily being shared contemporaneously with the
timing of the experiment. we also exclude potential subject-
url pairs where the subject had previously clicked on the
url via any interface on the site at any time up to two
months prior to exposure, or any interface other than the
feed for content assigned to the no feed condition. finally, we
use the facebook   s site integrity system [40] to classify and
remove urls that may not re   ect ordinary users    purposeful
intentions of distributing content to their friends.
3.3 population

the experimental population consists of a random sample
of all facebook users who visited the site between august
14th to october 4th 2010, and had at least one friend sharing
a link. at the time of the experiment, there were approxi-
mately 500 million facebook users logging in at least once a
month. our sample consists of approximately 253 million of
these users. all facebook users report their age and gender,
and a user   s country of residence can be inferred from the ip
address with which she accesses the site. in our sample, the
median and average age of subjects is 26 and 29.3, respec-
tively. subjects originate from 236 countries and territories,
44 of which have one million or more subjects. additional
summary statistics are given in table 1, and show that sub-
jects are assigned to the conditions in a balanced fashion.
3.4 evaluating outcomes

the assignment procedure allows us to directly compare
the overall id203 that subjects share links they were
or were not exposed to on the feed. the causal e   ect of
exposure via the facebook feed on sharing is simply the ex-
pected id203 of sharing in the feed condition minus the
expected id203 in the no feed condition. this quantity,

known as the average treatment e   ect on the treated (or al-
ternatively, the absolute risk increase), can vary when con-
ditioning on other variables, including the number of friends
and tie strength, which are analyzed in sections 4 and 5. al-
ternatively, the di   erence in probabilities can be viewed as
a ratio (the relative risk ratio), which quanti   es how many
times more likely an individual is to share as a result of being
exposed to content on the feed.

although the assignment is completely random, subjects
and urls may di   er in ways that impact our measurements.
for example, certain users may be highly active on face-
book, so that they are assigned to experimental conditions
more often than other users. if these users were to vary sig-
ni   cantly in terms of their information sharing propensities,
such as sharing or re-sharing greater or fewer links than oth-
ers, the disproportionate inclusion of these users may bias
our measurements and threaten the population validity of
our    ndings. similarly, very popular urls may also intro-
duce biases; they may be more or less likely to be re-shared
because of their inherent appeal or more likely to be dis-
covered independently of facebook because of their relative
popularity amongst friends.

to provide control for these biases, we use bootstrapped
averages clustered by the subject or url. we    nd that in all
of our analyses, id91 by the url rather than the sub-
ject yields nearly identical id203 estimates that have
marginally wider con   dence intervals, so we have chosen to
present our results using means and 95% con   dence inter-
vals clustered by url. risk ratios are obtained using the
95% bootstrapped con   dence intervals of likelihood of shar-
ing in the feed and no feed conditions. to compute the lower
bound of the ratio, we divide the lower bound of the prob-
ability of sharing in the feed condition by the upper bound
for the no feed condition. the upper bound of the ratio is
computed by dividing the upper bound in the feed condition
by the lower bound of the no feed condition. the additive
analog of the same procedure is used to obtain con   dence
intervals for id203 di   erences.

4. how exposure to social signals

affects diffusion

we    nd that subjects who are exposed to signals about
friends    sharing behavior are several times more likely to
share that same information, and share sooner than those
who are not exposed. to measure the relative increase in
sharing due to exposure, we compute the risk ratio: the like-
lihood of sharing in the feed condition (0.191%) divided by
the likelihood of sharing in the no feed condition (0.025%),
and    nd that individuals in the feed condition are 7.37 times
more likely share (95% ci = [7.23, 7.72]). although the
id203 of sharing upon exposure may appear small, it
is important to note that individuals have hundreds of con-
tacts online who may see their link, and that on average
one out of every 12.5 urls that are clicked on in the feed
condition are subsequently re-shared.
4.1 temporal id91

contemporaneous behavior among connected individuals
is commonly used as evidence for social in   uence processes
(e.g. [4, 9, 8, 15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 29, 36, 43]). we    nd that
subjects who share the same link as their friends typically do
so within a time that is proximate to their friends    sharing

to evaluate how exposure on the facebook feed relates
to the speed at which urls appear to di   use, we consider
urls that were assigned to both the feed and no feed condi-
tion. we    rst match the share time of each url in the feed
condition with a share time of the url in the no feed con-
dition, sampling urls in proportion to their relative abun-
dances in the data. from this set of contrasts, we    nd that
the median sharing latency after a friend has already shared
the content is 6 hours in the feed condition, compared to
20 hours when assigned to the no feed condition (wilcoxon
rank-sum test, p < 10   16). the presence of strong tempo-
ral id91 in both experimental conditions illustrates the
problem with inferring in   uence processes from observations
of temporally proximate behavior among connected individ-
uals: regardless of access to social signals within a particular
online medium, individuals can still acquire and share the
same information as their friends, albeit at a slightly later
point in time.

4.2 effect of multiple sharing friends

classic models of social and biological contagion (e.g. [23,
35]) predict that the likelihood of    infection    increases with
the number of infected contacts. observational studies of
online contagion [4, 9, 15, 30] not only    nd evidence of tem-
poral id91, but also observe a similar relationship be-
tween the likelihood of contagion and the number of infected
contacts. however, it is important to note that this corre-
lation can have multiple causes that are unrelated to social
in   uence processes. for example, if a website is popular
among friends, then a particularly interesting page is more
likely to be shared by a users    friends independent of one
another. the positive relationship between the number of
sharing friends and likelihood of sharing may therefore sim-
ply re   ect heterogeneity in the    interestingness    of the con-
tent, which is clustered along the network: the more popular
a page is for a group of friends, the more likely it is that one
would observe multiple friends sharing it.

we    rst show that, consistent with prior observational
studies, the id203 of sharing a link in the feed condi-
tion increases with the number of contacts who have already
shared the link (solid line, figure 4a). but the presence of a
similar relationship in the no feed condition (grey line, fig-
ure 4a) shows that an individual is more likely to exhibit the
sharing behavior when multiple friends share, even if she
does not necessarily observe her friends    behavior. there-
fore, when using observational data, the na    ve conditional
id203 (which is equivalent to the id203 of shar-
ing in the feed condition) does not directly give the proba-
bility increase due to in   uence via multiple sharing friends.
rather, such an estimate re   ects a mixture of internal in   u-
ence e   ects and external correlation.

our experiment allows us to directly measure the e   ect of
the feed relative to external factors, computed as either the
di   erence or ratio between the id203 of sharing in the
feed and no feed conditions (figure 4bc). while the di   er-
ence in sharing likelihood grows with the number of sharing
friends, the relative risk ratio falls. this contrast suggests
that social information in the feed is most likely to in   uence
a user to share a link that many of her friends have shared,
but the relative impact of that in   uence is highest for con-
tent that few friends are sharing. the decreasing relative
e   ect is consistent with the hypothesis that having multi-
ple sharing friends is associated with greater redundancy in

time, even when no exposure occurs on facebook. figure 3
illustrates the cumulative distribution of information lags
between the subject and their    rst sharing friend, among
subjects who had shared a url after their friends. the top
panel shows the latency in sharing times between the subject
and their friend for users in the feed and no feed condition.
while a larger proportion of users in the feed condition share
a link within the    rst hour of their friends, the distribution
of sharing times is strikingly similar. the bottom panel
shows the di   erences in time between when subjects shared
and when they were (or would have been)    rst exposed to
their friends    sharing behavior on the facebook feed. the
horizontal axis is negative when a subject had shared a link
after a friend but had not yet seen that link on the feed.
from this comparison, it is easy to see that users in the feed
condition are most likely to share a link immediately upon
exposure, while those who share it without seeing it in their
feed will do so over a slightly longer period of time.

in   uence.

5. tie strength and influence

next, we examine the relationship between tie strength,
in   uence, and information diversity by combining the ex-
perimental data with users    online and o   ine interactions.
following arguments originally proposed by mark granovet-
ter   s seminal 1973 paper, the strength of weak ties [22],
empirical work linking tie strength and di   usion often uti-
lize the number of mutual contacts as proxies of interaction
frequency. rather than using the number of mutual con-
tacts, which can be large for pairs of individuals who no
longer communicate (e.g.
former classmates), we directly
measure the strength of tie between a subject and her friend
in terms of four types of interactions: (i) the frequency of
private online communication between the two users in the
form of facebook messages1; (ii) the frequency of public on-
line interaction in the form of comments left by one user
on another user   s posts; (iii) the number of real-world coin-
cidences captured on facebook in terms of both users be-
ing labeled by users as appearing in the same photograph;
and (iv) the number of online coincidences in terms of both
users responding to the same facebook post with a com-
ment. frequencies are computed using data from the three
months directly prior to the experiment. the distribution of
tie strengths among subjects and their sharing friends can
be seen in figure 5.
5.1 effect of tie strength

we measure how the di   erence in the likelihood of sharing
a url in the feed versus no feed conditions varies according

1we quantify message and comment interactions as the
number of communication events the subject received from
their friend. the number of messages and comments sent,
and the geometric mean of communications sent and re-
ceived, yielded qualitatively similar results, so we plot only
the single directed measurement for the sake of clarity.

ments. points are plotted up to the 99.9th percentile.

to tie strength. to simplify our estimate of the e   ect of tie
strength, we restrict our analysis to subjects with exactly
one friend who had previously shared the link. in both con-
ditions, a subject is more likely to share a link when her
sharing friend is a strong tie (figure 6a). for example, sub-
jects who were exposed to a link shared by a friend from
whom the subject received three comments are 2.83 times
more likely to share than subjects exposed to a link shared
by a friend from whom they received no comments. for
those who were not exposed, the same comparison shows
that subjects are 3.84 times more likely to share a link that
was previously shared by the stronger tie. the larger ef-

that a friend shared in the feed and no feed conditions. (b) the multiplicative e   ect of feed diminishes with
tie strength, suggesting that exposure through strong ties may be redundant with external exposure, while
weak ties carry information one might otherwise not have been exposed to.

fect in the no feed condition suggests that tie strength is a
stronger predictor of externally correlated activity than it is
for in   uence on feed. from figure 6a, it is also clear that
individuals are more likely to be in   uenced by their stronger
ties via the feed to share content that they would not have
otherwise spread.

furthermore, our results extend granovetter   s hypothesis
that weak ties disseminate novel information into the con-
text of media contagion. figure 6b shows that the risk ratio
of sharing between the feed and no feed conditions is highest
for content shared by weak ties. this suggests that weak
ties consume and transmit information that one is unlikely
to be exposed to otherwise, thereby increasing the diversity
of information propagated within the network.
5.2 collective impact of ties

strong ties may be individually more in   uential, but how
much di   usion occurs in aggregate through these ties de-
pends on the underlying distribution of tie strength (i.e.
figure 5). using the experimental data, we can estimate
the amount of contagion on the feed generated by strong
and weak ties. the causal e   ect of exposure to information
shared by friends with tie strength k is given by the average
treatment e   ect on the treated:

atet(k) = p(k, feed)     p(k, no feed)

to determine the collective impact of ties of strength k,
we multiply this quantity by the fraction of links displayed
in all users    feeds posted by friends of tie strength k, denoted
by f (k). in order to compare the impact of weak and strong
ties, we must set a cuto    value for the minimum amount
of interaction required between two individuals in order to
consider that tie strong. setting the cuto    at k = 1 (a

single interaction) provides the most generous classi   cation
of strong ties while preserving some meaningful distinction
between strong and weak ties, thereby giving the most in-
   uence credit to strong ties.

under this categorization of strong and weak ties, the esti-
mated total fraction of sharing events that can be attributed
to weak and strong ties is the average treatment e   ect on
the treated weighted by the proportion of url exposures
from each tie type:

tweak = atet(0)     f (0)

tstrong =

atet(i)     f (i)

n(cid:88)

i=1

we illustrate this comparison in figure 7, and show that
by a wide margin, the majority of in   uence is generated by
weak ties2. although we have shown that strong ties are
individually more in   uential, the e   ect of strong ties is not
large enough to match the sheer abundance of weak ties.

6. discussion

social networks may in   uence an individual   s behavior,
but they also re   ect the individual   s own activities, inter-
ests, and opinions. these commonalities make it nearly im-
possible to determine from observational data whether any
particular interaction, mode of communication, or social en-

2note that for the purposes of this study, it is not neces-
sary to model the e   ect of tie strength for users with multi-
ple sharing friends, since stories of this kind only constitute
4.2% of links in the newsfeed, and their inclusion would not
dramatically alter the balance of aggregate in   uence by tie
strength.

otherwise spread.

although weak ties can serve a critical bridging func-
tion [22, 37], the in   uence that weak ties exert has never
before been measured empirically at a systemic level. we
   nd that the majority of in   uence results from exposure to
individual weak ties, which indicates that most information
di   usion on facebook is driven by simple contagion. this
stands in contrast to prior studies of in   uence on the adop-
tion of products, behaviors or opinions, which center around
the e   ect of having multiple or densely connected contacts
who have adopted [6, 7, 14, 13]. our results suggest that in
large online environments, the low cost of disseminating in-
formation fosters di   usion dynamics that are di   erent from
situations where adoption is subject to positive externalities
or carries a high cost.

because we are unable to observe interactions that occur
outside of facebook, a limitation of our study is that we
can only fully identify causal e   ects within the site. cor-
related sharing in the no feed condition may occur because
friends independently visit and share the same page as one
another, or because one user is in   uenced to share via an ex-
ternal communication channel. although we are not able to
directly evaluate the relative contribution of these two po-
tential causes, our results allow us to obtain a bound on the
e   ect on sharing behavior within the site. the id203
of sharing in the no feed condition, which is a combination of
similarity and external in   uence, is an upper bound on how
much sharing occurs because of homophily-related e   ects.
likewise, the di   erence in the id203 of sharing within
the feed and no feed condition gives a lower bound on how
much on-site sharing is due to interpersonal in   uence along
any communication medium.

the mass adoption of online social networking systems
has the potential to dramatically alter an individual   s ex-
posure to new information. by applying an experimental
approach to measuring di   usion outcomes within one of the
largest human communication networks, we are able to rig-
orously quantify the e   ect of social networks on information
spread. the present work sheds light on aggregate trends
over a large population; future studies may investigate how
properties of the individual, such as age, gender, and nation-
ality, or features of content, such as popularity and breadth
of appeal, relate to the in   uence and its confounds.

figure 7: weak ties are collectively more in   uen-
tial than strong ties. panels show the percentage
of information spread by strong and weak ties for
all four measurements of tie strength. although
the id203 of in   uence is signi   cantly higher
for those that interact frequently, most contagion
occurs along weak ties, which are more abundant.

vironment is responsible for the apparent spread of a behav-
ior through a network. in the context of our study, there are
three possible mechanisms that may explain di   usion-like
phenomena: (1) an individual shares a link on facebook,
and exposure to this information on the feed causes a friend
to re-share that same link. (2) friends visit the same web
page and share a link to that web page on facebook, inde-
pendently of one another. (3) an individual shares a link
within and external to facebook, and exposure to the ex-
ternally shared information causes a friend to share the link
on facebook. our experiment determines the causal e   ect
of the feed on the spread of sharing behaviors by comparing
the likelihood of sharing under the feed condition (possible
causes 1-3) with the likelihood under the no feed condition
(possible causes 2-3).

our experiment generalizes mark granovetter   s predic-
tions about the strength of weak ties [22] to the spread of
everyday information. weak ties are argued to have access
to more diverse information because they are expected to
have fewer mutual contacts; each individual has access to
information that the other does not. for information that
is almost exclusively embedded within few individuals, like
job openings or future strategic plans, weak ties play a nec-
essarily role in facilitating information    ow. this reason-
ing, however, does not necessarily apply to the spread of
widely available information, and the relationship between
tie strength and information access is not immediately obvi-
ous. our experiment sheds light on how tie strength relates
to information access within a broader context, and sug-
gests that weak ties, de   ned directly in terms of interaction
