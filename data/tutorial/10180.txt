culturomics was recently introduced as the application of high-throughput data collection and analysis to the
study of human culture. here we make use of this data by investigating    uctuations in yearly usage frequencies
of speci   c words that describe social and natural phenomena, as derived from books that were published over
the course of the past two centuries. we show that the determination of the hurst parameter by means of fractal
analysis provides fundamental insights into the nature of long-range correlations contained in the culturomic
trajectories, and by doing so, offers new interpretations as to what might be the main driving forces behind the
examined phenomena. quite remarkably, we    nd that social and natural phenomena are governed by fundamen-
tally different processes. while natural phenomena have properties that are typical for processes with persistent
long-range correlations, social phenomena are better described as nonstationary, on-off intermittent, or l  evy
walk processes.

1. introduction

observational data are often very complex, appearing with-
out any structure or pattern in either time or space. examples
of such observations can be found across the whole spectrum
of the social and natural sciences, ranging from economics
[1], to physics [2], biology [3], and medicine [4]. the origins
of observed irregular behavior, however, are not always clear.
roughly    ve decades ago, deterministic chaos was discov-
ered [5] and quickly rose to prominence as a possible mech-
anism of inherent unpredictability and complexity [6, 7]. yet
the strict criteria for declaring deterministic chaos in observed
data [8], most notably the satisfaction of criteria for stationar-
ity and determinism [2], and the veri   cation of exponential di-
vergence [9, 10], are rarely satis   ed. in response, attention has
begun to shift from chaos to noise and random processes as al-
ternate [11] (or, in many cases, as even more probable) sources
of irregularity. while the theory of deterministic chaos re-
lies on nonlinear dynamical systems with typically only a few
degrees of freedom, the analysis of stochastic processes, es-
pecially those that yield data with scale invariance, relies on
random fractal theory [12] or its generalization, multifractal
theory [9, 13]. indeed, investigations based on these theoret-
ical foundations may provide an elegant statistical characteri-
zation of a broad range of heterogeneous phenomena [14], and
in this paper, it is our goal to extend this theory to culturomics,
as recently introduced in [15].

culturomics, and the study of human culture in general,
seemingly has little to do with deterministic chaos and frac-
tals. however, quantitative analyses of various aspects of
human culture have become increasingly popular; examples

include the study of human mobility patterns [16   18], the
spread of infectious diseases [19   22] and malware [23, 24],
the dynamics of online popularity [25], social movement [26]
and language [27   29], and even tennis [30]. this progress is
driven not only by important advances in theory and model-
ing, but also by the increasing availability of vast amounts of
data and knowledge, also referred to as metaknowledge [31],
which allows scientists to apply advanced methods of analysis
on a large scale [32]. the seminal study by [15] was accom-
panied by the release of a vast amount of data comprised of
metrics derived from     4% of books ever published (over    ve
million in total), and it was this release that made the present
study, i.e. the application of random fractal theory, possible.
the data are available at ngrams.googlelabs.com as counts of
id165s that appeared in a given corpus of books published
in each year. an id165 is made up of a series of n 1-grams,
and a 1-gram is a string of characters uninterrupted by a space.
note that a 1-gram is not necessarily a word, for it may be a
number or a typo as well. besides the counts of individual
id165s, the total counts of id165s contained in each corpus
of books in a given year are also provided, from which yearly
usage frequencies can be obtained.

in this paper, we show what new insights are attainable by
applying random fractal theory to this vast culturomic data
set. our goal is to try and go beyond the interpretations of
trajectories provided in [15] by means of an accurate determi-
nation of scaling parameters [33], and in particular the hurst
parameter h, which enables us to characterize the nature of
correlations (memory), if any, contained in the irregular time
series.
in general, data with long-range correlations are an
important subclass of 1/f    noise [34   36], which is charac-
terized by a power-law decaying power spectral density, and
whose dimensionality cannot be reduced by principal compo-
nent analysis since the rank-ordered eigenvalue spectrum also
decays as a power law [37]. processes that generate time se-
ries with such properties are said to have antipersistent corre-

lations if 0 < h < 1/2, are memoryless or have only short-
range correlations if h = 1/2, and have persistent long-range
correlations (long memory) if 1/2 < h < 1 [12]. moreover,
values of h > 1 are possible as well; these values, however,
are characteristic of nonstationary processes or rather special
stationary processes such as on-off intermittency with power-
law distributed on and/or off periods and l  evy walks [10].
(note that the latter should not be confused with l  evy    ights,
which are random processes consisting of many independent
steps, and are thus memoryless with h = 1/2.) prominent
examples where 1/f    noise was recently observed and quan-
ti   ed include dna sequences [38, 39], human cognition [40]
and coordination [41], posture [42], cardiac dynamics [43   
46], as well as the distribution of prime numbers [47], to name
but a few.

despite the many successful attempts at assessing long-
range correlations in complex time series     for example, by
means of detrended    uctuation analysis [48], as well as many
other methods [9, 13]     care should be exercised by their inter-
pretation, particularly if one is faced with relatively short time
series that contain trends [49], nonstationarity [50], or signs of
rhythmic activity [51, 52]. although it is obviously impossi-
ble to make general statements concerning these properties for
all the id165s contained in the corpus of the over    ve mil-
lion digitized books, which amount roughly to over two billion
culturomic trajectories, it is clear that the time series are short,
comprising a little more than     200 points corresponding to
the two centuries considered (more precisely, from year 1770
to 2007), and that many will inevitably contain strong trends
[15]. in order to successfully surpass the dif   culties and pit-
falls associated with the analysis of such time series [10], be-
sides the traditional detrended    uctuation analysis (dfa), we
also use an adaptive fractal analysis (afa), which is based on
nonlinear adaptive multiscale decomposition. we use these
methods to determine the hurst parameter h for several 1-
grams that are representative for social and natural phenom-
ena. examples of words that we focus on include war, unem-
ployment, hurricane and earthquake (see tables 1 and 2 for the
complete list), and we    nd that those that describe social phe-
nomena (war, unemployment, etc.) in general have different
scaling properties than those describing natural phenomena
(hurricane, earthquake, etc.). our results can be corroborated
aptly with arguments from real life, and they    t nicely to the
declared goal of culturomics, which is to extend the bound-
aries of scienti   c inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena
[15].

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in the
next section we present the main results, in section 3 we sum-
marize them and discuss their potential implications, while in
the appendix we describe the details of fractal analysis.

panel (a) the original time series (thin blue line) and the esti-
mated trend (thick red line) for the 1-gram    earthquake   . the
detrended data are presented in panel (b). it can be observed
that overall the trend is very modest and simple, increasing
only slightly towards the present day. using equation 4, the
hurst parameter can be estimated from the slope of the f (w)
versus w dependence on a double log scale. in panel (c), we
show that the analysis of detrended data yields h = 0.65,
while in panel (d), we show that h = 0.75 if the original data
is used as input. both calculations produce similar results,
showing a very modest slope, and rely on statistically robust
scaling. based on the meaning of the hurst parameter, the
fractal analysis of the culturomic trajectory for    earthquake   
reveals that this phenomenon has persistent long-range corre-
lation.

as another example, we show in    gure 2 the same analysis
for the 1-gram    hurricane   . unlike the    earthquake    trajec-
tory, the trend for    hurricane    is more pronounced. it has a
strong upwards component, especially in the last couple of
decades. hence, it can be expected that the discrepancy of
the two estimated h values for the original and detrended
data will be somewhat larger than that for the 1-gram    earth-
quake    analyzed in    gure 1. this expectation is indeed con-
   rmed by comparing panels (c) and (d), from where it follows
that for the detrended data h = 0.70 while for original data
h = 0.85. still, however, both results robustly classify    hur-
ricane    as a phenomenon with persistent long-range correla-
tions, thus adding to the evidence that this may be valid in
general for natural phenomena.

fig. 2: adaptive fractal analysis of the usage frequency of the 1-
gram    hurricane    in the corpus of english books. the hurst param-
eter, as obtained from the detrended data, is h = 0.70. a) the
variation of the usage frequency of    hurricane    with time. the blue
(thin) line depicts the original data, while the red (thick) line depicts
the estimated trend (using a window of length 101). b) detrended
data, i.e. the difference between the blue and red curves in panel a).
c) best    t to the f (w) versus w dependence for detrended data on a
double log scale yields h = 0.70. d) best    t to the f (w) versus w
dependence for original data on a double log scale yields h = 0.85.

to test this hypothesis more thoroughly, we have performed
the same analysis as depicted in    gures 1 and 2, along with
the detrended    uctuation analysis (dfa), for thirteen other
phenomena that can be classi   ed as characteristic of natu-
ral phenomena. although there may be some disagreement
as to what terms are characteristic of natural phenomenon,
and other 1-grams as well as id165s could be suggested as
characteristic of natural phenomena and analyzed, we con-
sider our selection to be suf   ciently representative for this
study. supporting this assumption are the results presented
in table i, which point robustly towards the conclusion that
natural phenomena in general really can be classi   ed as pro-
cesses with persistent long-range correlations. more speci   -
cally, for detrended data, we    nd that all estimated hurst pa-
rameters are within the 1/2 < h < 1 range with an average
of h = 0.69 (afa), which leads us to the mentioned    nal
conclusion. results obtained for original data (before detrend-
ing, not shown), on the other hand, leave a bit more room for
discussion. there, for certain 1-grams, like    mudslide    and
      ooding   , the value of h is larger than one. this suggests
that the data would be more appropriately described as being
either nonstationary, on-off intermittent, or l  evy walk-like.
such a discussion, however, would be to a large degree base-
less as the upward trends occurring towards the present time in
most id165s describing natural phenomena must be properly
taken into account. the observed trends may be considered as
a straightforward consequence of the fact that we have more
and more data readily available on natural phenomena, which
is due to advancements in measuring techniques as well as the

tained by afa is 0.55     h     0.85, with an average over all    f-
teen considered 1-grams equalling h = 0.69. with dfa we obtain
0.41     h     0.85 and h = 0.67.

increasingly global reach of the internet. modern data col-
lection and telecommunication technologies have raised our
awareness, in general, of natural phenomena, and as a result, it
is reasonable to expect this increased awareness to be re   ected
in an increase of occurrences in the corpus. note, however,
that similar arguments can be raised for other    elds and trivia
(e.g. celebrity gossip, popular culture) as well, and thus one
could argue that relatively, the usage frequencies should not
necessarily increase as a result of that.

2.2. social phenomena

turning to social phenomena, we will show that the prob-
lems discussed for natural phenomena are in some cases am-
pli   ed, but more importantly, that social phenomena, apart
from rare exceptions, cannot be classi   ed solely as processes
with persistent-long range correlations.

first, we presented the adaptive fractal analysis for the 1-
gram    war    in    gure 3. the original data depicted by the
thin blue line in panel (a) are clearly reminiscent of histor-
ical events, as world wars i & ii generate two large peaks
that more or less dwarf the usage frequencies reported in other
decades. this observation goes hand in hand not just with the
magnitude of the two world wars, but also with the increase in
the usage frequency of    war    in the published literature at that
time. in agreement with the historical events is the estimated

double log scale yields h = 1.32. d) best    t to the f (w) versus w
dependence for original data on a double log scale yields h = 1.39.

trend line depicted by the thick red line in panel (a). however,
even after the detrending, the resulting culturomic trajectory
still clearly re   ects history in that the periods of world wars i
& ii stand out from the rest, as can be inferred from the curve
depicted in panel (b). the hurst parameter h determined us-
ing the detrended and original data [presented in panels (c)
and (d)] have similar values to each other (h = 1.09 for the
detrended data and h = 1.15 for the original data). as a
result, both classify    war    as either a nonstationary, on-off in-
termittent, or a l  evy walk-like process.

another illustrative example of fractal analysis is presented
in    gure 4, where we examine the 1-gram    unemployment   .
a crucial distinction from    war   , as well as all the considered
natural phenomena, is that unemployment was nonexistent, or
at least it was not mentioned, in the literature prior to 1900,
which is clearly inferable from the original data depicted thin
blue in panel (a). with the coming of age of the industrial
revolution, the job market began to take shape, and with it
came, rather inevitably it seems, the problem of unemploy-
ment. the trend line depicted thick red in panel (a) clearly
captures this fact. moreover, we note that the    rst broad peak
in the plot starts at around 1930, and thus correlates well with
the great depression, while the second broad peak starts at
around 1970, and thus correlates with that period of us eco-
nomic stagnation and high in   ation that was linked with the
middle eastern oil crisis. after detrending, the situation is of
course only marginally improved (in terms of assuring a more
stationary record), as can be concluded from the curve de-
picted in panel (b). the hurst parameters, equalling h = 1.32

for the detrended data (c) and h = 1.39 for the original data
(d), both clearly re   ect nonstationarity, and accordingly,    un-
employment    can be considered the result of such a process.
as in the case with natural phenomena (see table i), we
also performed the same fractal analysis as in    war    and    un-
employment   , along with the detrended    uctuation analysis
(dfa), for thirteen other social phenomena. the results are
presented in table ii. it can be observed that the large majority
of considered 1-grams have h > 1 (afa), which indicates
that social phenomena are most likely to be either nonsta-
tionary, on-off intermittent, or l  evy walk-like process. this
conclusion is obtained irrespective of whether detrending is
performed or not, although the average hurst parameter for
detrended data, equalling h = 1.11 (afa), is smaller than
that obtained for original data (before detrending, not shown),
which is h = 1.26. this technical discrepancy, however, is
likely due to the successful removal of some level of nonsta-
tionarity that is in general characteristic of social phenomena
(more so than of natural phenomena). we would like to note,
however, that in general not all h > 1 occurrences should
be, by default, attributed to nonstationarity in the trajectories.
while visual inspection may lend support to such a conclu-
sion, as this was the case for results presented in    gure 4, in
general the h value alone cannot distinguish between nonsta-
tionary, on-off intermittent or l  evy walk-like processes. in
fact, the time series are too short for a robust assessment of a
more precise nature of the examined social phenomena. at a
glance, and since this is indeed most common, it seems con-
venient to attribute h > 1 in social phenomena to nonstation-

table ii: hurst parameters h, as obtained for the detrended data
of all    fteen considered 1-grams describing social phenomena. the
left column lists results as obtained with the adaptive fractal analy-
sis (afa), while the right column lists results as obtained with the
detrended    uctuation analysis (dfa). the range of values as ob-
tained by afa is 0.74     h     1.33, with the average over all    f-
teen considered 1-grams equalling h = 1.11. with dfa we obtain
0.66     h     1.44 and h = 1.08.

arity, yet only additional future data can enable us to differen-
tiate whether the peaks are part of an on-off intermittent pro-
cess with power law distributed on and/or off events, or if they
are part of a l  evy walk. lastly, we would also like to point
out that of course not all phenomena that can be considered
as social will have h > 1. examples include 1-grams such
as    famine    or    christian   , which for the largest parts of the
recorded human history were either directly related to natural
phenomena (severe droughts,    ooding, or other phenomena
negatively affected that season   s yield on vegetables, crops,
grass, and animal population, hence leading to famine) or have
been an integral part of the human culture for a long time
(prior to the start of the culturomic trajectories). moreover,
social topics that are of little interest will not garner much
attention, and are as such also unlikely to have usage frequen-
cies with h > 1. the social phenomena where the human
factor has played a key role recently and which are reason-
ably popular, however, all share features that are characteristic
of processes with h > 1. in fact, it seems just to conclude
that the more the social phenomena can be considered recent
(unemployment, recession, democracy), the higher their hurst
parameter is likely to be (see table ii). this agrees nicely also
with the recent observation of bursts and heavy tails in human
dynamics [53].

3. discussion

by applying fractal analysis based on dfa and afa to cul-
turomic trajectories of 1-grams describing typical social and
natural phenomena over the past two centuries, we have found
that they obey different scaling laws. as we will discuss in
what follows, our    ndings agree nicely with existing theory
and expectations, as well as offer new interpretations as to
what might be the main driving forces behind the examined
phenomena.

we    nd that natural phenomena have properties that are
typical of processes that generate persistent long-range corre-
lations, as evidenced by the hurst parameter being in the range
0.55     h     0.85, with an average over all    fteen considered
1-grams equalling h = 0.69 (afa). the prevalence of long-
term memory in natural phenomena compels us to conjecture
that the long-range correlations in the usage frequency of the
corresponding terms is predominantly driven by occurrences
in nature of those phenomena. using data from    ve million
digitized books to arrive at this understanding certainly sup-
ports the declared goal of culturomics and lends strong sup-
port to its core principles. owing to this memory, and of
course by using statistical data available, we know, based on
the gutenberg-richter law [54], that in the united kingdom,
for example, an earthquake of 3.7     4.6 on the richter scale is
likely to happen every year, an earthquake of 4.7     5.5 is due
approximately every 10 years, while an earthquake of 5.6 or
larger is bound to happen every 100 years [55]. similar    sta-
tistical predictions    are available for tsunamis and many other,
if not all, natural phenomena. on a more personal level, this
also agrees with how we naturally develop an understanding
for the weather and related natural phenomena for the region
we live in.

social phenomena, on the other hand, have the hurst pa-
rameter in the range 0.74     h     1.33, with an average over
all    fteen considered 1-grams equalling h = 1.11 (afa).
this is indicative of nonstationary processes, or stationary
processes like on-off intermittency with power-law distributed
on and/or off periods or l  evy walks. while our analysis does
not allow distinction between these three options, it is clear
that all these processes are fundamentally different from those
describing natural phenomena. so while it is common to hear
speculations about possible average periods regarding social
phenomena     for instance, that there may be an average pe-
riod between major wars or stock market crashes     our anal-
ysis suggests this is not the case, and that social phenomena
tend to follow different scaling laws than natural phenomena.
such a difference is not unexpected, as social phenomena are,
by nature, more complex than natural phenomena; the former
depend on political, economic, and social forces, as well as on
natural phenomena. the results of this additional complexity
can be seen in our fractal analysis of a set of culturomic tra-
jectories.

in summary, we hope to have successfully demonstrated
that the data made available through the culturomics project
[15], when coupled with advanced methods of analysis, of-
fer fascinating opportunities to explore human culture in the
broadest possible sense.

appendix a. methods

a.1. nonlinear adaptive multiscale decomposition

nonlinear adaptive multiscale decomposition starts by par-
titioning a time series into segments of length w = 2n + 1,
where neighboring segments overlap by n + 1 points, thus
introducing a time scale of w+1
2    = (n + 1)  , where    is
the sampling time. each segment is then    tted with the best
polynomial of order m . note that m = 0 and 1 corre-
spond to piece-wise constant and linear    tting, respectively.
we denote the    tted polynomials for the i-th and (i + 1)-
th segments by y(i)(l1) and y(i+1)(l2), respectively, where
l1, l2 = 1,          , 2n + 1. we then de   ne the    tting for the over-
lapped region as

n (cid:1) and w2 = l   1

y(c)(l) = w1y(i)(l+n)+w2y(i+1)(l), l = 1,          , n+1, (1)
where w1 = (cid:0)1     l   1
n can be written as
(1     dj/n) for j = 1, 2, and where dj denotes the distances
between the point and the centers of y(i) and y(i+1), respec-
tively. this means that the weights decrease linearly with
the distance between the point and the center of the segment.
such a weighting ensures symmetry and effectively eliminates
any jumps or discontinuities around the boundaries of neigh-
boring segments. in fact, the scheme ensures that the    tting is
continuous everywhere, is smooth at the non-boundary points,
and has the right- and left-derivatives at the boundary. more-
over, since it can deal with an arbitrary trend without a priori
knowledge, it can remove nonstationarity, including baseline
drifts and motion artifacts [56], and the procedure may also be
used as either high-pass or low-pass    lter with superior noise-
removal properties than linear    lters, wavelet shrinkage, or
chaos-based noise reduction schemes [57].

a.2. fractal analysis

based on the described adaptive decomposition, a fractal
analysis can be conducted as follows. let {x1, x2,          , xn}
be a stationary stochastic process with mean x and autocorre-
lation function of type

r(k)     k2h   2 as k        ,

(2)

where h is the hurst parameter. this is often called an incre-
ment process, and its power spectral density is 1/f 2h   1. the
integral of the increment process:

u(i) =

i

xk=1

(xk     x), i = 1, 2,          , n,

(3)

on the other hand, is called a random walk process, and its
power spectral density is 1/f 2h+1. starting from an incre-
ment process, similarly to detrended    uctuation analysis [48],
we    rst construct a random walk process using equation (3).
if, however, the original data can already be classi   ed as a
random walk-like process, then this step is not necessary, al-
though for ideal fractal processes there is no penalty even if

fig. 5: scaling analysis of fractional gaussian noise processes of the
same length as the 1-gram data (240 points). blue (circles) and red
(diamonds) curves depict results as obtained by means of detrended
   uctuation analysis (dfa) and adaptive fractal analysis (afa), re-
spectively, for three different values of h. it can be observed that
both methods yield consistent results, regardless of the shortage of
the examined time series.

this step is done. next, for a window size w, we determine,
for the random walk process u(i) (or the original process
if it is already a random walk-like process), a global trend
v(i), i = 1, 2,          , n , where n is the length of the walk.
the residual, u(i)     v(i), characterizes    uctuations around
the global trend, and its variance yields the hurst parameter
h according to

f (w) = h 1

n

xi=1

(u(i)     v(i))2i1/2

    wh .

(4)

the validity of equation (4) can be proven if one starts from
an increment process with the hurst parameter equal to h.
using parseval   s theorem [9], the variance of the residual data
corresponding to a window size w may be equated to the total
power p in the frequency range (fw, fcutof f ) as

p     z fcutof f

fw

f 2h+1 df

2h(cid:16)w2h     f    2h

cutof f(cid:17),

(5)

where fw = 1/w, and fcutof f is the highest frequency of the
data. when fw     fcutof f , we see that equation (4) has to
be valid. in fact, the above treatment makes it clear that even
if we start from a random walk process with the hurst expo-
nent equal to h, integration will give the process a spectrum
of 1/f 2h+1+2 = 1/f 2(h+1)+1, and therefore, the    nal hurst
parameter will be simply h + 1. this in turn indicates that
there is indeed no penalty if one uses equation (3) when the
data are already a random walk-like process. note that the
proposed approach, if needed, can be readily extended and
applied successfully to multifractal as well as higher dimen-
sional data.

the described fractal analysis approach, which we will re-
fer to as adaptive fractal analysis (afa), in general yields re-
sults that are consistent with the traditionally used detrended

   uctuation analysis [48] (dfa), as can be concluded from re-
sults presented in    gure 5. nevertheless, especially for pro-
cesses having h > 1 [10], afa may yield better scaling,
which is why, although we analyze the culturomic trajecto-
ries with both methods, we rely on the results of afa for    -
nal interpretation. the potential advantage of adaptive fractal
analysis over detrended    uctuation analysis is due to the fact
that the trend for each window of size w obtained by afa is
smooth, while that obtained by dfa may change abruptly at
the boundary of neighboring segments. for short nonstation-
ary time series this may prove favorable for obtaining better

scaling in the f (w) versus w dependence.
