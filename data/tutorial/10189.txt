id95 model of opinion formation on social networks

we propose the id95 model of opinion formation and investigate its rich properties on real
directed networks of universities of cambridge and oxford, livejournal and twitter. in this model
the opinion formation of linked electors is weighted with their id95 id203. we    nd that
the society elite, corresponding to the top id95 nodes, can impose its opinion to a signi   cant
fraction of the society. however, for a homogeneous distribution of two opinions there exists a
bistability range of opinions which depends on a conformist parameter characterizing the opinion
formation. we    nd that livejournal and twitter networks have a stronger tendency to a totalitar
opinion formation. we also analyze the sznajd model generalized for scale-free networks with the
weighted id95 vote of electors.

i. introduction

to understand the nature and origins of mass opinion
formation is the outstanding challenge of democratic so-
cieties [1]. in a last few years an enormous development
of such social networks as livejournal [2], facebook [3],
twitter [4] and vkontakte [5], with up to hundreds
of millions of users, demonstrated the growing in   uence
of these networks on social and political life. the small-
world scale-free structure of the social networks (see e.g.
[6, 7]), combined with their rapid communication facil-
ities, leads to a very fast information propagation over
networks of electors, consumers, citizens making them
very active on instantaneous social events. this puts for-
ward a request for new theoretical models which would
allow to understand the opinion formation process in the
modern society of xxi century.

the important steps in the analysis of opinion for-
mation have been done with the development of var-
ious voter models described in a great detail
in [8],
[9],[10],[11],[12], [13],[14],[15]. this research    eld became
known as sociophysics [8],[10],[12]. in this work we in-
troduce several new aspects which take into account the
generic features of the social networks. at    rst, we an-
alyze the opinion formation on real directed networks
taken from the academic web link database of british
universities networks [16], livejournal database [17] and
twitter dataset [18]. this allows us to incorporate the
correct scale-free network structure instead of unrealistic
regular lattice networks, often considered in voter mod-
els [13, 14]. at second, we assume that the opinion at a
given node is formed by the opinions of its linked neigh-
bors weighted with the id95 id203 of these
network nodes. we think that this step represents the
reality of social networks: all of network nodes are char-
acterized by the id95 vector which gives a probabil-
ity to    nd a random surfer on a given node as described
in [19, 20]. this vector gives a steady-state probabil-
ity distribution on the network which provides a natural

ranking of node importance, or elector or society member
importance. in a certain sense the top nodes of pager-
ank correspond to a political elite of the social network
which opinion in   uences the opinions of other members
of the society [1]. thus the proposed id95 opinion
formation (prof) model takes into account the situ-
ation in which an opinion of an in   uential friend from
high ranks of the society counts more than an opinion
of a friend from lower society level. we argue that the
id95 id203 is the most natural form of ranking
of society members. indeed, the e   ciency of id95
rating is demonstrated for various types of scale-free net-
works including the world wide web (www) [19, 20],
physical review citation network [21, 22], scienti   c jour-
nal rating [23], ranking of tennis players [24], wikipedia
articles [25], the world trade network [26] and others.
due to the above argument we consider that the prof
model captures the reality of social networks and below
we present the analysis of its interesting properties.

in sec.

the paper is composed as follows: the prof model
is described in sec. ii, the numerical results on its prop-
erties are presented in sec.iii for british university net-
works.
iv we combine the prof model with
the sznajd model [13, 27] and study the properties of the
prof-sznajd model.
in sec.v we analyze the models
discussed in previous sections on an example of large so-
cial network of the livejournal [17]. the results for the
twitter dataset [18] are presented in sec.vi. the discus-
sion of the results is presented in sec.vii.

ii. id95 opinion formation (prof)

model description

the prof model is de   ned in the following way. in
agreement with the standard id95 algorithm [20]
we determine the id95 id203 pi for each node
i and arrange all n nodes in a monotonic decreasing or-
der of the id203.
in this way each node i has a
id203 p (ki) and the id95 index ki with the

maximal id203 is at ki = 1 (pn
i=1 p (ki) = 1). we
use the usual damping factor value    = 0.85 to compute
the id95 vector of the google matrix of the network
(see e.g. [19],[20],[28, 29]). in addition to that a network
node i is characterized by an ising spin variable   i which
can take values +1 or    1 coded also by red or blue color
respectively. the sign of a node i is determined by its di-
rect neighbors j which have the id95 probabilities
pj. for that we compute the sum   i over all directly
linked neighbors j of node i:

  i = a x

j,in + b x
p +

(1)

   a x

j

j,in     b x
p    

j

j

p    

j,out , a + b = 1 ,

where pj,in and pj,out denote the id95 id203
pj of a node j pointing to node i (incoming link) and a
node j to which node i points to (outgoing link) respec-
tively. here, the two parameters a and b are used to tune
the importance of incoming and outgoing links with the
imposed relation a + b = 1 (0     a, b     1). the values p +
and p     correspond to red and blue nodes respectively.
the value of spin   i takes the value 1 or    1 respectively
for   i > 0 or   i < 0. in a certain sense we can say that
a large value of parameter b corresponds to a conformist
society where an elector i takes an opinion of other elec-
tors to which he points to (nodes with many incoming
links are in average at the top positions of id95).
on the opposite side a large value of a corresponds to
a tenacious society where an elector i takes mainly an
opinion of those electors who point to him.

fraction of red nodes f (t) as a function of number of iterations
t. the red and black curves (top and bottom curves at t = 15
respectively) show evolution for two di   erent realizations of
random distribution of color with the same initial fraction
fi = 0.5 at t = 0. the green curve (middle curve at t = 15)
shows dependence f (t) for the initial state with ntop all red
nodes with top id95 k indexes (highest p (ki) values,
1     k     ntop). the evolution is done at a = b = 0.5 and
temperature t = 0. left panel : cambridge network with
ntop = 2000. right panel : oxford network with ntop = 1000.

the condition (1) on spin inversion can be written via
the e   ective ising hamiltonian h of the whole system of

interacting spins:

h =     x

where the spin-spin interaction jij determines the local
magnetic    eld bi on a given node i

bi = x

(apj,in + bpj,out)  j ,

j

which gives the local spin energy   i =    bi  i. accord-
ing to (2), (3) the interaction between a selected spin i
and its neighbors j is given by the id95 id203:
jij = apj,in + bpj,out. thus from a physical view point
the whole system can be viewed as a disordered ferromag-
net [12, 14]. in this way the condition (1) corresponds to
a local energy   i minimization done at zero temperature.
we note that such an analogy with spin systems is well
known for opinion formation models on regular lattices
[12],[13],[14]. however, it should be noted that generally
we have asymmetric couplings jij 6= jji that is unusual
for physical problems (see discussion in [30]). in view of
this analogy it is possible to introduce a    nite tempera-
ture t and then to make a probabilistic metropolis type
condition [31] for the spin i inversion determined by a
thermal id203   i = exp(        i/t ), where      i is the
energy di   erence between on-site energies   i with spin
up and down. during the relaxation process each spin is
tested on inversion condition that requires n steps and
then we do t iterations of such n steps. we discuss the
results of the relaxation process at zero and    nite tem-
peratures t in next section.

iii. numerical results for prof model

on university networks

here we present results for prof model considered on
the networks of cambridge and oxford universities in
year 2006, taken from [16]. the properties of id95
distribution p (k) for these networks have been analyzed
in [28, 29]. the total number of nodes n and links n    are:
n = 212710, n    = 2015265 (cambridge); n = 200823,
n    = 1831542 (oxford) [29]. both networks are char-
acterized by an algebraic decay of id95 id203
p (k)     1/k    and approximately usual exponent value
       0.9, additional results on the scale-free properties
of these networks are given in [28, 29]. we discuss usu-
ally the fraction of red nodes since by de   nition all other
nodes are blue.

the typical examples of time evolution of fraction of
red nodes f (t) with the number of time iterations t are
shown in fig. 1. we see the presence of bistability in
the opinion formation: two random states with the same
initial fraction of red nodes fi = f (t = 0) evolve to two
di   erent    nal fractions of red nodes ff . the process gives

ank id203 p (k) and that the correlations between
cheirank and id95 are not very strong (see discus-
sion in [25, 29]).

fig. 2:
(color online) time evolution of opinion colors
(red/gray and blue/black) for the parameters of fig. 1:
left/right column is for cambridge/oxford network. the ini-
tial fraction of red colors is fi = 0.5 (top panel) and ntop
nodes have red color for bottom panels with ntop = 2000 and
1000 for cambridge and oxford network respectively. nodes
are ordered by the id95 index k and color plot shows
only k     20000.

an impression of convergence to a    xed state approxi-
mately after tc     10 iterations. a special check shows
that all node colors become    xed after this time tc. the
convergence time to a    xed state is similar to those found
for opinion formation on regular lattices where tc = o(1)
[13, 14, 32]. the corresponding time evolution of colors
is shown in fig. 2 for    rst 10% of nodes ordered by the
id95 index k.

the results of fig. 1 show that for a random initial
distribution of colors we may have di   erent    nal states
with   0.2 variation compared to the initial fi = 0.5.
however, if we consider that ntop nodes with the top k
index values (from 1 to ntop) have the same opinion (e.g.
red nodes) then we    nd that even a small fraction of the
total number of nodes n (e.g. ntop of about 0.5% or 1%
of n ) can impose its opinion for a signi   cant fraction of
nodes of about ff     0.4. this shows that in the frame
of prof model the society elite, corresponding to top
k nodes, can signi   cantly in   uence the opinion of the
whole society under the condition that the elite members
have the    xed opinion between themselves.

we also considered the case when the red nodes are
placed on ntop = 2000 top nodes of cheirank index k    .
this ranking is characterized by the cheirank probabil-
ity p    (k    ) for a random surfer moving in the inverted
direction of links as described in [25, 29].
in average
p    (k    ) is proportional to the number of outgoing links.
however, in this case the top nodes with a small fi val-
ues are not able to impose their opinion and the    nal
fraction becomes blue. we attribute this to the fact that
the opinion condition (1) is determined by the pager-

fig. 3: (color online) density plot of id203 wf to    nd
a    nal red fraction ff , shown in y   axis, in dependence on
an initial red fraction fi, shown in x    axis; data are shown
inside the unit square 0     fi, ff     1. the values of wf are
de   ned as a relative number of realizations found inside each
of 20   20 cells which cover the whole unit square. here nr =
104 realizations of randomly distributed colors are used to
obtained wf values; for each realization the time evolution is
followed up the convergence time with up to t = 20 iterations;
here t = 0. left column: cambridge network; right column:
oxford network; here a = 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 from top to bottom.
the id203 wf is proportional to color changing from
zero (blue/black) to unity (red/gray).

to analyze how the    nal fraction of red nodes ff de-
pends on its initial fraction fi we study the time evolution
f (t) for a large number nr of initial random realizations
of colors following it up to the convergent time for each
realization. we    nd that the    nal red nodes are homoge-
neously distributed in k. thus there is no speci   c pref-
erence for top society levels for an initial random distri-
bution. the id203 distribution wf of    nal fractions
ff is shown in fig. 3 as a function of initial fraction fi at

three values of parameter a. these results show two main
features of the model: a small fraction of red opinion is
completely suppressed if fi < fc and its larger fraction
dominates completely for fi > 1     fc; there is a bistabil-
ity phase for the initial opinion range fb     fi     1     fb.
of course, there is a symmetry in respect to exchange
of red and blue colors. for small value a = 0.1 we have
fb     fc with fc     0.25 while for large value a = 0.9 we
have fc     35, fb     0.45.

id95 index (1     k     ntop); black and red(gray) curves
show data for cambridge and oxford networks; here t = 0.

our interpretation of these results is the following. for
small values of a     0 the opinion of a given society mem-
ber is determined mainly by the id95 of neighbors
to whom he points to (outgoing links). the id95
id203 p of nodes, on which many nodes point to, is
usually high since p is proportional to the number of in-
going links [20]. thus, at a     0 a society is composed of
members who form their opinion listening an elite opin-
ion.
in such a society its elite with one color opinion
can impose this opinion to a large fraction of the society.
this is illustrated on fig. 4 which shows a dependence of
   nal fraction of red ff nodes on parameter a for a small
initial fraction of red nodes in the top values of id95
index (ntop = 2000). we see that a = 0 corresponds to
a conformist society which follows in its great majority
the opinion of its elite. for a = 1 this fraction ff drops
signi   cantly showing that this corresponds to a regime
of tenacious society. it is somewhat surprising that the
tenacious society (a     1) has well de   ned and relatively
large    xed opinion phase with a relatively small region of
bistability phase. this is in a contrast to the conformist
society at a     0 when the opinion is strongly in   uenced
by the society elite. we attribute this to the fact that
in fig. 3 we start with a randomly distributed opinion,
due to that the opinion of elite has two fractions of two

fig. 5:
(color online) same as in fig. 3 (middle panels)
at a = 0.5 but with uniform condition for spin    ip being
independent of id95 id203 (top panels: p = 1
in eq. (1)) and id95 id203 p replaced by    p in
eq.(1) (bottom panels); left and right panels correspond to
cambridge and oxford networks; here t = 0 and nr = 104
realizations are used.

colors that create a bistable situation since two fractions
of society follows opinion of this divided elite that makes
the situation bistable on a larger interval of fi compared
to the case of tenacious society at a     1.
to stress the important role of id95 in the depen-
dence of ff on fi presented in fig. 3 we show in fig. 5
the same analysis at a = 0.5 but for the case when in
eq.(1) for the spin    ip we take all p = 1 (equal weight
for all nodes). the data of fig. 5 clearly demonstrate
that in this case the bistability of opinion disappears.
thus the prof model is qualitatively di   erent from the
case when only the links without their id95 weight
are counted for the spin    ip condition. we also test the
sensitivity in respect to id95 id203 replacing
p by    p in eq.(1) as it is shown in fig. 5 (bottom pan-
els). we see that compared to the case p = 1 we start to
have some signs of bistability but still they remain rather
weak compared to the case of fig. 3.

in fact the spin    ip condition (1) can be viewed as a
relaxation process in a disordered ferromagnet (since all
jij     0 in (2), (3)) at zero temperature. such type of
analysis of voter model relaxation process on regular lat-
tices is analyzed in [13, 14]. from this view point it is nat-
ural to consider the e   ect of    nite temperature t on this
relaxation. at    nite t the    ip condition is determined
by the thermal metropolis id203 exp(        i/t ) as
described in previous section. we follow this thermo-

5

however, the relaxation process at    nite temperatures
does not lead to the thermal boltzmann distribution. in-
deed, in fig. 7 we show the id203 distribution wi(  i)
as a function of local energies   i de   ned in (2), (3). the
distribution wi(  i) is obtained from the relaxation pro-
cess with many initial random spin realizations nr. even
if the temperature t is comparable with typical values of
local energies   i we still obtain a rather peaked distribu-
tion at   i     0 being very di   erent from the boltzmann
distribution.

fig. 6: (color online) same as in fig. 3 (middle panel) at a =
0.5 but at    nite temperature t during the relaxation process
with t = 0.001 (top panels) and t = 0.01 (bottom panels);
the number of random initial realizations is nr = 6000, the
relaxation is done during t = 200 iterations. left and right
columns correspond to cambridge and oxford networks.

dynamic relaxation process at    nite temperature up to
t = 200 iterations and in this way obtain the probabil-
ity distribution of    nal ff fraction of red nodes obtained
from initial fi fraction of red nodes randomly distributed
over the network at t = 0. the results obtained at    nite
temperatures are shown at fig. 6. they show that a    -
nite temperature t allows to have a    nite fraction of red
nodes ff when for their small initial fraction fi all    nal
ff were equal to zero. also the bistability splitting is re-
duced and it disappears at larger values of t . thus    nite
t introduce a certain smoothing in wf distribution.

distribution wi over local energies   i obtained from the relax-
ation process during t = 103 time iterations at temperatures

age is done over nr = 200 random initial realizations. the
insets show the distributions on a large scale including all lo-
cal energies   i. left and right panels show cambridge and
oxford networks.

fig. 8: (color online) diagram shows the    nal fraction of
red nodes ff , coded by color from ff = 0 (black) to ff = 1
(blue/dark gray), as a function of initial fraction of red nodes
fi and the total initial energy ei; each of nr > 3.5    104
random realizations is shown by color point; data are shown
after t = 20 time iterations at t = 0. the energy e0 is the
modulus of total energy with all spin up; here a = 0.5. left
and right panels show data for cambridge (e0 = 341.20) and
oxford (e0 = 254.28) networks; bars show color attribution
to    nal id203 ff .

we argue that a physical reason of signi   cantly non-
boltzmann distribution is related to the local nature of
spin    ip condition which does not allow to produce a good
thermalization on a scale of the whole system. indeed,
there are various energetic branches and probably non-
local thermalization    ips of group of spins are required
for a better thermalization. however, the voting is a lo-
cal process that involves only direct neighbors that seems
to be not su   cient for emergence of the global thermal
distribution. the presence of a few energy branches is
well visible from the data of fig. 8 obtained at t = 0.
this    gure shows the diagram of    nal fraction ff of red
nodes in dependence on their initial fraction fi and the
total initial energy ei = pn
m=1   m of the whole system
corresponding to a chosen initial random con   guration
of spins. most probably, these di   erent branches prevent
e   cient thermalization of the system with only local spin
   ip procedure. in addition to the above points the asym-
metric form of jij couplings plays an important role gen-
erating more complicated picture compared to the usual
image of thermal relaxation (see e.g. [30]). we also note
that the thermalization is absent in voter models on reg-
ular lattices [13].

iv. prof-sznajd model

the sznajd model [27] nicely incorporates the well-
known trade union principle    united we stand, divided
we fall    into the    eld of voter modeling and opinion for-
mation on regular networks. the review of various as-
pects of this model is given in [13]. here we generalize
the sznajd model to include in it the features of prof
model and consider it on social networks with their scale-
free structure. this gives us the prof-sznajd model
which is constructed in the following way. for a given
network we determine the id95 id203 p (ki)
and id95 index ki for all i nodes. after that we
introduce the de   nition of group of nodes. it is de   ned
by the following rule applied at each time step    :

    i) pick by random a node i in the network and con-
sider the polarization of the ng     1 highest pager-
ank nodes pointing to it;

j=1 pj;

    ii) if the node i and all other ng     1 nodes have
the same color (same spin polarization), then these
ng nodes form a group whose e   ective id95
value is the sum of all the member values pg =
png
if it is not the case then we leave the
nodes unchanged and perform the next time step;
    iii) consider all the nodes pointing to any member of
the group (this corresponds to the model option 1 )
or consider all the nodes pointing to any member of
the group and all the nodes pointed by any member
of the group (this corresponds to the model option
2 ); then check all these nodes n directly linked to
the group: if an individual node id95 value pn
is less than pgroup then this node joins the group by
taking the same color (polarization) as the group
nodes; if it is not the case then a node is left un-
changed; the id95 values of added nodes are
then added to the group id95 pgroup and the
group size is increased.

the above time step is repeated many times during time
   , counting the number of steps, by choosing a random
node i on each next step. this procedure e   ectively
corresponds to the zero temperature case in the prof
model.

a typical example of the time evolution of the fraction
of red nodes f (   ) in the prof-sznajd model is shown in
fig. 9. it shows that the system converges to a steady-
state after a time scale   c     10n that is comparable
with the convergence times for the prof models stud-
ied in previous sections. we see that there are still some
   uctuations in the steady-state regime which are visibly
smaller for the option 2 case. we attribute this to a
larger number of direct links in this case. the number
of group nodes ng gives some variation of ff but these
variations remain on a relatively small scale of a few per-
cents. here, we should point on the important di   erence

nodes f (   ) in the prof-sznajd model with the initial frac-

(blue/black); 8 (green/light gray); 13 (red/gray). full/dashed
curves are for cambridge/oxford networks; left panel is for
option 1; right panel is for option 2.

between prof and prof-sznajd models:
for a given
initial color realization, in the    rst case we have conver-
gence to a    xed state after some convergence time while
in the second case we have convergence to a steady-state
which continue to    uctuate in time, keeping the colors
distribution only on average.

the dependence of the    nal fraction of red nodes ff on
its initial value fi is shown by the density plot of prob-
ability wf in fig. 10 (option 1 of prof-sznajd model).
the id203 wf is obtained from many initial ran-
dom realizations in a similar way to the case of fig. 3.
we see that there is a signi   cant di   erence compared to
the prof model (fig. 3): now even at small values of fi
we    nd small but    nite values of ff while in the prof
model the red color disappears at fi < fc. this fea-
ture is related to the essence of the sznajd model: here
even small groups can resist against totalitar opinion.
other features of fig. 10 are similar to those found for
the prof model: we again observe bistability of opin-
ion formation. the number of nodes ng, which form the
group, does not a   ect signi   cantly the distribution wf ,
we have smaller    uctuations at larger ng values but the
model works in a stable way already at ng = 3. the re-
sults for the option 2 of prof-sznajd model are shown
in fig. 11. in this case the opinions with a small initial
fraction of red nodes fi are suppressed in a signi   cantly
stronger way compared to the option 1. we attribute this
to the fact that large groups can suppress in a stronger
way small groups since the outgoing direct links are taken
into account in this option.

the signi   cant di   erence between the two options of
prof-sznajd model is well seen from the data of fig. 12.
here, all ntop nodes are taken in red (compare with the
prof model in fig. 4). for the option 1 the society elite
succeeds to impose its opinion to a signi   cant fraction
of nodes which is increased by a factor 5-10. visibly,
this increase is less signi   cant than in the prof model.
however, for the option 2 of prof-sznajd model there is
practically no increase of the fraction of red nodes. thus,

in the option 2 the society members are very independent
and the in   uence of the elite on their opinion is very
weak.

the frame of real social network. for that we use the
livejournal network collected, described and presented
at [17]. from this database we obtain the directed net-
work with n = 3577166 nodes, n    = 44913072 links
which are mainly directed (only about 30% of links are
symmetric). the google matrix of the network is con-
structed in a usual way [20] and its id95 vector is
determined by the iteration process at the damping fac-
tor    = 0.85. for the time evolution of fraction of red
nodes f we use time iterations in t and    de   ned as in
previous sections.

the id95 id203 decay p (k) is shown in
fig. 13. it is well described by an algebraic law p (k)    
1/k    with    = 0.448    0.000046. the convergence of a
fraction of red nodes f (t) takes place approximately on
the same convergence time scale tc     5     o(1) even if
the size of the networks is increased almost by a factor
20.

even if one can expect that the properties of university
networks are similar to those of the real social networks
it is important to analyze the previous prof models in

in a way similar to the university networks we    nd that
the homogeneous opinion of society elite presented in a
small fraction of ntop nodes in   uences a large fraction

tial fi = 0.4 while for the quadratic weight we obtain a
rather broad distribution of ff values in the main range
0 < ff < 0.15 with a few large values ff     0.6. thus we
see that the    nal opinion is rather sensitive to the weight
used in eq.(1). however, in contrast to the university
networks (see fig. 3,fig. 5), where we have narrow one
peak or double peak distributions of ff , for the livejour-
nal network with quadratic weight we    nd a rather broad
distribution of ff . in the spirit of a reid172 map
description considered in [10] (see figs.1,2 there), it is
possible to assume that one or two peaks corresponds to
one or two    xed points attractor of the map. we make a
conjecture that a broad distribution as in fig. 15 (right
panel) can correspond to a regime of strange chaotic at-
tractor appearing in the reid172 map dynamics.
in principle, such a chaotic reid172 dynamics is
known to appear in coupled spins lattices when three-
spin couplings are present (see [33] and refs. therein). it
is possible that a presence of weight id203 associ-
ated with the id95 in a certain power may lead to
a chaotic dynamics which would generate a broad distri-
bution of    nal opinions ff .

we also made tests for the prof-sznajd model (op-
tion 1) for the livejournal database. however, in this
case at fi = 0.4, a = 0.5 we found only small ff values
(similar of those in fig. 15, left panel) both for linear
and quadratic weights in eq.(1). it is possible that the
sznajd groups are less sensitive to the id203 weight.

of the whole society especially when the parameter a is
not very large (see fig. 14 in comparison with fig. 4).
the in   uence of the elite at 1% of red nodes is larger in
the case of livejournal network. it is possible that this
is related to a 30% larger number of links but it is also
possible that other structural network parameters also
play a role here.

in spite of certain similarities with the previous data
for university networks discussed before we    nd that
the opinion diagram for the livejournal network (see
fig. 14 right panel) is very di   erent from those obtained
for the university networks (see fig. 3): the bistability
practically disappeared. we think that this di   erence
originates from a signi   cantly slower decay exponent for
id95 p (k) in the case of livejournal. to check
this assumption we compare the id203 distribution
wf of    nal opinion ff for an initial opinion    xed at
fi = 0.4 using the prof model with the usual linear
weight p in eq.(1) and a quadratic weight proportional
to p 2 (see fig. 15). for the linear weight we    nd that
only very small values of ff     0.005 can be found for ini-

line y = b       x (for 1     log10 k     5.5) with the exponent
   = 0.511    0.0021 and b =    3.33    0.0069 (for the range
5.5     log10 k     7 we    nd    = 1.23). right panel: depen-
dence of the    nal fraction of red nodes ff on the tenacious
parameter a (or conformist parameter b = 1    a) in the prof

line at ff = 0); 1250 (red curve with circles), 1300 (top gree
line); t = 0.

the dependence of id95 p on its index k is
shown in fig. 16 (left panel). for the range 1     log10 k    
5.5 we    nd the decay exponent        0.51, being similar to
those of livejournal network (see fig. 13) even if there
is a faster drop of p at larger k values. we note that the
value        0.5 is rather di   erent from the value usually
found for the zipf law [34] and the www [20] with        1.
it is possible that this is related to a signi   cantly larger
average number of links per node which is increased by a
factor 3.5 for the twitter network compared to the uni-
versity networks analyzed in the previous sections.

the e   ect of the homogeneous elite opinion of all red
ntop nodes is shown in fig. 16 (right panel). we see that

9

on the twitter network a small fraction of elite with the
   xed opinion (ntop/n     3    10   5) can impose it prac-
tically to the whole community for all values of the con-
formist parameter 1    a. we    nd that for ntop > 1300 all
ff values are very close to unity, while for ntop < 1200 we
   nd ff = 0 as it is seen in fig. 16, right panel. thus, the
transition is very sharp. we attribute such a strong in-
   uence of elite opinion to the very connected structure of
twitter network with a signi   cantly larger average num-
ber of links per node comparing to the university and
livejournal networks.

at a = 0.5,

for a    xed fraction of initial opinion
fi = 0.4, we    nd that the id203 distribution wf
of    nal opinion ff is located in the range of small values
0.0006 < wf < 0.0007 both for linear p and quadratic
p 2 weight used in eq.(1) (we do not show these data).
for the linear weight the situation is rather similar to the
case of livejournal (see fig. 15), but for the quadratic
weight we    nd a signi   cant di   erence between two net-
works (see fig. 15). the reason of such a signi   cant
di   erence for the quadratic weight case requires a more
detailed comparison of network properties.

the large size of twitter network makes numerical sim-
ulations of the prof-sznajd model rather heavy and due
to that we did not study this model for this network.

vii. discussion

in this work we proposed the id95 model of opin-
ion formation of social networks and analyzed its prop-
erties on example of four di   erent networks. for two
university networks we    nd rather similar properties of
opinion formation. it is characterized by the important
feature according to which the society elite with a    xed
opinion can impose it to a signi   cant fraction of the so-
ciety members which is much larger than the initial elite
fraction. however, when the initial opinions of society
members, including the elite, are presented by two op-
tions then we    nd a signi   cant range of opinion fraction
within a bistability regime. this range depends on the
conformist parameter which characterizes the local as-
pects of opinion formation of linked society members.
the generalization of the sznajd model for the scale-free
social networks gives interesting examples of opinion for-
mation where    nite small size groups can keep their own
opinion being di   erent from the main opinion of the ma-
jority.
in this way the proposed prof-sznajd model
shows that the totalitar opinions can be escaped by small
sub-communities. we    nd that the properties of opinion
formation are rather similar for the two university net-
works of cambridge and oxford. however, the results
obtained for networks of livejournal and twitter show
that the range of bistability practically disappears for
these networks. our data indicate that this is related to
a slower algebraic decay of id95 in these cases com-

pared to the university networks. however, the deep rea-
sons of such a di   erence require a more detailed analysis.
indeed, livejournal and twitter networks demonstrate
rather di   erent behavior for the p 2-weighted function of
opinion formation. the studies performed for regular
networks [10] show existence of stable or bistable    xed
points for opinion formation models that have certain
similarities with the opinion formation properties found
in our studies. at the same time the results obtained
in [33] show that three-body spin coupling can generate
a chaotic reid172 dynamics. some our results
(fig. 15, right panel) give indications on a possible exis-
tence of such chaotic phase on the social networks.

the enormous development of social networks in a few
last years [2   5] de   nitely shows that the analysis of opin-
ion formation on such networks requires further investi-
gations. this research can    nd also various other appli-
cations. one of them can be a neuronal network of brain
which represents itself a directed scale-free network [35].
the applications of network science to brain networks is
now under a rapid development (see e.g.
[36]) and the
google matrix methods can    nd useful applications in
this    eld [37].
