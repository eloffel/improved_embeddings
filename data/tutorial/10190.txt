abstract
it is arguable whether history is made by great men and
women or vice versa, but undoubtably social connections
shape history. analysing wikipedia, a global collective
memory place, we aim to understand how social links are
recorded across cultures. starting with the set of biogra-
phies in the english wikipedia we focus on the networks of
links between these biographical articles on the 15 largest
language wikipedias. we detect the most central charac-
ters in these networks and point out culture-related pecu-
liarities. furthermore, we reveal remarkable similarities be-
tween distinct groups of language wikipedias and highlight
the shared knowledge about connections between persons
across cultures.

introduction

social network analysis, one of the most studied subjects
in the last decade, has been applied in very di   erent contexts
ranging from online social networks [11], over networks of
   ctitious comic characters [1] to animal social networks [5].
here we present a study about connections of a di   erent
form. we use neither self-reported nor observed relations
nor interactions inferred from activity logs. we focus on the
links between notable humans as they are recorded in col-
lective memory. to extract these connections and build the
corresponding networks we use di   erent language versions of
wikipedia, which can be seen as global memory place [12].
we exploit direct links between biographic articles as ev-
idence of relations between the corresponding persons, and

.

build biographical social networks for the 15 largest language
versions of wikipedia. we investigate these networks sepa-
rately and analyse their similarity. we furthermore extract
the most important persons according to several centrality
metrics in these networks. this allows us to analyse and
compare the di   erent language communities over their per-
ception and reporting of connections between notable per-
sons. the visualisation of the shared links present in most
of the di   erent language networks highlights the connections
commonly known across language and culture barriers.

2. related work

social networks analysis on wikipedia has mainly
exploited editor interactions, either via generating co-
authorship networks [8] or analysing social interactions on
article and user talk-pages [9]. additionally, co-authorship
has been used to create networks of similar articles [4].

the link structure of wikipedia articles has been studied
extensively: common features have been found in the net-
work topology of several language versions of wikipedia [14],
and rankings of the most central entries in the english wi-
kipedia have been presented [3]. the idea of restricting the
network to articles representing entities of a given type has
been followed in [2], introducing a framework for visualising
links between philosophers in the english wikipedia.

di   erent language versions of wikipedia have been com-
pared to study cultural di   erences among their communi-
ties [13]. while this has been done mostly by analysing the
behaviour of the editors, here we propose to study di   erences
and similarities as they emerge from the link structure of the
artifacts created by di   erent communities.

3. data extraction

to obtain a list of articles about persons on the english
wikipedia, we relied on a dataset from dbpedia1. the
dataset contains links to 296 511 existing english articles,
which we parsed to identify the names of the corresponding
articles in the other 14 language versions of wikipedia with
the largest number of articles at the moment we extracted
the data (september 8 to 13, 2011).

for each language version we generated a directed network
where nodes represent persons with a biographical wikipe-
dia article and a node i links to node j if the article of the
person i is linking to the article about person j.

as many wikipedia articles have alternative names which
redirect to the same article, we had to track these redirects

finally, we also analyse the in- and out-degree distribu-
tions and observe heavy-tails, as found in many real-life net-
works, for all language wikipedias (data not shown).
4.2 most central persons

in this section we focus on centrality metrics for the above
in table 2 we present the
de   ned biographical networks.
top-ranked persons according to the degree centrality for
the english wikipedia. we also provide results for other
centrality measures together with the corresponding rank-
ings. betweenness measures the fraction of shortest paths
between other pairs of nodes passing through a given node,
while id95 gives a measure of the global importance
of nodes, computed recursively putting a larger weight on
incoming connections from central nodes.

figure 1: distribution of the number of redirects
per biographical article for the english wikipedia.

for every person and every language with a script provided
by the wikimedia toolserver.2 the number of redirects per
page follows a heavy tailed distribution as can be observed
in figure 1. the table embedded in the    gure lists the 13
persons with the largest number of redirects in the english
wikipedia. the article about muammar al-gadda    leads
the ranking with 251 di   erent ways of linking towards it,
more than doubling the redirects of osama bin laden, the
second ranked person.

4. results

in this section we study global metrics calculated for the
biographical networks of di   erent languages. we also dis-
cuss rankings based on various de   nitions of centrality. in
particular, we present the most central (linked) persons in
the di   erent language wikipedia. finally, we compare the
similarities between the di   erent language networks.
4.1 global network statistics

a brief overview of the principal social network measures
for the di   erent language networks is given in table 1. the
largest network corresponds to the english wikipedia with
nearly 200, 000 nodes. the second largest, extracted from
the german wikipedia, is only about one-third as large.

all language networks show very low id91. the only
outstanding network is the chinese with a id91 coe   -
cient of 0.17, which indicates an important structural di   er-
ence of the link structure in this language version.

by looking at the link reciprocities we    nd that it is quite
rare that two persons are mutually connected. one of the
possible causes of this observation may be the presence of
parasocial interactions [6], i.e. one-sided interpersonal rela-
tionships in which one part knows a great deal about the
other, but the other does not. e.g., when a person is in   u-
enced by the works of somebody who died decades before.

we see that all networks are well connected, as the per-
centage of nodes in the giant component (gc)3 lies between
85% (polish) and 96% (french and japanese).

when calculating the average path length between two
persons in the gc we observe that the largest average dis-
tances are found for the polish and russian networks.

http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/sources/rdcheck.py
3the gc corresponds here to the largest weakly connected
component. weakly connected means that there exists at
least a path in one direction between any pair of nodes.

we    nd many american presidents, iconic american musi-
cians, and european leaders during the ww2 period among
the most linked. interestingly, we observe that pope john
paul ii appears to be a more central    gure than jesus.

comparing the number of incoming and outgoing links, we
observe that in-degrees are of an order of magnitude greater
than out-degrees. we explain this phenomenon again by the
presence of the parasocial relations. for betweenness and
id95 we do not    nd large di   erences in the rankings.
the only exception is shakespeare, whose low betweenness
value can be caused by the low number of out-going links.
interestingly, shakespeare   s page is one of the most central
for several languages (see table 3), but not for english.

in table 3 we show the most central characters in wikipe-
dia for the 15 analysed languages ranked by the betweenness
centrality. we observe that most of the presented persons
are known to be (or have been) highly in   uential in many
aspects. thus, in these lists we    nd political leaders, revo-
lutionaries, famous musicians, writers and actors. we note
that political    gures such as adolf hitler, george w. bush
or barack obama dominate in almost all top rankings. in-
terestingly, william shakespeare and michael jackson are
also among the central    gures for several languages.

for many languages we    nd, however, that the top ranked
persons re   ect country speci   c issues. thus, for example,
pope john paul ii is only present in the top    ve list of the
italian and polish wikipedia, two countries which have a
special tie with this    gure.
in the english wikipedia the
most central    gures are former us presidents, while the
spanish-speaking wikipedia community marks out latin
american revolutionaries. the russian version surprisingly
highlights william shakespeare and also kenneth branagh,
known for several    lm adaptations of shakespeare   s plays.
only the japanese wikipedia rankes the author mishima
prominently, while two chinese leaders, chiang kai-shek
and deng xiaopin, are in the top-5 in the chinese version.
when looking at these results, it should be taken into ac-
count that there is an anglo-saxon bias in the dataset, as
we relied on a list of notable persons extracted from the en-
glish wikipedia, and persons from other cultures not know
internationally might be missing. in that sense the above
list re   ects centrality among persons with at least limited
international notoriety.

4.3 similarity between languages

in this section we focus on similarities between the net-
works emerging from the di   erent language wikipedias. we

figure 2: languages similarity network: every lan-
guage links to the two languages with the largest
similarities according to table 4.

calculate the similarity for every pair of networks as their
jaccard coe   cient, i.e.
the ratio between the number of
links present in both networks (their intersection) and the
number of links existing in their union. table 4 shows the
obtained similarity results. for every language row we high-
light the two languages with the largest similarities. the
most similar language is also underlined.

figure 2 further illustrates these similarities by drawing a
language similarity network. in this network a language a
is connected to another language b if language b is one of
the two most similar to a. applying the louvain method,
we divide this graph into three clusters.
in agreement
with [10], we observe that most of the links can be explained
by language-family relations (e.g romance and slavic lan-
guages) and geographic or historical ties (e.g. scandinavian
group, or russia and finland). we also    nd a number of less
obvious connections, e.g. japanese to spanish and finnish

connections which can be found in most of the analysed lan-
guage wikipedias. knowledge about these social connec-
tions trespasses cultural barriers and represents part of the
shared global collective memory of our civilisation.

possible directions for future work include the applica-
tion of the methodology to generate subnetworks of other
kinds of article categories, and a speci   c study of links
present in most networks but missing only in a few language
wikipedias.

finally, the gender gap among wikipedia editors is a se-
rious concern for the community, and has been related to
the topics covered in the encyclopedia [7]. our results point
out a very small presence of females also among the most
central persons in the encyclopedic content, suggesting the
link between these two phenomena as an intriguing subject
for future investigation.

4.4 links present in most language networks
finally, figure 3 depicts the network of connections which
are present in at least 13 of the 15 language wikipedias4.
the network is relatively small, containing 1663 nodes and
1738 links, but allows to visualise the quintessence of knowl-
edge about biographical connections present in most of the
analysed language communities.

the largest connected component in figure 3 corresponds
to a cluster of us presidents which connects over ronald
reagan to a cluster of british premier ministers. this group
is related through winston churchill to a cluster of persons
from ww2   s axis powers. the second largest component
is compound of several clusters related to the music and
entertainment business, and the third one of two clusters of
male and female tennis players connected through dinara
and marat sa   n. other large isolated clusters can be found
around such diverse groups as russian and chinese political
   gures, french presidents, israeli and palestinian politicians,
formula one pilots, world chess champions or actresses.

5. conclusions

our results show that biographical connections are record-
ed di   erently in the distinct language versions of wikipedia.
although the global social network measures are largely sim-
ilar for all these networks, the most central persons unveil
interesting peculiarities about the language communities. a
study of similarity reveals that networks are more similar
for geographically or linguistically closer communities. nev-
ertheless, there also exists a great number of biographical
