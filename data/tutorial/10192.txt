abstract
wikipedia articles are by de   nition never    nished: at any
moment their content can be edited, or discussed in the as-
sociated talk pages. in this study we analyse the evolution
of these discussions to unveil patterns of collective participa-
tion along the temporal dimension, and to shed light on the
process of content creation on di   erent topics. at a micro-
scale, we investigate peaks in the discussion activity and we
observe a non-trivial relationship with edit activity. at a
larger scale, we introduce a measure to account for how fast
discussions grow in complexity, and we    nd speeds that span
three orders of magnitude for di   erent articles. our analysis
should help the community in tasks such as early detection
of controversies and assessment of discussion maturity.

introduction

everyday thousands of people from all over the world edit
the articles of wikipedia, and millions access their content
to get information and form opinions about the most various
kinds of topics. while one of the weaknesses of traditional
encyclopedias is the lack of up-to-date information, due to
the time required by the publishing process, wikipedia tends
to cover also very recent events and fresh information, as it
can be updated in real time. this is one of its most essential
characteristics, as suggested by the very same word wiki,
which in hawaiian means quick.

yet, not all articles evolve with the same speed and whether
in some cases quick may be too fast is object of discussion
among the editors of wikipedia. an essay invites users to

.

consider whether an addition will still appear relevant in ten
years1 to avoid recentism, i.e. editing an article without a
long-term, historical view. nevertheless, although another
sibling project has been created expressly for in-depth cover-
age of news2, also for recent and current events most editors
seem to prefer wikipedia articles, as unique collective arti-
facts in constant evolution.

if one would like to study the speed with which an arti-
cle changes, the    rst natural choice would be to study the
number of edits per time unit. however, the larger an article
becomes, more and more of its generative process takes place
in talk pages, parallel spaces to every article, where editors
are engaged in discussions with the objective of reaching con-
sensus on the article content. these discussions can be seen
as a magmatic    ow of arguments and counter-arguments,
which are progressively transformed into the encyclopedic
content. looking at the associated discussion is often the
most e   ective way to understand the process which brought
to the current state of an article, showing traces of the ex-
plicit coordination among editors in the form of suggestions,
disputes, complains, invocation of community policies, polls
and pursuit of consensus [22].

this motivates us to investigate the temporal patterns of
these discussions and their relation with edit activity. while
previous studies have focused on the amount of activity on
talk pages [13, 24], and the shape and complexity of the
discussions [15], still little is known about the dynamics of
these conversations.

how are the conversations distributed in time? how fre-
quent are spikes of activity? are they associated to external
events or to community dynamics? what is the relationship
between discussion and edit activity? how fast do discus-
sions grow, and for how long? does the topic a   ect the way
a discussion evolves?

being able to answer these questions could bene   t the
community in tasks like assessment of discussion maturity
and early detection of controversies. understanding when
the biggest controversies associated to an article have been
solved (i.e. the discussion is mature) may serve as a proxy for
content stability, while detecting disputes which may need
the attention of moderators could help avoid their escalation
into a too    erce debate, allowing wikipedians to invest their
time into more productive tasks and to reduce their frustra-
tion, and ultimately might help to reduce editor drop-out.

to address the above-mentioned research questions, we
present here an extensive study of the temporal dynamics

1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:recentism
2http://www.wikinews.org/

of the english wikipedia discussions, taking into account
all the conversations on article talk pages occurring during
its    rst 9 years of history. we start by summarising our
main    ndings and o   ering a brief insight into related work
in sections 2 and 3. then, after introducing the dataset
in section 4, we detect and contrast peaks in the edit and
discussion activity of articles in section 5. afterwards, in
section 6, we introduce a metric based on the h-index [9] to
measure the growth speed of discussions. as an example, we
illustrate the evolution of the articles about the last three us
presidents, and apply our measure to all heavily discussed
articles to reveal di   erences in the discussions about di   er-
ent subjects. finally, in the last section we draw conclusions
and lines for future research.

2. our contribution

our main contributions are:
    we detect peaks in the discussions on wikipedia arti-
cles and shed light on some of their statistical proper-
ties such as number of peaks per article, peak length
and time interval between peaks. a comparison with
peaks in the edit history reveals that comment and
edit peaks appear mainly independently of each other.
    we o   er a qualitative insight into the nature of edit
and discussion peaks through the detailed analysis of
a case study, which shows that both endogenous (wi-
kipedia internal) and exogenous (o   ine world) events
can be the cause of such peaks, while the subjects of
the disputes are not necessarily related to such events.
    we introduce a measure to account for the speed with
which the discussions gain in complexity. the measure
reveals speeds that span three orders of magnitude.

    we observe that articles about hot topics in the media
receive also considerably more attention, have faster
dynamics and longer peak durations in wikipedia.

3. related work

transparency is a pillar of the wiki philosophy, so com-
plete information about the edit history of each page is avail-
able. however, it is often di   cult to make sense of it, espe-
cially for larger pages. to address this limitation, a number
of tools have been proposed for the visualisation of the evo-
lution of the activity on a given page [3, 20, 22]. among
the studies focused on mining edit history to extract pat-
terns of interaction, we mention [1] for automatic vandalism
detection, [13] and [24] for identifying con   ict. the latter
also provides a description of the most controversial topics
in several language versions of wikipedia; for the english
wikipedia, positive correlation is found between con   ict on
an article and length of the associated talk page.

while at the beginning most of the e   ort in wikipedia was
spent in creating and editing articles, other activities such as
coordination and discussion have progressively emerged with
the increased complexity [13, 21]. kittur et al. [12] studied
the distribution of work over time, and found a gradual shift
from the    elite    users to less active editors, while the authors
of [14] described the evolution of wikipedia   s co-authorship
network pointing out its increasing centralisation around the
most active users.

the interpretation of wikipedia as a global memory place
led ferron et al. [6] to observe that articles related to trau-
matic events are more likely to be characterised by a higher

amount of edits in correspondence with anniversaries. in [5]
the same authors present a study of activity on di   erent lan-
guage versions of wikipedia during the egyptian revolution,
   nding evidence of intensive participation on articles and
talk pages related to the events. furthermore, they point
out boosts of edits after major events, like mubarak   s resig-
nation. another case study [11] analyses edit and collabo-
ration dynamics around articles related to the 2011 tohoku
earthquakes.

temporal patterns in comment activity have also been in-
vestigated in other contexts, e.g.
for slashdot comments
by [10] who mainly analysed the reaction time of a commu-
nity to an initiator event. however, discussions in slashdot
evolve on a much faster timescale than in wikipedia. they
only receive a very short attention span and are subject to
time limits, making their dynamics highly in   uenced by the
circadian cycle of its authors. activity peaks in social me-
dia platforms have been studied in other contexts such as
small text fragments from blogs and mainstream media [17],
youtube [4] and twitter [16]. the two latter studies pro-
pose models to characterise di   erent classes of activity peaks
according to their dynamics, and to associate them to ex-
ogenous and endogenous factors.

4. dataset and data preparation

we are interested not only in the evolution of the sizes of
the discussions but also in their complexity. to measure the
complexity of a discussion we will use its structure, thus we
have to go beyond simply analysing the edit history of article
talk pages. we use a dataset which identi   es every comment
and its associated metadata via parsing the wikitext.

this dataset is described in more detail in [15]. it contains
all wikipedia article talk pages, as of march 12th, 2010;
each discussion page is represented as a tree, to re   ect the
thread structure of comments and replies indented under
one another3. most comments are signed and dated by the
users4 adopting di   erent conventions and making use of wiki

3note that sometimes users reset indentation; we consider
these cases as the start of a new thread in the discussion.

shortcuts. we only consider comments for which an author-
signature could be identi   ed; of these 9.4 millions comments,
about 11% have a malformed date-signature (or none at all).
we keep those comments as they still allow to extract the
structure of the discussion prior to the    rst correctly signed
comment. this information is then used as starting point
for our statistics in the second part of our study.

to extract the edit history of the articles we processed the
complete dump of wikipedia including all revisions of each
page, using the wikixray parser5. we only considered ar-
ticles having a talk page (    871, 000, corresponding to 27%
of all articles in the dump). figure 1 shows the evolution of
the number of edits and comments per day to these articles.
we    nd about 6 comments for every 100 edits and a very
similar trend in both curves, which co-evolve nearly in per-
fect synchrony showing the same weekly activity cycle. the
cycles becomes visible in the zoom on the activity during
2007 in the bottom subplot of figure 1.6

the    rst objective of this study is to investigate whether
this co-evolution between edits and comments can also be
found at the article level.

5http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/wikixray
6in this figure the comments of two bots which made on rare
occasions comments to several thousands di   erent articles
on a speci   c day were omitted for clarity.

5. comment and edit peaks

we    rst analyse the co-occurrence of peaks in the com-
ment and edit activity of the di   erent wikipedia articles.
we start by introducing the method to detect the moments
in time with peak activity.
5.1 peak detection algorithm

we extract two time series for every wikipedia article:

1. the number of edits per day to the article.
2. the number of comments per day on the corresponding

article talk page.

to identify peaks in these time-series we adapt the peak
detection algorithm of [16]. we compare the number n(t)
of edits (or comments) at day t to the median activity m(t)
during a sliding window of 4 weeks length7 centred on day t.
we consider the activity to peak if

n(t) > c    max(m(t), nmin)

(1)

where nmin is the minimum activity set to 10 comments or 10
edits respectively8 and c is the peak-factor, which we set to
5 if not stated otherwise in the rest of the manuscript. con-
sequences of other choices of c are discussed in section 5.3.
7this length accounts for the weekly activity cycles [23]
while re   ecting seasonal (monthly) trends.
8the choice of 10 was taken in analogy to [16].

we consider therefore the activity to peak at day t if it
is larger than c times the median activity during   2 weeks
around t (or larger than c times nmin if the median is lower
than the limit nmin).

note that this metric can also be seen as an extension of
a method presented in [19] where the logarithmic derivative,
i.e. the fraction (n(t)     n(t     1))/n(t     1), was used to detect
peaks in the number of page views and incoming links of
wikipedia articles. our metric adds a sliding window and
a minimum amount of activity to obtain more stable results
which do not depend on low activity    uctuations (which are
frequently found in the number of edits or comments). apart
from that, a peak-condition of the logarithmic derivative
being larger than one, as used in [19], would be equivalent
to the use of c = 2 in our case.
5.2 a case study: the article    barack obama   
before analysing the discussion and edit peaks on wikipe-
dia as a whole we start    rst with a case study on a speci   c
article to illustrate our peak detection method as well as the
co-occurrence of endogenous and exogenous peaks.

figure 2 gives an example of the activity peaks for the
article    barack obama    between january 2007 and march
2010. the activity prior to 2007 is considerably lower and
has been omitted in the    gure for clarity9. the blue line cor-
responds to the number of comments per day and the gray
curve to the number of edits. the dashed lines in red and
green show the   2 weeks medians of the comments and edits
respectively. peaks in the comment activity are depicted by
blue circles, edit peaks by black squares we count 6 com-
ment peaks, two of them correspond to twin peaks where
the activity peaks on two consecutive days. our method
also    nds 6 (isolated) edit peaks, of which 3 coincide in time
with peaks in the comment activity. the other 3 edit peaks
concur as well with elevated activity on the article talk page
but the number of comments involved does not surpass the
threshold established by eq. 1.

some peaks clearly correspond to important events, such
as obama winning the presidential primaries and elections,
his inauguration and the nobel peace prize win. however,
the subjects treated in the edit peaks and intensive discus-
sions are mostly not directly related to these events, but fo-
cused on controversies regarding the    gure of obama and the
disputed neutrality of the article. this suggests that these
peaks of activity were mainly caused by attention peaks of
the public opinion towards the subject of the page.

other edit and comment peaks seem not to be related to
major o   -line events, but caused by endogenous factors. for
example, the twin discussion peak on march 11th and 12th,
2007 is due to a poll proposed by a user to    nd consensus
about which of the 13 main supposed controversies, previ-
ously raised in the talk page, were notable 10, and thus had to
be included in the article. on march 9th, 2009, in correspon-
dence with a featured article review11, an edit war was raised
by users trying to add to the article content about contro-
versial issues, such as obama   s contact with rev. jeremiah
wright. the article was temporarily locked down, allow-

9note that also february 29th, 2008 has been excluded from
the    gure (but not from the analysis) to allow alignment
with the non-leap years. no peaks were found for this day.

ing only administrators to edit, and rerouting the dispute
to the talk page. this explains the fall of edit activity after
the peak on march 9th, accompanied by the burst of discus-
sion in the talk page, resulting in a twin peak (march 9th
and 10th). the edit war was reported by some conservative
media like fox news12, and media exposure ampli   ed the
expansion of the discussion.

finally, we also observe two endogenous discussion peaks
which occur in the vicinity of external events but do not have
a direct relation with them. on february 15th, 2007 discus-
sion peaks 5 days after obama   s candidacy announcement
and on october 10th, 2008 in between the two presidential
debates on the october 7th and 15th, 2008.

overall, the example shows that both internal community
dynamics and external events can cause spikes of attention
towards wikipedia articles, but the subjects of the disputes
are not necessarily directly related to the events which pro-
voked them initially.
5.3 choice of the parameter values

as mentioned earlier we choose c = 5, this way we en-
sure that peaks are rare spiky events with a large di   erence
from the usual activity variations. for the article about
   barack obama    the peaks we    nd occur with a frequency
of about 1%. this can be observed in figure 3 which shows
the complementary cumulative distribution of the ratio be-
tween the number of comments or edits n(t) and the 4 week
medians m(t) for all time-points (days) shown in figure 2.
continuous lines correct m(t) with the minimum activity
limit (nmin = 10) as in eq. 1 while dashed lines represent
the pure ratio between the two quantities13.
if the ratio
surpasses the peak-factor c our method detects a peak. the
curves roughly resemble error functions in log-scale suggest-
ing a log-normal distribution of the variations around the
median time series. we observe that a choice of c = 2 would
lead to peaks in one of every 4 or 5 days without the use of
nmin, or one in 10 with correction. choices of nmin smaller

13which is more similar to the logarithmic derivative used
in [19].

than 10 would lead to intermediate values. the choice of 10
was taken in analogy to [16].

table 1 lists the number of comment and edit-peaks we
obtained for our data set. we    nd 2,580 peaks in the dis-
cussions and 32,853 edit peaks with c = 5. higher choices
for c signi   cantly reduce the number of peaks we detect: for
c = 10 we    nd roughly one tenth of the comments peaks
and 15% of the edit-peaks. if we increase c further to 20
the numbers decrease in similar proportion. one can draw
a similar    gure as figure 3 (not shown) to observe the ef-
fect of other choices of c. the proportions are very similar
when not correcting with the minimum activity limit nmin,
but are lower when using it. e.g. with c = 5 we obtain, on
average, a peak for 0.2% of the days with comment activity
and for 0.5% of the days with edit activity. this di   erence
is caused by the fact that the average activity per article is
lower than the one for the article    barack obama   . never-
theless, it is the articles with high editing and commenting
activity which have to be used to calibrate the peak detec-
tion method to avoid an excessive number of peaks.

5.4 peaks in the wikipedia

in this section we present observations obtained when cal-
culating peaks in comment and edit activity for all english
wikipedia articles.

niversaries.

once the peaks are detected the next natural question is
whether this edit and comment peaks coincide in time. the
bottom nine rows of table 1 show that for c = 5 only about
12% of all comment peaks coincide with an edit peak at the
same day. this number increases to 27% when allowing one
day of di   erence between the edit and comment peaks and
to 33.8% when allowing two. these results indicate that not
necessarily peaks in the discussion activity have to lead to
peaks in the editing activity as well. however, the larger
those peaks the more likely is a coincidence. e.g. for c = 20
we    nd for 63% of the comment peaks a corresponding edit
peak within at most 2 days distance.

furthermore, we can observe that the average number of
comment peaks per article (2.15 for c = 5 among the arti-
cles with at least one peak) is larger than the corresponding
number of edit peaks per article (1.59 for c = 5). an article
with already one comment peak is thus more likely to obtain
a second one than an article with one edit-peak.

this    nding is con   rmed when taking a deeper look at
the distribution of the number of peaks per article depicted
in figure 4(a). we observe the typical shape of a power-
law-like distributions, with the majority of articles having
at most one peak. although we    nd a considerably larger
number of edit peaks the shape of the distributions are sim-
ilar for the comments (blue circles) and edit peaks (black
squares) with a steeper exponent for the edit peak distri-
bution. this implies (when normalising the distributions)
smaller likelihoods for having multiple edit peaks than hav-
ing multiple comment peaks.

we observe a similar characteristic for the distribution of
the peak-lengths, i.e. the number of consecutive days with
peak activity, in figure 4(b), although in this case the dif-
ference in the slopes is less pronounced. the time between

two consecutive peaks also follows a power-law distribution
as can be observed in figure 4(c).14 a maximum likelihood
estimation of the power-law exponents reveals exponents of
around    1.4. further understanding of the shape of this
inter-peak time distributions in the wikipedia community
might be found in models similar to the one of [2] which ex-
plain bursts and inter-event time distributions of individual
human behaviour.

taking a closer look at figure 4(c) we furthermore observe
three outliers in the distribution of the edit peaks with sig-
ni   cantly more frequent peaks after 364, 365 and 366 days
from the previous one. this resonates with the anniver-
sary e   ect described by [6] as people returning to articles
at the anniversary of a traumatic event. however, although
we observe one such repeated peak in the article about the
september 11 attacks, most of these    anniversary peaks    ap-
pear in articles about holidays or other events with a    xed
date in the calendar, as can be observed in table 2. the
table lists all articles that repeat an edit peak at least two
times. the anniversary e   ect is not visible in the comment
peaks and seems thus restricted to editing behaviour.

we    nish the section with three more tables. the    rst,
table 3, shows a list of the top 10 articles with the largest
number of the comment peaks and the second, table 4, lists
the 10 articles with the longest peak-durations (consecutive
days with peak-activity). we    nd that many known contro-
versial topics also have a large amount of comment peaks;
the top 7 articles listed in table 3 can also be found among
the ones with the largest number of (prolonged) discussions

14note that we do not count peaks on consecutive days sep-
arately in this    gure.

between pairs of users in a listing given in [15]. however,
with the exception of the article about anarchism, it is also
interesting to note that there can be found (if any) only
a much lower number of edit peaks in these articles. this
might be explained by protection or semi-protection of the
corresponding articles.

in the list of the longest comment peak durations given in
table 4 we    nd articles (apart from the one on capitalism)
about one time events, or with a clear relation to an event
such as the independence of a country or the publication of
a long awaited book. we will discuss some of these articles
again at the end of the next section.

finally, we also list the top 10 articles with the largest
number of edit peaks in table 5. surprisingly, the majority
of the articles listed there seems to be only of limited general
interest, indicating that the corresponding edit peaks might
be caused by edit wars within a smaller group of users, or a
single very, very active user. the latter is for example the
case in the article about    uxbridge, massachusetts   .

tables 3 and 5 suggest that the peaks in the discussion
activity are more suitable as a measure of a sudden, more
widespread interest of the wikipedians in a speci   c topic
than the edit peaks. the latter seem to be easier to cause
by a small group of people. an adaptation of the measure
taking into account the number of users involved might be
suitable to avoid this e   ect.
5.5 peak detection in real time

so far we have presented a study of peaks in retrospective,
as a    rst necessary step for the understanding of edit and
discussion dynamics. however, the ability to detect peaks
in real time could be important for knowing what is going
on in the wiki, and detecting quick relative increments of
activity around one or more articles. this would be useful
for the community, for example to involve mediators early
into a controversy and to try to prevent its escalation into a
too    erce debate.

to use our peak detection algorithm in real time, one
would have to modify the time window used to calculate
the median activity, e.g. by using just the activity during 2
weeks before the current date. another possible modi   ca-
tion would be to monitor the fraction of median and current
activity instead of    xing a peak-factor. the fraction could
then be used to asses the relative size of a peak and depend-
ing on the size di   erent actions could be triggered.

6. the speed of growth of the dis-

cussions

after having analysed peaks in the discussion activity we
are now interested in measuring how fast the discussions
grow in complexity.

figure 5 depicts the number of comments received by the
discussion pages of the wikipedia articles of the three most
recent us-presidents. the left plot shows the evolution of
the number of comments per month, while the right plot
corresponds to the increase in the total number of comments
on the pages. one can observe that until the end of 2006
the page of george w. bush received more comments than
those of his predecessor and successor. between january
2007 and october 2008 the page of g.w. bush received a
similar amount of comments as the one of barack obama,
who took the lead after the elections of november 2008.
the discussion page of the article about bill clinton receives
considerably less comments than those of his two successors.
how should we assess now the complexity of the discus-
sions on those pages? for that purpose we will use the h-
index of the structure of the discussion introduced in [7].

6.1 the h-index of a discussion

the h-index of a discussion is a balanced depth measure.
figure 6 gives an example of the tree representation of a
nested discussion. the root node of the discussion corre-
sponds to its initiating event (i.e.
the article in the case
of wikipedia). the comments initiating a sub-thread are
placed on the    rst level, their replies on the second and
replies to the replies on the third level and so forth. the
level of the comment is also refereed to as its depth. the
h-index of a discussion is the maximal number    such that
there are at least    comments at level (depth)   , but not   +1
comments at level    + 1. another possible de   nition would
be that there are    sub-threads of depth at least   . the red
line in figure 6 indicates that for the example thread the
condition is ful   lled for    = 3.

this measure is able to    lter discussions which are very
intense but otherwise restricted to repeated arguments be-
tween two or a small group of users. such threads can reach
considerable depths but are normally not representative to

figure 6: example for the calculation of the h-index
of a nested discussion with h = 3, adapted from [7].

describe the complexity of the discussions. for example, the
authors of [15] found discussions with a depth of 42 about
the article    liberal democracy   , while the h-index of this
discussion was just 12. the maximal h-index they found
was 20 for the discussion about    anarchism   .
6.2 the growth measure    h

to measure how the h-index grows over time we de   ne as
   h the average time (measured in days) it takes a discussion
to increase its h-index by one. mathematically this can be
written as: given the time-series h(t) of the values of the h-
index of a discussion until day t we search for the time-points
t1, . . . t   such that h(ti) = h(tt   1) + 1 for all i     [1, . . . ,   ]
and de   ne then the growth speed of the discussion as

   h =

p     1

i=1 (ti+1     ti)

       1

=

t       t1
       1

.

(2)

the measure we propose here is very related to the inverse
of the m-index proposed in [9]. the m-index of a researcher
with and h-index of    and who has    rst published a paper n
years ago is m =   /n. this de   nition takes advantage of the
fact that the h-index of a researcher should grow approxi-
mately linearly in time. this is also true for the h-index of
the discussions as we will see in the next subsection.

figure 7: evolution of the increase of the h-index
for the three most recent us-presidents.

6.3 results for three examples

once introduced we can calculate the growth measure for
the discussion pages of the three most recent us-presidents.
figure 7 shows the increase in time of the h-index of these
three pages. we observe a more or less constant growth of
the discussions, validating the linearity assumed in the def-
inition of eq. 2. note that as explained in the data section
the date of the older comments in wikipedia could not al-
ways be determined due to format issues. this explains why
the curves in figure 7 do not start for all articles with h = 1
(in that case eq. 2 has to be adapted to average over less
time-intervals). for example, for the article about george
w. bush we can only determine the time-stamp of the com-
ments when the h-index of the discussion already reached
an h-index of 4. we observe that the articles about the two
presidents in o   ce during the time since wikipedia has ex-
isted experience a considerable faster growth than the page
about their predecessor bill clinton. for george w. bush
we observe an average    h of 70.7 days, for barack obama15
this value is 90.2 days, while the article about bill clinton
takes on average 331.9 days to increase its h-index by one.
this might again be explained by a considerably larger in-
   uence of recent events on the discussion dynamics.
6.4 general results

how do these growth rates compare with those of other
articles? to answer this, in this section we take a look at
the distribution of    h for all 826 articles with more than
1000 comments in our dataset.

figure 8 depicts this distribution (with logarithmic bin-
ning). we observe a certain resemblance to a gaussian
shape, with the mode of the distribution at values of    h
of around 200 days (mean =183.1 and median =172.7). the
articles about barack obama and george w. bush are in
the quartile of the fastest growing discussions, while the one
about bill clinton can be found in the decile of the slowest
discussions. however, none of these discussions falls into the
extremes of very slow or very fast growing discussions.

tables 6 and 7 list the top discussions according to these
criteria together with their    h values. the start date in-
dicates the earliest dated comment16, the end date the day
when the the    nal h-index has been reached for the    rst time
(note that this will be in most cases not the day of the last
comment). we observe that many of the fastest evolving
discussions appear around articles related to events which
received heavy news coverage, such as school shootings (the
virginia tech massacre and its author which occupy ranks 1
and 5 in table 6), the 2009    u pandemic, terrorist attacks,
air crashes, etc. nevertheless we    nd also topics which re-
   ect ideological or ethical motivated disputes among the wi-
kipedia editors which lead to discussion gaining complexity
very fast. such topics are the    bronze solder of tallinn   
(re   ecting a con   ict between ethnic russians and estoni-
ans),    the 2009 honduran constitutional crisis    as well as
discussions about the    israeli occupied territories    and the
   international status of abkhazia and south ossetia   . some
of the articles of this list have already appeared in table 4
suggesting a correlation between    h and the maximum edit
peak-length of the articles. such a correlation can indeed
be found (r =    0.25, weak although statistically signi   -
cant, p < 10   4) indicating that faster growing discussions
are more likely to have longer lasting edit peaks.

we also    nd the very similar topics    state terrorism by
the united states    and    state terrorism and the united
states    appearing in the list. they correspond in fact to
the same article, which has been renamed several times (the
current title is    united states and state terrorism   ) leaving
only the archived discussions under the old titles. we have
decided to keep these separated discussions, to show the
repeated fast growth of the discussion around the slightly
renamed (and re-framed) subject.

finally the list of the slowest evolving discussions in ta-
ble 6 is led by the articles about    christopher columbus   
and    pi    and contains many more articles about timeless
content or content which has been subject of discussion over

elements such as headlines in the calculation of the h-index
which explains the smaller    nal h-index compared to the
ones reported by [15].

16as mentioned above this does not have to mean that the
discussion started that day, as about 11% of the comments,
and especially the oldest comments, do not have a date as-
sociated in our dataset.

long dispute such as the    shakespeare authorship question   .

unexpected will happen. however, more research is need
to investigate the correct parametrisation of the proposed
technique for this speci   c application.

6.5 using    h to measure discussion maturity
our results show that article discussions can have very
di   erent dynamics, with time-spans ranging from days to
years. also, figure 7 suggests a remarkable di   erence be-
tween discussions which are still growing in complexity, as
the one about the article    barack obama      , and those whose
h-index has not increased recently, like in the case of the ar-
ticle    george w. bush   . it seems reasonable to assume that,
although both articles are still being edited and discussed,
the content of the second one should be more stable as its
discussion is mature in the sense that its most con   ictive
controversies have been fought, i.e. its maximal h-index has
been reached. that does not mean that no new controversy
might emerge somewhere in the future to raise it further.

the growth measure    h introduced in this section can be
used to assess this maturity of a discussion. one has to as-
sure that a su   cient amount of time has passed since the last
time the h-index of a discussion has increased. only after
some multiples of    h one can safely assume that the dis-
cussion will not grow more in complexity unless something

7. conclusions

in this study we have analysed the time-evolution of the
discussions about wikipedia articles on two scales: at a mi-
croscopic level detecting peaks in the comment activity and
at a macroscopic level introducing a measure for the rate
of increase in complexity of the discussions. although other
studies have systematically analysed peaks on wikipedia be-
fore [19], to our knowledge this is the    rst study which does
this for the commenting and editing activity.

we observe that, although on a global scale editing and
commenting activity co-evolve nearly in perfect synchrony,
at the individual article level discussion and edit peaks seem
to occur mostly independently of each other. they can be
caused by either endogenous dynamics, such as polls, inter-
nal peer reviews and initiatives of some editors, or exogenous
factors, such as o   -line events or media exposure. however,
the subjects of the disputes are not necessarily related di-
rectly to the events which provoked a peak of attention.

by introducing a measure for the growth of a discussion
based on a balanced depth-measure of its structure we    nd

several orders of magnitude of di   erent rates of increase in
complexity of the discussions. some discussions need only a
few days to evolve, while the slowest go on over years.

our    ndings indicate that current events are often edited
and discussed on wikipedia about nearly in real-time either
in a new article or in the form of a new peak in an already
existing article, while on the other hand, for articles about
historical or scienti   c facts which are not on the people   s
minds it may take years to reach a similar level of intensity.
wikipedia is the most up-to-date encyclopedia seen until
now and is heavily in   uenced by recent events as can be ob-
served for example when consulting the wiki-zeitgeist17, i.e.
the list of the most edited topics in a certain time period.
using the metrics presented here one should be able to de-
velop more sophisticated algorithms for such rankings which
instead of just counting edits would account also for relative
growth dynamics in both edit and discussion activity.

although there is concern inside the wikipedia commu-
nity about the risks of recentism and the disproportionate
attention received by recent and current events, our results
point out that this type of dynamics constitutes a character-
istic pattern of activity in the wikipedia community. such
patterns are probably unavoidable in the context of an open
collaborative platform.

according to the interpretation of wikipedia as a collec-
tive memory place [18], where a living memory is progres-
sively turned into a    xed text, talk pages are the space where
this transformation takes place. wikipedia discussions can
thus be seen as a mirror of a stream of public consciousness,
where those elements which are still not part of a shared
consolidated heritage are object of a continuous negotiation
among di   erent points of view.

future work our study presents a    rst step towards the
comprehension of the temporal patterns which rule the col-
lective process of content creation in wikipedia, and opens
up to further research in several directions.

we have sketched applications of our metrics for early
detection of controversies and assessment of discussion ma-
turity, which should be implemented for further evaluation.
the extension of existing generative models [8] for the tree
structure of the discussions with temporal information could
help to explain possible dynamical di   erences between fast
and slow evolving discussions.

a cross-article analysis of peaks would help to unveil hid-
den relationships between articles and topics, while the clas-
si   cation of peaks according to their shape, as for example
proposed in [4]18, could allow to automatically distinguish
exogenous and endogenous peaks, and to detect the in   u-
ence of external events. the metrics used in this study could
also be applied on speci   c sub-threads of a discussion, which
should allow to detect hot spots within a speci   c article.
