abstract

   dictionaries link a given word to a set of alternative words (the
   definition) which in turn point to further descendants. iterating
   through definitions in this way, one typically finds that definitions
   loop back upon themselves. we demonstrate that such definitional loops
   are created in order to introduce new concepts into a language. in
   contrast to the expectations for a random lexical network, in graphs of
   the dictionary, meaningful loops are quite short, although they are
   often linked to form larger, strongly connected components. these
   components are found to represent distinct semantic ideas. this
   observation can be quantified by a singular value decomposition, which
   uncovers a set of conceptual relationships arising in the global
   structure of the dictionary. finally, we use etymological data to show
   that elements of loops tend to be added to the english lexicon
   simultaneously and incorporate our results into a simple model for
   language evolution that falls within the    rich-get-richer    class of
   network growth.

popular summary

   humans can communicate complex thoughts and ideas owing to a shared
   vocabulary and rules for stringing words together in meaningful
   sentences. these vocabulary words are often interrelated and evolve
   over time in response to the changing needs of communication. such
   relations are embedded in the structure of dictionaries in which
   language is fixed in time and words are used to define other words. by
   applying the tools of statistical physics and id207, we have
   discovered new features of word connections and, in particular, that
   some aspects of vocabularies, such as apparently circular definitions
   (or    definitional loops   ), are not defects but essential to the growth
   of language.

   in our paper we report a quantitative analysis achieved by viewing a
   dictionary as a network of words: every word has links pointing to each
   of the words in its definition. in turn, each of those words points to
   the words in its definition, and so on. iterating through the whole
   dictionary, we find that a complicated directed graph appears. the
   directed trajectories converge to a small set of fundamental words,
   strongly connected with a high density of loops, from which all others
   can in principle be defined.

   the graph of the dictionary must be cyclic to some extent, given the
   requirement that every word have a definition. however, we show here
   that definitional loops arise not as simple artifacts of the
   dictionary   s construction but rather as the vehicle by which new
   concepts are introduced to language. when a totally new concept is
   created, the dictionary can accommodate it only by revising the
   topology of the graph.

   our analysis further reveals that short loops describe parts of
   homogeneous subjects, which then overlap to form larger components that
   represent in turn whole semantic ideas. finally, we show that elements
   of loops tend to be added to the english lexicon simultaneously, and we
   incorporate our results into a simple model for language evolution.

       was actually definable before time
       [math: <mi>t</mi> :math]
       ; no new concept was created by

       . in (b), any definition of
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi></msub> :math]
       must include

       ,
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>c</mi></msub> :math]
       , or
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>d</mi></msub> :math]
       . since
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>b</mi></msub> :math]
       is a descendant of all of these words,
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>a</mi></msub> :math]
       is not definable before
       [math: <mi>t</mi> :math]
       , implying that a new concept was formed. in fact, despite having
       originally been introduced at
       [math: <mi>t</mi><mo>   </mo><mn>1</mn> :math]
       ,
       [math: <msub><mi>w</mi><mi>c</mi></msub> :math]

       empirically according to usage frequencies in written texts, while
