abstract

   the second eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix and its associated
   eigenvector are fundamental features of an undirected graph, and as
   such they have found widespread use in scientific computing, machine
   learning, and data analysis. in many applications, however, graphs that
   arise have several local regions of interest, and the second
   eigenvector will typically fail to provide information fine-tuned to
   each local region. in this paper, we introduce a locally-biased
   analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its usefulness
   at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised
   manner. to do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution
   to a constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local
   information as an additional constraint; we then characterize the
   optimal solution to this new problem and show that it can be
   interpreted as a generalization of a personalized id95 vector; and
   finally, as a consequence, we show that the solution can be computed in
   nearly-linear time. in addition, we show that this locally-biased
   vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best partition
   near an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in which the
   second eigenvector of the laplacian can be used to obtain an
   approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. such a
   primitive is useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as
   it allows us to focus on a local region of interest in a
   semi-supervised manner. finally, we provide a detailed empirical
   evaluation of our method by showing how it can applied to finding
   locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set in social
   and information networks.
