abstract

   a recent article [vinkovic d, kirman a (2006) proc natl acad sci usa
   103:19261   19265] showing that the schelling model has a physical
   analogue extends our understanding of the model. however, prior
   research has already outlined a mathematical basis for the schelling
   model and simulations based on it have already enhanced our
   understanding of the social dynamics that underlie the model, something
   that the physical analogue does not address. research in social science
   has provided a formal basis for the segregative outcomes resulting from
   the residential selection process and simulations have replicated
   relevant spatial outcomes under different specifications of the
   residential dynamics. new and increasingly detailed survey data on
   preferences demonstrates the embeddedness of the schelling selection
   process in the social behaviors of choosing alternative residential
   compositions. it also demonstrates that, in the multicultural context,
   seemingly mild preferences for living with similar neighbors carry the
   potential to be strong determinants for own race selectivity and
   residential segregation.

     * author contributions: w.a.v.c. and m.f. designed research,
       performed research, analyzed data, and wrote the paper.
     * the authors declare no conflict of interest.
     * this article is a pnas direct submission.
     * [144]    d simseg can implement two- and three-group simulations. the
       shift from two to three groups is sufficient to reveal many
       differences in the implications of preferences in the multigroup
       context.
     * [145]    e this is a conservative setting because specifying groups
       as equal in size is optimal for maintaining integration in
       schelling-style segregation models ([146]22). higher levels of
       segregation result when we use more realistic demographic
       distributions (e.g., 65, 25, and 10).
     * [147]    f targets for same-group presence are the same for all
       groups. we ran simulations in which preference targets were
       dispersed around the mean (as seen in the distributions in
       [148]fig. 2) and simulations in which targets were homogeneous. the
       results were similar either way, indicating that, in the main,
       preference effects revolve around the central tendency of the
       preference distribution.
     * [149]    g this specification is used in recent studies ([150]22,
       [151]23) and is similar to the 5    5 square neighborhoods schelling
       used in some simulations ([152]2). significantly, preference
       effects are robust over varying specifications of neighborhood
       size, shape, and type (e.g., bounded areas versus site-centered
       areas).
     * [153]    h the results shown here are from representative simulation
       experiments. we performed 500 replications for each design to
       establish the statistical norm for quantitative results.
     * [154]    i v is a well known measure with many attractive technical
       properties. we also computed scores for the more widely used
       dissimilarity index (d). reporting v is a conservative choice;
       scores for d are always higher and suggest even more dramatic
       segregation results.
     * [155]    j we omit results for simulations with preferences set to
       zero. not surprisingly, segregation did not emerge in these
       simulations.
     * [156]    k the shift from small-to-large scale segregation patterns
       occurs at low levels of agent vision (e.g., 4   16 units).
       computational burden increases geometrically as local agent vision
       increases. intermediate vision produces large-scale segregation
       with low computational burden.
     * [157]    l when multiple factors affect segregation, quantitative
       assessments of their separate effects depend critically on how the
       analysis is performed. when each is    added    or    removed    from a
       model system in which no other segregation dynamics are active, the
       impact can be large. however, when they are    added    or    removed   
       from a model system in which multiple segregation dynamics are
       active, their impact is usually small.
