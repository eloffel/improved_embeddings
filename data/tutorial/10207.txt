abstract

   theoretical models suggest that social networks influence the evolution
   of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies.
   observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread
   in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to
   befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal
   id136. here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments
   that originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help
   sustain cooperation. in these experiments, subjects were randomly
   assigned to a sequence of different groups to play a series of
   single-shot public goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us
   to draw networks of interactions to explore how cooperative and
   uncooperative behaviors spread from person to person to person. we show
   that, in both an ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game
   with punishment, focal individuals are influenced by fellow group
   members    contribution behavior in future interactions with other
   individuals who were not a party to the initial interaction.
   furthermore, this influence persists for multiple periods and spreads
   up to three degrees of separation (from person to person to person to
   person). the results suggest that each additional contribution a
   subject makes to the public good in the first period is tripled over
   the course of the experiment by other subjects who are directly or
   indirectly influenced to contribute more as a consequence. these
   results show experimentally that cooperative behavior cascades in human
   social networks.
