abstract

   human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized.
   human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social
   networks. importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,
   changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. this
   dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that
   has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical
   attention: people can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
   around them by making or breaking network links. here, we present
   experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation
   and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize
   cooperation in sizable groups. our experiments explore large-scale
   cooperation, where subjects    cooperative actions are equally beneficial
   to all those with whom they interact. consistent with previous
   research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social
   networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all
   rounds. we also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated
   only infrequently, cooperation again fails. however, when subjects can
   update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively
   different outcome: cooperation is maintained at a high level through
   network rewiring. subjects preferentially break links with defectors
   and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate
   and leading to substantial changes in network structure. our
   experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game
   theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social
   networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.
