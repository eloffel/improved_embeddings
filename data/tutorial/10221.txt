[30]abstract

   understanding social dynamics that govern human phenomena, such as
   communications and social relationships is a major problem in current
   computational social sciences. in particular, given the unprecedented
   success of online social networks (osns), in this paper we are
   concerned with the analysis of aggregation patterns and social dynamics
   occurring among users of the largest osn as the date: facebook. in
   detail, we discuss the mesoscopic features of the community structure
   of this network, considering the perspective of the communities, which
   has not yet been studied on such a large scale. to this purpose, we
   acquired a sample of this network containing millions of users and
   their social relationships; then, we unveiled the communities
   representing the aggregation units among which users gather and
   interact; finally, we analyzed the statistical features of such a
   network of communities, discovering and characterizing some specific
   organization patterns followed by individuals interacting in online
   social networks, that emerge considering different sampling techniques
   and id91 methodologies. this study provides some clues of the
   tendency of individuals to establish social interactions in online
   social networks that eventually contribute to building a well-connected
   social structure, and opens space for further social studies.

[32]introduction

   social media and online social networks (osns) represent a revolution
   in web users behavior that is spreading at an unprecedented rate during
   the latest years. online users aggregate on platforms such as facebook
   and twitter creating large social networks of millions of persons that
   interact and group each other. people create social ties constituting
   groups based on existing relationships in real life, such as on
   relatives, friends, colleagues, or based on common interests, shared
   tastes, etc.

   in the context of computational social sciences, the analysis of social
   dynamics, including the description of those unique features that
   characterize online social networks, is acquiring an increasing
   importance in current literature [[33]1   [34]3].

   one of the challenges for network scientists is to provide techniques
   to collect [[35]4] and process [[36]5] data from online social networks
   in an automatic fashion, and strategies to unveil the features that
   characterize these types of complex networks [[37]6]. in addition,
   these methods should be capable of working in such large-scale
   scenarios [[38]7].

   amongst all the relevant problems in this area, the analysis of the
   so-called community structure of online social networks acquired
   relevant attention during latest years [[39]8   [40]14]. recently,
   several relevant quantitative works have been presented to this purpose
   [[41]15   [42]19].

   studying the community structure of a network helps in explaining
   social dynamics of interaction among groups of individuals
   [[43]20   [44]22], but also to quantitatively investigate social theories
   such as milgram   s small world [[45]23], granovetter   s strength of weak
   ties [[46]24], borgatti   s and everett   s core-periphery structure
   [[47]25, [48]26], and so forth.

   furthermore, discovering and analyzing the community structure is a
   topic of great interest for its economical and marketing implications
   [[49]27]. for example, it could be possible to improve the advertising
   performance by identifying and targeting the most influential users of
   each community, exploiting effects such as the word-of-mouth and the
   spread of information within the community itself [[50]28]. similarly,
   exploiting the affiliations of users to communities might be effective
   to provide them useful recommendations on the base of common interests
   shared with their friends [[51]29].

   finally, the community detection problem has plenty of challenges from
   a computational perspective, since it is highly related to the problem
   of id91 large, possibly heterogeneous, datasets [[52]30   [53]35].

   in this work we are concerned with the analysis of the community
   structure of the largest online social network as to date: facebook. in
   particular, we acquire a sample from the facebook social graph (i.e.,
   the network of relationships among the users), and then we apply two
   different state-of-the-art algorithms to unveil its underlying
   community structure (see the appendix for technical details).

   the further analysis of the mesoscopic features of this network puts
   into evidence the organization patterns that describe the connectivity
   of users in large online social network.
   to summarize, in the remainder of the paper we will discuss the
   following results:
    1. (i)
       the emergence of a tendency of social network users at the
       formation of communities of heterogeneous size (following a
       heavy-tailed distribution), which means that there exist several
       groups of small size and a decreasing number of groups or larger
       size.

    2. (ii)
       the number of interconnections that exists among communities also
       follows a broad distribution, that provides some clues in the
       direction of the assessment of the strength of weak ties theory,
       foreseen by the early work of granovetter [[54]24].

   (iii) the community structure of the network is defined, independently
   of the method adopted to unveil it. to this purpose, we take into
   account the possible bias introduced by the sampling procedures
   [[55]36] and the resolution limit suffered by some types of community
   detection algorithms [[56]37, [57]38].
    1. (iv)
       the emergence of the so-called small world phenomenon - whose
       existence in real-world social networks has been assessed during
       the sixties by milgram [[58]23]: the community structure of the
       network is highly clustered and tightly interconnected by means of
       short paths, features which are exhibited by several small world
       networks [[59]15, [60]39]. according to the model of small world
       network proposed by watts and strogatz [[61]39], not only the
       diameter of the network grows as the logarithm of the size (a
       feature exhibited also by random networks), but also the id91
       coefficient is high - a discriminating feature observed also in our
       case.

[62]methods

   the aim of this work is to analyze the mesoscopic features of the
   community structure of the facebook social network. in the following we
   provide some information about the process of data collection, briefly
   discussing the sampling methodology and the techniques adopted to
   collect data.

   this is the first step to study the community structure of real-world
   networks, that reflect unique characteristics which are impossible to
   replicate by using synthetic network models [[63]40].

   after that, we discuss the process of community detection that we
   adopted to unveil the community structure of the network (and, to this
   regard, additional technical details are discussed in the appendix).

   finally, we describe the process of definition of the community
   meta-network - a network whose nodes represent the communities
   identified in the social graph, to which it follows its analysis and
   discussion of findings.

sampling the facebook network

   differently from other online social network platforms (for example
   twitter), facebook does not provide a framework to automatically access
   information related to users with public profiles.

   this lack of data availability has been faced acquiring public
   information directly from the platform, by means of a sampling process.

   during this study we did not inspect, acquire or store personal
   information about users, since we were interested only in
   reconstructing the social connections among a sample of them - whose
   friend-lists were publicly accessible. to this purpose, we designed a
   web data mining platform with the only ability to visit the publicly
   accessible friend-list web pages of specific users, selected according
   to a sampling algorithm, and extract their connections. obtained data
   have been used only to reconstruct the network sample studied in this
   work.

   the architecture of the designed mining platform is briefly schematized
   as follows. we devised a data mining agent (i.e., an autonomous
   software tool), which implements two sampling methodologies
   (breadth-first search and uniform sampling). the agent queries the
   facebook server(s) in order to request the friend-list web pages of
   specific users. in detail, the agent visits those web pages containing
   the friend-list of a given user, following the directives of the chosen
   sampling methodology, and extracts the friendship relationships
   reported in the publicly accessible user profile.

   the sampling procedure runs until any termination criterion/a is/are
   met (e.g., a maximum running time, a minimum size of the sample, etc.),
   concluding the sampling process. collected data are processed and
   stored in anonymized format,^a post-processed, cleaned and filtered
   according to further requirements.

the sampling methodologies

   in the following, we briefly discuss the two statistical sampling
   methods adopted in this work, namely the breadth-first-search and the
   uniform sampling.

the breadth-first-search sampling

   the first adopted sampling methodology is a snowball technique that
   exploits the breadth-first-search (bfs), an uninformed graph traversal
   algorithm. starting from a seed node, the procedure explores its
   neighborhood; then, for each neighbor, it visits its unexplored
   neighbors, and so on, until the whole network is visited (or,
   alternatively, a termination criterion is met). this sampling technique
   has several advantages with respect to other techniques (for example,
   id93 sampling, forest fire sampling, etc.) as discussed in
   recent literature [[64]41, [65]42]. one of the main advantages is that
   it produces a coherent graph whose topological features can be studied.

   for this reason it has been adopted in a variety of osns mining studies
   [[66]1, [67]43   [68]46]. during our experimentation, we defined the
   termination criterion that the mining process did not exceed 10 days of
   running time. by observing a short time-limit, we ensured a negligible
   effect of evolution of the network structure (less than 2% overall,
   according to a heuristic calculation based on the growth rate of
   facebook during the sampling process - august 2010). the size of the
   obtained (partial) graph of the facebook social network has been
   adopted as yardstick for the uniform sampling process.

the uniform sampling

   the second chosen sampling methodology is a rejection-based sampling
   technique, called uniform sampling. the main advantage of this
   technique is that it is proven unbiased, at least in its formulation
   for facebook. details about its definition are provided by gjoka et al.
   [[69]44]. the process consists of generating an arbitrary number of
   user-ids, randomly distributed in the domain of assignment of the
   facebook user-id system. in our case, it is the space of the 32-bit
   numbers: the maximum amount of assignable user-ids is 2^32, about 4
   billions. as of august 2010 (the period during which we carried out the
   sampling process), the number of subscribed users on facebook was about
   500 millions, thus the id203 of randomly generating an existing
   user-id was
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>1</mn> <mo
   stretchy="false">/</mo> <mn>8</mn> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   .

   the sampling process has been set up as follows: first we generated a
   number of random user-ids, lying in the interval
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo stretchy="false">[</mo> <mn>0</mn>
   <mo>,</mo> <msup> <mn>2</mn> <mn>32</mn> </msup> <mo>   </mo> <mn>1</mn>
   <mo stretchy="false">]</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , equal to the dimension of the bfs-sample multiplied by 8. then, we
   queried facebook for their existence. our expectation was to obtain a
   sample of comparable dimensions with respect to the bfs-sample.
   actually, we obtained a slightly smaller sample, due to the restrictive
   privacy settings imposed by some users, who configured their profile
   preventing the public accessibility of their friend-lists. the issue of
   the privacy has been investigated in our previous work [[70]45].

description of the samples

   all the user-ids contained in the samples have been anonymized using a
   48-bit hashing functions [[71]47], in order to hide references to users
   and their connections. data have been post-processed for a cleansing
   step, during which all the duplicates have been removed, and their
   integrity and congruency have been verified. the characteristics of the
   samples are reported in table [72]1. the size of both the samples is in
   the magnitude of few millions of nodes and edges.

   in this table we report some statistics regarding the two samples, bfs
   and uniform, which have been collected during august 2010 from the
   facebook social network.

   the anonymized datasets studied in this work may be examined by the
   scientific community.^b

   some of the statistical and topological features of these networks have
   been discussed in our previous work [[73]45], and our main previous
   findings can be summarized as follows:
     * it emerges that the degree distribution of nodes in the samples is
       defined by a power law

       :math]
       identifying two different regimes. in detail, it is possible to
       divide the domain into two intervals (tentatively
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>   </mo> <mi>x</mi>
       <mo>   </mo> <mn>10</mn> </mrow></semantics> :math]
       and
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>></mo> <mn>10</mn>
       </mrow></semantics> :math]
       ), whose exponents are
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <msubsup> <mi>  </mi> <mn>1</mn> <mi
       mathvariant="normal">bfs</mi> </msubsup> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2.45</mn>

       ,

       mathvariant="normal">uni</mi> </msubsup> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.2</mn>
       </mrow></semantics> :math]
       respectively for the bfs and the uniform sample, in agreement with
       recent studies by facebook [[74]18, [75]19].
     * concerning the diameter of the networks, the bfs sample shows a
       small diameter, in agreement with the six-degrees of separation
       theory[[76]39], given the snowball nature of the sampling
       algorithm, which produces a plausible graph; differently, the
       diameter is over-represented in the uniform sample, possibly
       because the largest connected component does not cover the whole
       network.
     * regarding the id91 coefficient, we observed that the average
       values for both the samples are very high, similarly as reported by
       other recent studies on osns [[77]3, [78]44]. high id91
       coefficient and small diameter provide a clue of the presence of
       the so-called small world effect [[79]15, [80]39] in the facebook
       social graph.

detecting communities

   given the large size of our facebook samples, most of the community
   detection algorithms existing in literature could not deal with it. in
   order to unveil the community structure of these networks we adopted
   two computationally efficient techniques: (i) label propagation
   algorithm (lpa) [[81]48], and (ii) fast network community algorithm
   (fnca) [[82]49].

   in the following we discuss the main advantages given from their choice
   and their performance.

advantages and performance of chosen methods

   the problem of selecting a particular community detection algorithm is
   crucial if the aim is to unveil the community structure of a network.
   in fact, the choice of a given methodology could affect the outcome of
   the experiments. in particular, several algorithms depend on tuning
   specific parameters, such as the size of the communities in the given
   networks, and/or their number (for additional information see recent
   surveys on this wide topic [[83]30   [84]35]).

   in this study, the purpose was to unveil the unknown community
   structure of our facebook samples, and to do so we choose two different
   techniques which rely just on the topology of the network itself as
   guide to discover the community structure.

   lpa (label propagation algorithm) is an algorithm for community
   detection based on the paradigm of label propagation, a common strategy
   characterizing several machine learning algorithms. its computational
   cost is near liner with respect to the size of the analyzed network.
   this computational efficiency makes it well suited for the discovery of
   communities in large networks, such as in our case. lpa only exploits
   the network structure as guide and does not follow any pre-defined
   objective function to maximize (differently from fnca); in addition, it
   does not require any prior information about the communities, their
   number or their size.

   fnca (fast network community algorithm) is a computationally efficient
   method to unveil the community structure of large networks. it is based
   on the maximization of an objective function called network modularity
   [[85]50, [86]51]. similarly to lpa, it does not require prior
   information on the structure of the network, the number of communities
   present in the network and/or their size.

   even though the paradigms on which the algorithms rely are different, a
   common feature emerges: their functioning is agnostic with respect to
   the characteristics of the considered network. this aspect makes them
   an ideal choice, considering that we do not have any prior information
   about the characteristics of the community structure of facebook.
   further technical details regarding these methods are discussed in the
   appendix of this paper.
   the performance of the lpa and fnca on our facebook samples is showed
   in table [87]2. both the algorithms are able to unveil the community
   structure of the network in double time. high values of network
   modularity have been obtained in both the samples. this aspect suggests
   the presence of a well-defined community structure.

   this table summarizes performance and results of the two chosen
   community detection algorithms (i.e., fnca and lpa) applied to the
   samples we collected from facebook.
   the community structure has been represented by using a list of vectors
   which are identified by a    community-id   ; each vector contains the list
   of user-ids (in anonymized format) of the users belonging to the given
   community; an example is depicted in table [88]3. this representation
   was instrumental to carry out with efficiency the experiments discussed
   in the remainder of the paper.

assessing the quality of the community detection

   remarkably, one challenge arises in the context of the assessment of
   the quality of the community detection process in real-world scenarios
   that is the lack of a ground truth against which to compare the results
   provided by the adopted community detection strategy - which might be
   biased by the strategy itself [[89]37, [90]38]. for such a reason, some
   works [[91]52   [92]54] estimate the quality of a community detection
   algorithm by measuring some internal measures of quality of detected
   communities, based on topological characteristics (for example, the
   network modularity to establish the density of connections among and
   within communities, or the stability of eigenvalues of the laplacian
   graph). other approaches [[93]33] are based on the possibility of
   exploiting exogenous factors, such as semantic information derived from
   additional knowledge on users (for example their affiliations to
   particular groups, etc.). in the first case, indicators of internal
   quality of the communities are often not sufficient to ensure the
   quality of the results - think, for example, at the resolution limit
   that arises in modularity maximization algorithms [[94]37, [95]38]. on
   the other hand, no additional information on users other than their
   interconnections was available to us, for the purpose of assessing the
   quality of our communities.

   then, to establish the significance of the community structure obtained
   by using the methods discussed above, we chose to evaluate the
   similarity of outcomes provided by the two adopted algorithms, against
   each other, in a number of different ways which are discussed in the
   next section. this might help in highlighting anomalies in our
   methodology, in case of significant divergences between obtained
   results.

building the community meta-network

   to study the mesoscopic features of the community structure of
   facebook, we abstracted a meta-network consisting of the communities,
   as follows. we built a weighted undirected graph
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msup> <mi>g</mi> <mo>   </mo> </msup>
   <mo>=</mo> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo> <msup> <mi>v</mi> <mo>   </mo>

   table [96]4 summarizes some characteristics of the networks obtained
   for the uniform sample by using fnca and lpa. something which
   immediately emerges is that the overall statistics obtained by using
   the two different community detection methods are very similar. the
   number of nodes in the meta-networks is smaller than the total number
   of communities discovered by the algorithms, because we excluded all
   those    communities    containing only one member (whose consideration
   would be in antithesis with the definition of community in the common
   sense).

   in this table we report some statistics regarding the community
   structure meta-network obtained from the uniform sample, by using the
   two chosen community detection algorithms (i.e., fnca and lpa).

   we discuss results regarding the community structure and its mesoscopic
   features in the following.

[97]results

   the analysis of the community structure of facebook will focus on the
   following aspects: (i) first, we try to evaluate the quality of the
   communities identified by means of the community detection algorithms
   described above. this step includes assessing the similarity of results
   obtained by using different sampling techniques and id91 methods.
   in detail, we evaluate the possible bias introduced by well-known
   limitations of these techniques (e.g., the resolution limit for
   modularity maximization methods [[98]37, [99]38] or the sampling bias
   due to the incompleteness of the sampling process [[100]36]). (ii)
   second, we investigate the mesoscopic features of the community
   meta-network considering some characteristics of the network (such as
   the diameter, the distribution of shortest-paths and weights of links,
   the connectivity among communities, etc.), discussing how these
   features may reflect organization patterns of individuals in the
   network.

analysis of the community structure

   in order to characterize the features of the community structure of
   facebook, our first step was to describe the distribution of the size
   of the communities discovered. this feature has been investigated in
   current literature [[101]12, [102]40], and it emerges that different
   complex networks exhibit heavy-tailed distributions in the size of the
   communities. this implies the existence of a large amount of
   communities whose size is very small and a very small amount of large
   communities in this type of real-world networks. in detail,
   lancichinetti et al. [[103]12] put into evidence that this holds true
   for a large family of complex networks, such as information,
   communication, biological, and social networks.

distribution of the community size

   figures [104]1 and [105]2 represent the id203 mass function of
   the distributions of the size of discovered communities, respectively
   for uniform and bfs sample, by using the two chosen community detection
   algorithms. from the analysis of these figures, it emerges that in both
   cases the distributions produced by the two community detection
   algorithms are very similar. moreover, we can observe that these
   distributions are broad and resembles other real-world complex networks
   (cf. [[106]12]).
   [107]figure 1 figure 1
   figure 1

   this plot shows the id203 mass function of the distribution of
   the size of the communities discovered by the two adopted algorithms (
   i.e. , fnca and lpa) for the uniform sample. both the distributions are
   broad and heavy-tailed.
   [108]figure 2 figure 2
   figure 2

   this figure depicts the id203 mass function of the distribution
   of the size of the communities discovered by fnca and lpa for the bfs
   sample. the distributions are wide but not heavy-tailed, due to the
   presence of a quasi-steady distribution of communities of size between
   50 and 500.

   from a further analysis it emerges that, for the uniform sample
   (figure [109]1), both the distributions are broad and heavy-tailed.
   differently, the distributions for the bfs sample are wide but not
   heavy-tailed, due to the quasi-steady id203 of finding
   communities of size between 50 and 200.

   the difference between bfs and uniform samples appears in agreement
   with the adopted sampling techniques. in fact, it has been recently put
   into evidence [[110]36, [111]45] that a sampling algorithm such as the
   bfs may affect the degree distribution towards high degree nodes, in
   case of incomplete visits. interestingly, this reflects also in the
   presence of communities, tentatively lying in the size interval
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>50</mn> <mo>   </mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>   </mo>
   <mn>200</mn> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , that are in greater number with respect to what it would be expected
   by a scale-free network.

   to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time it is observed
   that the bias towards high degree nodes introduced by the bfs sampling
   method reflects on the features of the community structure of a
   network. to the purpose of sampling, we could indicate as more
   appropriate those rejection-based methods, such as the uniform
   sampling, that do not over-represent high degree nodes.

   indeed, the analytical results reported in table [112]2 combined with
   the plots discussed above, suggest that both the algorithms identified
   a similar amount of communities, regardless the adopted sampling
   method. this is also reflected by the similar values of network
   modularity obtained for the two different sets. moreover, the size of
   the communities themselves seems to coincide for most of the times.

   the following point we address is inspecting the quality of the
   community structure obtained by using fnca and lpa. the possibility
   that two different algorithms produce different community structures is
   not to be excluded, thus in the following we investigate to what extent
   the results we obtained share a high degree of similarity.

community structure similarity

   in order to evaluate the similarity of two community structures we
   adopt three measures: (i) a variant of the jaccard coefficient, called
   binary jaccard coefficient; (ii) the id181; and,
   (iii) the normalized mutual information. in the following we discuss
   them separately, to explain their functioning, the motivations of their
   adoption and the obtained results.
   the first measure considered to our purpose is the binary jaccard
   coefficient, defined as
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mover accent="true"> <mi>j</mi> <mo
   stretchy="false">  </mo> </mover> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">v</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi mathvariant="bold">w</mi> <mo

   <mi>m</mi> <mn>11</mn> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>,</mo>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   (2)

   where
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>m</mi> <mn>11</mn> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   represents the total number of shared elements between two vectors^c v
   and w,
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>m</mi> <mn>01</mn> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   represents the total number of elements belonging to w and not
   belonging to v, and, finally
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>m</mi> <mn>10</mn> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   the vice-versa. the outcome of this measure lies in
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo stretchy="false">[</mo> <mn>0</mn>
   <mo>,</mo> <mn>1</mn> <mo stretchy="false">]</mo> </mrow></semantics>
   :math]
   .
   the adoption of the binary jaccard coefficient is due to the following
   consideration: if we would compute the simple intersection of two sets
   (i.e., the community structures) by using the classic jaccard
   coefficient, those communities differing even by only one member would
   be considered different, while a high degree of similarity among them
   could still be envisaged. we avoid this issue adopting the binary
   jaccard coefficient, by comparing each vector of the former set against
   all the vectors in the latter set, in order to match the most similar
   one. the mean degree of similarity is then computed as
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <munderover> <mo movablelimits="false">   </mo>

   represents the highest value of similarity chosen among those
   calculated combining the vector i of the former set with all the
   vectors of the latter set. we obtained the results as in table [113]5,
   in which we show the mean, median and standard deviations of the
   results obtained by comparing, both for the bfs and the uniform sample,
   the outcome of the id91 processes according to the two different
   algorithms (i.e., fnca and lpa).

   in this table we report the results obtained computing the similarity
   between the community structure discovered by using fnca and lpa in the
   bfs and uniform samples, computed by means of the binary jaccard
   coefficient.

   while the number of identical communities between the two sets obtained
   by using, respectively, bfs and uniform sampling, is not high (i.e.,
   respectively,
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>2</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>35</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   ), the overall mean degree of similarity is very high (i.e.,
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>73</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>91</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   ). this is due to the high number of communities which differ only for
   a very small number of elements. moreover, the fact that the median is,
   respectively,
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>75</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>99</mn> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">%</mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , and that the very majority of results lie in one standard deviation,
   supports the similarity of the obtained community structures.
   figures [114]3 and [115]4 graphically highlight these findings. their
   interpretation is as follows: on the x-axis and on the y-axis there are
   represented the communities discovered for the fnca and the lpa
   methods, respectively. the higher the degree of similarity between two
   compared communities, the higher the heat-map scores. the similarity is
   graphically evident considering that the values of heat showed in the
   figures are very high (i.e., greater than 0.7) for the most of the
   heat-map.
   [116]figure 3 figure 3
   figure 3

   this heat-map highlights the similarity of the communities discovered
   by means of the two adopted algorithms ( i.e. , fnca and lpa) applied
   to the uniform sample. almost the totality of communities discovered
   share a high fraction of members (in average the 91%), according the
   jaccard similarity computed pairwisely selecting the most similar
   communities in the partitions.
   [117]figure 4 figure 4
   figure 4

   this heat-map shows the similarity of the communities discovered by
   fnca and lpa in the bfs sample. in this case, with respect to the
   uniform sample case, the pairwise similarity between communities
   emerges slightly less obviously, but it is in average the 73%.
   before introducing the second experiment, observe that it is desirable
   to assess, not only if the two id91 solutions present a large
   amount of similar clusters, but also if they exhibit a similar
   statistical distribution in the size of the obtained clusters. to this
   purpose, a second method has been taken into consideration: the
   divergence measure called id181, that is defined
   as
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>d</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">kl</mi> </msub> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>p</mi> <mo stretchy="false">   </mo> <mi>q</mi> <mo

   stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi>i</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow>
   </mfrac> <mo>,</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   (4)

   where p and q represent, respectively, the id203 distributions
   that characterize the size of communities discovered by lpa and fnca,
   calculated on a given sample. let i be a given size such that
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>i</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>q</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>i</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   represent the id203 that a community of size i exists in the
   distributions p and q. the kl divergence is helpful if one would like
   to calculate how different are two distributions with respect to one
   another. in particular, being the kl divergence defined in the interval
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>0</mn> <mo>   </mo> <msub> <mi>d</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">kl</mi> </msub> <mo>   </mo> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">   </mi> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , the smaller the value of kl divergence between two distributions, the
   more similar they are.
   we calculated the pairwise kl divergences between the distributions
   discussed above, finding the following results.
    1. (i)
       on the uniform sample:

   the low values obtained by adopting the kl divergence put into evidence
   the correlation between the distributions calculated by using the two
   different algorithms on the two different samples.
   finally, to compute the quality of the results, we adopted a third
   measure, called normalized mutual information (nmi) [[118]55]. such a
   measure assumes that, given a graph g, a ground truth is available to
   verify what are the clusters (said real clusters) in g and what are
   their features. let us denote as a the true community structure of g
   and suppose that g consists of
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>a</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   clusters. let us consider a id91 algorithm applied on g and
   assume that it identifies a community structure b consisting of
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>b</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   clusters. we define a
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>a</mi> </msub>
   <mo>  </mo> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>b</mi> </msub> </mrow></semantics>
   :math]
   matrix - said confusion matrix - cm such that each row of cm
   corresponds to a cluster in a whereas each column of cm is associated
   with a cluster in b. the generic element
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="italic">cm</mi> <mrow>

   is equal to the number of elements of the real i th cluster which are
   also present in the j th cluster found by the algorithm. starting from
   these assumptions, the normalized mutual information is defined as

   ) the sum of the elements in the i th row (resp., j th column) of the
   confusion matrix. if the considered id91 algorithm would work
   perfectly, then for each discovered cluster j, it would exist a real
   cluster i exactly coinciding with j. in such a case, it is possible to
   show that

   is exactly equal to 1 [[119]55]. by contrast, if the clusters detected
   by the algorithm are totally independent of the real communities then
   it is possible to show that the nmi is equal to 0. the nmi, therefore,
   ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher the value, the better the id91
   algorithm performs with respect to the ground truth.

   observe that, in our scenario, we do not have at disposal any ground
   truth, given the fact that the community structure of the considered
   network is unknown and the purpose of our study was, in fact, to
   discover it. still, we can adopt the nmi to compare against each other,
   the outcome of the id91 solutions obtained by means of two
   different algorithms, taking the result of the former and using it as a
   ground truth to assess the latter, or the vice-versa.

   several variants of normalized mutual information exist: to our
   purposes, we adopted two different versions of nmi, henceforth called

   mathvariant="normal">lfk</mi> </msub> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="normal">nmi</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="normal">mgh</mi> </msub> </mrow></semantics> :math]
    - after the authors initials - presented, respectively, by
   lancichinetti, fortunato and kertesz [[120]56] and by mcdaid, greene
   and hurley [[121]57]. these two variants adopt slightly different
   id172 factors, thus they produce different (but comparable)
   results.
   applying these two versions of nmi according to the considerations
   presented above, we obtained the following results:
    1. (i)
       on the uniform sample:

     *
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="normal">nmi</mi>

       </msub> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.786</mn>
       </mrow></semantics> :math]

    1. (ii)
       on the bfs sample:

     *
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="normal">nmi</mi>
       <mi mathvariant="normal">lfk</mi> </msub> <mo
       stretchy="false">(</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="normal">fnca</mi>
       <mi mathvariant="normal">bfs</mi> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi
       mathvariant="normal">lpa</mi> <mi mathvariant="normal">bfs</mi>
       </msub> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.678</mn>
       </mrow></semantics> :math]
     *
       [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="normal">nmi</mi>
       <mi mathvariant="normal">mgh</mi> </msub> <mo

       </msub> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.648</mn>
       </mrow></semantics> :math]

   the high values obtained by using the normalized mutual information,
   which is able to better capture nuances and facets of different
   id91 solutions with respect to the much simpler binary jaccard
   coefficient adopted above, still confirm the similarity of the
   community structure discovered by the two different algorithms employed
   in our analysis.

   given the limitations imposed by the lack of a ground truth for
   real-world networks for which the community structure is unknown, the
   approaches we adopted to assess the results are only a
   best-approximation of any robust evaluation method. indeed, the problem
   of evaluating the id91 quality of real-world networks lacking of
   a ground truth is an open and urgent problem in current literature.

   in addition, recently [[122]37], in the context of detecting
   communities by adopting the network modularity as maximization
   function, a resolution limit has been put into evidence. in [[123]37],
   the authors found that modularity optimization could, depending on the
   topology of the network, cause the inability of the process of
   community detection to find communities whose size is smaller than
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mi>e</mi> <mo
   stretchy="false">/</mo> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow></semantics>
   :math]
   (i.e., in our case
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mo>   </mo> <mn>3</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>000</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   ). this reflects in another effect, that is the creation of big
   communities that include a large part of the nodes of the network,
   without affecting the global value of network modularity.

   being all the communities revealed smaller than that size and
   distributed in agreement with what already observed for other complex
   networks [[124]12], we may hypothesize that the community structure
   unveiled by the algorithm for our samples is unlikely to be affected by
   the resolution limit.

mesoscopic features of the community structure

   in the following we consider the uniform sample and the community
   structure unveiled by the lpa as yardstick for our investigation. the
   experiments discussed in the remainder of this section focus in
   particular on three aspects: (i) assessment of the mesoscopic features
   of the community structure of the network and their implications in
   terms of social dynamics; (ii) study of the connectivity among
   communities and how it reflects on users organization patterns on a
   large scale; (iii) ability of inferring additional insights by means of
   visual observation of the community structure.

   the purpose of investigating the mesoscopic features of the community
   structure of facebook includes finding patterns that emerge from the
   network structure, in particular those which are related not to
   individuals or to the overall networks, but with those aggregation
   units that are the communities among which users gather.
   to this purpose, we first discuss the degree distribution of
   communities discovered by means of our methods (i.e., fnca and lpa) in
   the uniform sample. we report figure [125]5, that shows the
   complementary cumulative degree id203 distribution (ccdf) as a
   function of the degree in the cases discussed above. the meaning of the
   complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf), defined as
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>f</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>x</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mo
   movablelimits="false">pr</mo> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi>x</mi>
   <mo>></mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics>
   :math]
   , is the id203 that a random variable x assumes values below a
   given x. analyzing these distributions we observe a very peculiar
   feature: two different regimes, tentatively
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>   </mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo><</mo>
   <mn>100</mn> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>100</mn> <mo>   </mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo><</mo>
   <mn>300</mn> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , can be identified, and a cut-off in proximity of
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>   </mo> <mn>300</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   as well. this reveals a decreasing chance of finding communities as
   their size grows, with a clear cut-off above a certain threshold.
   interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been previously observed in the
   facebook social graph [[126]44] and it has been put in correlation with
   the so-called self-organization principle observed in social networks
   [[127]58]. self-organization is the ability of individual to coordinate
   and organize in patterns or structures which are proven to be
   efficient, robust and reliable. for example, efficiency could be
   expressed in terms of minimizing costs for diffusing information
   [[128]59, [129]60], robustness could be represented by the presence of
   redundant connections that link the same groups and reliability by the
   ability of the network to well-react to errors and malfunctioning
   [[130]61   [131]63].
   [132]figure 5 figure 5
   figure 5

   this plot shows the complementary cumulative distribution function of
   the degree distribution of the meta-network of communities discovered
   by the fnca and lpa algorithms, for the uniform sample. in this kind of
   network, each node represents a community and each edge, whose weight
   is computed according to equation ([133]1), links communities whose
   members are connected in the original network. results follow a
   heavy-tailed distribution and are very similar for both algorithms.
   in the light of this observations, we tried to relate how communities
   grow with respect to their degree of connectivity. our finding are
   reported in figure [134]6. it emerges that, not only the communities
   above a certain threshold size are much less likely to happen, but also
   they are much less interconnected. in fact, we can observe that the
   average degree of communities grows proportionally to their size up to
   a cut-off value still approximately
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>   </mo> <mn>300</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   . above this threshold, larger communities become less and less
   connected with the others. this finding provides an argument in support
   to the idea that individuals in online social networks are mostly
   aggregated in small- or medium-size communities. on the other hand,
   large communities may suffer of a lack of external connectivity. the
   fact that individuals mostly aggregate in communities well-connected
   among each other without a coordinated effort is in line with the
   self-organization principle explained above.
   [135]figure 6 figure 6
   figure 6

   in this plot we show the average degree of communities expressed as a
   function of their size. it is possible to observe that the average
   degree grows proportionally to the size of the communities up to a
   certain threshold, approximately
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>   </mo> <mn>300</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   above which the average degree of the communities quickly falls off.
   interestingly, self-organization is a phenomenon which is known to
   happen in small world networks [[136]59, [137]60, [138]64, [139]65] and
   in their community structure [[140]66]. in the light of this
   assumption, we investigated the presence of the small world effect in
   the community structure of facebook. to this purpose, a reliable
   indicator of the presence of this phenomenon is the id91
   coefficient - i.e., the tendency to the creation of closed triangles
   among triads of communities. in our context, the id91 coefficient
   of a community is the ratio of the number of existing links over the
   number of possible links between the given community and its neighbors.
   given our meta-network
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>g</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mo
   stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi>v</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>e</mi> <mo
   stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , the id91 coefficient
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   of community
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo>   </mo> <mi>v</mi>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   is

   where
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>k</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   is the degree of community i.

   it can be intuitively interpreted as the id203 that, given two
   randomly chosen communities that share a common neighbor, there also
   exists a link between them. high values of average id91
   coefficient indicate that the communities are well connected among each
   other. this result would be interesting since it would indicate a
   tendency to the small world effect.
   we plotted the average id91 coefficient id203 distribution
   for the community structure in figure [141]7. from its analysis it
   emerges that the slope of this curve is smooth, which allows for a the
   existence of a high id203 of finding communities with large
   id91 coefficient, irrespectively of the number of connections
   they have with other communities.
   [142]figure 7 figure 7
   figure 7

   this figure depicts the average id91 coefficient id203
   distribution for the community meta-network computed according to fnca
   and lpa in the uniform sample. results provided by the two methods are
   comparable and the distribution of the average id91 coefficient
   as a function of the degree is broad.

   this interesting fact reflects the existence of a tight and highly
   connected core in the community structure [[143]25, [144]26]. the small
   world effect is also related to the presence of short-paths connecting
   communities. in this context, it is reasonable to suppose that,
   randomly selecting two disconnected communities, it is likely that a
   short path connecting their members exists.
   to investigate this aspect, in the following we analyze the effective
   diameter and the shortest paths distribution in the community
   structure. to this purpose, figure [145]8 reports the cumulative
   distribution function of the id203 that two arbitrary communities
   are connected in a given number of hops. the cumulative distribution
   function (cdf) defines the id203 that a random variable x assumes
   values below a given x. in that sense, from figure [146]8 it emerges^d
   that all communities are connected in a number of hops of 6, and most
   interestingly, that the highest advantage in terms of id203 gain
   of connecting two randomly chosen communities, is obtained considering
   hops of length 3.
   [147]figure 8 figure 8
   figure 8

   this plot shows the cumulative distribution function of the hops
   separating communities of the meta-network computed according to fnca
   and lpa for the uniform sample. almost the totality of communities are
   connected within 4 hops.
   this aspect is further investigated as follows: figure [148]9
   represents the id203 distribution for the shortest paths as a
   function of the path length. the interesting behavior which emerges
   from its analysis is that the shortest path id203 distribution
   reaches a peak for paths of length 2 and 3. in correspondence with this
   peak, the number of connected pairs of communities quickly grows,
   reaching the effective diameter of the networks (cf. figure [149]8).
   this findings has an important impact on the features of the overall
   social graph. in fact, if we would suppose that all nodes belonging to
   a given community are well connected each other, or even directly
   connected, this would result in a very short diameter of the social
   graph itself. in fact, there will always exist a very short path
   connecting the communities of any pair of randomly chosen members of
   the social network. interestingly, this hypothesis is substantiated by
   recent studies by facebook, who used heuristic techniques to measure
   the average diameter of the whole network [[150]18, [151]19]. their
   outcomes are very similar to our results: they estimated an average
   diameter of 4.72 while the effective diameter of the community
   structure for our uniform sample is 4.45 and 4.85, respectively for lpa
   and fnca.
   [152]figure 9 figure 9
   figure 9

   this figure displays the shortest paths id203 distribution for
   the meta-network of communities discovered by the fnca and lpa
   algorithms in the uniform sample. in agreement to figure [153]8, the
   path length peak resides between 2 and 4.
   thus, we conclude the characterization of the mesoscopic features of
   the community structure discussing the distribution of weights and
   strength of links among communities. the importance of this kind of
   analysis rises considering some social conjectures, like the
   granovetter   s strength of weak ties theory [[154]24], that rely on the
   assessment of the strength of links in social networks. to this
   purpose, we resemble that the strength
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msup> <mi>s</mi> <mi>  </mi> </msup> <mo
   stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi>v</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   (or weighted degree) of a given node v is determined as the sum of the
   weights of all edges incident on v, defined as
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msup> <mi>s</mi> <mi>  </mi> </msup> <mo

   where
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>  </mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>e</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   is the weight of a given edge e and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>v</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   the set of edges incident on v.
   in figure [155]10, we plotted the id203 distribution of both
   weight and strength on links among communities. interestingly, the
   distribution of weights is defined by a power law
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>x</mi> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <msup> <mi>x</mi>

   described by a coefficient
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>  </mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1.45</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   . the strength distribution is still broad but it is possible to
   observe two different regimes, in the intervals of tentatively
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>   </mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo><</mo>

   .
   [156]figure 10 figure 10
   figure 10

   this plot shows the id203 distributions of weight and strength of
   edges of the meta-network of communities discovered by fnca and lpa in
   the uniform sample. the distribution of weights is scale-free and,
   regarding strength we can identify two different regimes.

   given the definition of weights for the community meta-network, as in
   equation ([157]1) (i.e., the sum of total number of edges connecting
   all users belonging to the two connected communities), we can suggest
   the hypothesis that there exists a high id203 of finding a large
   number of pairs of communities whose members are not directly
   connected, and a increasingly smaller number of pairs of communities
   whose members are highly connected each other. these connections, which
   are usually referred as to weak ties, according to the strength of weak
   ties theory [[158]24], are characterized by a smaller strength but a
   hightened tendency to proficiently connect communities otherwise
   disconnected. this aspect is further discussed in the following.

connectivity among communities

   the last experiment discussed in this paper is devoted to understanding
   the density of links connecting communities in facebook. in particular,
   we are interested in defining to what extent links connect communities
   of comparable or different size. to do so, we considered each edge in
   the community meta-network and we computed the size of the community to
   which the source node of the edge belonged to. similarly, we computed
   the size of the target community.^e
   figure [159]11 represents a id203 density map of the distribution
   of edges among communities. first, we highlight that the map is
   symmetric with respect to the diagonal, according to the fact that the
   graph is undirected and each edge is counted twice, once for each
   end-vertex. from the analysis of this figure, it emerges that edges
   mainly connect two types of communities: (i) communities of small size,
   each other - this is the most common case; (ii) communities of small
   size with communities of large size - less likely to happen but still
   significant.
   [160]figure 11 figure 11
   figure 11

   this heat-map shows the id203 distribution map of links between
   communities of different size, computed by lpa in the uniform sample.
   it emerges the tendency of communities of smaller size to be strongly
   interconnected among each other.

   this can be intuitively explained since the number of communities of
   small size is much greater than the number of large communities. on the
   other hand, it is an important finding since similar results have been
   recently described for twitter [[161]21], in the context of the
   evaluation of the granovetter   s strength of weak ties theory
   [[162]24].^f

   in fact, according to this theory, weak links typically occur among
   communities that do not share a large amount of neighbors, and are
   important to keep the network proficiently connected.

inter and intra-community links

   for further analysis, we evaluated the amount of edges that fall in
   each given community with respect to its size. the results of this
   assessment are reported in figure [163]12. the interpretation of this
   plot is the following: on the y-axis it is represented the fraction of
   edges per community as a function of the size of the community itself,
   reported on the x-axis. it emerges that also the distribution of the
   link fraction against the size of the communities follows a power law
   with an exponent equal to
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2.45</mn>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   . this result shows that small communities are also more internally
   dense, while larger communities exhibit less internal connectivity -
   decreasing according to their size. indeed, this result is different
   from that recently proved for twitter [[164]21], in which a
   gaussian-like distribution has been discovered. this is probably due to
   the intrinsic characteristics of the networks, that are topologically
   dissimilar (i.e., twitter is represented by a directed graph with
   multiple type of edges) and also the interpretation itself of social
   tie is different. in fact, twitter represents in a way hierarchical
   connections - in the form of follower and followed users - while
   facebook tries to reflects a friendship social structure which better
   represents the community structure of real social networks.
   [165]figure 12 figure 12
   figure 12

   this figure depicts the id203 distribution of the fraction of
   inter-community edges ( i.e. , those edges that connects communities
   among each other) as a function of the size of the communities,
   according to the lpa community detection algorithm applied on the
   uniform sample. in agreement with figure [166]11, a scale-free behavior
   emerges, highlighting that the majority of edges connects among each
   other communities of small size.

   the emergence of this scaling law is interesting with regard to the
   organization patterns that are reflected by individuals participating
   to large social networks. in fact, it seems that users that constitute
   small communities are generally very well connected to other
   communities and among each others, while large communities of
   individuals seem to be linked in a less efficient way to other
   communities - and also less dense of links. this is reflected by the
   small number of weak ties incident on communities of large size with
   respect to the number of individuals they gather. these findings are
   relevant since they provide a clue that individuals are able to
   self-organize even in large networks and without a coordinated effort.
   this might improve their ability to efficiently get in touch and
   communicate with a number of users larger than their friends or
   acquaintances.

visual observation of the community meta-network

   the visual analysis of large-scale networks is usually unfeasible when
   managing samples whose size is in the order of millions of entities.
   even though, by adopting our technique of building a community
   meta-network, it is yet possible to study the mesoscopic features of
   the facebook social network from an unprecedented perspective. to this
   purpose, for example, social network analysts may be able to infer
   additional insights about the structure of the original network from
   the visual analysis of its community structure.
   in figure [167]13, obtained by using cvis^g - a hierarchical-based
   circular visualization algorithm - we represent the community structure
   unveiled by lpa in the uniform sample. from its analysis, it is
   possible to appreciate the existence of a tight core of communities
   which occupy a central position into the meta-network [[168]25,
   [169]26]. a further inspection of the features of these communities
   revealed that their positioning is generally irrespective of their
   size. this means that there are several different small communities
   which play a dominant role in the network. this is in agreement with
   previous findings and highlight the role of self-organization on such a
   scale. similar considerations hold for the periphery of the network,
   which is constituted both by small and larger communities.
   [170]figure 13 figure 13
   figure 13

   this figure displays the outcome of a hierarchical-based circular
   visualization algorithm that represents the community structure
   unveiled by lpa in the uniform sample. it emerges the existence of a
   tight core of communities which occupy a central position into the
   meta-network, generally irrespectively of their size.

   finally, we highlight the presence of so-called weak ties, that
   proficiently connect communities that otherwise would be far each
   other. in particular, those that connect communities in the core with
   communities in the periphery of the network, according to the strength
   of weak ties theory [[171]24], might represent the most important
   patterns along which communications flow, enhancing users ability of
   getting in touch with each other, efficiently spreading information,
   and so on.

[172]discussion

   this work concludes putting into evidence implications, strength and
   limitations of our study.

   first of all, in this paper we put into evidence that the community
   structure of the facebook social network presents a broad distribution
   of the dimension of the communities, similarly to other complex
   networks [[173]12]. this result is independent with respect to the
   algorithm adopted to discover the community structure, and even (but in
   a less evident way) to the sampling methodology adopted to collect the
   samples. on the other hand, this is the first experimental work that
   proves the hypothesis, theoretically advanced by [[174]36], of the
   possible bias towards high degree nodes introduced by the bfs sampling
   methodology for incomplete sampling of large networks.

   regarding the qualitative analysis of our results, it emerges that the
   communities share a high degree of similarity among different samples.

   the analysis of the community meta-network puts into evidence different
   mesoscopic features. we discovered that the average degree of
   communities average degree of communities and their size put into
   evidence the tendency to self-organization of users into small- or
   medium-size communities well-connected among each other.

   our further analysis highlights that there exists a tendency to the
   creation of short-paths (whose length mainly consists of two or three
   hops), that proficiently connect the majority of the communities
   existing in the network. this finally led us to the identification of
   links connecting communities otherwise disconnected, that we called
   weak ties in the granovetter   s sense [[175]24].

results in context with previous literature

   several recent studies focused on the analysis of the community
   structure of different social networks [[176]12, [177]13, [178]40,
   [179]67]. an in-depth analysis of the facebook collegiate networks has
   been carried out in [[180]13]. authors considered data collected from 5
   american colleges and examined how the online social lives reflect the
   real social structure. they proved that the analysis of the community
   structure of online social networks is fundamental to obtain additional
   insights about the prominent motivations which underly the community
   creation in the corresponding real world. moreover, authors found that
   the facebook social network shows a very tight community structure, and
   exhibits high values of network modularity. some of their findings are
   confirmed in this study on a large scale.

   recently [[181]12], it has been put into evidence that the community
   structure of social networks shares similarities with communication and
   biological networks. the authors investigated several mesoscopic
   features of different networks, such as community size distribution,
   density of communities and the average shortest path length, finding
   that these features are very characteristic of the network nature.
   according to their findings, we assessed that also facebook is
   well-described by some specific characteristics on a mesoscopic level.

   regarding the mesoscale structure analysis of social networks,
   [[182]40] provided a study by comparing three state-of-the-art methods
   to detect the community structure on large networks. an interesting
   aspect considered in that work is that two of the three considered
   methods can detect overlapping communities, so that a differential
   analysis has been carried out by the authors. they focused on the
   analysis of several mesoscopic features such as the community size and
   density distribution and the neighborhood overlapping. in addition,
   they verified that results obtained by the analysis of synthetic
   networks are profoundly different from those obtained by analyzing
   real-world datasets, in particular regarding the community structure,
   putting into evidence the emergence of need of studying online social
   networks acquiring data from the real platforms. their findings are
   also confirmed in this study, in which we acquired a sample of the
   social graph directly from the facebook platform.

   an interesting work which is closely related to this study regards the
   assessment of the strength of weak ties theory in the context of
   twitter [[183]21]. in that work, it emerges that one of the roles of
   weak ties is to connect small communities of acquaintances which are
   not that close to belong to the same community but, on the other hand,
   are somehow proficiently in contact. clues in this direction come also
   from this study, although the two networks exhibit different
   topological features (i.e., twitter is represented by a directed graph
   with multiple type of edges) and also carry a different interpretation
   of the social connections themselves. in fact, social ties in twitter
   represent hierarchical connections (in the form of follower and
   followed users), while facebook tries to reflects a friendship social
   structure which better represents the community structure of real-world
   social networks.

   concluding, recently [[184]67] the perspective of the study of the
   community structure has been revisited considering the problem of the
   detecting communities of edges instead of the classical communities of
   nodes. in this approach we observe an interesting feature, i.e., that
   link communities intrinsically incorporate the concept of overlap. the
   authors findings are applied to large social networks of mobile phone
   calls confirming the emergence of scale free distributions also for
   link community structures. similar studies could be extended to online
   social networks like facebook, in order to investigating the existence
   of particular communication patterns or motifs.

strength and limitations of this study

   in the following we discuss the main strengths and limitations of this
   study. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
   investigates the general mesoscopic structure of a large online social
   network. this is particularly interesting since it is opposed to just
   trying to identify dense clusters in large communities, which is the
   aim of different works discussed above.

   this work highlights the possibility of inferring characteristics
   describing the organization patterns of users of large social networks,
   analyzing some mesoscopic features that arise from a statistical and
   topological investigation. this kind of analysis has been recently
   carried out for some types of social media platforms (such as twitter
   [[185]21]) which capture different nuances of relations (for example,
   hierarchical follower-followed user relations), but there was a lack in
   literature regarding online social network platforms reflecting
   friendship relations, such as facebook. this work, that tries to fill
   this gap, provides results that well relate with those presented in
   recent literature, and describes novel insights on the problem of
   characterizing social network structure on the large scale.

   we can already envision two limitations of this work, which leave space
   for further investigation. first, our sample purely relies on binary
   friendship relations, which represent the simplest way to capture the
   concept of friendship on facebook. on the other hand, there could be
   more refined representations of the facebook social graph, such as
   taking into consideration the frequency of interaction among
   individuals of the network, to weight the importance of each tie. to
   this purpose, the feasibility of this study is complicated by the
   privacy issues deriving from accessing private information about users
   habits (such as the frequency of interaction with their friends), which
   limit our range of study.

   depending on this aspect, the second shortcoming of this study rises.
   in detail, the fact that we were concerned with the analysis of
   publicly accessible profiles implies that our sample only reproduces a
   partial picture of the facebook social network which could slightly
   vary with respect to the overall social graph. to this purpose, another
   aspect which deserves more investigation is understanding how the
   incompleteness of the sampling affects the characteristics of the
   community structure.

conclusions

   the aim of this work was to investigate the emergence of social
   dynamics, organization patterns and mesoscopic features in the
   community structure of a large online social network such as facebook.
   this task was quite thrilling and not trivial, since a number of
   theoretical and computational challenges raised.

   first of all, we collected real-world data directly from the online
   network. in fact, as recently put into evidence in literature
   [[186]40], the differences between synthetic and real-world data have
   profound implications on results.
   after we reconstructed a sample of the structure of the social graph of
   facebook, we unveiled its community structure. the main findings that
   emerged from the mesoscopic analysis of the community structure of this
   network can be summarized as follows:
    1. (i)
       we assessed the tendency of online social network users to
       constitute communities of small size, proving the presence of a
       decreasing number of communities of larger size. this behavior
       explains the tendency of users to self-organization even in absence
       of a coordinated effort.

    2. (ii)
       we investigated the occurrence of connections among communities,
       finding that some kind of links, commonly referred as to weak ties,
       are more relevant than others because they connect communities each
       other, according to the granovetter   s strength of weak ties theory
       [[187]24] and in agreement with recent studies on other online
       social networks such as twitter [[188]21].

    3. (iii)
       the community structure is highly clusterized and the diameter of
       the community structure meta-network is small (approximately around
       4 and 5). these aspects indicate the presence of the small world
       phenomenon, which characterizes real-world social networks,
       according to sociological studies envisioned by milgram [[189]23]
       and in agreement with some heuristic evaluations recently provided
       by facebook [[190]18, [191]19].

   the achieved results open space for further studies in different
   directions. as far as it concerns our long-term future research
   directions, we plan to investigate, amongst others, the following
   issues:
    1. (i)
       devising a model to identify the most representative users inside
       each given community. this would leave space for further
       interesting applications, such as the maximization of advertising
       on online social networks, the analysis of communication dynamics,
       spread of influence and information and so on.

   (ii) exploiting geographical data regarding the physical location of
   users of facebook, to study the effect of strong and weak ties in the
   society [[192]24]. in fact, is it known that a relevant additional
   source of information is represented by the geographical distribution
   of individuals [[193]68   [194]70]. for example, we suppose that strong
   ties could reflect relations characterized by physical closeness, while
   weak ties could be more appropriate to represent connections among
   physically distant individuals.

   (iii) concluding, we devised a strategy to estimate the strength of
   ties between social network users [[195]71] and we want to study its
   application to online social networks on a large scale. in the case of
   social ties, this is equivalent to estimate the friendship degree
   between a pair of users by considering their interactions and their
   attitude to exchange information.

[196]appendix

   in this appendix we shortly discuss the background in community
   detection algorithms and explain the functioning of the two community
   detection methods adopted during our experimentation, namely lpa and
   fnca.

community detection in complex networks

   the problem of discovering the community structure of a network has
   been approached in several different ways. a common formulation of this
   problem is to find a partitioning
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>v</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mo
   stretchy="false">(</mo> <msub> <mi>v</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>   </mo>

   of disjoint subsets of vertices of the graph

   stretchy="false">(</mo> <mi>v</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>e</mi> <mo
   stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow></semantics> :math]
   representing the network (in which the vertices represent the users of
   the network and the edges represent their social ties) in a meaningful
   manner.
   the most popular quantitative measure to prove the existence of an
   emergent community structure in a network, called network modularity,
   has been proposed by girvan and newman [[197]50, [198]51]. it is
   defined as the sum of the difference between the fraction of edges
   falling in each given community and the expected fraction if they were
   randomly distributed. let consider a network which has been partitioned
   into m communities; its value of network modularity is
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>q</mi> <mo>=</mo> <munderover> <mo

   (6)

   assuming
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>l</mi> <mi>s</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   the number of edges between vertices belonging to the s th community
   and
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>d</mi> <mi>s</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the s th community. high
   values of q imply high values of
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <msub> <mi>l</mi> <mi>s</mi> </msub>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   for each discovered community. in that case, detected communities are
   dense within their structure and weakly coupled among each other.

   partitioning a network in disjoint subsets may arise some difficulties.
   in fact, each user in the network possibly belongs to several different
   communities; the problem of overlapping community detection has
   recently received a lot of attention (see [[199]34]). moreover, may
   exist networks in which a certain individual may not belong to any
   group, remaining isolated, as recently put into evidence by hunter et
   al. [[200]16]. such a case commonly happens in real and online social
   networks, as reported by recent social studies [[201]72].

community detection techniques

   in its general formulation, the problem of finding communities in a
   network is solvable assigning each vertex of the network to a cluster,
   in a meaningful way. there exist different paradigms to solve this
   problem, such as the spectral id91 [[202]73, [203]74] which
   relies on optimizing the process of cutting the graph, and the network
   modularity maximization methods.

   regarding spectral id91 techniques, they have an important
   limitation. they require a prior knowledge on the network, to define
   the number of communities present in the network and their size. this
   makes them unsuitable if the aim is to unveil the unknown community
   structure of a given network.

   as for network modularity maximization techniques, the task of
   maximizing the objective function q has been proved np-hard [[204]75],
   thus several heuristic techniques have been presented during the last
   years. the girvan-newman algorithm [[205]50, [206]51, [207]76] is an
   example. it exploits the assumption that it is possible to maximize the
   value of q deleting edges with a high value of betweenness, starting
   from the intuition that they connect vertices belonging to different
   communities. unfortunately, the cost of this algorithm is
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mi>o</mi> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo> <msup>
   <mi>n</mi> <mn>3</mn> </msup> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]
   , being n the number of vertices in the network; it is unsuitable for
   large-scale networks. a tremendous amount of improved versions of this
   approach have been provided in the last years and are extensively
   discussed in [[208]30, [209]31].

   from a computational perspective, some of the state-of-the-art
   algorithms are louvain method [[210]77, [211]78], lpa [[212]48,
   [213]79], fnca [[214]49] and a voltage-based divisive method [[215]80].
   all these algorithms provide with near linear computational costs.

   recently, the problem of discovering the community structure in a
   network including the possibility of finding overlapping nodes
   belonging to different communities at the same time, has acquired a lot
   of attention by the scientists because of the seminal paper presented
   by palla et al. [[216]81]. a lot of efforts have been spent in order to
   advance novel possible strategies. for example, an interesting approach
   has been proposed by gregory [[217]82], that is based on an extension
   of the label propagation algorithm adopted in this work. on the other
   hand, an approach in which the hierarchical id91 is instrumental
   to find the overlapping community structure has been proposed by
   lancichinetti et al. [[218]56, [219]83].

label propagation algorithm (lpa)

   the lpa (label propagation algorithm) [[220]48] is a near linear time
   algorithm for community detection. its functioning is very simple,
   considered its computational efficiency. lpa uses only the network
   structure as its guide, is optimized for large-scale networks, does not
   follow any pre-defined objective function and does not require any
   prior information about the communities. labels represent unique
   identifiers, assigned to each vertex of the network.

   its functioning is reported as described in [[221]48]:

   step 1 to initialize, each vertex is given a unique label;

   step 2 repeatedly, each vertex updates its label with the one used by
   the greatest number of neighbors. if more than one label is used by the
   same maximum number of neighbors, one is chosen randomly. after several
   iterations, the same label tends to become associated with all the
   members of a community;

   step 3 vertices labeled alike are added to one community.

   authors themselves proved that this process, under specific conditions,
   could not converge. in order to avoid deadlocks and to guarantee an
   efficient network id91, we accept their suggestion to adopt an
   asynchronous update of the labels, considering the values of some
   neighbors at the previous iteration and some at the current one. this
   precaution ensures the convergence of the process, usually in few
   steps. raghavan et al. [[222]48] ensure that five iterations are
   sufficient to correctly classify 95% of vertices of the network. after
   some experimentation, we found that this forecast is too optimistic,
   thus we elevated the maximum number of iterations to 50, finding a good
   compromise between quality of results and amount of time required for
   computation.

   a characteristic of this approach is that it produces groups that are
   not necessarily contiguous, thus it could exist a path connecting a
   pair of vertices in a group passing through vertices belonging to
   different groups. although in our case this condition would be
   acceptable, we adopted the suggestion of the authors to devise a final
   step to split the groups into one or more contiguous communities.

   the authors proved its near linear computational cost [[223]48].

fast network community algorithm (fnca)

   fnca (fast network community algorithm) [[224]49] is a modularity
   maximization algorithm for community detection, optimized for
   large-scale social networks.

   we convert equation ([226]7) to equation ([227]8), which takes the
   function q as the sum of functions f of all nodes. the function f can
   be regarded as the difference between the number of edges that fall
   within communities and the expected number of edges that fall within
   communities, from the local angle of any node in the network. the
   function f of each node can measure whether a network division
   indicates a strong community structure from its local point of view

   the authors [[228]49] proved that: (i) any node in a network can
   evaluate its function f only by using local information (the
   information of its community); (ii) if the variety of some nodes label
   results in the increase of its function f and the labels of the other
   nodes do not change, the function q of the whole network will increase
   too. the community detection algorithm used is based on these
   assumptions. it makes each node maximize its own function f by using
   local information in the sight of local view, which will then achieve
   the goal that optimize the function q.

   moreover, in complex networks with a community structure, holds true
   the intuition that any node should have the same label with one of its
   neighbors or it is itself a cluster. therefore, each node does not need
   to compute its function f for all the labels at each iteration, but
   just for the labels of its neighbors. this improvement not only
   decreases the time complexity of the algorithm, but also makes it able
   to optimize the function q by using only local information of the
   network community structure.

   it has been proved that this algorithm, under certain conditions, could
   not quickly converge, thus we introduced an iteration number limitation
   t as additional termination condition. experimental results show that,
   the id91 solution of fnca is good enough before 50 iterations for
   most large-scale networks. therefore, iteration number limitation t is
   set at 50 in all the experiments in this paper. authors proved the near
   linear cost of this algorithm [[229]49].

   to this regard, we put into evidence that the x-axis is reversed and we
   recall that the diameter of the considered community structures is 4.45
   and 4.85, respectively for lpa and fnca.

   we recall that, being the network model adopted undirected, the meaning
   of source and target node is only instrumental to identify the

   the roles of weak ties is to connect small communities of acquaintances
   which are not that close to belong to the same community but, on the
   other hand, are somehow proficiently in contact.
