abstract     several characteristics of written texts have been inferred from statistical analysis
derived from networked models. even though many network measurements have been adapted
to study textual properties at several levels of complexity, some textual aspects have been disre-
garded. in this paper, we study the symmetry of word adjacency networks, a well-known represen-
tation of text as a graph. a statistical analysis of the symmetry distribution performed in several
novels showed that most of the words do not display symmetric patterns of connectivity. more
speci   cally, the merged symmetry displayed a distribution similar to the ubiquitous power-law
distribution. our experiments also revealed that the studied metrics do not correlate with other
traditional network measurements, such as the degree or betweenness centrality. the e   ective-
ness of the symmetry measurements was veri   ed in the authorship attribution task. interestingly,
we found that speci   c authors prefer particular types of symmetric motifs. as a consequence,
the authorship of books could be accurately identi   ed in 82.5% of the cases, in a dataset com-
prising books written by 8 authors. because the proposed measurements for text analysis are
complementary to the traditional approach, they can be used to improve the characterization of
text networks, which might be useful for applications such as identi   cation of topical words and
information retrieval.

introduction.     in recent years, network science has
become commonplace. many real systems such as the in-
ternet, social networks and transportation systems have
increasingly been studied via networked models [1]. be-
cause language is organized by rules and relationships be-
tween words in a complex way, it can also be represented
as networks. in this case, words are connected according
to syntactical or semantical relationships [2]. the use of
the network framework not only allowed for a better un-
derstanding of the origins and organization of language [2],
but also improved the performance of several natural pro-
cessing language tasks, including e.g. the automatic sum-
marization of texts [3], the identi   cation of word senses [4]
and the classi   cation of syntactical complexity [5].

many measurements proposed for analyzing complex

networks have been reinterpreted when applied to analyze
linguistic features. centrality measurements, for exam-
ple, have been useful to identify core concepts and key-
words, which in turn have allowed the improvement of
summarization and classi   cation tasks [3]. while a myr-
iad of measurements have been adapted to probe tex-
tual patterns, only a limited number of studies have been
devoted to devise novel network measurements that are
able to identify more complex linguistic patterns. par-
ticularly, a relevant pattern that has not been addressed
by networked-linguistic models is the quanti   cation of the
heterogeneity of speci   c textual distributions. this is the
case of the spatial distribution of words along the text,
which has been mainly studied in terms of the burstiness
(or intermittency) of time series [6]. another interest-

p-1

ing pattern concerns the uneven distribution of the num-
ber of distinct neighbors of words [7].
in this context,
we introduce two network measurements to quantify the
heterogeneity of accessing words neighbors in word adja-
cency networks. as we shall show, the adopted measure-
ments, henceforth referred to as symmetry measurements,
are able to characterize authors    stylistic marks, since dis-
tinct authors display speci   c bias towards particular net-
work motifs. in addition to being useful to improve the
characterization of word adjacency networks, we found out
that the symmetry measurements do not correlate with
other traditional network measurements. therefore, they
could be useful to complement the characterization of text
networks in its several levels of complexity.

methods.     in this section, we describe the formation
word adjacency networks from raw books. the symmetry
measurements, namely backbone and merged symmetry
are then described. furthermore, we present a short in-
troduction to the pattern recognition methods employed
in this study.

word adjacency networks. written texts can be mod-
eled as networks in several ways [2]. if one aims at grasping
stylistic textual features, networks generated from syntac-
tical analysis can be employed [3, 8]. another possibility
is to map texts into a word adjacency network (wan),
which links adjacent words [9, 11, 12]. actually, wans
can be considered as an extension of the syntactical model
since most of the syntactical links occur between adjacent
words [8]. because syntax depends upon the language,
wans have also proven useful to capture language depen-
dent features [13].

to construct a word adjacency network, some pre-
processing steps are usually applied. first, stopwords
such as articles and prepositions are removed because such
words convey no semantic information. therefore, they
can be modeled as edges in the wan model because stop-
words usually play the role of linking content words. in
order to represent as a single node the words that refer
to the same concept, the text undergoes a lemmatization
process. hence, nouns and verbs are mapped to their sin-
gular and in   nitive forms, respectively. to minimize the
errors arising from the lemmatization, before this step,
all words are labeled with their part-of-speech [14].
in
the current study, the maximum-id178 model devised
in [15] was used to perform the part-of-speech labeling.
after the lemmatization and the removal of the stopwords,
each distinct word is mapped into a node and edges are
created between adjacent words. further details regarding
the wan model can be found in [9].

symmetry in networks.

symmetry is one of the most
fundamental aspects of complex systems, naturally emerg-
ing from physical spatial restrictions and laws [16], self
organization [17], biological structures [18], and chemical
reactions [19], etc. written texts bear no exception to
this rule, presenting intrinsic patterns of symmetry. in a
sentence, for instance, some words can be exchanged by

synonyms without compromising its original meaning. in
a similar fashion, some grammatical constructions are also
interchangeable. aside from restrictions conveying seman-
tic relationships and grammatical rules, authors also tend
to employ additional restrictions in their works, which in
turn a   ects their written style. whenever texts are repre-
sented by networks, it is expected that such styles may be
re   ected on the symmetrical characteristics of its topolog-
ical structure.

while the concept of symmetry in id207 is
tightly related to the problem of    nding and counting au-
tomorphisms, this approach cannot be straightforwardly
extended to study most of real complex networks [20]. re-
cently, practical de   nitions of symmetries for real networks
have been proposed in the literature. they include path
similarity techniques [20], the methods based on quantum
walks [21] and concentric rings [22]. the latter presents
some advantages over the other strategies. for example,
the symmetry can be calculated locally around nodes in
a multiscale fashion, de   ned in terms of node centered
subgraphs referred to as concentric patterns conceptually
linked to the concentric levels of a node. the concentric
level   h(i) is de   ned as the set of nodes h hops away from
the original node i and the concentric l-pattern is the sub-
graph comprising only nodes located l or less hops away

from i, i.e., nodes in the set(cid:83)l

h=0   h(i).

the concentric symmetry approach is based on the ac-
cessibility measurement [23], which is calculated as a nor-
malization of the id178 obtained from the transition
probabilities for a network walk dynamics, such as the
traditional random walk or self-avoiding random walk. in
particular, the symmetry is obtained considering a very
special case of walk dynamics in which an agent never
goes back to a node belonging to a lower concentric level.
however, to account for the degeneracy caused by con-
nections between nodes in the same concentric level, two
transformations of concentric patterns were proposed, re-
sulting in two types of symmetry measurements: backbone
and merged symmetries. the backbone symmetry, sb, is
loosely based on the concept of radial symmetry, in which
edges among nodes in the same concentric level are re-
moved for the pattern. di   erently, the merged symmetry,
sm, that bears some resemblance with angular symmetry,
is obtained from patterns by e   ectively merging nodes in
the same concentric level.
in both cases, the symmetry
measurements sh for level h centered on i are calculated
from the shannon id178 hh of the transition probabili-
ties ph(i     j). more speci   cally,

fig. 1: example illustrating the calculation of the backbone and merged symmetries for two concentric 2-patterns. the numbers
next to each node account for the transition probabilities and colors indicate the respective concentric level of a node (blue
for level 0, orange for level 1 and green for level 2) [10]. red self loops indicate a dead end. both transformations of patterns
are shown. the backbone pattern is obtained by removing edges connecting nodes at the same level from the original pattern,
whereas merged patterns are weighted subgraphs created by merging nodes originally connected at the same concentric level.
in this case, the weight corresponds to the number of connections spanning from the nodes that were merged to each node in
other concentric levels. note that the pattern in the left panel only presents merged asymmetry, while the pattern in the right
panel presents both types of asymmetry, which is also con   rmed by the symmetry values.

pattern recognition methods.

pattern recognition
methods are useful to identify patterns and infer classi-
   ers [24]. particularly, in this study, pattern recognition
methods were applied to recognize patterns in the distri-
bution of symmetry measurements across distinct authors.
four pattern recognition methods were employed: support
vector machines (id166), multilayer id88 (mlp),
nearest neighbors (knn) and naive bayes (nby). these
four methods were chosen because they usually display a
good overall performance [25]. an introduction to these
methods can be found in [25, 26]. we also provide a very
short introduction to these methods in the supplementary
information1.

results and discussion.     this section is divided
in two subsections. firstly, we study the statistical prop-
erties of symmetry measurements in word adjacency net-
works. we then show how the symmetry of speci   c words
can be employed to discriminate authors    styles. the list
of books employed in the experiments is shown in table
s1 of the supplementary information.

properties of merged and backbone symmetry in word
adjacency networks. we start the investigation of the
statistical properties of symmetry measurements in tex-
tual networks by analyzing the distribution of symmetry
values in real networks formed from books. here we focus
our discussion on the book    adventures of sally   , by p.g.
wodehouse. notwithstanding, all discussion henceforth
applies to the other books of the dataset. concerning the
merged symmetry, all books displayed a id203 den-

p (sm) (cid:39) a1     a2

1 + (sm/s0)p + a2,

(2)

where a1, a2, s0 and p are constant. according to the
equation 2, high values of symmetry are very rare. this is
similar to other well-known distributions in texts, such as
the frequency distribution given by the zipf   s law [27].
fig. 2 illustrates the histogram of symmetry distribu-
tion obtained for the book    adventures of sally   , by p.w.
wodehouse. for this book in particular, the p.d.f of the
merged symmetry in equation 2 can be written as

p (sm) (cid:39)

where a = 1.0136, s0 = 0.0136 and p = 1.25348. the high

of chi-square (  2 = 1.43261   10   5) con   rm the adehenrece
of the    tting.

unlike the merged symmetry, the backbone counterpart
displayed a distribution of values with two typical peaks,
as revealed by fig. 2 (see left panel). the    rst peak of
distribution occurs around sb (cid:39) 0.3. while low values
of backbone symmetry are very rare, high values are fre-
quent, especially on the less frequent words. this occurs
because smaller (or lowly connected) concentric patterns
are more unlikely to accumulate enough imperfections over
the concentric levels to attain very low symmetry values.
on the other hand, larger patterns do not present such
constraints and can attain many distinct levels of symme-
try.

while several traditional centrality network measure-
ments correlate with the node degree, the proposed sym-
metry measurements for text analysis usually do not yield
a strong correlation with the connectivity of nodes. in ta-
bles 1 and 2, we show, in the same row, words with sim-
ilar degree taking very discrepant values of merged and

at the second level seems to follow a logistic function (see equa-

books of the dataset.

backbone symmetries. for example, in table 2, the words
bathing and mother occur with the same frequency; how-
ever, the respective values of backbone symmetry are quite
discrepant. as a matter of fact, the access to the second
level neighbors is much more regular for the word mother,
as it backbone symmetry is close to the maximum possible
value, i.e. max(sb) = 1.

the correlation between symmetry and other tradi-
tional topological measurements were also investigated.
according to fig. 3, there is no consistent, signi   cant
correlation between symmetry and other network mea-
surements. this means that the values of both merged
and backbone symmetry cannot be mimicked by other well
known network measurements. therefore, the symmetry
measurements provide novel information for network anal-
ysis.

authorship recognition via network symmetry.

in this
section, we exemplify the discriminability power of sym-
metry measurements in word adjacency networks. more
speci   cally, we show that the symmetry os speci   c words is
able to identify the writing style of distinct authors. in the

fig. 3: pearson correlation coe   cients between symmetry and
other traditional network measurements. note that, in general,
there is a weak correlation between symmetry and other mea-
surements. the correlations were obtained from the word adja-
cency network obtained from the book    adventures of sally   ,
by p.g. wodehouse.

context of information sciences, the authorship recognition
task is relevant because it can be useful to classify liter-
ary manuscripts [28] and intercept terrorist messages [29].
traditional features employed for stylometric analysis in-
clude simple statistics such as the average length and fre-
quency of words [30], richness of vocabulary size [30] and
burstiness indexes [7].

to evaluate the ability of the symmetry measurements
to recognize particular authors    styles, we used a dataset
of 40 books written by 8 authors (see table s1 of the
supplementary information). as features for the classi-
   cation task, both merged and backbone symmetry were
computed for the 229 words appearing in all books of the
dataset. to automatically recognize and classify the pat-
terns displayed by each author, we used the four pattern
recognition techniques described in the methodology. the
accuracy rates in identifying the correct author are shown
in table 3. with regard to the performance of the pat-
tern recognition methods, the best results were obtained
with the id166 and mlp methods. when the symmetry
was computed considering the second level of neighbors

(h = 2), the best accuracy rate achieved was 75.0% (this
corresponds to a p-value lower than 1.0  10   15). both sym-
metries measurements calculated at the third level did not
increase the best classi   cation performance obtained with
h = 2. a minor improvement in performance occurred
when the fourth level was included in the analysis. the
best accuracy rate increased from 75.0% to 82.5%. we also
probed the performance of the classi   cation by combining
di   erent levels as features. in this case, the performance
did not improve (result not shown). all in all, these re-
sults con   rms the suitability of symmetry measurements
to identify the subtleties of authors    styles in terms of the
homogeneity of accessibility of neighbors.

symmetry measurements are robust in the sense that they
do not mimic the behavior of other traditional topological
measurements. thus, because symmetry measurements
do not strongly correlate with other traditional network or
textual features, they could be combined with other mea-
surements to improve the characterization of texts rep-
resented as graphs and related networked systems. the
proposed symmetry measurements were also evaluated in
the context of the authorship recognition task. the re-
sults revealed that the symmetry of speci   c words is able
to identify the authorship of books with high accuracy
rates. this result con   rms the suitability of the measure-
ments to detect the subtleties of authors    styles re   ected
on the organization of word adjacency networks. in future
works, we intend to study the suitability of both backbone
and merged symmetry in semantical networks, which may
ultimately lead to the improvement of several semantical-
related applications.

to understand the patterns behind the high discrim-
inability rates found in table 3 we show some visualiza-
tions obtained for two words,    time    and    indeed   , in
fig. 4. we chose these words because they were able
discriminate among a few groups of authors while also
presenting a wide range of symmetry values. the pat-
terns obtained for the word    time    are arranged along the
top of the corresponding axis according to their respective
merged symmetry, which was found to separate arthur
conan doyle, thomas hardy and charles darwin. note
that the nodes with low merged symmetry presented sev-
eral edges crossing over the internal shell of its patterns.
additionally, connections between nodes lying at the third
concentric level are much less organized, hence the low
values of symmetry. conversely, nodes taking high values
of symmetry displayed more organized connections, lead-
ing to higher uniformity of connections among nodes lying
at the farthest concentric level. the same observations
can be made for the patterns obtained for the word    in-
deed   , which discriminated between hector hugh munro
and the group of authors encompassing arthur conan
doyle, bram stoker, thomas hardy and charles dickens.
still, however, these patterns are much more symmetric,
which is once again re   ected in the visualizations by their
higher organization on the last concentric level.

conclusion.     in this paper, we have introduced the
concept of symmetry to study the connectivity patterns
of word association networks. by de   ning symmetry as a
function of particular id93, we showed that the
