abstract   in this paper, we study the sensitivity of the spectral
id91 based community detection algorithm subject to a
erdos-renyi type random noise model. we prove phase transi-
tions in community detectability as a function of the external edge
connection id203 and the noisy edge presence id203
under a general network model where two arbitrarily connected
communities are interconnected by random external edges.
speci   cally, the community detection performance transitions
from almost perfect detectability to low detectability as the inter-
community edge connection id203 exceeds some critical
value. we derive upper and lower bounds on the critical value and
show that the bounds are identical when the two communities
have the same size. the phase transition results are validated
using network simulations. using the derived expressions for the
phase transition threshold we propose a method for estimating
this threshold from observed data.

i. introduction

community detection is a graph signal processing problem [1]   
[9] where the goal is to cluster the nodes on a graph into different
communities by inspecting the connectivity structure of the graph.
consider an undirected regular graph consisting of two node-disjoint
communities interconnected by some external edges. let n denote
the total number of nodes in the network. the network topology can
be characterized by its symmetric adjacency matrix a, where a is
an n    n matrix, with aij = 1 if an edge exists between nodes i
and j, and aij = 0 otherwise.
since community detection can be viewed as a graph partitioning
problem that can be solved by identifying the graph cut that correctly
separates the communities, spectral id91 [10], [11] approaches
to community detection are natural [12]   [15]. spectral id91
speci   es a graph cut by inspecting the eigenstructure of the graph.
let 1n(0n) be the n-dimensional all-one (all-zero) vector. de   ne
l = d     a as the graph laplacian matrix of the graph, where
d = diag(a1n) is the diagonal degree matrix. let   i(l) denote the
i-th smallest eigenvalue of l. it is well-known that   1(l) = 0 since
l1n = 0n and l is a positive semide   nite (psd) matrix [16], [17].
the second smallest eigenvalue,   2(l), is known as the algebraic
connectivity. the eigenvector associated with   2(l) is called the
fiedler vector [18]. a mathematical representation of the algebraic
connectivity is

  2(l) =

(1)

the principle underlying spectral id91 for community detec-

tion [12]   [15] is summarized as follows:

1) compute the graph laplacian matrix l = d     a.
2) compute the fiedler vector y.
3) perform id116 id91 [19] on the entries of y to
cluster the nodes into two groups. to detect more than two

(aro), grant number w911nf-12-1-0443.

communities, we can use successive spectral id91 on the
discovered communities [1], [20].

most literature on community detectability [21]   [28] focuses on
the noiseless setting where the edges are not subject to random
insertions or deletions. however, in practice the network data can
be corrupted by incorrect measurements or background noises (e.g.,
bio-informatics data) that can produce such random insertions and
deletions. consequently, analyzing the sensitivity of community
detection algorithms to noise is an important task. in this paper,
we prove the existence of abrupt phase transitions in community
detectability for spectral community detection under a erdos-renyi
type random noise model. our network model includes the widely
used stochastic block model [29] as a special case. we show that at
some critical value of random external edge connection id203
the community detection performance transitions from almost perfect
detectability to low detectability in the large network limit (large n).
we provide asymptotic upper and lower bounds on this critical value.
the bounds become equal to each other when these two community
sizes are identical. this framework can be generalized to community
detection on more than two communities by aggregating multiple
communities into two larger communities.

we use simulated networks to validate the asymptotic expressions
for the phase transitions. using our theory, we propose an empirical
estimator of the critical phase transition threshold that can be applied
to data. these empirical estimates are used to test whether the detector
is operating in a reliable detection regime, i.e., below the phase
transition threshold.

ii. network model and related works

consider two arbitrarily connected communities with internal
adjacency matrices as1 and as2 and network sizes n1 and n2, re-
spectively. the external connections between these two communities
are characterized by an n1    n2 adjacency matrix cs, where each
entry in cs is a bernoulli(p) random variable. let n = n1 + n2.
the overall n    n adjacency matrix of the community structure can
be represented as

as =(cid:20)as1 cs
s as2(cid:21) .

(2)

the widely used stochastic block model [29] is a special case of
(2) when the two community structures are generated by connected
erdos-renyi random graphs parameterized by the within-community
connection id203 pi (i = 1, 2). our network model is more
general since we only assume random connection id203 p on
the external edges and we allow the within-community adjacency
matrices as i to be arbitrary. in this paper we consider the noisy
setting in which the adjacency matrix as is corrupted by a random
adjacency matrix an such that the observed adjacency matrix is
a = as + an . the adjacency matrix an is generated by a erdos-
renyi random graph with edge connection id203 q. note that
this model only allows random insertions and not deletions of edges.
community detectability has been studied under the stochastic
block model with restricted assumptions such as n1 = n2, p1 = p2
and    xed average degree as the network size n increases [23]   [26],

[30]. the planted clique detection problem in [31] is a special case
of the stochastic block model when p1 = 1 and p2 = p. a less
restricted stochastic block model is studied in [28] where a universal
phase transition in community detectability is established for which
the critical value does not depend on the community sizes. a similar
model to our network model is studied in [32] for interconnected
networks. however, in [32] the subnetworks are of equal size and
the external edges are known (i.e., non-random). phase transitions
in spectral community detection under noiseless network setting is
studied in [27].

iii. phase transition analysis

let 1ni be the ni-dimensional all-one vector and let ds1 =

diag (cs 1n2 ) and ds2 = diag(cid:0)ct

matrix of the noiseless graph can be represented as

s 1n1(cid:1). the graph laplacian
ls2 + ds2(cid:21) ,
   cs

(3)

ls =(cid:20)ls1 + ds1
   ct

s

where ls i is the graph laplacian matrix of i-th community. simi-
larly, the graph laplacian matrix of the noise matrix can be repre-
sented as

ln =(cid:20)ln1 + dn1

n

   ct

ln2 + dn2(cid:21) ,
   cn

where ln i is the graph laplacian matrix of the noise matrix in i-th
community, cn is the adjacency matrix of noisy edges between two

therefore the overall graph laplacian matrix is l = ls + ln .

communities, dn1 = diag (cn 1n2 ) and dn2 = diag(cid:0)ct
n 1n1(cid:1).
let x = [x1 x2]t , where x1     rn1 and x2     rn2 . by (1) we
have   2(l) = minx xt lx subject to the constraints xt
2 x2 =
2 1n2 = 0. using lagrange multipliers   ,    and
1 and xt
(3), the fiedler vector y = [y1 y2]t of l, with y1     rn1 and
y1     rn2 , satis   es y = arg minx   (x), where
  (x) = xt

(5)

differentiating (5) with respect
substituting y to the equations, we obtain

to x1 and x2 respectively, and

2(ls1 + ds1 + ln1 + dn1 )y1     2(cs + cn )y2     2  y1       1n1

adding (10) and (11) and by (1) and (3) we obtain    =   2(l).

let   cs = p1n1 1t

n2 , a matrix whose elements are the means of
entries in cs. let   i(m) denote the i-th largest singular value of
a rectangular matrix m1 and write cs =   cs +    s, where    s =

cs       cs. by latala   s theorem [33], eh  1(cid:16)    s   n1 n2(cid:17)i     0. this

is proved in appendix vii-a of [27]. furthermore, by talagrand   s
concentration inequality [34], almost surely,

  1(cid:18) cs   n1n2(cid:19)     p;   i(cid:18) cs   n1n2(cid:19)     0     i     2

(12)

when n1, n2         and n1
n2     c > 0. this is proved in appendix
vii-b of [27]. note that the convergence rate is maximal when
n1 = n2 because n1 + n2     2   n1n2 and the equality holds if
n1 = n2. similarly, let   cn = q1n1 1t
n2 , a matrix whose elements
are the means of entries in an . we have   1(cid:16) cn   n1 n2(cid:17)     q and
  i(cid:16) cn   n1 n2(cid:17)     0     i     2 when n1, n2         and n1
n2     c > 0.

as proved in [35], the singular vectors of cs (cn ) and   cs (   cn )
are close to each other in the sense that the squared inner product
of their left/right singular vectors converges to 1 almost surely when

   n1n2p         (   n1n2q        ). consequently, we have, almost

surely,

(ds1 + dn1 )1n1

    (p + q)1n2 .

(13)

(14)

applying (12), (13) and (14) to (8) and (9) and recalling that    = 0

and n1
n2

= c > 0, we have, almost surely,

(p + q)1t

by the fact that 1t

n2 y2 = 0, we have, almost surely,

(cid:18)   c +
(cid:18)   c +

n1 y1     0;

n2 y2     0.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

consequently, as    =   2(l), at least one of the two cases have to
be satis   ed:

case 1:

case 2: 1t

  2(l)

a.s.

       p + q =: t,
n
n1 y1     0 and 1t

n2 y2     0 almost surely.

(19)

(20)

we will show that the algebraic connectivity   2(l)/n and the
fiedler vector y undergo a phase transition between case 1 and case
2 as a function of t = p + q. that is, a transition from case 1 to case
2 occurs when p exceeds a certain threshold p   . in case 1, observe
that asymptotically   2(l)
grows linearly with t while the asymptotic
fiedler vector remains the same (unique up to its sign). furthermore,
n2 y2 = 0, the
from (10), (11), (12), (19),    =   2(l) and 1t
fielder vector y in case 1 has the following property. almost surely,

1note that for convenience, we use   i(m1) to denote the i-th smallest
eigenvalue of a square matrix m1 and use   i(m2) to denote the i-th largest
singular value of a rectangular matrix m2.

adding (21) and (22), we have

by the psd property of the graph laplacian matrix, yt
1 (ls1 +
2 (ls2 + ln2 )y2 > 0 if and only if y1 and y2 are
ln1 )y1 + yt
not constant vectors. therefore (24) implies y1 and y2 converge
to constant vectors. by the constraints yt
2 y2 = 1 and
n2 y2 = 0, we have, almost surely,
1t
n1 y1 + 1t

1 y1 + yt

r nn1

n2

y1       1n1 and r nn2

n1

y2        1n2 .

(26)

consequently, in case 1 y1 and y2 tend to be constant vectors with
opposite signs. more importantly, (26) suggests a phase transition in
spectral community detectability. in case 1, spectral id91 can
almost correctly identify these two communities since y1 and y2 are
constant vectors with opposite signs. on the other hand, in case 2,
n2 y2     0 almost surely. the entries of y1 and
n1 y1     0 and 1t
1t
y2 tend to have opposite signs in their entries. therefore in case 2
spectral id91 results in very poor community detection.

iv. upper and lower bounds on the critical

value

next we derive an upper bound on the critical value p    of the

phase transition. from (1) and (3) we know that

  2(l) = yt

furthermore, since ds1 = diag (cs1n2 ), ds2 = diag(cid:0)ct

v. performance evaluation

a. simulated networks

we use the stochastic block model [29] to generate network graphs
for community detection. the detectability is de   ned as the fraction
of nodes that are correctly identi   ed and the baseline detectability
is 0.5 for random guesses. in fig. 1, when p1 = p2 = 0.25, n1 =
n2 = 2000 and q = 0.05, the theoretical critical value from (41) is
p    = 0.2229. note that p    will converge to 0.25 as we increase n
as predicted in sec. iv.

here we show that the critical phase transition threshold p    can
be empirically estimated to empirically test the reliability of spectral

estimated community i obtained by applying spectral id91 to

community detection. let bli be the graph laplacian matrix of the
the observed adjacency matrix a and let bni denote the estimated

network size of community i. using (37) and (40), the empirical
estimators of these parameters are de   ned as

bp = number of identi   ed external edges/bn1bn2,
  2(bl1) +   2(bl2)    (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  2(bl1)       2(bl2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

  2(bl1) +   2(bl2)    (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  2(bl1)       2(bl2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

based on these empirical estimates, the performance of community

network is in the unreliable detection region.

detection can be classi   ed into three categories. if bp     bplb, the
network is in the reliable detection region. if bplb < bp < bpub, the
network is in the intermediate detection region. if bp     bpub, the

the co-purchasement data between 105 american political books
sold on amazon [36] are used to estimate the parameters plb, pub
and p. for the corresponding network graph nodes represent political
books and edges represent co-purchasements. an edge exists between
two books if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer.
three labels, liberal, conservative and neutral, were determined by
newman [36]. we perform community detection by separating the
books into two groups since there are only 13 books with neutral
labels (i.e., the oracle detectability is 0.8762). to investigate the
sensitivity of spectral community detection to noisy edge insertions,
for each edge not present in the original graph, an edge is added
with id203 q. the community detection results are summarized
in table i. observe that for small q (q=0 or 0.002) the network is

large variation. when q is large (q=0.05 or 0.1), the network is
mostly in the unreliable detection region resulting in low detectability.

q = 0.01, the network is mostly in the intermediate detection region

mostly in the reliable detection region (bp < bplb), which indicates

vi. conclusion

we establish asymptotic phase transition bounds on the critical
value p    under a general network setting corrupted by a erdos-renyi
type noise model. the communities are proven to be almost perfectly
detectable below the phase transition threshold and to be undetectable
above the phase transition threshold. the phase transition bounds
are used to establish empirical estimators to evaluate the reliability
of spectral community detection, where the detector is said to be
operating in the reliable, intermediate, or unreliable detection regime
based on the empirical estimates. simulated networks generated
by the stochastic block model validate the phase transition theory
for community detectability. an empirical estimator of the phase
transition is proposed that can be used to explore sensitivity of the
spectral community detection algorithm on real data.
