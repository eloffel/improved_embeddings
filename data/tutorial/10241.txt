semi-supervised eigenvectors for large-scale locally-biased learning

abstract

   in many applications, one has side information, e.g., labels that are
   provided in a semi-supervised manner, about a specific target region of
   a large data set, and one wants to perform machine learning and data
   analysis tasks "nearby" that prespecified target region. for example,
   one might be interested in the id91 structure of a data graph
   near a prespecified "seed set" of nodes, or one might be interested in
   finding partitions in an image that are near a prespecified "ground
   truth" set of pixels. locally-biased problems of this sort are
   particularly challenging for popular eigenvector-based machine learning
   and data analysis tools. at root, the reason is that eigenvectors are
   inherently global quantities, thus limiting the applicability of
   eigenvector-based methods in situations where one is interested in very
   local properties of the data.

   in this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to
   construct semi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph laplacian, and we
   illustrate how these locally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform
   locally-biased machine learning. these semi-supervised eigenvectors
   capture successively-orthogonalized directions of maximum variance,
   conditioned on being well-correlated with an input seed set of nodes
   that is assumed to be provided in a semi-supervised manner. we show
   that these semi-supervised eigenvectors can be computed quickly as the
   solution to a system of linear equations; and we also describe several
   variants of our basic method that have improved scaling properties. we
   provide several empirical examples demonstrating how these
   semi-supervised eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased
   learning; and we discuss the relationship between our results and
   recent machine learning algorithms that use global eigenvectors of the
   graph laplacian.
