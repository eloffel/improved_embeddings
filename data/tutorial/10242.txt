new results for random walk learning

abstract

   in a very strong positive result for passive learning algorithms,
   bshouty et al. showed that dnf expressions are efficiently learnable in
   the uniform random walk model. it is natural to ask whether the more
   expressive class of thresholds of parities (top) can also be learned
   efficiently in this model, since both dnf and top are efficiently
   uniform-learnable from queries. however, the time bounds of the
   algorithms of bshouty et al. are exponential for top. we present a new
   approach to weak parity learning that leads to quasi-efficient uniform
   random walk learnability of top. we also introduce a more general
   random walk model and give two positive results in this new model: dnf
   is efficiently learnable and juntas are efficiently agnostically
   learnable.
