manifold id173 and semi-supervised learning: some theoretical
analyses

   partha niyogi; 14(may):1229   1250, 2013.

abstract

   manifold id173 (belkin et al., 2006) is a geometrically
   motivated framework for machine learning within which several semi-
   supervised algorithms have been constructed. here we try to provide
   some theoretical understanding of this approach. our main result is to
   expose the natural structure of a class of problems on which manifold
   id173 methods are helpful. we show that for such problems, no
   supervised learner can learn effectively. on the other hand, a manifold
   based learner (that knows the manifold or    learns    it from unlabeled
   examples) can learn with relatively few labeled examples. our analysis
   follows a minimax style with an emphasis on finite sample results (in
   terms of $n$: the number of labeled examples). these results allow us
   to properly interpret manifold id173 and related spectral and
   geometric algorithms in terms of their potential use in semi-supervised
   learning.
