of basic interest is the quanti   cation of the long term growth of a language   s lexicon as it devel-
ops to more completely cover both a culture   s communication requirements and knowledge space.
here, we explore the usage dynamics of words in the english language as re   ected by the google
books 2012 english fiction corpus. we critique an earlier method that found decreasing birth and
increasing death rates of words over the second half of the 20th century, showing death rates to be
strongly a   ected by the imposed time cuto    of the arbitrary present and not increasing dramatically.
we provide a robust, principled approach to examining lexical evolution by tracking the volume of
word    ux across various relative frequency thresholds. we show that while the overall statistical
structure of the english language remains stable over time in terms of its raw zipf distribution,
we    nd evidence of an enduring    lexical turbulence   : the    ux of words across frequency thresholds
from decade to decade scales superlinearly with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we connect
to that of zipf   s law. to better understand the changing lexicon, we examine the contributions
to the jensen-shannon divergence of individual words crossing frequency thresholds. we also    nd
indications that scholarly works about    ction are strongly represented in the 2012 english fiction
corpus, and suggest that a future revision of the corpus should attempt to separate critical works
from    ction itself.

i.

introduction

in studying any entity or system, a fundamental sci-
enti   c goal is the satisfactory characterization of tempo-
ral dynamics, whether empirically observed, simulated,
or theoretically predicted. for language, there are many
kinds and scales of temporal dynamics to consider such as
the introduction and usage decline of speci   c words [1],
the evolution of accents, the long term development of
individual languages [2], and the changes in the overall
ecology of human languages which has now moved well
into an era of die o    [3].

here, we are concerned with the dynamics of the
english language   s lexicon. primarily, we want to know
how the usage of words has changed in time, and how
this is re   ected in the english lexicon   s evolution. this
focus leads us to several core questions: (1) what are
the rates at which words are born and at which they
die? (2) how do we reasonably identify word births and
deaths in the    rst place? (3) as the english lexicon has
expanded, how have overall statistical patterns such as
zipf   s law [4] changed, if at all? we are especially inter-
ested with revisiting work on word    birth    and    death   
rates as performed in [1]. as we will show, the methods
employed in [1] su   er from boundary e   ects, and we pro-
pose and investigate an alternative approach insensitive
to time range choice. we also investigate lexical changes
at a range of usage frequency levels.

we will perform our analyses using the google books
corpus [5, 6] whose incredible volume generated from an
extensive coverage of all written works would seemingly
make it an ideal candidate for linguistic research. how-
ever, there are two major caveats that limit its potency
and we will lay them out before proceeding.

in previous research [7], we broadly explored the char-
acteristics and dynamics of the un   ltered english and
english fiction data sets from both the 2009 and 2012
versions of the google books corpus. we showed that
the 2009 and 2012 un   ltered english data sets and, sur-
prisingly, the 2009 english fiction data set, all become
increasingly in   uenced by scienti   c texts throughout the
1900s, with medical research language being especially
prevalent. we concluded that, without sophisticated pro-
cessing or the provision of extensive metadata, only the
2012 english fiction data set is suitable for any kind of
analysis and deduction as it stands.

we also described the confounding problem of the
library-like nature of the google books corpus. each
book is, in principle, represented only once (re-editions
are one exception). word frequency is thus a deceptive
aspect of the google books corpus as book popularity
is not encoded in any way. word counts are in no way
re   ective of how often these words are read   as might
be informed by book sales and library borrowing data   
much less spoken by the general public. nevertheless,
the google books corpus registers an imprint of a lan-
guage   s lexicon and remains worthy of study, as long as
we remain mindful of its nature.

in this paper, we therefore focus only on the 2012 ver-
sion of the english fiction data set. to provide a sense of
scale for this corpus, we show in fig. 1 the total number
of 1-grams for this data set between 1800 and 2000 (1-

2

fig. 1: total 1-gram counts for the google books corpus
2012 english fiction data set as a function of publication year.
more than simple words, 1-grams include any sequence of
unbroken non-space characters as well as punctuation marks,
such as commas and brackets, which are broken away from
words. the number of 1-grams is proportional to the number
of books and pages in the corpus but does not account for
readership popularity [7]. a roughly exponential increase in
1-gram volume is apparent over time with several periods of
stasis and decline. volume decreases are particularly appar-
ent during the american civil war, world war i, and world
war ii as indicated by the three vertical gray shadings. both
world wars follow a decade of stagnancy and decline for the
corpus.

grams are de   ned to be contiguous text elements and are
more general than words including, for example, punctu-
ation; for ease of expression, we will use word and 1-gram
interchangeably). an exponential increase in volume is
apparent over time with notable exceptions during major
con   icts when the total volume decreases. there is e   ec-
tively zero growth in volume over    rst half of the 20th
century.

a number of researchers have carried out studies of the
google books corpus with the aim of examining prop-
erties and dynamics of entire languages. these include
analyses of zipf   s and heaps    laws as applied to the cor-
pus [8], the rates of verb id173 [5], rates of word
   birth    and    death    and durations of cultural memory [1],
as well as an observed decrease in the need for new words
in several languages [2]. however, most of the studies
were performed before the release of the second version,
and, to our knowledge, none have taken into account the
substantial e   ects of scienti   c literature on the data sets.
we structure the paper as follows. in sec. ii, we cri-
tique the method from [1] which examines the birth and
death rates of 1-grams for several languages using the
   rst google books corpus. through a number of dif-
ferent analyses, we show that while 1-gram birth rate
has slowed, death rates have not increased substantial-

ly. in sec. iii, we describe information theoretic meth-
ods for examining lexical evolution using the jensen-
shannon divergence, and then present our observations
in the form of word shift graphs. we    rst recall and
con   rm an apparent bias toward increased usage rates
of 1-grams over time [7]. we then measure the    ux of
1-grams across various relative frequency boundaries in
both directions for the 2012 english fiction data set.
we describe the use of the largest contributions to the
jensen-shannon divergence between successive decades
from among the 1-grams crossing each boundary as sig-
nals to highlight the speci   c dynamics of 1-gram growth
and decay over time. we display ranked examples of
these 1-gram usage changes and explore the factors con-
tributing to the observed disparities between growth and
decay. in releasing the original data set, michel et al. [5]
noted that english fiction contained scholarly articles
about    ctional works (but not scholarly works in gener-
al), and we also investigate this mixing of texts. we o   er
concluding remarks in sec. v supporting material can be
found at our paper   s online appendices [9].

to compare across years, we will work with relative
frequency, f. for a 1-gram w, fw;y is the usage frequency
of w normalized by the total number of 1-grams in the
year y (the total number of 1-grams is to be distinguished
form the number of unique 1-grams). we will also use
the average relative frequency for a 1-gram over the time
scale of a decade.

ii. on quantifying the birth and

death of words

in this section, we aim to measure the births and
deaths of words over time. as we will show, this will turn
out to be a delicate and arguably ill-de   ned task. we will
arrive at this conclusion by considering and attempting
to reproduce the work of petersen et al. [1] on word life
spans, and, by doing so, show how word death rates are
strongly a   ected by our vantage point in history.

petersen et al. [1] examined the birth and death rates of
words over time for various data sets in the 2009 version
of the google books corpus including un   ltered english,
english fiction, spanish, and hebrew.

their quanti   cation of birth and death is nuanced and
requires some examination. they de   ne the birth year
and death year of an individual word as the    rst and last
year, respectively, that the given word   s relative frequen-
cy fw;y is found to be equal to or greater than a cuto    fre-
quency f cut
equal to one twentieth its median relative
w;y1,y2
frequency f med
w;y1,y2.
the subscripts y1 and y2 indicate the    rst and last year
of the overall time period. they exclude words appear-
ing in only one year (we will show this is problematic)
and words appearing for the    rst time before y1 = 1700.
the rates of word birth and death, respectively, are then
found by normalizing the numbers of word births and
deaths by the total number of unique words in a given

, i.e., fw;y     f cut

for all four data sets, petersen et al. found strongly
decreased birth rates and increased death rates over time,
a variation for both of two to three orders of magnitude
occurring most rapidly between 1950 and 2000. they
noted that they obtained qualitatively similar results
when one tenth the median frequency is used as the cuto   
threshold.

the very speci   c nature of the analysis raise questions
as to the robustness of the method. three major con-
cerns:

1. use of the median relative frequency for a threshold
of birth and death. this quantity depends on the
word and the year range chosen. hypothetically, a
rare word w1 that has a constant relative frequency
over time will never be identi   ed as being born or
dying, while a word w2 with much higher relative
frequencies may die out yet still never fall to the
relative frequency of w1.
in short, the standards
for a word   s birth and death vary from word to
word and from time range to time range. as we
will see in particular, shifting the end year y2 using
this analysis strongly a   ects death rates.

w;y1,y2

2. the problematic use of the median for very rare
words. rare words that have a zero relative fre-
quency in more than half of the years examined
will have a median relative frequency f med
= 0.
the strict de   nition in [1] means such a word will
never be born or die as its relative frequency will
always be greater than or equal to 0 (such a state
could be possibly termed    unalive    [10]). if we sim-
ply ignore such words, then we will at the same
time be including words with lower overall abun-
dance, e.g., words that appear only in two con-
secutive years. to overcome this issue, we adjust
petersen et al.   s criterion to involve an inequality:
fw;y > f cut
w;y1,y2. we note that we
presume the computation of the median in [1] was
carried out for the range of years covering the    rst
and last appearance of a word.

w;y1,y2 = 0.05f med

3. by necessity, the google books corpus was con-
structed with a frequency threshold for a word to
be included or not (a word must appear at least 200
times). thus, a word having a relative frequency
of 0 in the data set does not mean it was entire-
ly absent. we do not attempt to incorporate this
issue of censusing here but note that it becomes
problematic for rare words (which are collectively
legion).

with these points in mind, we recreated the described
analysis of [1] for the 2012 version of english fiction at
the level of individual years. per [1], we initially exclude
words appearing in only one year. we also limit our anal-
ysis to 1800    (rather than 1700   ) and our    ndings will
help us address this choice. we believe these di   erences

3

with [1] should not be substantive, and allow us to re-
examine their work and build out our own in meaningful
ways.

we compare the birth and death rates as observed at
di   erent end points of history by performing the analysis
with y2=1860 through to y2=2000 in increments of 20
years. we present the resulting birth and death rates in
fig. 2 (cf. fig. 2 in [1]). subsequent modi   cations which
we will explain below will give us the comparison plots
shown in figs. 2b and d.

we observe in fig. 2a that birth rates decline approx-
imately exponentially overall, and here we    nd general
agreement with [1] and [2]. however, we also see sharp
departures to much lower birth rates near the end point
of each history. we are able to entirely attribute these
drops to the decision in [1] to ignore all 1-grams that have
a non-zero relative frequency in a single year. by includ-
ing these 1-grams, fig. 2a becomes fig. 2b and we see
that birth rate is no longer a   ected by the choice of y2.
we therefore see that words that appeared in only one
year before a selected end year y2 may well be just sput-
tering into existence. such words will be retrospectively
declared born when the end of history moves forward.

we can also now see that the apparent speeding up of
the drop in birth rate after 1980 in fig. 2b appears to be
real, consistent with [1]. we note that this is a complicat-
ed time with massive growth and change in information
technology and publishing, and we will see that literary
criticism starts to populate the corpus during this time
period as well.

we now turn to word death rates in fig. 2b. in contrast
to birth rates, there is no overlap between death rates at
any point in time as a function of the end of history y2.
for example, death rates in the late 1800s are estimated
at 10% if y2=1900 but < 10   3 % if y2 = 2000. it appears
that words are not in fact dying out.

so why is the word death rate used in [1] a   ected so
profoundly by boundaries? including words appearing in
only one year as we did for birth rates, does not resolve
this issue: fig. 2d is essentially the same as fig. 2c.

the problem lies instead in that the relative frequency
threshold for a word    existing    in a given year y is deter-
mined by range of years being considered. we argue that
a number of example relative frequency trajectories are
problematic for a range dependent de   nition.

consider two di   erent ranges of years,

[y1, y2] and
[y1, y(cid:48)2] with y2 < y(cid:48)2 and a year y internal to both ranges.
the median relative frequency for the same 1-gram will
very likely di   er for the two ranges, and a word which is
alive in year y for the [y1, y2] range may be either not yet
born or dead for the same year y in the [y(cid:48)1, y(cid:48)2] range.

this complication allows for unintuitive results such
as a 1-gram appearing to have died out by y2 but over a
longer period of time ending at y(cid:48)2, it quali   es as having
being alive, or possibly,    undead.   

we provide two examples of dead-undead behavior in
fig. 3. first, in fig. 3a, we show the word    chap    (all
capitals, likely short for chapter). we chose this word as

4

fig. 2: a and c: birth and death rates for 1-grams for the 2012 version of english fiction determined using the method
proposed in [1]. curves correspond to di   erent end-of-history boundaries with history running from y1=1800 to y2=1860 to
2000 in 20 year increments. birth rates show clear departures from an overall form as each end of history year is approached.
including words that appear in only one year in a time range eliminates these discrepancies (plot b). death rates however are
strongly a   ected by the choice of when history ends and this cannot be remedied by modifying the rule for 1-gram death. as
the end of history moves forward in time, words that seemed dead are no longer dead for a number of reasons b and d: birth
and death rates as per plots a and c in all respects except now including words that appear only once in a time range   i.e.,
have a non-zero relative frequency in only one year. birth rates are now well determined retrospectively from any vantage point
of history and an exponential decay appears con   rmed. death rates remain incongruent as in c.

one with a reasonably high median relative frequency but
otherwise fairly randomly from all words with oscillating
dead-undead states. the main curve is the relative fre-
quency for    chap    over time showing a gradual decline
over around three orders of magnitude. in both figs. 3a
and 3b, the blue region outlines the lowest possible rel-
ative frequency for each year (i.e., 1 divided by the total
number of 1-grams recorded).

we measure median relative frequency over a series
of time ranges with y1=1800 and ends-of-history at
y2=1850 through to y2=2000 in decade steps. the circles
mark the cuto    frequency f cut
for each time range.
open circles indicate the relative frequency of    chap   
has exceeded the cuto    at that y2      chap    is alive   
while    lled circles show that    chap    has died.

in 1850, the word    chap    would have appeared to have
snu   ed it in 1848; then viewed as having only temporarily
been stunned and revived for the following 8 decadal end
points; been declared an ex-word again in 1940, nailed
to the perch as it were; and    nally seen again to be only
resting and not at all ready to push up the daises through
to 2000 [11].

in fig. 3b, we show the relative frequency for a
much less common word which displays a di   erent kind
of dead-undead cycling:
   coryphaeus    (the head of a
greek chorus). the time series includes numerous zeroes
(which we must remember pertain only to the sample
behind the google books 2012 english fiction corpus).
this example shows a decadal-scale swapping between
being dead and undead from 1850 on, and demonstrates

fig. 3: two examples of how a 1-gram may be variously labeled dead or alive depending on the end of history using the
criterion in [1]. a. the word    chap    declines in relative frequency over time, from a high of 10   3.5 to as low as 10   7.5. using
a twentieth of the median frequency of a 1-gram as a threshold for birth and death, we see    chap    appears to have    run down
the curtain    in 1850 but then re-emerged as alive for 8 subsequent decadal end points.    chap    once again succumbs in 1940
only to stagger on through 2000. this dead-undead cycling can be seen for many words and leads us to exploring how words
pass above and drop below    xed relative frequency thresholds. in both plots, the blue region marks the lowest possible relative
frequency for each year achieved when a 1-gram has a count of 1. b. the word    coryphaeus    is a much less frequent word
than    chap   , and its time series contains a substantial number of zeroes and ones (resting on the top of the blue region).
the criterion in [1] leads to a    ipping back and forth between being dead and undead at most end-of-history years from 1850
through to 2000.

how zero frequencies may induce unexpected behavior
in the birth-death criterion in [1]. essentially, whenever
   coryphaeus    does not appear in the corpus for a year, it
will be considered dead, and if it does appear, it will have
a relative frequency exceeding the dead-undead cuto   .

thus, while the method in [1] provides a reasonable
approach to analyzing dynamics and asymmetries in the
evolutionary dynamics of a language data set and is
informative about birth rates, the results for death rates
depend on when the experiment is performed. we pro-
ceed to develop an approach that is independent of time

boundaries and agnostic to the 1-grams themselves.

iii. tracking language evolution
through the flux of words across

relative frequency thresholds

we move away from attempting to identify words as
having been born or died to exploring the    ux of words
across    xed relative frequency thresholds. for example,
over some time span, we wish to    nd and count which

18001820184018601880190019201940196019802000   7.5   7   6.5   6   5.5   5   4.5   4   3.5   3yearlog10relativefrequency   chap   cuto   s   deadundead a 18001820184018601880190019201940196019802000   9.5   9   8.5   8   7.5   7   6.5   6yearlog10relativefrequency   coryphaeus   cuto   s   deadundead b 6

words decline in prevalence and drop below, say, a rela-
tive frequency of 10   5, along with which words move up
above this threshold. with a decay in the birth rates of
words, english may be globally    cooling    [2] but we will
show that there is still much bubbling within.

to work at a meaningful temporal scale, we coarse-
grain the relative frequencies in the second english fic-
tion data set at the level of decades   e.g., between 1870-
to-1879 and 1990-to-1999   by averaging the relative fre-
quency of each unique word in a given decade over all
years in that decade. we weight each year equally. this
allows us to conveniently calculate and sort contributions
to the jensen-shannon divergence (de   ned below) of indi-
vidual 1-grams between, for example, any two time peri-
ods. to avoid high levels of id42
(ocr) errors for texts typeset prior to the early 19th
century, we will concern ourselves going forward with 1-
grams between the years 1820 and 2000. a prevalent
example is the long s   e.g.,    said    being read as    faid    [7].

a. basic stability of zipf   s law

a famous and fundamental scaling for language is
zipf   s law [4] which was long held to be that the relative
frequency of a word in a corpus scales approximately as
the inverse of its size rank, f     r      with    (cid:39) 1. however,
recent empirical work has shown that for large corpora,
zipf   s law typically exhibits two scaling regimes:

(cid:26) r      for r (cid:28) rb,

(cid:48) for r (cid:29) rb,

r     

f    

(1)

where   (cid:48) >   , and the transition between scaling regimes
around the break point rb typically occurs over an order
of magnitude. prior work by our group has elsewhere
found the break in scaling for zipf   s law to be a result
of text mixing [12] (other theories have been put for-
ward [13, 14]). the break point rb can be estimated
by average text length, though we cannot do so for the
google books corpus as the necessary information on
individual books is not available.

for the present work, we only need to characterize
zipf   s law with its two scaling regimes. in fig. 4a, we
plot zipf   s law for each decade running from the 1830s
through to the 1990s. we observe very strong agreement
over nearly 200 years of english fiction. the variations
that we do see are (1) the most common words become
slightly less common, and (2) the tail becomes slightly
fatter as new 1-grams enter the lexicon.

for the sake of introducing and broadly characteriz-
ing word    ux, it is su   cient for us to perform a simple
measure of the scaling exponents by averaging the zipf   s
laws and then using standard id75 over the
ranges indicated in fig. 4a. we estimate   (cid:48) (cid:39) 1.14 and
   (cid:39) 1.95.
in fig. 4b, we show in detail how the numbers of 1-
grams with relative frequencies exceeding    xed thresh-
olds are stable over time. the only exception is the top

1-gram   always the comma   which gradually de   ates in
relative frequency (punctured punctuation).

at least in the case of english    ction then, the    bones   
of zipf   s law have changed little over the period 1820 to
2000.

but the words underlying zipf   s law have    uctuated in
relative frequency, and this is an aspect often overlooked
when comparing ranked distributions for any system.

b. lexical turbulence: the scaling of word    ux

across internal frequency thresholds

in fig. 5, we show word    ux as a function of time and
frequency threshold. first, in figs. 5a and 5b, we dis-
play the upward and downward    uxes   up and   down of
the number of 1-grams crossing relative frequency thresh-
olds of powers of 10 from fthr = 10   4 down to 10   7.
each point is centered in a decade and represents the
total number of words moving across a frequency thresh-
old from that decade to the next.

we can see that word    ux across frequency thresholds
is relatively constant over time. of the minor modula-
tions we see some consistency across thresholds, notably
recent decades for   down and fthr = 10   5, 10   6, and
10   7. moreover, in comparing figs. 5a and 5b, the two
   uxes appear to be fairly balanced.

however, word    ux does vary strongly with respect to
frequency threshold fthr and we view this as a kind of
   lexical turbulence   . we see in figs. 5a and 5b that,
as we should expect, the lower the threshold, the high-
er the    ux. the most common words have essentially
no turnover (see below) while increasingly rare ones are
increasingly volatile.

in fig. 5c, we attempt to characterize the relationship
between word    ux and frequency threshold, fthr. we
average the    uxes in figs. 5a and 5b, and plot them
as a function of fthr. the averages for   up and   down
are indistinguishable to the eye, con   rming the balance
suggested in figs. 5a and 5b.

we have at hand evidence of lexical turbulence through
an apparent inverse scaling of word    ux across frequency
thresholds, and we mark two possible scaling regimes:

(cid:26) f     

      

(cid:48)

thr for fthr (cid:28) fb,
for fthr (cid:29) fb,
f     
thr

where    (cid:39) 0.77 and   (cid:48) (cid:39) 1.10, and fb is the scaling break
point.
in fig. 5d, we also show how    ux scales with word rank
r. to do so, we have used the average form of zipf   s law
in fig. 4a to map frequency to rank. the evident upper
limit for    ux is    = r, marked by gray area in fig. 5d.
we are able to connect the scaling break for    ux with
respect to both fthr and r to the scaling break in zipf   s
law. combining eqs. 1 and 2, we have

(cid:26) r   = r    

(cid:48)

r  

= r  

      

(cid:48)

(cid:48) for r (cid:28) rb,
   for r (cid:29) rb.

fig. 4: a. overlay of zipf   s laws for all decades running from the 1820s to the 1990s for the 2012 english fiction corpus
(color shifts from light gray to black). the observed stability demonstrates that zipf   s law remains largely unchanged for the
2012 english fiction data set, even though individual words may vary greatly in rank over time. b. in support of a, rank
threshold boundaries correspond to nearly constant relative frequency threshold boundaries over many orders of magnitude,
with the exception of the top 1-gram (always a comma), which decreases in relative frequency. points are located at the center
of each decade.

we measure the lower and upper exponents in fig. 5d
as 1.23 and 1.47, and these compare favorably using the
equation above and the exponents measured in figs. 4
and 5d:    =     (cid:48) (cid:39) 1.14    1.10 (cid:39) 1.25 and   (cid:48) =   (cid:48)   (cid:39)
1.95    0.77 (cid:39) 1.50.
now, both lower and upper scalings of    ux with
rank are superlinear meaning that the lexical turbulence
increases strongly with rank   relatively more and more
words are turned over the further we move up in word
rank (down in relative frequency thresholds). clearly this
scaling cannot be sustained as eventually we would have
   > r. for the 2012 english fiction corpus, we see that
the lexicon is exhausted before such a possibility comes
about.

for the top 100 words, we see the lexicon is strongly
conserved   crystallized   with on average 2.4% of words
turning over every decade. but the superlinear scaling
means the lexicon becomes increasingly volatile. as we
travel out to the top 105 words, the    ux has grown to a
considerable 16.8% per decade.

there are some important limitations to our    ndings.
the time scale of comparison, which is here decade-to-
decade, will a   ect the scaling as well, i.e., we need to
consider   (r,    ) where    is the length in years of adjacent
periods. clearly, the smaller the time scale of compari-
son, the less the degree of lexical turbulence which must
tend toward 0.

we stress that the scalings indicated for    ux are

intended only to be rough estimates, and we will stop
well short of proclaiming a set of universal exponents.
future work will need to be performed across many lan-
guages and using better curated and di   erent corpora.

in sum, we    nd that despite a steady decline in word
birth rate for the 2012 english fiction corpus   two
orders of magnitude over two hundred years (fig. 2)   
the    ux of words across frequency thresholds in the zipf
distribution has remained essentially constant in mag-
nitude and scaling. our next and last task will be to
explore the individual words most strongly contributing
to this lexical turbulence.

iv. fine-grained exploration of flux

across frequency threshold

boundaries

we now begin to examine the speci   c 1-grams that
cross relative frequency thresholds as we move from
decade to decade. we    rst describe the very limited    ux
across the fthr = 10   2 boundary and then investigate the
richer transitions for the lower thresholds 10   3 down to
10   6.

flux across the 10   2 boundary between consecutive
decades is almost nonexistent from the 1820s to the
1990s. the 1-grams that do achieve such a crossing make
for a short list of three:

fig. 5: upward and downward    uxes,   up and   down as a function of relative frequency threshold fthr. these    uxes are the
total number of words crossing relative frequency thresholds of fthr = 10   4, 10   5, 10   6, and 10   7 in both upward (plot a)
and downward (plot b) directions between consecutive decades. word    ux is roughly proportional to the inverse of the relative
frequency threshold fthr. for each threshold, the upward and downward    ux roughly cancel. for either direction of    ux, there
appears to be little qualitative di   erence between the three smallest thresholds. plot c: upward and downward    uxes   up and
  down from a and b averaged over all decade pairs as a function of relative frequency threshold fthr. the balance between the
two    uxes is evident, and the two scaling regimes identi   ed are tied to the break in scaling in zipf   s law (fig. 4a) [12]. word
   ux scales approximately as the inverse of frequency threshold showing that in moving further away from the most common
words, the english language becomes more and more alive, churning internally in a regular fashion. plot d: using zipf   s law
from fig. 4a, c transformed to show    ux as a function of word rank. the scaling regimes connect to those of c through the
zipf exponents    and   (cid:48) (see eqs. 1, 2, and 3). the superlinear scaling makes clear that the growth in lexical turbulence with
rank r is strong. for example, around 16.8% of words with r     105 will be replaced every decade.

1. between the 1820s and 1830s, the semicolon falls

below the 10   2 relative frequency threshold.

2. between the 1840s and 1850s,    i    rises above the

10   2 relative frequency threshold.

3. between the 1910s and 1920s,    was    rises above the

10   2 relative frequency threshold.

this is the entirety of the    ux across the 10   2 threshold
from 1820 to 2000 showing once again that the regime
of 1-grams above this frequency (roughly the top 10 1-

grams) is extremely stable. the eleven 1-grams with rel-
ative frequency above a threshold of 10   2 in the 1990s
in decreasing order of frequency are: the comma    ,    , the
period    .   ,    the   , the quotation mark    "   ,    to   ,    and   ,    of   ,

1-gram contributions

9

to enable us to make better sense of the detailed    ux
across lower frequency thresholds, we need some way of
assigning some kind of weight of importance to each 1-
gram involved in the    ux. to do so, we start with a
standard measure for comparing two id203 distribu-
tions, the jensen-shannon divergence (jsd) [15]. we will
then decompose the jsd into contributions from individ-
ual 1-grams which in turn will a   ord a simple ranking of
1-grams. we note that other approaches to determining
the salience of words are possible such as the di   erent
lens generated by the use of the partial kl in [16].

given two corpora with 1-gram distributions p and q,

the jsd between p and q may be expressed as

(cid:80)

djs(p || q) = h(m )    

[h(p ) + h(q)] ,

(4)

1
2

2 (p + q) is the mixed distribution of the
where m = 1
two years, and h(p ) =    
i pi log2 pi is the shannon
id178 [17] of the original distribution. the jsd is sym-
metric and bounded between 0 bits and 1 bit, and these
bounds are only attained when the distributions are iden-
tical and free of overlap, respectively.

djs,i(p || q) =(cid:80)

helpfully, the jsd is a linear combination of contribu-
tions due to individual words and can be expressed as
i djs,i(p || q). the contribution from
the ith word to the divergence between the two distribu-
tions, as derived from eq. 4, is given by

(cid:2)ri log2 ri+(2   ri) log2(2   ri)(cid:3), (5)

djs,i(p || q) = mi  
where ri = min(pi, qi)/mi. the contribution from an
individual word is therefore proportional to the average
frequency of the word mi and also depends on the ratio
between the smaller and average frequencies, ri = pi/mi.
we write the contribution of the ith word as:

1
2

djs,i(p || q) = mic(ri),

(cid:2)ri log2 ri + (2     ri) log2(2     ri)(cid:3).

(6)

words with larger average frequencies (mi) yield larger
contribution signals as do those with smaller ratios (ri).
a commonly occurring 1-gram changing subtly can pro-
duce a large signal. so can an uncommon or new word
given a su   cient shift in id203. the quantity c(ri)
is concave (up) and symmetric about ri = 1, where the
frequency remains unchanged (pi = qi = mi) yielding no
contribution. if a word appears or disappears between
two decades (e.g., pi = 0 and qi > 0), then the contribu-
tion is maximized at precisely the average frequency of
the word in question.

fig. 6:
percent of (jensen-shannon divergence) jsd in
english fiction 2012 corpus due to words increasing in rel-
ative frequency of use for successive decades (dark gray), and
decades three apart (light gray; e.g., 1990s versus 1960s). the
contribution for successive decades is nearly always more than
half   the exceptions are between the 1820s, 1840s, and 1970s,
and their successive decades. for decades three apart, the
contribution is always greater than 50%. the jsd between
successive decades also shows peaks in the vicinity of major
con   icts.

contributions from words increasing in relative frequen-
cy. the jsds between 1820s, 1840s, and 1970s and their
successive decades are the only exceptions. moreover,
when the time di   erential is increased to three decades,
no exceptions remain. this asymmetry is sympathetic
to the lexicon enjoying new words but relatively few true
deaths (sec. ii).

we note relative extrema of the inter-decade jsd in
the vicinity of major con   icts. between the 1860s and
successive decade, words on the rise contribute substan-
tially to the jsd. this is consistent with words not rela-
tively popular during wartime (speci   cally the american
civil war) being used more frequently in peacetime. a
similar tendency holds for the jsd between the 1910s
(world war i) and the 1920s. this is not as apparent
in the jsd between the 1910s and the 1940s, possibly
because the 1940s coincide with world war ii. the abso-
lute maximum for the single-decade curve corresponds
to the divergence between the 1950s and 1960s. this
suggests a strong e   ect from social movements. for the
3-decade split, the absolute peak comes from the jsd
between the 1940s and 1970s, which are certainly decades
of starkly di   erent character.

c. fine-grained exploration of    ux across
frequency threshold boundaries: fthr = 10   3

as we show in fig. 6, more than half of the jsd
between a given decade and the next is typically due to

we conclude our analysis with a series of observations
on which words contribute to    ux between a number of
example decade pairs and across the frequency thresh-

18001850190019502000455055606570year(middecade)%ofjsdduetoincreasedusageofwords  tonextdecadeto3decadesinfuture10

olds 10   3, 10   4, 10   5, and 10   6. for thresholds of 10   5
and below, we omit signals corresponding to references
to speci   c years, as such references would otherwise over-
whelm the charts for these thresholds. we prepare the
reader by noting that these    nal sections are somewhat
detailed in nature.

but we also add that any study of texts reduced to 1-
grams should in some fashion    look at the words    them-
selves, for the very least as a sanity check on code and
more deeply to    nd the story behind observed summa-
rized dynamics and patterns [18, 19].

the set of 1-grams with relative frequencies above 10   3
is also fairly stable. from zipf   s law for the 2012 english
fiction corpus (fig 4), we know that this threshold is
typically exceeded by the 100 most common 1-grams.
viewing language as code, these top 100 1-grams are
fundamental elements in the construction of meaningful
statements and comprise around 55% of all 1-grams.

we should expect limited turnover for these core 1-
grams, and indeed the    ux of 1-grams across the 10   3
boundary between consecutive decades is entirely cap-
tured by fig. 7.

we generate these and all subsequent    jsd word shift   

   gures by:

1. finding all 1-grams that either move above or

below a given threshold between two decades;

2. ranking these 1-grams by their contributions to the

jsd measured between the same decades; and

3. plotting downward    ux 1-grams with their contri-
butions as bars to the left, and upward    ux 1-grams
with their contributions as bars to the right. we
leave aside all 1-grams representing years.

in taking a close look at fig. 7, we see that parenthe-
ses drop in relative frequency of use between the 1840s
and 1850s and cross back over the threshold after the
american civil war (between the 1860s and 1870s). the
same is true for before and after world war ii (between
the 1930s and 1940s and between the 1940s and 1950s,
respectively). beyond these, the    ux is entirely due to
proper words (not punctuation). for example,    made   
   uctuates up and down over this threshold repeatedly
over the course of a century. between the 1870s and the
1880s,    made   , which sees slightly increased use, is the
only word to cross the threshold. the most crossings is
12, which occurs between the    rst two decades. also,
   great    struggled over the    rst 5 decades and eventually
failed to remain great by this measure.    mr.       uctuated
across the threshold between the 1830s and 1910s. more
recently, from the 1930s on,    they    has been making its
paces up and down across the threshold.

d. fine-grained exploration of    ux across

frequency threshold boundaries: 1970s   1980s and

1980s   1990s

we now choose a few interesting decade-to-decade
transitions to delve into for the    ux at the lower frequen-
cy thresholds of fthr = 10   4, 10   5, and 10   6. returning
to fig. 5, we know that for each threshold between 10   4
and 10   7, the upward and downward    ux roughly can-
cel. for both upward and downward    ux, there appears
to be little qualitative di   erence between the three small-
est thresholds of 10   4, 10   5, and 10   6. for these thresh-
olds, the downward    ux between the 1950s and the 1960s
is a minimum then increases over the next two pairs of
consecutive decades, and then dips again between the
1980s and 1990s. for fthr = 10   4, the increase between
the 1960s and 1970s and the next pair of decades is
more noticeable for the downward    ux, as is the decrease
between the last two pairs of decades.

based on these observations, we will examine the    ux
for two decade pairs in this section: 1970s   1980s and
1980s   1990s. in the following two sections, we will con-
sider the 1930s   1940s transition because of the historical
importance of these decades, and then    nally the 1960s   
1970s transition to show some peculiarities of word    ux.
we begin by displaying in fig. 8 the top 60    ux 1-
grams across fthr=10   4 between the 1970s and the 1980s,
and in fig. 9, we show all 55    ux words between the
1980s and the 1990s for the same fthr. in these and all
subsequent    gures, we use the same format as fig. 7.

between each pair of decades, we see reduced rela-
tive use of particularly british words, including    eng-
land    between the    rst two decades and    king   ,    george   ,
and    sir    between the latter two. we also see reduced
use of more formal-sounding words, such as    character   ,
   manner   , and    general    between the    rst two decades
and    suppose   ,    indeed   , and    hardly    between the lat-
ter two.
increasing are physical and emotional words.
those between the    rst two decades include    stared   ,
   breath   ,    realized   ,    shoulder    and    shoulders   ,    co   ee   ,
   guess   ,    pain   , and    sorry.    between the latter two, we
see    chest   ,    skin   ,    whispered   ,    hit   ,    throat   ,    hurt   ,
   control   , and    lives.    also included are    phone    and    par-
ents.   

in figs. 10 and 11, we display the top 60    ux words,
not counting references to years, across the 10   5 thresh-
old between the same pairs of decades. many of the
words declining below the threshold between the 1970s
and 1980s are unusual spellings such as    tho   , proper
names like    balzac   , or words from non-english languages
like    une.    increasing across this threshold between the
   rst two decades are a plethora of mostly female proper
names, with    jessica    and    megan    leading. also seen are
   kgb    and    jeans.    (   kgb    decreases in the 1990s, as
does    russians.   ) increasing between the 1980s and 1990s
are a few proper names; however, most of the signals here
are social and sexual in nature, and in part point to the
inclusion of academic, literary criticism. these include

10   5 as seen in fig. 11. for the second pair of decades, we
   nd some surprising signals. in particular, while increas-
es in    hiv    and    bisexual    make the list (similarly to
many signals in fig. 11), as do    fax   ,    laptop   , and    inter-
net   , a great swath of the signals are accounted for by
one franchise. we note increases in    picard   ,    tng   ,
   sisko   , and    ds9.    these latter signals should serve
as a reminder that the word distributions in library-like
google books corpus [7], even for    ction, do not remotely
resemble the contents of normal conversations (at least
not for the general population). however, we do observe

premature to dismiss the contributions at this threshold
because of an apparent overabundance of    star trek.    in
fact, because    the next generation    and    deep space 9   
aired precisely during these two decades, an abundance
of    star trek    novels in the english fiction data set is
actually quite encouraging, because these novels do exist,
are available in english, and are (clearly)    ction.

the cultural signals change as we dial down the fre-
quency threshold. we typically    nd that thresholds of
10   4 and above produce signals with little to no noise.
this is not surprising because this relative frequency
roughly corresponds to rank threshold for the 1000 most
common words (see fig. 4) in the data set. using a
threshold of 10   5 (fewer than 10,000 words fall above this

frequency in any given decade), we see some noise (most-
ly in the form of familiar names), but still observe many
valuable signals. only when the threshold is reduced to
10   6 does the overall texture of the signals become ques-
tionable as a result of a variety of proper nouns far less
familiar than those observed with the previous thresh-
old. however, at this threshold, we nevertheless observe
several early signals of real social importance.

e. fine-grained exploration of    ux across
frequency threshold boundaries: 1930s   1940s

curiously, between the 1930s and 1940s the volume
of    ux across each threshold is not atypical (see fig. 5).
moreover, the asymmetry between the jsd contributions
between those decades is very low. yet it is obvious that
we should expect signals of historical signi   cance between
these two decades, and indeed we do once we examine the
dynamics of individual 1-grams. in figs. 14 and 15, we
see words crossing the 10   4 and 10   5 thresholds, respec-
tively (with references to years omitted in fig. 15). for
the higher threshold, only 56 words cross. the most
noticeable such words that are more commonly used in

the 1940s are    general    and    german.    also,    killed   
appears in this list. words used less frequently include
   pleasure   ,    garden   , and    spirit.    for the lower threshold,
we see the signals from proli   c authors as in our previous
paper [7], particularly upton sinclair   s character, lanny
budd. we also see more nazis (   nazi    and    nazis   ).

f. fine-grained exploration of    ux across
frequency threshold boundaries: 1960s   1970s

last, we include one of the more colorful examples. in
fig. 16, we show signals (not including years) for words
crossing the 10   5 threshold between the 1960s and 1970s.

profanity dominates. we see references to the world
according to garp (   garp   ) and, again, to    star trek   
(   kirk    this time). we also see more    computer   ,    tv   ,
and, per the graduate,    plastic.    signals also appear
for    blacks    and    homosexual   , for narcotics (   drug    and
   drugs   ), and a changing role for police (   enforcement   
and    cop   ).

we refer the reader to our paper   s online appen-
dices [9] for    gures representing    ux across relative fre-
quency thresholds of 10   4, 10   5, and 10   6 between con-
secutive decades over the entire period analyzed (the
1820s to the 1990s).

v. concluding remarks

in seeking to characterize word birth and death for the
2012 google books english fiction corpus, we have iden-
ti   ed and characterized what we believe is a fundamental
feature of language evolution: lexical turbulence. in gen-
eral, for any time-coded corpus, we quantify lexical tur-
bulence as the    ux    of words across a relative frequency
of usage threshold between two time periods. we speak
of undirected    ux    because we found that upward and
downward    ux   up and   down across a threshold were on
average well balance, though this may not always be the
case.

like the jensen-shannon divergence and related mea-
sures, lexical turbulence is one way of characterizing the
degree of word rank (or relative frequency) variability
underlying zipf   s law. the overall form of zipf   s law may
be strongly preserved across corpora suggesting stabili-
ty (fig. 4) but completely occlude how individual word
usage rates are changing (fig. 5).

word    ux may also be naturally measured across a
   xed word rank, with the connection to relative frequency
being made through zipf   s law (fig. 5d). the scaling of

word    ux with rank is superlinear with a break in scaling
tied to that of zipf   s law [12].

we conjecture that word rank may be viewed as rough-
ly analogous to a kind of temperature where the most
common words are nearly frozen in usage rates while rar-
er and rarer words increasingly boil and bubble in their
relative frequencies. one metaphor for words sometimes
invoked is that of tools [4]. words form a hierarchy of
tools with a crystallized set of the most frequently used
instruments (comma, period,    the   ) resting above a vast
tool set of increasingly speci   c uses.

we arrived at the notion of lexical turbulence via our
e   orts to reproduce the results of [1]. we found general
agreement regarding a decay in word birth from 1800 to
2000 but not so for word death. true word death appears
to be extremely and durably rare. overall, the lowering
birth rate signals a cooling of language [2] but the time-
independent scaling of lexical turbulence shows that the
lexicon is constantly turning over.

using jsd word shifts, we also explored in detail the
words dominating the    ux across some example frequen-
cy thresholds for a number of interesting decade-decades
transitions. while extremely speci   c    ction can be of
great interest   whether it be in the form of war novels
or volumes from the    star trek    franchise   vocabulary
from these works is more easily studied when placed
in proper context. dialing down the relative frequency
threshold across several orders of magnitude helps to cap-
ture this distinction. however, further experimentation
is called for, because an automatic means of separating
speci   c signals from the more general signals (e.g.,    star
trek    from social movements) could a   ord both a more
intuitive grasp of the lexical dynamics and might, ideal-
ly, allow investigators to hypothesize causal relationships
between exogenous and endogenous drivers of language.
of many potential directions for future work, sever-
al that stand out would be (1) reproducing the present
analysis of lexical turbulence for 2-grams and 3-grams
which, id165s that are particularly rich in meaning; (2)
quantifying the behavior of lexical turbulence with time
(e.g., beyond adjacent decade comparisons as we have
done here); (3) creating toy models of language evolu-
tion to attempt to capture lexical turbulence; and (4)
building interactive jsd-based word shifts where corpo-
ra, frequency thresholds and year range may be selected
to facilitate rapid explorations.
