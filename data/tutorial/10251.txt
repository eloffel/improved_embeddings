abstract     the use of methods borrowed from statistics and physics to analyze written texts has
allowed the discovery of unprecedent patterns of human behavior and cognition by establishing
links between models features and language structure. while current models have been useful to
unveil patterns via analysis of syntactical and semantical networks, only a few works have probed
the relevance of investigating the structure arising from the relationship between relevant entities
such as characters, locations and organizations.
in this study, we represent entities appearing
in the same context as a co-occurrence network, where links are established according to a null
model based on random, shu   ed texts. computational simulations performed in novels revealed
that the proposed model displays interesting topological features, such as the small world feature,
characterized by high values of id91 coe   cient. the e   ectiveness of our model was veri   ed
in a practical pattern recognition task in real networks. when compared with traditional word
adjacency networks, our model displayed optimized results in identifying unknown references in
texts. because the proposed representation plays a complementary role in characterizing unstruc-
tured documents via topological analysis of named entities, we believe that it could be useful to
improve the characterization of written texts (and related systems), specially if combined with
traditional approaches based on statistical and deeper paradigms.

introduction.     the study of complex networks
emerged in the beginning of the last decade as a pow-
erful, robust and general representation of a myriad of
real complex systems [1]. biological systems, transporta-
tion networks, communication and information networks
are examples of real systems whose underlying properties
were unsnarled via graph representation. the investiga-
tion of many complex systems in terms of their topological
structure and dynamical behavior allowed the discovery of
non-trivial connectivity/functional patterns, including the
discovery of speci   c mesoscopic, heterogeneous and hier-
archical structures responsible for particular functions [1].

even though several complex systems modeled as net-
works are artlessly visualized as a graph representation
(e.g. street [2] or id191 [3, 4]), many others
undergo a pre-processing step to allow a proper networked
representation. this is the case of instances represented in
an attribute space [5], images modelled as networks [6] and
texts represented as graphs [7]. of particular interest to
the aims of this study are the text networks, a model that
has drawn the attention of physicists in recent years and
has been of paramount relevance to shed light on the struc-
ture and function of linguistic and cognitive processes [8].

in addition, such textual representations has allowed the
investigation of basic human behavior through the auto-
matic analysis of the ever increasing amount of electronic
data in social and information networks [9].

many physical models of texts have been proposed to
tackle a diversity of problems [9]. the representation
of unstructured documents depends on the speci   c lan-
guage properties being studied.
if writing style or lan-
guage identi   cation is relevant, syntactical networks are
used to grasp stylistic-dependent features [10]. in syntac-
tical networks, each word is mapped into a node and edges
are established according to syntactical relations, which
are language-dependent constraints. interestingly, it has
been shown that such networks share the same topologi-
cal properties of networks representing completely di   er-
ent systems [10], allowing thus the construction of opti-
mized structures for id146 and communi-
cation [11].

usually, syntactical networks are analyzed using a
simpli   ed representation, the so-called word adjacency
model [5, 12   14]. in this model, adjacent words are linked
if they appear as neighbors in the text. it has been shown
that, despite this seemingly naive simpli   cation, word ad-

p-1

diego raphael amancio1

jacency networks are e   cient representations for text anal-
ysis because most of the syntactical connections occur
between neighboring words [10]. the usefulness of such
models has been veri   ed in many theoretical and practi-
cal research [9]. finally, another important class of text
networks are the semantical networks, where links are es-
tablished if concepts share some semantical property (e.g.
a semantical similarity or a entailment relationship) [15].
whilst several available methods grasp the relationship
between all words or the relationship between speci   c
classes of words [16, 17] as a co-occurrence graph (see sec-
tion s4 of the supplementary information (si)1), only a
few studies have investigated the properties of entity co-
occurrences as a complex network. note that this is a
relevant issue because the presence of speci   c words other
than relevant entities in networked models may hinder the
accurate recognition of novel patterns. in this sense, this
study aims at creating a networked textual representa-
tion that analyzes the topology emerging from the rela-
tionship between speci   c words, namely the named en-
tities, which are a class of particular concepts that has
been useful to shed light on the understanding of several
language properties [18]. particularly, we consider that
words represent named entities whenever they name peo-
ple (characters), places or organizations. hence, unlike
traditional textual networked models, the proposed repre-
sentation emphasizes the complexity of the document plot
rather than linguistic styles.

the application of the proposed network model that
links entities co-occurring in the same context allowed
the identi   cation of some interesting topological patterns.
qualitatively, we have found that named entity networks
share topological features of other complex systems, as re-
vealed by low values of typical shortest path length and
high local id91. in addition, we have found that the
networks display a modular structure. the potential of
the proposed representation was veri   ed in a typical pat-
tern recognition problem devoted to the resolution of co-
references. optimized results were found with our model,
which con   rms that the information provided by the rep-
resentation goes beyond simple word frequency statistics.
because named entity networks are a complementary rep-
resentation of texts as networks, we believe that it could
be useful to improve the characterization of written texts
and related systems with nodes playing special roles.

extracting networks from books.     the objec-
tive of this paper is to propose a simple but relevant model
that captures co-occurrences of named entities in texts. to
identify pertinent entities, we used the technique referred
to as    id39   , which identi   es rele-
vant persons, locations and organizations in documents.
speci   cally, we used the method devised in [19], which
tags words with three possible labels. an example of enti-
ties recognition is shown in the following extract obtained

from a modi   ed wikipedia article 2. note that the entities
recovered from the method are highlighted in italic font:
   barack hussein obama ii (us, born august 4, 1961) is
the 44th and current president of the us, and the    rst
african american to hold the o   ce. born in honolulu,
hawaii, obama is a graduate of columbia university and
harvard law school, where he served as president of the
harvard law review. he was a community organizer in
chicago before earning his law degree. he worked as a civil
rights attorney and taught constitutional law at univer-
sity of chicago law school from 1992 to 2004. he served
three terms representing the 13th district in the illinois
senate from 1997 to 2004, running in 2000 unsuccessfully
for the united states house of representatives.   
in the above example, the recognized entities denote per-
sons (e.g. obama), locations (e.g. chicago and hawaii )
and organizations (e.g. harvard law school or columbia
university). after the entity recognition step, the text
undergoes a pre-processing step to eliminate ambiguities
and name duplications. in this step, for example, emma
wodehouse and emma are mapped into the same entity.
after this pre-processing phase, a set v = {v1, v2, . . .} of
entities is obtained for each book. note that, in this phase
(training phase), only the known entities (such as obama
and chicago are represented as nodes. unknown entities
(such as he) are included in a classi   cation phase, for ex-
ample, in the id2 problem (see    results
and discussion    section). to create the network of related
entities, hereafter referred to as named entity (ne) net-
work, the proposed method connects entities appearing in
the same context. thus, entities sharing some semanti-
cal relationship tend to be connected. the motivation of
this approach relies on the fact that concepts appearing
in the same context tend to be semantically related [20].
the separation of the text in contexts is accomplished by
splitting the entire document in shorter subtexts compris-
ing the same number of tokens w . as a consequence,
each book is represented by the set    = {s1, s2, . . . , sn},
where si is the i-th subtext. note that, we could have
chosen as a representative context the segments of texts
structured as chapters or other natural textual structure.
speci   cally, we have not used this information concern-
ing the structure of texts because this information is not
readily available in all books of the dataset. to store the
information concerning the co-occurrence of distinct enti-
ties in the same subset, the matrix b is created. if entity
vi appears in the j-th subset, then bij = 1, otherwise
bij = 0. the frequency of entities in subsets, i.e.
the
number of subtexts in which a entity appears is de   ned as
j bij. analogously, the frequency of co-occurrence

fi =(cid:80)

of two entities vi and vj is de   ned as

fij =

bikbjk.

the link between two entities is established if they co-
occur at least in one set si       . the weight (i.e. the
strength) of the link is computed as

wij = min{p (vi|vj), p (vj|vi)},

(2)
where p (vi|vj) = fij/fj. here, the weight wij de   ned in
equation 2 is used to identify the strongest links, which are
in turn stored in the adjacency matrix a. an example of
network construction for a    ctitious dataset is shown in
fig. s3 of the si.

to improve the characterization of ne networks, we also
considered the signi   cance of entities co-occurrence. more
speci   cally, two entities vi and vj were connected only if
the quantity fij was su   ciently higher than the same value
expected in a null model, i.e. in a random (shu   ed) text.
given two entities vi and vj, the signi   cance of the co-
occurrence is estimated by computing how likely it is to
observe more than k = fij co-occurrences of vi and vj
in the null model. equivalently, the p-value associated to
k   r p(k), where p(k) is the
id203 of k co-occurrences of vi and vj in the random
text. to compute p(k), we followed the approach devised
in [21]. if n1 = fi and n2 = fj, p(k) can be computed as

the quantity k = fij is p =(cid:80)

p(k) =

(n ; k, n1     k, n2     k)

(n ; n1)(n ; n2)

where (x; y1, . . . , y2) is a simpli   ed notation:

therefore, the p-value associated to the number of ob-
served co-occurrences is [21]

note that the value p(k) de   ned in the above equation
can be used to establish links between entities whose co-
occurrence frequency is signi   cant.

results and discussion.     in this section, the topo-
logical properties of ne networks are investigated. in ad-
dition, we apply the proposed networked representation
to tackle a natural language processing task related to
anaphora (or co-reference) resolution. the dataset used
in the experiments is shown in table s2 of the si. the list
comprises romances by distinct authors. all books were
retrieved from the project gutenberg dataset3.

statistical properties of named entities networks.

to
probe the topological properties of ne networks, the fol-
lowing quantities were computed: the number of nodes
(n ), the average degree ((cid:104)k(cid:105)), the id91 coe   cient
((cid:104)c(cid:105)) and the average shortest path length ((cid:104)l(cid:105)). in order
to compare the properties of ne and random networks, the
values of id91 coe   cient and average shortest path
length in equivalent random networks were also computed
as:

(cid:104)c(cid:105)r = (cid:104)k(cid:105)/n,
(cid:104)l(cid:105)r = log n.

the results obtained for selected books of our dataset are
shown in table 1. the results for the full dataset are
shown in table s3 of the si. note that, di   erently from
traditional language networks where the number of nodes
is proportional to the vocabulary size [9, 10, 22, 23], in this
case, the total number of nodes (i.e. the number of enti-
ties) is much lower. from a qualitative point of view, ne
and small-world networks share similar topological prop-
erties, because in most cases (cid:104)c(cid:105) (cid:29) (cid:104)c(cid:105)r and (cid:104)l(cid:105) (cid:39) (cid:104)l(cid:105)r.
even though the zipf   s law may play a role in the ob-
served small-world e   ect, the equivalence between these
two e   ects is not straightforward because, in the proposed
model, we consider segments of texts, where a quantity of
k entity occurrences does not imply the formation of k
edges. in addition, note that many entity occurrences tend
not to be translated into an edge because of the bursti-
ness e   ect, which is specially prominent in words denoting
named entities [24]. an example of ne network is shown
in fig. s5 of the si. as expected, central characters play a
prominent role on the networked model. another impor-
tant feature of ne networks is their modular structure. in
fig. 1, we show the modular structure unfolded with tra-
ditional community structure methods [25] (see also fig.
s4 of the si). this modular structure has been noted in
most of the studied networks.

in order to show how the network representation might
provide complementary information for text analysis, we
studied the problem of identifying the most central enti-
ties. as an example, we used the book middlemarch, by
george eliot. the following network centrality measure-
ments were computed: betweenness centrality, id95

table 1: statistical properties of ne networks.
in most of
the networks, the id91 coe   cient is higher than the same
quantity observed in equivalent random networks. with re-
gard to the average shortest path lengths, the values observed
in real and equivalent random networks are similar. concern-
ing the di   erences across books, we have identi   ed that most
   uctuations arise from the di   erence in network size (result not
shown). however, in speci   c cases (such as the value of (cid:104)k(cid:105) in
man and per), the statistical di   erences are signi   cative, as
a consequence of distinct authors    styles. such di   erences could
be explored in further studies aiming at identifying authorship
in texts.

and accessibility. the betweenness is a global measure-
ment that computes the number of shortest paths passing
through nodes. the id95 is a global centrality mea-
surement that considers that a node is relevant whenever
it is connected to other relevant nodes. finally, the acces-
sibility is a local measurement which can be understood
as an extension of the degree connectivity as it quanti   es
the e   ective number of neighbors at a distance h from the
reference node [26]. mathematically, the accessibility (  )
is de   ned as

(cid:16)    (cid:88)

(cid:17)

  (h)(i) = exp

p(h)
ij

ln p(h)
ij

,

(8)

where p(h)
is the id203 of a random walker to go
ij
from node i to node j in h steps. all three network cen-
trality indices were compared with the raw frequency of
appearance of the respective entities in the books. in ta-
ble 2, we show in decreasing order the 10 most relevant
entities obtained with the frequency and the accessibility
measurement. the most relevant entities obtained with
the betweenness and id95 are shown in table s5 of
the si. as for the betweenness centrality, the six most rel-
evant entities are the same as the ones obtained with the
simple frequency. however, the entities appearing between
seventh and tenth positions are low frequency entities that,
nonetheless, are located in privileged network position. a
similar behavior can be observed for the id95 index:
top relevant entities are also very frequent, even though
some low frequency entities are important because they
are a few hops away from the most relevant nodes. the
most relevant entities captured by the accessibility index
(computed for h = 2) turned out to be less in   uenced by
the frequency. note, for example, that farebrother is the

house, a novel by charles dickens. the    ve largest communi-
ties are highlighted. the communities were obtained with the
fastgreedy optmization of the modularity [25].

character with the highest e   ective number of neighbors at
the second level, even though it is only the tenth most fre-
quent entity in the book. in fact, a correlation analysis of
less frequent entities showed that the relevance of entities
according to topological indices may not be predicted by
frequency alone (result not shown). by no means we are
suggesting that network measurements are more relevant
than traditional frequency indices. we rather suggest that
network measurements could be included as an additional
feature to analyze e.g. the complexity of book plots and
literary movements [27   30].

identifying patterns in ne networks: application to
id2. to show how the proposed network
representation might be useful in a real application, we
addressed the anaphora (or co-reference) resolution prob-
lem [32] (see a brief description of traditional methods in
section s4 of the si). in this task, we aim at identifying
the entity related to an unde   ned reference in the text.
to illustrate the problem, consider the following example:
   the ordinance was published by ricardo and borsari, who
are responsible for the management of water resources in
the state. in the document, he points out the critical situ-
ation of water in the region.    note that, in this case, the
objective of a system aiming at id2 is to
relate    who    and    he    to either    ricardo    or    borsari    .
the following methodology was applied to tackle the
id2 problem. di   erently from the train-
ing phase (see section    extracting networks from books   ),
in this phase (classi   cation phase), each unknown entity
(e.g.    who    or    he    in the previous example) was mod-
elled as a di   erent node in the network. as such, the

novel by george eliot) according to two centrality measure-
ments. while frequency is obtained from simple word counts,
the accessibility measurement is obtained from ne networks.
note that the most frequent entities assume di   erent levels of
relevance in the network according to the accessibility.

network comprises nodes belonging to the set of unknown
(e?) and known (e!) entities.
in other words, the    nal
networks in this task contain vertices of di   erent linguis-
tic provenance, i.e. while some vertices represent known
named entities; others model unknown references. we
measured all possible pairwise similarities between enti-
ties vi     e? and vj     e!. therefore, unknown references
were characterized by their similarity to the others entities
in the book. in the baseline approach based on simple co-
occurrence statistics (coo), which does not consider the
global topology of networks, each vi     e? is considered to
be similar only to those entities vj     e! that appeared in
the same text window. mathematically, the similarity fij
between vi     e? and vj     es in the baseline approach is
computed as de   ned in equation 1.

the co-occurrence approach is based on the premise
that the references to unknown entities tend to occur in
the same context, thus surrounding characters, locations
and organizations tend to be the same. however, the co-
occurrence approach only takes into account local infor-
mation to measure the similarity between entities, which
may lead to a large loss of relevant information. a more
informed approach can consider the full network topology
to quantify the pairwise similarities and thus improve the
characterization of the context around a entity. here, we
used the katz similarity [1], which is de   ned as:

   =

  mam = (i       a)   1,

(9)

i=0

1

where i is the identity matrix and    is a positive constant.
if   1 is the leading eigenvalue of a,    must satisfy    <
     1
if equation 9 is to converge [1]. we also considered a
variation of the katz similarity (    ) that does not consider
the bias toward highly connected nodes. mathematically,
the similarity      between two nodes vi     e? and vj     e! is

   (cid:88)

given by:

(cid:88)

k

  
fi

    ij =

aik     kj +   ij,

(10)

where   ij accounts for the self-similarity term and is de-
   ned as   ij = 1, if vi = vj; and   ij = 0, otherwise.
in
matrix terms,      is written as

     = (d       a)   1d,

(11)

where d is the diagonal matrix with elements dij = fi, if
vi = vj; and dij = 0; otherwise. note that both measure-
ments    and      make use of the full network structure to
compute pairwise similarities. this is evident when one in-
terprets the quantity am as the matrix storing the number
of paths of length m between two nodes [1]. an example
of identi   cation of unknown entities in a toy network is
discussed in section s3 of the si.

in our real dataset, we addressed the anaphora resolu-
tion task where two possible entities are candidates in a
unsolved reference. this problem can be modelled as a su-
pervised classi   cation task [31] with two possible classes
(see de   nitions in section s1 of the si). the pairs of eval-
uated entities are shown in the second column of table 3.
the best average accuracy rates obtained in our selected
dataset are shown in table 3. for each pair of entities,
we show the performance obtained with the traditional
method based on co-occurrence statistics (coo, see equa-
tion 1) and with methods making use of network similarity
measures, as de   ned in equation 9 (katz similarity). the
results obtained with the normalized katz similarity (see
equation 11) were no better than the ones obtained with
the non-normalized version, as shown in table s4 of the si.
note that the use of global network information was able
to improve the characterization of unsolved references, as
revealed by higher accuracy indexes obtained with non-
local network measurements when compared to the tra-
ditional method based on simple co-occurrence statistics.
this means that the co-occurrence with speci   c entities
might be useful to discriminate unknown entities whenever
the test instance tend to appear in a community domi-
nated by a speci   c entity. in fact, a systematic error anal-
ysis performed in our dataset revealed that most of the
errors occur when distinct entities in the training dataset
appear in the same community. another recurrent error
occurs when the test instance appears between two com-
munities dominated by distinct entities (see section s5 of
the si). this result con   rms the importance of the pat-
terns unveiled by the proposed networked representation,
which were hidden from traditional models.
comparison with other

traditional
id2 methods not relying on any network
information was also performed, and the results are pro-
vided in table s6 of the si. in general, our networked ap-
proach performed better than other statistical approaches.
in light of the results obtained with ne networks draw-
ing on the katz measurement to quantify similarity be-
tween unknown references, we advocate that topological

conclusion.     in this study, we have introduced a
model to form named entities networks,
i.e. networks
whose nodes denote people, locations and organizations.
unlike current networked representations of written texts,
our model focused on the complexity arising from non-
trivial co-occurrences between entities alone.
in other
words, we disregarded linguistic/stylist in   uences of the
language on the construction of the networks. from this
point of view, ne networks can be understood as a comple-
mentary form of text representation. a topological analy-
sis performed on novels revealed that ne networks display
high-id91 and low typical shortest path lengths, a
similar behavior found in other textual and non-textual
networks. another interesting    nding arising from the
topological analysis of our model is that ne networks
can unveil patterns that cannot be unveiled with tradi-
tional methods based on simple word count statistics. this
was clear in the application of ne networks for identify-
ing unknown references in texts. particularly, the char-
acterization textual relying upon ne networks outper-
formed the traditional representation based on statistical
co-occurrence analysis. we believe that the performance
of applications using ne networks could be improved with
further development of enhanced automatic entity rec-
ognizers, which could treat referential opacities [33] and
entities with multiple aliases (e.g.    morning star    and
   evening star   ) [34].

ne networks turned out to play a complementary role
in the characterization of written texts. while traditional
approaches neglect the rich information underlying net-
worked representations, our model is able to capture this
type of information concerning the interactions between
relevant entities. given the variety of current applications
and representations making use of networks in texts [9],
we believe that the use of ne networks might be useful to

recover language-independent patterns. from a practical
point of view, the model could also lead to improved per-
formances for recognizing styles, authorship, quality and
plagiarisms in a higher level of abstraction.
