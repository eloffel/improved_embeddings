abstract. a commentary on the article    large-scale evidence of dependency length minimization in 37 

 
central to the inspiring contributions of e. gibson and collaborators to language research is the 
idea that a wide range of phenomena, e.g., ambiguity resolution, parsing difficulties or even our 
notion  of  sentence     grammaticality   ,  could  be  manifestations  of  a  principle  of  dependency 
length minimization (e.g., references to gibson   s work of futrell, mahowald, & gibson, 2015), 
in stark contrast to the view of generative linguistics at least. 

in a recent study of impressive breadth, futrell, mahowald and gibson (2015) have provided 
evidence of dependency length minimization across languages by means of various baselines. 
paradoxically, the random baselines incorporate constraints on word order that are likely to be 
consequences of the very principle of dependency length minimization. futrell et al. argue that 
their    free word order baseline    does not obey any particular word order rule, however, it is 
not  actually  free  because  crossing  dependencies  are  not  allowed.  a  truly  free  word  order 
baseline, and indeed a fully null hypothesis, is one where the n! possible linearizations of the n 
units (words) of a sentence are allowed a priori, as in the pioneering research on dependency 
length minimization by ferrer-i-cancho that futrell et al. (2015) cite. furthermore, a large body 
of theoretical and empirical research strongly suggests that non-crossing dependencies arise as a 
side effect of pressure to reduce dependency lengths (see g  mez-rodr  guez & ferrer-i-cancho 
2016, ferrer-i-cancho & g  mez-rodr  guez, 2015 and references therein). 

therefore,  investigating  dependency  length  minimization  with  random  baselines  or  an 
   optimal baseline    where crossings are not allowed is not only theoretically superficial, but also 
unnecessarily complicated and most worryingly, indicates subordination to the division between

competence and performance, a dogma of generative linguistics that gibson and collaborators 
have  challenged  in  the  past.  futrell  et  al.   s     consistent  head  direction  baseline     is  another 
example of baseline that is likely to incorporate dependency length minimization in its very de-
finition: consistent head direction might be a consequence of dependency length minimization 
(ferrer-i-cancho, 2015a, 2015b). for instance, once the verb is placed last (as in sov order), 
dependency length minimization predicts that, consistently, the dependents of the nominal heads 
of  s  and  o  should  precede  their  heads.  similar  arguments  can  be  made  for  the     fixed  word 
order  baseline   :  dependency  length  minimization  predicts  the  relative  placements  for  certain 
dependencies, e.g. adjectives with respect to their nominal heads, verbal auxiliaries with respect 
to their verbal heads, and so on (ferrer-i-cancho, 2015a). 

surprisingly, futrell et al. take for granted dogmas behind principles and parameters theory, 
where the consistent branching is assumed (not explained) and its direction is determined by a 
parameter. in contrast, tendencies for consistent branching and its direction are less parameter-
consuming predictions of a mathematical theory of dependency length minimization (ferrer-i-
cancho, 2015a, 2015b). 

in sum, futrell et al.   s research on dependency length minimization is an example of radical 
empirical research that attempts to remain theoretically agnostic but, paradoxically, turns out to 
gullibly  accept  tenets  of  theoretical  linguistics  of  the  past  century.  those  tenets  can  be  sum-
marized  as  a  belief  in  the  existence  of  word  order  constraints  that  cannot  be  explained  by 
evolutionary processes or requirements of performance or learning, and instead require either (a) 
heavy  assumptions  that  compromise  the  parsimony  of  linguistic  theory  as  a  whole  or  (b)  ex-
planations based on internal constraints of obscure nature. 

our commentary has focused on the problems of futrell et al.   s analysis for the construction 
of a general theory of language that is both highly predictive and parsimonius. other issues have 
been reviewed by liu, xu, and liang (2016).
