abstract

morpho-syntactic lexicons provide informa-
tion about the morphological and syntactic
roles of words in a language. such lexicons
are not available for all languages and even
when available, their coverage can be limited.
we present a graph-based semi-supervised
learning method that uses the morphologi-
cal, syntactic and semantic relations between
words to automatically construct wide cover-
age lexicons from small seed sets. our method
is language-independent, and we show that we
can expand a 1000 word seed lexicon to more
than 100 times its size with high quality for
11 languages. in addition, the automatically
created lexicons provide features that improve
performance in two downstream tasks: mor-
phological tagging and id33.

introduction

lexicons

contain information
morpho-syntactic
the morphological attributes and syntactic
about
roles of words in a given language. a typical lexicon
contains all possible attributes that can be displayed
by a word. table 1 shows some entries in a sample
english morpho-syntactic lexicon. as these lexicons
contain rich linguistic information, they are useful
as features in downstream nlp tasks like machine
translation (nie  en and ney, 2004; minkov et al.,
2007; green and denero, 2012), part of speech tag-
ging (schmid, 1994; denis and sagot, 2009; moore,
2015), id33 (goldberg et al., 2009),
id38 (arisoy et al., 2010) and mor-
phological tagging (m  uller and schuetze, 2015) in-
ter alia. there are three major factors that limit the
use of such lexicons in real world applications: (1)

they are often constructed manually and are expen-
sive to obtain (kokkinakis et al., 2000; dukes and
habash, 2010); (2) they are currently available for
only a few languages; and (3) size of available lexi-
cons is generally small.

in this paper, we present a method that takes as in-
put a small seed lexicon, containing a few thousand
annotated words, and outputs an automatically con-
structed lexicon which contains morpho-syntactic
attributes (henceforth referred to as attributes) for
a large number of words of a given language. we
model the problem of morpho-syntactic lexicon gen-
eration as a graph-based semi-supervised learning
problem (zhu, 2005; bengio et al., 2006; subra-
manya and talukdar, 2014). we construct a graph
where nodes represent word types and the goal is
to label them with attributes. the seed lexicon pro-
vides attributes for a subset of these nodes. nodes
are connected to each other through edges that de-
note features shared between them or surface mor-
phological transformation between them.

our entire framework of lexicon generation, in-
cluding the label propagation algorithm and the fea-
ture extraction module is language independent. we
only use word-level morphological, semantic and
syntactic relations between words that can be in-
duced from unannotated corpora in an unsuper-

of our model. we construct a graph in which nodes
are word types and directed edges are present be-
tween nodes that share one or more features. edges
between nodes denote that there might be a relation-
ship between the attributes of the two nodes, which
we intend to learn. as we want to keep our model
language independent, we use edge features that can
be induced between words without using any lan-
guage speci   c tools. to this end, we describe three
features in this section that can be obtained using
unlabeled corpora for any given language.1 fig. 1
shows a subgraph of the full graph constructed for
english.

word clusters. previous work has shown that un-
labeled text can be used to induce unsupervised
word clusters which can improve the performance
of many nlp tasks in different languages (clark,
2003; koo et al., 2008; turian et al., 2010; faruqui
and pad  o, 2010; t  ackstr  om et al., 2012; owoputi
et al., 2013). word clusters capture semantic and
syntactic similarities between words, for example,
play and run are present in the same cluster. we
obtain word clusters by using exchange id91
algorithm (kneser and ney, 1993; martin et al.,
1998; uszkoreit and brants, 2008) on large unla-
beled corpus of every language. as in t  ackstr  om et
al. (2012), we use one year of news articles scrapped
from a variety of sources and cluster only the most
frequent 1m words into 256 different clusters. an
edge was introduced for every word pair sharing the
same word cluster and a feature for the cluster is
   red. thus, there are 256 possible cluster features
on an edge, though in our case only a single one can
   re.

suf   x & pre   x. suf   xes are often strong indi-
cators of the morpho-syntactic attributes of a word
(ratnaparkhi, 1996; clark, 2003). for example, in
english, -ing denotes gerund verb forms like, study-
ing, playing and -ed denotes past tense like studied,
played etc. pre   xes like un-, in- often denote ad-
jectives. thus we include both 2-gram and 3-gram

1some of these features can cause the graph to become very
dense making label propagation prohibitive. we keep the size
of the graph in check by only allowing a word node to be con-
nected to at most 100 other (randomly selected) word nodes
sharing one particular feature. this reduces edges while still
keeping the graph connected.

between words. some possible features/edges have been

vised manner. one particularly novel aspect of
our graph-based framework is that edges are fea-
turized. some of these features measure similarity,
e.g., singular nouns tend to occur in similar distri-
butional contexts as other singular nouns, but some
also measure transformations from one in   ection to
another, e.g., adding a    s    suf   x could indicate    ip-
ping the num:sing attribute to num:plur (in en-
glish). for every attribute to be propagated, we learn
weights over features on the edges separately. this
is in contrast to traditional label propagation, where
edges indicate similarity exclusively (zhu, 2005).

we construct lexicons in 11 languages of vary-
ing morphological complexity. we perform intrin-
sic evaluation of the quality of generated lexicons
obtained from either the universal dependency tree-
bank or created manually by humans (  4). we show
that these automatically created lexicons provide
useful features in two extrinsic nlp tasks which re-
quire identifying the contextually plausible morpho-
logical and syntactic roles: morphological tagging
(haji  c and hladk  a, 1998; haji  c, 2000) and syntactic
id33 (k  ubler et al., 2009). we ob-
tain an average of 15.4% and 5.3% error reduction
across 11 languages for morphological tagging and
id33 respectively on a set of publicly
available treebanks (  5). we anticipate that the lexi-
cons thus created will be useful in a variety of nlp
problems.

2 graph construction

the approach we take propagates information over
lexical graphs (  3). in this section we describe how
to construct the graph that serves as the backbone

playplayedplayingrunrunningclus:20pre   x:pl, suf   x:{null}:edpre   x:plsuf   x:ing:edclus:15suf   x:ingsuf   x:{null}:ningpre   x:plsuf   x:{null}:ingsuf   x and pre   x as edge features.2 we introduce an
edge between two words sharing a particular suf   x
or pre   x feature.
morphological transformations. soricut
and
och (2015) presented an unsupervised method of
inducing pre   x- and suf   x-based morphological
transformations between words using word embed-
dings.
in their method, statistically, most of the
transformations are induced between words with the
same lemma (without using any prior information
about the word lemma). for example, their method
induces the transformation between played and
playing as suf   x:ed:ing.
this feature indicates
tense:past to turn off and tense:pres to turn
on.3 we train the morphological transformation
prediction tool of soricut and och (2015) on the
news corpus (same as the one used for training word
clusters) for each language. an edge is introduced
between two words that exhibit a morphological
transformation feature from one word to another as
indicated by the tool   s output.
motivation for the model. to motivate our
model, consider the words played and playing. they
have a common attribute pos:verb but they differ
in tense, showing tense:past and tense:pres
resp. typical graph-propagation algorithms model
similarity (zhu, 2005) and thus propagate all at-
tributes along the edges. however, we want to model
if an attribute should propagate or change across an
edge. for example, having a shared cluster feature,
is an indication of similar pos tag (clark, 2003;
koo et al., 2008; turian et al., 2010), but a sur-
face morphological transformation feature like suf-
   x:ed:ing possibly indicates a change in the tense
of the word. thus, we will model attributes prop-
agation/transformation as a function of the features
shared on the edges between words. the features
described in this section are specially suitable for
languages that exhibit concatenative morphology,
like english, german, greek etc. and might not
work very well with languages that exhibit non-
concatenative morphology i.e, where root modi   ca-
tion is highly frequent like in arabic and hebrew.

2we only include those suf   x and pre   x which appear at

least twice in the seed lexicon.
tense:past: 1     -1, tense:present: -1     1 (  3).

3our model will

learn the following transformation:

however, it is important to note that our framework
is not limited to just the features described here, but
can incorporate any arbitrary information over word
pairs (  8).

3 graph-based label propagation

let w =
we now describe our model.
{w1, w2, . . . , w|w|} be the vocabulary with |w|
words and a = {a1, a2, . . . , a|a|} be the set
of lexical attributes that words in w can ex-
press; e.g. w = {played, playing, . . .} and
a = {num:sing, num:plur, tense:past, . . .}.
each word type w     w is associated with a vec-
tor aw     [   1, 1]|a|, where ai,w = 1 indicates that
word w has attribute i and ai,w =    1 indicates its
absence; values in between are treated as degrees of
uncertainty. for example, tense:pastplayed = 1
and tense:pastplaying =    1.4
the vocabulary w is divided into two disjoint
subsets, the labeled words l for which we know
their aw   s (obtained from seed lexicon)5 and the un-
labeled words u whose attributes are unknown. in
general |u| (cid:29) |l|. the words in w are organized
into a directed graph with edges e between words.
let, vector   (w, v)     [0, 1]|f| denote the features
on the directed edge between words w and v, with
1 indicating the presence and 0 the absence of fea-
ture fk     f, where, f = {f1, f2, . . . , f|f|} are the
set of possible binary features shared between two
words in the graph. for example, the features on
edges between played and playing from fig. 1 are:

  k(played, playing) =

iffk = suf   x:ed:ing
iffk = pre   x:pl
iffk = suf   x:ly

                                 

1,
1,
0,
. . .

we seek to determine which subsets of a are valid
for each word w     w. we learn how a particular
attribute of a node is a function of that particular
attribute of its neighboring nodes and features on the
edge connecting them. let ai,w be an attribute of
word w and let   ai,w be the empirical estimate of that
4we constrain ai,w     [   1, 1] as its easier to model the    ip-

ping of an attribute value from    1 to 1 as opposed to [0, 1].

5we use labeled, seed, and training lexicon to mean the same

thing interchangeably.

figure 2: word graph with edges between words showing the labeled (grey) and the unlabeled (white) word nodes.
only nodes connected via solid edges are visible to each other, dotted edges block visibility. this    gure demonstrates
interaction between nodes during model estimation (left), label propagation (center), and paradigm projection (right).

attribute paradigm to which the empirical vector is projected.

attribute. we posit that   ai,w can be estimated from
the neighbors n (w) of w as follows:

  ai,w = tanh

(  (w, v)      i)    ai,v

       (1)

       (cid:88)

v   n (w)

where,   i     r|f| is weight vector of the edge fea-
tures for estimating attribute ai.          represents dot
product betwen two vectors. we use tanh as the non-
linearity to make sure that   ai,w     [   1, 1]. the set of
such weights        r|a|  |f| for all attributes are the
model parameters that we learn. our graph resem-
bles the ising model, which is a lattice model pro-
posed for describing intermolecular forces (ising,
1925), and eq. 1 solves the naive mean    eld approx-
imation of the ising model (wang et al., 2007).
intuitively, one can view the node to node mes-
sage function from v to w:   (w, v)    i  ai,v as either
(1) supporting the value ai,v when   (w, v)      i > 0;
(2) inverting ai,v when   (w, v)      i < 0; or (3)
dampening or neutering ai,v when   (w, v)      i     0.
returning to our motivation, if w = played and
v = playing, a feature indicating the suf   x sub-
stitution suf   x:ed:ing should have a highly nega-
tive weight for tense:past, indicating a change in
value. this is because tense:past = -1 for play-
ing, and a negative value of   (w, v)      i will push it
to positive for played.

it should be noted that this framework for con-
structing lexicons does not explicitly distinguish
between morpho-syntactic paradigms, but simply
identi   es all possible attribute-values a word can
if we consider an example like    games   
take.
and two attributes,
the syntactic part-of-speech,
pos, and number, num, games can either be 1)
{pos:verb, num:sing}, as in john games the
system; or {pos:noun, num:plur}, as in the
games have started. our framework will mereley
return that all the above attribute-values are possi-
ble, which implies that the singluar noun and plu-
ral verb interpretations are valid. one possible way
to account for this is to make full morphological
paradigms the    attributes    in or model. but this
leads to slower runtimes and sparser learning. we
leave as future work extensions to full paradigm pre-
diction.

our framework has three critical components,
each described below:
(1) model estimation, i.e.,
learning   ; (2) label propagation to u; and option-
ally (3) paradigm projection to known valid morpho-
logical paradigms. the overall procedure is illus-
trated in figure 2 and made concrete in algorithm 1.

3.1 model estimation
we estimate all individual elements of an attribute
vector using eq. 1. we de   ne loss as the squared loss
between the empirical and observed attribute vectors

<1, -1,    , -1><0, 0,    , 0><0.2, 0.1,    , 0.9><1, -1,    , -1><0.2, 0.1,    , 0.9><-1, -1,    , -1><1, 1,    , 1><1, -1,    , 1><1, 1,    , -1>data: w, l, u, a, f, p

can be computed as:(cid:88)

we train the edge feature weights    by minimiz-
ing the id168 in eq. 2. in this step, we only
use labeled nodes and the edge connections between
labeled nodes. as such, this is strictly a supervised
learning setup. we minimize the id168 using
online adaptive id119 (duchi et al., 2011)
with (cid:96)2 id173 on the feature weights   . this
is the    rst step in algorithm 1 (lines 1   4).

3.2 label propagation
in the second step, we use the learned weights
of the edge features to estimate the attribute val-
ues over unlabeled nodes iteratively. the attribute
vector of all unlabeled words is initialized to null,
   w     u, aw = (cid:104)0, 0, . . . , 0(cid:105). in every iteration, an
unlabeled node estimates its empirical attributes by
looking at the corresponding attributes of its labeled
and unlabeled neighbors using eq. 1, thus this is

the semi-supervised step. we stop after the squared
euclidean distance between the attribute vectors at
two consecutive iterations for a node becomes less
than 0.1 (averaged over all unlabeled nodes). this
is the second step in algorithm 1 (lines 5   7). after
convergence, we can directly obtain attributes for a
word by thresholding: a word w is said to possess an
attribute ai if ai,w > 0.

3.3 paradigm projection
since a word can be labeled with multiple lexical at-
tributes, this is a multi-label classi   cation problem.
for such a task, several advanced methods that take
into account the correlation between attributes have
been proposed (ghamrawi and mccallum, 2005;
tsoumakas and katakis, 2006; f  urnkranz et al.,
2008; read et al., 2011), here we have adopted
the binary relevance method which trains a classi-
   er for every attribute independently of the other at-
tributes, for its simplicity (godbole and sarawagi,
2004; zhang and zhou, 2005).

however, as the decision for the presence of an
attribute over a word is independent of all the other
attributes, the    nal set of attributes obtained for a
word in   3.2 might not be a valid paradigm.6 for ex-
ample, a word cannot only exhibit the two attributes
pos:noun and tense:past, since the presence of
the tense attribute implies pos:verb should also
be true. further, we want to utilize the inherent
correlations between attribute labels to obtain bet-
ter solutions. we thus present an alternative, simpler
method to account for this problem. to ensure that
we obtain a valid attribute paradigm, we project the
empirical attribute vector obtained after propagation
to the space of all valid paradigms.
we    rst collect all observed and thus valid at-
tribute paradigms from the seed lexicon (p =
{aw|w     l}). we replace the empirical at-
tribute vector obtained in   3.2 by a valid attribute
paradigm vector which is nearest to it according to
euclidean distance. this projection step is inspired
from the decoding step in label-space transforma-
tion approaches to multilabel classi   cation (hsu et
al., 2009; ferng and lin, 2011; zhang and schnei-
der, 2011). this is the last step in algorithm 1 (lines
8   14). we investigate for each language if paradigm

6a paradigm is de   ned as a set of attributes.

projection is helpful (  4.1).
intrinsic evaluation
4
to ascertain how our graph-propagation framework
predicts morphological attributes for words, we pro-
vide an intrinsic evaluation where we compare pre-
dicted attributes to gold lexicons that have been ei-
ther read off from a treebank or derived manually.

4.1 dependency treebank lexicons
the universal dependency treebank (mcdonald et
al., 2013; de marneffe et al., 2014; agi  c et al., 2015)
contains dependency annotations for sentences and
morpho-syntactic annotations for words in context
for a number of languages.7 a word can display dif-
ferent attributes depending on its role in a sentence.
in order to create morpho-syntactic lexicon for ev-
ery language, we take the union of all the attributes
that the word realizes in the entire treebank. al-
though, it is possible that this lexicon might not con-
tain all realizable attributes if a particular attribute
or paradigm is not seen in the treebank (we address
this issue in   4.2). the utility of evaluating against
treebank derived lexicons is that it allows us to eval-
uate on a large set of languages.
in particular, in
the universal dependency treebanks v1.1 (agi  c et al.,

7we use version 1.1 released in may 2015.

2015), 11 diverse languages contain the morphology
layer, including romance, germanic and slavic lan-
guages plus isolates like basque and greek.

we use the train/dev/test set of the treebank to cre-
ate training (seed),8 development and test lexicons
for each language. we exclude words from the dev
and test lexicon that have been seen in seed lexicon.
for every language, we create a graph with the fea-
tures described in   2 with words in the seed lexicon
as labeled nodes. the words from development and
test set are included as unlabeled nodes for the prop-
agation stage.9 table 2 shows statistics about the
constructed graph for different languages.10

we perform feature selection and hyperparame-
ter tuning by optimizing prediction on words in the
development lexicon and then report results on the
test lexicon. the decision whether paradigm projec-
tion (  3.3) is useful or not is also taken by tuning
performance on the development lexicon. table 3
shows the features that were selected for each lan-
guage. now, for every word in the test lexicon we
obtain predicted lexical attributes from the graph.
for a given attribute, we count the number of words
for which it was correctly predicted (true positive),
wrongly predicted (false positive) and not predicted
(false negative). aggregating these counts over all
attributes (a), we compute the micro-averaged f1
score and achieve 74.3% on an average across 11
languages (cf. table 4). note that this systemati-
cally underestimates performance due to the effect
of missing attributes/paradigms that were not ob-
served in the treebank.

propagated lexicons. the last column in table 2
shows the number of words in the propagated lexi-
con, and the    rst column shows the number of words
in the seed lexicon. the ratio of the size of propa-
gated and seed lexicon is different across languages,
which presumably depends on how densely con-
nected each language   s graph is. for example, for

8we only include those words in the seed lexicon that occur

at least twice in the training set of the treebank.

9words from the news corpus used for word id91 are

also used as unlabeled nodes.

10note that the size of the constructed lexicon (cf. table 2)
is always less than or equal to the total number of unlabeled
nodes in the graph because some unlabeled nodes are not able
to collect enough mass for acquiring an attribute i.e,    a     a :
aw < 0 and thus they remain unlabeled (cf.   3.2).

word cluster and the surface morphological transfor-
mation features. this essentially translates to hav-
ing a graph that consists of small connected com-
ponents of words having the same lemma (discov-
ered in an unsupervised manner) with semantic links
connecting such components using word cluster fea-
tures. suf   x features are useful for highly in   ected
languages like czech and greek, while the pre   x
feature is only useful for czech. overall, the se-
lected edge features for different languages corre-
spond well to the morphological structure of these
languages (dryer, 2013).

corpus baseline. we compare our results to a
corpus-based method of obtaining morpho-syntactic
lexicons. we hypothesize that if we use a morpho-
logical tagger of reasonable quality to tag the entire
wikipedia corpus of a language and take the union of
all the attributes for a word type across all its occur-
rences in the corpus, then we can acquire all possible
attributes for a given word. hence, producing a lex-
icon of reasonable quality. moore (2015) used this
technique to obtain a high quality tag dictionary for

pos-tagging. we thus train a morphological tagger
(detail in   5.1) on the training portion of the depen-
dency treebank and use it to tag the entire wikipedia
corpus. for every word, we add an attribute to the
lexicon if it has been seen at least k times for the
word in the corpus, where k     [2, 20]. this thresh-
old on the frequency of the word-attribute pair helps
prevent noisy judgements. we tune k for each lan-
guage on the development set and report results on
the test set in table 4. we call this method the cor-
pus baseline. it can be seen that for every language
we outperform this baseline, which on average has
an f1 score of 67.1%.

4.2 manually curated lexicons
we have now showed that its possible to automat-
ically construct large lexicons from smaller seed
lexicons. however, the seed lexicons used in   4.1
have been arti   cally constructed from aggregating
attributes of word types over the treebank. thus, it

included.

can be argued that these constructed lexicons might
not be complete i.e, the lexicon might not exhibit all
possible attributes for a given word. on the other
hand, manually curated lexicons are unavailable for
many languages, inhibiting proper evaluation.

to test the utility of our approach on manually cu-
rated lexicons, we investigate publicly available lex-
icons for finnish (pirinen, 2011), czech (haji  c and
hladk  a, 1998) and hungarian (tr  on et al., 2006).
we eliminate numbers and punctuation from all lex-
icons. for each of these languages, we select 10000
words for training and the rest of the word types for
evaluation. we train models obtained in   4.1 for a
given language using suf   x, brown and morpholog-
ical transformation features with paradigm projec-
tion. the only difference is the source of the seed
lexicon and test set. results are reported in table 5
averaged over 10 different randomly selected seed
set for every language. for each language we ob-
tain more than 70% f1 score and on an average ob-
tain 79.7%. critically, the f1 score on human cu-
rated lexicons is higher for each language than the
treebank constructed lexicons, in some cases as high
as 9% absolute. this shows that the average 74.3%
f1 score across all 11 languages is likely underesti-
mated.

5 extrinsic evaluation

we now show that the automatically generated lex-
icons provide informative features that are useful in
two downstream nlp tasks: morphological tagging
(  5.1) and syntactic id33 (  5.2).
5.1 morphological tagging
morphological tagging is the task of assigning a
morphological reading to a token in context. the
morphological reading consists of features such as
part of speech, case, gender, person,
tense etc.

cal tagging: without using any lexicon (none), with seed
lexicon (seed), with propagated lexicon (propagation).

(o   azer and kuru  oz, 1994; haji  c and hladk  a,
1998). the model we use is a standard atomic se-
quence classi   er, that classi   es the morphological
bundle for each word independent of the others (with
the exception of features derived from these words).
speci   cally, we use a linear id166 model classi   er
with hand tuned features. this is similar to com-
monly used analyzers like id166tagger (gim  enez
and marquez, 2004) and matetagger (bohnet and
nivre, 2012).

our taggers are trained in a language independent
manner (haji  c, 2000; smith et al., 2005; m  uller et
al., 2013). the list of features used in training the
tagger are listed in table 6. in addition to the stan-
dard features, we use the morpho-syntactic attributes
present in the lexicon for every word as features in
the tagger. as shown in m  uller and schuetze (2015),
this is typically the most important feature for mor-
phological tagging, even more useful than clusters
or id27s. while predicting the contex-
tual morphological tags for a given word, the mor-
phological attributes present in the lexicon for the
current word, the previous word and the next word
are used as features.

we use the same 11 languages from the univer-
sal dependency treebanks (agi  c et al., 2015) that
contain morphological tags to train and evaluate the
morphological taggers. we use the pre-speci   ed
train/dev/test splits that come with the data. ta-

attributes for each language on the test lexicon. the
three columns show the f1 score of the tagger when
no lexicon is used; when the seed lexicon derived
from the training data is used; and when label prop-
agation is applied.

overall, using lexicons provides a signi   cant im-
provement in accuracy, even when just using the
seed lexicon. for 9 out of 11 languages, the high-
est accuracy is obtained using the lexicon derived
from graph propagation. in some cases the gain is
quite substantial, e.g., 94.6%     95.9% for bulgar-
ian. overall there is 1.0% and 0.3% absolute im-
provement over the baseline and seed resp., which
corresponds roughly to a 15% and 5% relative re-
duction in error.
it is not surprising that the seed
lexicon performs on par with the derived lexicon
for some languages, as it is derived from the train-
ing corpus, which likely contains the most frequent
words of the language.

5.2 id33
we train dependency parsers for the same 11 uni-
versal dependency treebanks that contain the mor-
phological layer (agi  c et al., 2015). we again use
the supplied train/dev/test split of the dependency
treebank to develop the models. our parsing model
is the transition-based parsing system of zhang and
nivre (2011) with identical features and a beam of
size 8.

we augment the features of zhang and nivre

figure 3: micro-average f1 score on test lexicon while
using varying seed sizes for cs, hu and    .

(2011) in two ways: using the context-independent
morphological attributes present in the different lex-
icons; and using the corresponding morphological
taggers from   5.1 to generate context-dependent at-
tributes. for each of the above two kinds of features,
we    re the attributes for the word on top of the stack
and the two words on at the front of the buffer. ad-
ditionally we take the cross product of these features
between the word on the top of the stack and at the
front of the buffer.

table 8 shows the labeled accuracy score (las)
for all languages. overall, the generated lexicon
gives an improvement of absolute 1.5% point over
the baseline (5.3% relative reduction in error) and
0.5% over the seed lexicon on an average across
11 languages. critically this improvement holds
for 10/11 languages over the baseline and 8/11 lan-
guages over the system that uses seed lexicon only.

6 further analysis
in this section we further investigate our model and
results in detail.
size of seed lexicon. we    rst test how the size
of the seed lexicon affects performance of attribute
prediction on the test set. we use the manually
constructed lexicons described in   4.2 for experi-
ments. for each language, instead of using the
full seed lexicon of 10000 words, we construct sub-
sets of this lexicon by taking 1000 and 5000 ran-
domly sampled words. we then train models ob-
tained in   4.1 on these lexicons and plot the perfor-
mance on the test set in figure 3. on average across

table 10: highest (upper half) and lowest (lower half)
weighted features (with their sign) for predicting a given
attribute of english words.

three languages, we observe that the absolute perfor-
mance improvement from 1000 to 5000 seed words
is    10% whereas it reduces to    2% from 5000 to
10000 words.
feature analysis. table 10 shows the highest and
the lowest weighted features for predicting a given
attribute of english words. the highest weighted
features for both vform:ger and num:plur are
word clusters, indicating that word clusters exhibit
strong syntactic and semantic coherence. more
interestingly,
it can be seen that for predicting
vform:ger i.e, continuous verb forms, the lowest
weighted features are those morphological transfor-
mations that substitute    ing    with something else.
thus, if there exists an edge between the words
studying and study, containing the feature:
suf-
   x:ing:{null},
the model would correctly predict
that studying is vform:ger as study is not so and
the negative feature weight can    ip the label values.
the same observation holds true for num:plur.
feature ablation. one key question is which of
the features in our graph are important for project-
ing morphological attribute-values. table 3 suggests
that this is language speci   c, which is intuitive, as

evaluated on manually curated gold lexicons. reported
scores are micro-averaged f1 score (%) for prediction of
lexical attributes. s = suf   x; p = pre   x; c = clusters; and
mt = morphological transformations.

morphology can be represented more or less regu-
larly through the surface form depending on the lan-
guage. to understand this, we did a feature ablation
study for the three languages with manually curated
lexicons (  4.2) using the same feature set as before:
clusters, suf   x and morphological transformations
with paradigm projection. we then leave out each
feature to measure how performance drops. unlike
  4.2, we do not average over 10 runs but use a sin-
gle static graph where features (edges) are added or
removed as necessary.

table 11 contains the results. critically, all fea-
tures are required for top accuracy across all lan-
guages and leaving out suf   x features has the most
detrimental effect. this is not surprising considering
all three language primarily express morphological
properties via suf   xes. furthermore, suf   x features
help to connect the graph and assist label propaga-
tion. note that the importance of suf   x features here
is in contrast to the evaluation on treebank derived
lexicons in   4.1, where suf   x features were only se-
lected for 4 out of 11 languages based on the devel-
opment data (table 3), and not for hungarian and
finnish. this could be due to the nature of the lex-

icons derived from treebanks versus complete lexi-
cons constructed by humans.

additionally, we also added back pre   x features
and found that for all languages, this resulted in a
drop in accuracy, particularly for finnish and hun-
garian. the primary reason for this is that pre   x fea-
tures often create spurious edges in the graph. this
in and of itself is not a problem for our model, as the
edge weights should learn to discount this feature.
however, the fact that we sample edges to make in-
ference tractable means that more informative edges
could be dropped in favor of those that are only con-
nected via a pre   x features.

prediction examples. table 9 shows examples of
predictions made by our model for english and ital-
ian. for each language, we    rst select a random
word from the seed lexicon, then we pick one syn-
tactic and one semantically related word to the se-
lected word from the set of unlabeled words. for
e.g., in italian tavola means table, whereas tavoli is
the plural form and divano means sofa. we correctly
identify attributes for these words.

7 related work

we now review the areas of related work.

lexicon generation. eskander et al. (2013) con-
struct morpho-syntactic lexicons by incrementally
merging in   ectional classes with shared morpholog-
ical features. natural language lexicons have often
been created from smaller seed lexcions using var-
ious methods. thelen and riloff (2002) use pat-
terns extracted over a large corpus to learn semantic
lexicons from smaller seed lexicons using bootstrap-
ping. alfonseca et al. (2010) use distributional simi-
larity scores across instances to propagate attributes
using id93 over a graph. das and smith
(2012) learn potential semantic frames for unknown
predicates by expanding a seed frame lexicon. sen-
timent lexicons containing semantic polarity labels
for words and phrases have been created using boot-
strapping and graph-based learning (banea et al.,
2008; mohammad et al., 2009; velikovich et al.,
2010; takamura et al., 2007; lu et al., 2011).

graph-based learning.
in general, graph-based
semi-supervised learning is heavily used in nlp

(talukdar and cohen, 2013; subramanya and taluk-
dar, 2014). graph-based learning has been used
for class-instance acquisition (talukdar and pereira,
2010), text classi   cation (subramanya and bilmes,
2008), summarization (erkan and radev, 2004),
id170 problems (subramanya et al.,
2010; das and petrov, 2011; garrette et al., 2013)
etc. our work differs from most of these approaches
in that we speci   cally learn how different features
shared between the nodes can correspond to either
the propagation of an attribute or an inversion of
the attribute value (cf. equ 1). in terms of the ca-
pability of inverting an attribute value, our method
is close to goldberg et al. (2007), who present a
framework to include dissimilarity between nodes
and talukdar et al. (2012), who learn which edges
can be excluded for label propagation. in terms of
featurizing the edges, our work resembles previous
work which measured similarity between nodes in
terms of similarity between the feature types that
they share (muthukrishnan et al., 2011; saluja and
navr  atil, 2013). our work is also related to graph-
based metric learning, where the objective is to learn
a suitable distance metric between the nodes of a
graph for solving a given problem (weinberger et
al., 2005; dhillon et al., 2012).

morphology. high morphological complexity ex-
acerbates the problem of feature sparsity in many
nlp applications and leads to poor estimation of
model parameters, emphasizing the need of mor-
phological analysis. morphological analysis en-
compasses    elds like morphological segmentation
(creutz and lagus, 2007; demberg, 2007; snyder
and barzilay, 2008; poon et al., 2009; narasimhan
et al., 2015), and in   ection generation (yarowsky
and wicentowski, 2000; wicentowski, 2004). such
models of segmentation and in   ection generation
are used to better understand the meaning and re-
lations between words. our task is complementary
to the task of morphological paradigm generation.
paradigm generation requires generating all possible
morphological forms of a given base-form according
to different linguistic transformations (dreyer and
eisner, 2011; durrett and denero, 2013; ahlberg et
al., 2014; ahlberg et al., 2015; nicolai et al., 2015;
faruqui et al., 2016), whereas our task requires iden-
tifying linguistic transformations between two dif-

ferent word forms.
low-resourced languages. our algorithm can be
used to generate morpho-syntactic lexicons for low-
resourced languages, where the seed lexicon can
be constructed, for example, using id104
(callison-burch and dredze, 2010; irvine and kle-
mentiev, 2010). morpho-syntactic resources have
been developed for east-european languages like
slovene (dzeroski et al., 2000; erjavec, 2004),
bulgarian (simov et al., 2004) and highly agglu-
tinative languages like turkish (sak et al., 2008).
morpho-syntactic lexicons are crucial components
in acousting modeling and automatic speech recog-
nition, where they have been developed for low-
resourced languages (huet et al., 2008; besacier et
al., 2014).

one alternative method to extract morphosyntac-
tic lexicons is via parallel data (das and petrov,
2011). however, such methods assume that both
the source and target langauges are isomorphic with
respect to morphology. this can be the case with
attributes like coarse part-of-speech or case, but is
rarely true for other attributes like gender, which is
very language speci   c.

8 future work

there are three major ways in which the current
model can be possibly improved.
joint learning and propagation.
in the current
model, we are    rst learning the weights in a su-
pervised manner (  3.1) and then propagating labels
across nodes in a semi-supervised step with    xed
feature weights (  3.2). these can also be performed
jointly: perform one iteration of weight learning,
propagate labels using these weights, perform an-
other iteration of weight learning assuming empir-
ical labels as gold labels and continue to learn and
propagate until convergence. this joint learning
would be slower than the current approach as prop-
agating labels across the graph is an expensive step.
multi-label classifcation. we are currently using
the binary relevance method which trains a binary
classi   er for every attribute independently (godbole
and sarawagi, 2004; zhang and zhou, 2005) with
paradigm projection as a post-processing step (  3.3).
thus we are accounting for attribute correlations

only at the end. we can instead model such cor-
relations as constraints during the learning step to
obtain better solutions (ghamrawi and mccallum,
2005; tsoumakas and katakis, 2006; f  urnkranz et
al., 2008; read et al., 2011).
richer feature set.
in addition our model can ben-
e   t from a richer set of features. id27s
can be used to connect word node which are similar
in meaning (mikolov et al., 2013). we can use ex-
isting morphological segmentation tools to discover
the morpheme and in   ections of a word to connect it
to word with similar in   ections which might be bet-
ter than the crude suf   x or pre   x features. we can
also use rich lexical resources like wiktionary11 to
extract relations between words that can be encoded
on our graph edges.

9 conclusion
we have presented a graph-based semi-supervised
method to construct
large annotated morpho-
syntactic lexicons from small seed lexicons. our
method is language independent and we have con-
structed lexicons for 11 different languages. we
showed that the lexicons thus constructed help im-
prove performance in morphological tagging and de-
pendency parsing, when used as features.
