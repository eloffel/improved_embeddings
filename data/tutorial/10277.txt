many real-world relations can be represented by signed networks with positive and negative links, as a
result of which signed network analysis has attracted increasing attention from multiple disciplines. with
the increasing prevalence of social media networks, signed network analysis has evolved from developing
and measuring theories to mining tasks. in this article, we present a review of mining signed networks in
the context of social media and discuss some promising research directions and new frontiers. we begin by
giving basic concepts and unique properties and principles of signed networks. then we classify and review
tasks of signed network mining with representative algorithms. we also delineate some tasks that have not
been extensively studied with formal de   nitions and also propose research directions to expand the    eld of
signed network mining.

1. introduction
in many real-world social systems, relations between two nodes can be represented as
signed networks with positive and negative links. in the 1940s, heider [1946] stud-
ied perception and attitude of individuals and introduced structural balance theory,
which is an important social theory for signed networks. in the 1950s, cartwright
and harary [1956] further developed the theory and introduced the notion of balanced
signed graph to characterize forbidden patterns in social networks. with roots in so-
cial psychology, signed network analysis has attracted much attention from multiple
disciplines such as physics and computer science, and has evolved considerably from
both data- and problem-centric perspectives.

the early work in the    eld was mainly based on signed networks derived from obser-
vations in the physical world such as the international relationships in europe from
1872 to 1907 [heider 1946], relationships among allied and axis powers during world
war ii [axelrod and bennett 1993], and the con   ict over bangladesh   s separation from
pakistan in 1971 [moore 1978; moore 1979]. these signed networks were typically
characterized by a small number of nodes with dense relationships and were notable
for their clean structure. with the development of social media, increasing attention
has been focused on signed social networks observed in online worlds. signed networks
in social media represent relations among online users where positive links indicate
friendships, trust, and like, whereas negative links indicate foes, distrust, dislike and
antagonism. examples of signed networks in social media include trust/distrust in
epinions1 [massa and avesani 2005; leskovec et al. 2010a] and friends/foes in slash-
dot2 [kunegis et al. 2009]. signed networks in social media often have hundreds of
thousands of users and millions of links, and they are usually very sparse and noisy.
data for signed network analysis has evolved from of   ine to social media networks.

research problems have evolved together with the evolution of

the na-
ture of available data sets for signed network analysis. signed networks ob-
served in the physical world are often small but dense and clean. there-
fore, early research about signed networks had mainly focused on develop-
ing theories to explain social phenomenon in signed networks [heider 1946;
cartwright and harary 1956]. later
conducted on mea-

surements
frank and harary 1980]
[antal et al. 2005;
radicchi et al. 2007b; radicchi et al. 2007a; marvel et al. 2011]. the recent avail-
ability of
large-scale, sparse and noisy social media networks has encouraged
increasing attention on leveraging data mining, machine learning and opti-
mization techniques [kunegis et al. 2009; leskovec et al. 2010a; yang et al. 2012;
chiang et al. 2013; tang et al. 2014a]. research problems for signed network analysis
have evolved from developing and measuring theories to mining tasks.

this survey mainly focuses on mining tasks for signed networks in social media.
however, it should be pointed out that (a) we will review theories originating from
signed networks in the physical world for mining signed networks; and (b) we will
review measurements and dynamics of social balance as basis or objectives in mining
signed networks. note that since nodes represent users in social networks, we will use
the terms    node    and    user    interchangeably in this article.

1.1. mining signed networks in social media
the problem of mining unsigned networks in social media (or networks with only
positive links) has been extensively studied for decades [knoke and yang 2008;
aggarwal 2011; zafarani et al. 2014]. however, mining signed networks requires ded-
icated methods because cannot simply use straightforward extensions of algorithms
and theories in unsigned networks [chiang et al. 2013]. first, the existence of negative
links in signed networks challenges many concepts and algorithms for unsigned net-
works. for example, node ranking algorithms for unsigned networks such as pager-
ank [page et al. 1999] and hits [kleinberg 1999] require all links to be positive. sim-
ilarly, spectral id91 algorithms for unsigned networks cannot, in general, be di-
rectly extended to signed networks [kunegis et al. 2010], and the concept of structural
hole in unsigned networks is not applicable to signed networks [zhang et al. 2016].
second, some social theories such as balance theory [heider 1946] and status the-

ory [leskovec et al. 2010b] are only applicable to signed networks, while social the-
ories for unsigned networks such as homophily may not be applicable to signed
networks [tang et al. 2014a]. in addition, the availability of negative links brings
about unprecedented opportunities and potentials in mining signed networks. first,
it is evident from recent research that negative links have signi   cant added value
over positive links in various analytical tasks. for example, a small number of
negative links can signi   cantly improve positive link prediction [guha et al. 2004;
leskovec et al. 2010a], and they can also improve recommendation performance in so-
cial media [victor et al. 2009; ma et al. 2009]. second, analogous to mining unsigned
networks, we can have similar mining tasks for signed networks; however, negative
links in signed networks make them applicable to a broader range of applications. for
example, similar tasks for unsigned networks have new de   nitions for signed networks
such as community detection and link prediction, while new tasks and applications
emerged for only signed networks such as sign prediction and negative link prediction.
in this article, we present a comprehensive review of current research    ndings about
mining signed networks and discuss some tasks that need further investigation. the
major motivation of this article is two-fold:

    negative links in signed networks present two unique types of properties     (1) dis-
tinct topological properties as opposed to positive links; and (2) collective properties
with positive links. these unique properties determine that the basic concepts, prin-
ciples and properties of signed networks are substantially different from those of
unsigned networks. therefore an overview of basic concepts, principles and proper-
ties of signed social networks can facilitate a better understanding of the challenges,
opportunities and necessity of mining signed networks.

    the availability of large-scale signed networks from social media has encouraged a
large body of literature in mining signed networks. on the one hand, a classi   cation
of typical tasks can promote a better understanding. on the other hand, the devel-
opment of tasks of mining signed social networks is highly imbalanced     some tasks
are extensively studied, whereas others have not been suf   ciently investigated. for
well-studied tasks, an overview will help users familiarize themselves with the state-
of-the-art algorithms; for insuf   ciently studied tasks, it is necessary to give formal
de   nitions with promising research directions that can enrich current research.

the organization and contributions of the article are summarized as follows:

    we give an overview of basic concepts, unique principles, and properties of signed
networks in section 2. we discuss approaches to represent signed networks, topo-
logical properties of the negative networks, and collective properties of positive and
negative links with social theories.

    we classify the mining tasks of signed social networks into node-oriented, link-
oriented and application-oriented tasks. from section 3 to section 5, we review well-
studied tasks in each category with representative algorithms and

    mining signed networks is in the early stages of development. we discuss some tasks
for each category that have not yet received suf   cient attention in the literature. we
discuss formal de   nitions and promising research directions.

the readers of this survey are expected to have some basic understanding of social
network analysis such as adjacency matrices, reciprocity and id91 coef   cient,
data mining techniques such as id91 and classi   cation, machine learning tech-
niques such as eigen-decomposition, mixture models, id105 and opti-
mization techniques such as gradient decent and em methods.

1.2. related surveys and differences
a few surveys about signed networks analysis exist in the literature. one of the earli-
est surveys may be found in [taylor 1970]. this survey gives an overview of metrics to
measure the degree of social balance for given signed networks. very recently, zheng
et al. [zheng et al. 2014] provides a comprehensive overview of social balance in signed
networks. this survey gives an overview about recent metrics to measure the degree
and the dynamics of social balance as well as the application of social balance in par-
titioning signed networks. with the increasing popularization of signed networks in
social media, a large body of literature has emerged, which leverages machine learn-
ing, data mining and optimization techniques. this survey provides a comprehensive
overview of this emerging area, along with a discussion of applications and promising
research directions.

compared to signed networks,

there are many more surveys about un-
signed network analysis. these surveys cover various topics in unsigned net-
work analysis including community detection [tang and liu 2010], node classi   ca-
tion [bhagat et al. 2011], link prediction [liben-nowell and kleinberg 2007] and net-
work evolution [aggarwal and subbian 2014]. surveys are also available about appli-
cations of unsigned networks such as data classi   cation [sen et al. 2008], recommen-
dation [tang et al. 2013] and information propagation [chen et al. 2013a].

2. basis of signed networks
the basic concepts, principles and properties of signed networks are related to but dis-
tinct from those of unsigned networks. in this section, we review the representations,
distinct properties of negative links, and collective properties of positive and negative
links with social theories.

2.1. network representation
a signed network g consists of a set of n nodes u = {u1, u2, . . . , un }, a set of positive
links ep and a set of negative links en. there are two major ways to represent a signed
network g.

as suggested in [leskovec et al. 2010a], positive and negative links should be viewed
as tightly related features in signed networks. one way is to represent both positive
and negative links into one adjacency matrix a     rn   n where aij = 1, aij =    1 and
aij = 0 denote positive, negative and missing links from ui to uj, respectively.

the independent analyses of the different networks in signed networks reveal dis-
tinct types of properties and it is important to consider these distinct topological prop-
erties in modeling [szell et al. 2010]. therefore we separate a signed network into a
network with only positive links and a network with only negative links, and then use
two adjacency matrices to represent these two networks, respectively. in particular, it
uses ap     rn   n to represent positive links where ap
ij = 0 denote a posi-
ij     rn   n is used to represent
tive link and a missing link from ui to uj. similarly an
negative links where an
ij = 0 denote a negative link and a missing link
from ui to uj.

ij = 1 and ap

ij = 1 and an

it is easy to convert one representation into the other with the following rules: a =

2.2. properties of negative networks
there are some well known properties of positive links such as power-law degree distri-
butions, high id91 coef   cient, high reciprocity, transitivity and strong correlation
with similarity. however, we cannot easily extend these properties of positive links to

negative links. in this subsection, we will review important properties of negative links
in social media, which are analogous to those of positive links.

power-law distributions. it is well known that the distributions of incoming or out-
going positive links for users usually follow power-law distributions     a few users with
large degrees while most users have small degrees. in [tang et al. 2014a], incoming or
outgoing negative links for each user are calculated and there are two important    nd-
ings     (a) in a signed network, positive links are denser than negative links and there
are many users without any incoming and outgoing negative links; and (b) for users
with negative links, the degree distributions also follow power-law distributions     a
few users have a large number of negative links, while most users have few negative
links.

id91 coef   cient. nodes in networks with positive links are often easy to clus-
ter. this property is often re   ected by their high id91 coef   cients (cc). high
values of cc are expected because of the inherently cohesive nature of positive
links [coleman 1988]. however, the values of id91 coef   cients for negative links
are signi   cantly lower than these for positive links. this suggests that many useful
properties such as triadic closure cannot be applied to negative links [szell et al. 2010].

reciprocity. positive links show high reciprocity. networks with positive links are
strongly reciprocal, which indicates that pairs of nodes tend to form bi-directional con-
nections, whereas networks with negative links show signi   cantly lower reciprocity.
asymmetry in negative links is con   rmed in the correlations between the in- and out-
degrees of nodes. in- and out-degrees of positive links are almost balanced, while neg-
ative links show an obvious suppression of such reciprocity [szell et al. 2010].

transitivity. positive links show strong transitivity, which can be explained as
   friends    friends are friends   . the authors of [tang et al. 2014a] examined the tran-
sitivity of negative links on two social media signed networks epinions and slashdot
and found that negative links may be not transitive since they observed both    enemies   
enemies are friends    and    enemies    enemies are enemies   .

links have

strong correlations with
similarity, which can be explained by two important social theories,
i.e., ho-
mophily [mcpherson et al. 2001] and social in   uence [marsden and friedkin 1993].
homophily suggests that users are likely to connect to other similar users, while
social in   uence indicates that users    behaviors are likely to be in   uenced by their
friends. via analyzing two real-world signed social networks epinions and slashdot,
the authors in [tang et al. 2014a] found that users are likely to be more similar to
users with negative links than those without any links, while users with positive
links are likely to be more similar than those with negative links. these observations
suggest that negative links in signed social networks may denote neither similarity
nor dissimilarity.

in addition, a recent work conducted a comprehensive signed link analy-
sis [beigi et al. 2016] and found     (1) users with positive (negative) emotions are
likely to establish positive (negative) links; (2) users are likely to like their friends   
friends and dislike their friends    foes; and (3) users with higher optimism (pessimism)
are more likely to create positive (negative) links.

2.3. collective properties of positive and negative links
as shown in the previous subsection, distinct properties are observed for posi-
tive and negative links. when we consider positive and negative links together,

they present collective properties, which can be explained by two important so-
cial theories in signed networks, i.e., balance theory [heider 1946] and status the-
ory [guha et al. 2004; leskovec et al. 2010b]. next we present these collective prop-
erties by introducing these two social theories, which have been proven to be very
helpful in mining signed social networks [leskovec et al. 2010b; yang et al. 2012;
zheng et al. 2014; kunegis 2014]. for example, the signed id91 coef   cient and
the relative signed id91 coef   cient [kunegis et al. 2009] are de   ned based on the
intuition    the enemy of my enemy is my friend    implied by balance theory. note that
balance theory is developed for undirected signed social networks, whereas status the-
ory is developed for directed signed social networks

theory
introduced
level and generalized by cartwright and
the individual
in [heider 1946] at
harary [cartwright and harary 1956]
in the graph-theoretical formation at the
group level. when the signed network is not restricted to be complete, the network is
balanced if all its cycles have an even number of negative links. using this de   nition,
it is proven in [harary et al. 1953] that    a signed graph is balanced if and only if
nodes can be separated into two mutually exclusive subsets such that each positive
link joins two nodes of the same subset and each negative link joins nodes from
different subsets.    it is dif   cult to represent real-world signed networks by balanced
structure. therefore, davis [1967] introduced the notion of a clusterizable graph     a
signed graph is clusterizable if there exists a partition of the nodes such that nodes
with positive links are in the same subset and nodes with negative links are between
different subsets.

later on, researchers have proposed some important metrics to measure the de-
gree of balance of signed networks. as mentioned above, the concept of balance has
evolved and been generalized. hence, these metrics can be categorized according to
their adopted de   nitions of balance. some metrics use the de   nition of balance by
cartwright and harary [cartwright and harary 1956] hence they measure the num-
ber of balanced or unbalanced cycles. the ratio of balanced circles among all possible
circles was calculate by using the adjacency matrix a [cartwright and gleason 1966],
which was modi   ed to consider the length of cycles in [henley et al. 1969]. the time
complexity of these metrics is o(n3), which is infeasible for large real-world signed
networks. terzi and winkler proposed an ef   cient spectral algorithm to estimate the
degree of balance for large signed networks [terzi and winkler 2011]. the de   nition
of balance by davis [1967] established the correlation between balance and cluster-
ing     id91 is partition of the nodes of a given signed network into k clusters,
such that each pair of nodes in the same cluster has a positive link and a negative
link exists between each pair of nodes from different clusters. therefore the met-
rics based on the de   nition by davis [1967] measure the number of disagreements
    the number of negative links inside clusters and the number of positive links be-
tween clusters [bansal et al. 2004; facchetti et al. 2011; zheng et al. 2014]. actually
these metrics later on became criteria to partition signed networks into clusters (or
communities) such as approximation algorithms were developed for minimizing dis-
agreements by identifying the optimal number of clusters in [bansal et al. 2004]. more
details about these id91 algorithms will be discussed in section 3.2.1.

balance theory generally implies that    the friend of my friend is my friend    and    the
enemy of my enemy is my friend    [heider 1946]. let sij represent the sign of the link
between the i-th node and the j-th node where sij = 1 and sij =    1 denote a positive
link and a negative link are observed between ui and uj. balance theory suggests that
a triad hui, uj, uki is balanced if     (1) sij = 1 and sjk = 1, then sik = 1 ; or (2) sij =    1
and sjk =    1, then sik = 1.

fig. 1: an illustration of balance theory. as suggested by balance theory, triads a and
c are balanced; while triads b and d are imbalanced.

for a triad, four possible sign combinations exist as demonstrated in figure 1.
among these four combinations, a and c are balanced. the way to measure the bal-
ance of signed networks in social media is to examine all these triads and then to
compute the ratio of a and c over a, b, c and d. existing work reported that tri-
ads in signed networks in social media are highly balanced. for example, leskovec et
al. [leskovec et al. 2010a] found that the ratios of balanced triads of signed networks
in epinions, slashdot and wikipedia are 0.941, 0.912, and 0.909, respectively, and more
than 90% of triads are balanced in other social media datasets [yang et al. 2012]. fur-
thermore, the ratio of balanced triads increases while that of unbalanced triads de-
creases over time [szell et al. 2010].

2.3.2. status theory. while balance theory is naturally de   ned for undirected net-
works, status theory [guha et al. 2004; leskovec et al. 2010b] is relevant for directed
networks. social status can be represented in a variety of ways, such as the rankings
of nodes in social networks, and it represents the prestige of nodes. in its most basic
form, status theory suggests that ui has a higher status than uj if there is a positive
link from uj to ui or a negative link from ui to uj.

as shown in figure 2, there are two types of triads in directed networks, which cor-
respond to acyclic and cyclic triads. note that    ipping the directions of all the links has
no impact on the type of the cyclic triad. since there are four possible sign combina-
tions, there are four types of cyclic signed triads for t2 as shown in figure 3. each link
in an acyclic triad can be positive or negative and the signs of links in an acyclic triad
are not exchangeable; hence, there are eight types of acyclic signed triads as depicted
in figure 4. overall, there are 12 types of triads in directed signed networks.

a popular approach to examine whether a given triad satis   es status theory or not is
as follows. we reverse the directions of all negative links and    ip their signs to positive.
if the resulting triad is acyclic, then the triad satis   es status theory. it is easy to verify
          uj, reversing its direction and    ipping its sign simul-
that (1) for a negative link ui
+       ui, which preserves the status order of ui and uj
taneously lead to a positive link uj

according to status theory; and (2) for a positive and cyclic triad ui
their statuses should satisfy ui > uj > uk > ui according to status theory, which leads
to a logical contradiction ui > ui. following the aforementioned approach, we    nd that
8 of the 12 types of triads in signed networks satisfy status theory as shown in the
   rst row of table i. similar to the approach for testing the balance of signed networks,
we examine all 12 triads and then calculate the ratio of triads satisfying status theory.
examinations on signed networks in typical social media suggest that more than 90%
of triads satisfy status theory [leskovec et al. 2010b].

as shown in table i, status theory and balance theory do not always agree with one
another. note that we apply balance theory to directed signed networks by ignoring
the directions of links. some triads satisfy both theories such as the triad t11. some
satisfy status theory but not balance theory such as the triad t12. some satisfy balance
theory but not status theory such as the triad t21. others do not satisfy either such as
the triad t24.

2.4. popular data sets for benchmarking
in this subsection, we discuss some social media data sets widely used for benchmark-
ing analytical algorithms in the signed network setting.

epinions is a product review site. users can create both positive (trust) and negative
(distrust) links to other users. they can write reviews for various products with rating
scores from 1 to 5. other users can rate the helpfulness of reviews. there are sev-
eral variants of datasets from epinions publicly available [massa and avesani 2005;
leskovec et al. 2010a; yang et al. 2012; tang et al. 2015]. statistics of two representa-
tive sets are illustrated in table ii.    epinions    is from stanford large network dataset
collection 3 where only signed networks among users are available. in addition to
signed networks,    eepinion    [tang et al. 2015] also provides item ratings, review con-
tent, helpfulness ratings and categories of items. it also includes timestamps when
links are established and ratings are created.

slashdot is a technology news platform in which users can create friend (posi-
tive) and foe (negative) links to other users. they can also post news articles. other
users may annotate these articles with their comments. there also various variants of
datasets from slashdot [kunegis et al. 2009; leskovec et al. 2010a; tang et al. 2015]
and two of them are demonstrated in table ii.    slashdot    is from stanford large net-
work dataset collection with only signed networks among users, while the more de-
tailed    eslashdot    [tang et al. 2015] provides signed networks, comments on articles,
user tags and groups in which users participate.

2.5. tasks of mining signed networks
there are similar tasks for mining unsigned and signed networks. however, the avail-
ability of negative links in signed networks determines that similar mining tasks for
unsigned networks may have new de   nitions for signed networks and there may be
new tasks speci   c to signed networks. we category the tasks of mining signed networks
as tasks that focus on nodes, links and applications, i.e., node-oriented, link-oriented

fig. 5: an overview of tasks of mining signed networks in social media. tasks high-
lighted in red have not been extensively studied.

and application-oriented tasks as shown in figure 5. although a large body of work has
emerged in recent years for mining signed social networks, the development of tasks
in each category is highly imbalanced. some of them are well studied, whereas oth-
ers need further investigation. these tasks are highlighted in red in figure 5. in the
following sections, we give an overview of representative algorithms for well-studied
tasks and also provide a detailed discussion of important and emerging tasks. where
needed, promising research directions are also highlighted. the notations used in this
article are summarized in table iii. any algorithms for directed signed networks are
applicable to undirected signed networks by considering an undirected link as two
bidirectional links. hence, in the following sections, it can be assumed by default that
an algorithm can be applied to both directed and undirected signed networks.

3. node-oriented tasks
as shown in figure 5, important node-oriented tasks include node ranking, commu-
nity detection, node classi   cation and node embedding, among which node ranking
and community detection are extensively studied. on the other hand, node classi   ca-
tion and node embedding need further investigations. in this section, we review node
ranking and community detection with representative algorithms.

3.1. node ranking
the problem of node ranking for signed networks is that of exploiting the link struc-
ture of a network to order or prioritize the set of nodes within the network by consid-
ering both positive and negative links [getoor and diehl 2005]. since negative links
are usually not considered, most node ranking algorithms for unsigned networks can-
not deal with negative values directly [haveliwala 2002; cohn and chang 2000]. a
straightforward solution is to apply node ranking algorithms of unsigned networks,
such as eigentrust [kamvar et al. 2003], by ignoring negative links or zero the en-
tries corresponding to the negative links in the matrix representation of the net-
work [richardson et al. 2003]. in other words, we only consider the positive network
ap while ignoring the impact from an in a signed network. this solution cannot distin-
guish between negative and missing links since both of them correspond to a zero en-
tity in the representation matrix. recent node ranking algorithms for signed networks
fall into three themes     (a) centrality measurements are used; (b) id95-like mod-
els are used [page et al. 1999]; and (c) hits-like methods are used [kleinberg 1999].
next, we will introduce representative algorithms for each group.

3.1.1. centrality-based algorithms. centrality-based algorithms use certain centrality
measurements to rank nodes in signed networks. if a node receives many positive
incoming links, it should have high prestige value, while nodes with many nega-
tive incoming links will have small values of prestige. a measure pi of the sta-
tus score of ui based on the indegree of positive and negative links is proposed
in [zolfaghar and aghaie 2010] as follows:

pi =

|i +
|i +

i |     |i    
i |
i | + |i    
i |

(1)

i |, and |i    

where |i +
i | are the indegree of positive and negative links of ui, respectively.
a similar metric is used in [kunegis et al. 2009] as the subtraction of indegree of neg-
ative links from indegree of positive links, i.e., pi = |i +
i |. an eigenvector cen-
trality metric is proposed in [bonacich and lloyd 2004] for balanced complete signed
networks. we can divide nodes of a balanced complete signed network into two com-
munities such that all positive links connect members of the same community and all
negative links connect members of different communities. thus, positive and nega-
tive scores in the eigenvector that correspond to the largest eigenvalue of the adja-
cency matrix a reveal not only the clique structure but also status scores within each
clique [bonacich and lloyd 2004].

i |     |i    

3.1.2. id95-based algorithms. the original id95 algorithm expresses the rep-

utation score for the i-th node as:

pi = xuj    i +

i

pj
|o+
j |

(2)

where |o+
in an iterative way:

j | is the outdegree of positive links of uj. the id203 pi can be computed

i =    xuj    i +

i

(3)

where the term (1       ) 1
n is the restart component, n the total number of users,
and    is a damping factor. in signed networks, mechanisms are also provided to
handle negative links [traag et al. 2010; borgs et al. 2010; chung et al. 2013]. next,
we detail three representative algorithms in this group [shahriari and jalili 2014;
de kerchove and van dooren 2008; traag et al. 2010]

in [shahriari and jalili 2014], two status scores are calculated by the original
id95 algorithm for the positive network and the negative network separately, and
the difference of the two provides the    nal result. therefore, this algorithm considers a
signed network as two separate networks and completely ignores the interactions be-
tween positive and negative links. furthermore, this approach does not have natural
interpretations in terms of the reputation scores of nodes. in [wu et al. 2016], the troll-
trust model is proposed that has a clear physical interpretation. an exponential node
ranking algorithm based on discrete choice theory is proposed in [traag et al. 2010].
ajipj, the id203 of ui with the high-

when the observed reputation is ki =puj    ii

est real reputation according to discrete choice theory is:

pi =

exp(ki/  )

pj exp(kj/  )

(4)

a survey of signed network mining in social media

an iterative approach is used to compute the status scores as follows:

pt+1 =

exp( 1
kexp( 1

   a   pt)
   a   pt)k1

39:13

(5)

within a certain range of   , the aforementioned formulation can achieve a global solu-
tion p    with arbitrary initializations.

the work in [de kerchove and van dooren 2008; de kerchove et al. 2009] uses the
intuition that the random-walk process should be modi   ed to avoid negative links.
therefore nodes receiving negative connections are visited less. this is formalized as
follows:

i = (1       qt
pt+1

ii)(   xuj    i +

i

j
|o+

(6)

where   qt
(1       qt
calculated as follows:

ii gives the ratio of walkers that distrust the node they are in. in that manner
ii) represents the ratio of remaining walkers in ui. the distrust matrix   q is

    a random walk according to the original id95 formulation is used:

  qt+1 = ttqt

(7)

where tt is the transition matrix whose (i, j)th entry tt
ers in ui who were in uj at time t as follows:

    a walk in ui automatically adopts negative opinions of ui. in other words, he adds
ij =    1). a walker who
ij = 0). with the

distrusts a node leaves the graph if ever he visits the node (qt+1

hi = xj   i +

if aij =    1 ,
if i = j,

(9)

3.1.3. hits-based algorithms. the original hits algorithm [kleinberg 1999] calculates

a hub score hi and an authority score ai for each node ui as

aj; ai = xj   o+

i

hj

(10)

hits-based algorithms provide components to handle negative links based on the
original hits algorithm. in [shahriari and jalili 2014], two strategies are proposed.
the    rst applies the original hits algorithm separately on the positive and negative
networks as follows:

then, the    nal hub and authority scores are computed as follows:

( h+

h   

i

i =pj   i +
i =pj   i +

i

the other way is to incorporate the signs directly as follows:

hi =

ai =

pj   i+ aj    p
aj +p

j   i

instead of hub and authority scores in hits, the concepts of bias and deserve are
introduced in [mishra and bhattacharya 2011]. here, bias (or trustworthiness) of a
link re   ects the expected weight of an outgoing connection and deserve (or prestige) of
a link re   ects the expected weight of an incoming connection from an unbiased node.
similar to hits, the deserve score desi for ui is the aggregation of all unbiased votes
from her incoming connections as:

dest+1

i =

aji(1     x t

ji)

1

|ii|xj

where xji indicates the in   uence that bias of uj has on its outgoing link to ui

xji = max{0, biasj     aji}

(14)

(15)

while the bias score biasi for ui is the aggregation of voting biases of her outgoing
connections as:

biast+1

i =

(aji     dest

(16)

3.2. community detection in signed networks
the existence of negative links in signed networks makes the de   nition of community
detection in signed networks substantially different from that in unsigned networks.
in unsigned networks, community detection identi   es groups of densely connected
nodes [tang and liu 2010; papadopoulos et al. 2012; ailon et al. 2013]. in signed net-
works, groups of users are identi   ed, where users are densely connected by positive
links within the group and negative links between groups. based on the underlying
methodology, id91-based, modularity-based, mixture-model-based and dynamic-
model-based methods are used. next we will give basic concepts for each group with
representative algorithms.

3.2.1. id91-based algorithms. id91-based algorithms transform a graph ver-
tex id91 problem to one that can be addressed by traditional data id91
methods. if we consider a positive link or a negative link indicates whether two nodes
are similar or different, community detection in signed networks is boiled down to the
correlation id91 problem [bansal et al. 2004]. bansal et. al. proved np hardness
of the correlation id91 problem and gave constant-factor approximation algo-
rithms for the special case in which the network is complete and undirected, and every
edge has weight +1 or    1 [bansal et al. 2004]. a two phase id91 re-id91 al-
gorithm is introduced in [sharma et al. 2009]     (1) the    rst phase is based on breadth
first search algorithm which forms clusters on the basis of the positive links only; and
(2) the second phase is to reclassify the nodes with negative links on the basis of the
participation level of the nodes having the negative links. in addition, there are two
groups of id91 algorithms for community detection. one is based on k-balanced
social theory and the other is based on spectral id91. note that algorithms based
on spectral id91 are designed for undirected signed networks.

algorithms based on k-balanced social theory aim to    nd k clusters with min-
imal positive links between clusters and minimal negative links inside clusters.

acm computing surveys, vol. 9, no. 4, article 39, publication date: march 2014.

a survey of signed network mining in social media

39:15

in [doreian and mrvar 1996], the objective function of id91 algorithms is de   ned
as e =   nn + (1       )np, where nn is the number of negative links within clus-
ters and np the number of positive links between clusters. the proposed algorithm
in [doreian and mrvar 1996; hassan et al. 2012a]    rst assigns the nodes to k clusters
randomly, and then optimizes the above objective function through reallocating the
nodes. an alternative approach is to leverage simulated annealing to optimize the ob-
jective function e [traag and bruggeman 2009; bogdanov et al. 2010].

one spectral id91 technique is introduced in [kunegis et al. 2010]. for a signed

network a, it    rst de   nes the signed laplacian matrix [hou 2005] as follows:

l = d     a, dii =xj

|aij |

(17)

similar to the laplacian matrix for unsigned networks, it can be proven that the signed
laplacian matrix l is often positive-semide   nite but it is positive-de   nite if and only
if the network is unbalanced. spectral id91 algorithms on the signed laplacian
matrix can detect clusters of nodes within which there are only positive links. the
laplacian matrix in eq. (17 tends to separate pairs with negative links rather than to
force pairs with positive links closer. hence a balanced normalized signed laplacian
matrix is proposed in [zheng and skillicorn 2015] as:

l = (dp     ap + an)

(18)

another

normalized
cut [chiang et al. 2012]. the objective of a positive ratio cut is to minimize the
number of positive links between communities:

(19)

c=1 are the community indicator vectors, and lp is the laplacian matrix of
where {xc}k
positive links. the objective of negative ratio association is to minimize the number of
negative links in each cluster as:

k

min(

xc=1

x   
c anxc
x   
c xc

)

(20)

the balance normalized cut is to minimize the positive ratio cut and negative ratio
association simultaneously as:

min(

k

xc=1

x   
c (dp     a)xc

x   
c xc

)

(21)

where the matrix of dp     a in balanced normalized cut is identical to the balanced
normalized signed laplacian matrix in eq. (18).

we can obtain {x1, x2, . . . , xk} by solving the optimization problems in eqs (19),
(20) or (21). to generate k clusters, we can round {x1, x2, . . . , xk} to a valid indicator
set [chiang et al. 2012]     we consider (x1(i), x2(i), . . . , xk(i)) as a k-dimensional vector
representation of user i(i     {1, 2, . . . , n}) and then perform id116 on these n vectors

3.2.2. modularity-based algorithms. these algorithms are to detect communities by op-
timizing modularity or its variants for signed networks [li et al. 2014a]. the origi-
nal modularity [newman and girvan 2004] is developed for unsigned networks and

acm computing surveys, vol. 9, no. 4, article 39, publication date: march 2014.

j. tang et al.

it measures how far the real positive connections deviates from the expected random
connections, which is formally de   ned as follows:

q+ =

1

2m+ xij

(ap

ij    

j

i d+
d+
2m+ )  (i, j)

(22)

where   (ci, cj) is the kronecker delta function which is 1 if ui and uj are in the same
community, and 0 otherwise. in [g  omez et al. 2009], modularity of networks with only
negative links q    is de   ned in a similar as q+:

q    =

1

2m    xij

(an

ij    

j

d   
i d   
2m    )  (i, j)

(23)

modularity for signed network q should balance the tendency of users with positive
links to form communities and that of users with negative links to destroy them and
the mathematical expression of q is:
2m+

2m   

q =

2m+ + 2m    q+    

2m+ + 2m    q   

(24)

eq. (24) can be rewritten as:

q =

(aij +

d   
i d   
2m       

j

j

d+
i d+
2m+ )  (i, j)

(25)

2mxij

the de   nition of q in eq.

(24) has three properties [li et al. 2014a]    
(1) q boils down to q+ if no negative link exists;
(2) q = 0 if all
nodes are assigned to the same community; and (3) q is anti-symmetric in
weighted signed networks. based on q in eq.
(24), several variants of mod-
ularity are developed such as modularity density [li et al. 2014a] and frustra-
tion [anchuri and magdon-ismail 2012]. community structure can be obtained by ei-
ther minimizing frustration [anchuri and magdon-ismail 2012] or maximizing mod-
ularity, both of which have been proven to be a general eigenvector prob-
lem [anchuri and magdon-ismail 2012]. in [amelio and pizzuti 2013], a community
detection framework sn-moga is proposed by using non-dominated sorting ge-
netic [srinivas and deb 1994; pizzuti 2009] to minimize frustration and maximize
signed modularity simultaneously.

3.2.3. mixture-model-based algorithms. mixture-model-based algorithms generate the
division of the network into communities based on generative graphical mod-
els [chen et al. 2013]. in general, there are two advantages of mixture-model-based
algorithms. first they provide soft-partition solutions in signed networks. second, they
provide soft-memberships which indicate the strength of a node belonging to a commu-
nity. these two advantages determine that they can identify overlapping communities.
stochastic block-based models and probabilistic mixture-based models are two types of
mixture models widely adopted for community detection in signed networks. stochas-
tic block-based models generate a network from a node perspective where each node
is assigned to a block or community and links are independently generated for pairs
of nodes. in [jiang 2015], a generalized stochastic model, i.e., signed stochastic block
model (ssbm), is proposed to identify communities for signed networks where nodes
within a community are more similar in terms of positive and negative connection pat-
terns than those from other communities. ssbm represents the memberships of each
node as hidden variables and uses two matrices to explicitly characterize positive and
negative links among groups, respectively. while probabilistic mixture-based models

39:17

generate a network from the link perspective [shen 2013]. in [chen et al. 2013] , a
signed probabilistic mixture (spm) model is proposed to detect overlapping communi-
ties in undirected signed networks. a link from ui to uj is generated by spm as follows:

    if the link from ui to uj is positive, i.e., aij > 0:

(1) choose a community c for the link with id203 wcc
(2) select ui from c with id203   ci
(3) select uj from c with id203   cj

    if the link from ui to uj is negative, i.e., aij < 0:

(1) choose two different communities c and s for the link with id203 wcs(c6=s)
(2) select ui from c with id203   ci
(3) select uj from s with id203   sj

overall, the id203 of the link from ui to uj can be rewritten as:

p (aij |w,   ) = (xcc

wcc  ci  cj)ap

ij ( xcs(c6=s)

wcs  ci  sj)an

ij

(26)

3.2.4. dynamic-model-based algorithms. dynamic-model-based algorithms consider a
dynamic process taking place on the network, which reveals its communities. one
type of algorithm in this group is based on discrete-time and continuous-time dy-
namic models of social balance, and a review of these algorithms can be found
in [zheng et al. 2014]. a framework based on agent-based random walk model is
proposed in [yang et al. 2007] to extract communities for signed networks. generally,
links are much denser within a community than between communities. the intu-
ition behind this framework is that an agent, starting from any node, should have
higher chances to stay in the same community than to go to a different community
after a number of walks. the framework has two advantages     (1) it is very ef   -
cient with linear time complexity in terms of the number of nodes; and (2) it con-
siders both the density of links and signs, which provides a uni   ed framework for
community detection for unsigned and signed networks. some additional steps are
added by [kong and yang 2011] to further advance the framework such as introducing
a method to detect random walk steps automatically.

3.3. promising directions for node-oriented tasks
in this subsection, we discuss two node-oriented tasks including node classi   cation
and node embedding, which need further investigations to help us gain a better under-
standing of nodes in signed networks.

3.3.1. node classi   cation in signed networks. user information such as demographic val-
ues, interest beliefs or other characteristics plays an important role in helping social
media sites provide better services for their users such as recommendations and con-
tent    ltering. however, most social media users do not share too much of their in-
formation [zheleva and getoor 2009]. for example, more than 90% of users in face-
book do no t reveal their political views [abbasi et al. 2014]. one way of bridging this
knowledge gap is to infer missing user information by leveraging the pervasively avail-
able network structures in social media. an example of such id136 is that of node
classi   cation in social networks. the node classi   cation problem has been extensively
studied in the literature [getoor and diehl 2005]. the vast majority of these algo-
rithms have focused on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only pos-
itive links) [sen et al. 2008]. evidence from recent achievements in signed networks
suggests that negative links may be also potentially helpful in the task of node classi-
   cation.

let c = {c1, c2, . . . , cm} be the set of m class labels. assume that u l = {u1, u2, . . . , un}
is the set of n labeled users where n < n and u u = u\u l is the set of n     n unlabeled
users. we use y     rn  m to denote the label indicator matrix for u l where yik = 1 if
ui is labeled as ck, yik = 0 otherwise. with above notations and de   nitions, the prob-
lem of user classi   cation in a signed social network can be formally stated as follows:
given a signed social network g with ap and an, and labels y for some users u l, user
classi   cation in a signed social network aims to infer labels for u u by leveraging ap,
an and y.

there are two possible research directions for node classi   cation in signed net-
works. since node classi   cation has been extensively studied for unsigned networks,
one way is to transform algorithms from unsigned to signed networks. negative
links present distinct properties from positive links [szell et al. 2010]. as suggested
in [leskovec et al. 2010a], positive and negative links should also be viewed as tightly
related features in signed social networks. meanwhile links could have different se-
mantics in different social media sites. therefore, an alternative approach is to develop
novel models based on the understandings about signed networks. very recently, a
framework is proposed to capture both single- and multi-view information from signed
networks for node classi   cation that signi   cantly improves the classi   cation perfor-
mance [tang et al. 2016a].

given a signed network g(n , an, ap), the task of signed-network embedding is to
learn a low-dimensional vector representation ui     rd for each user ui where d is
the embedding dimension. similar to unsigned network embedding, a signed network
embedding algorithm needs (1) an objective function for signed network embedding;
and (2) a representation learning algorithm to optimize the objective function. so-
cial theories for unsigned social networks have been widely used to design objective
functions for unsigned social network embedding. for example, social correlation the-
ories such as homophily and social in   uence suggest that two positively connected
users are likely to share similar interests, which are the foundations of many objective
functions of unsigned network embedding [belkin and niyogi 2001]. many social the-
ories such as balance and status theories are developed for signed social networks and
they provide fundamental understandings about signed social networks, which could
pave us a way to develop objective functions for signed network embedding. meanwhile
recently deep learning techniques provide powerful tools for representation learning
which have enhanced various domains such as id103, natural language
processing and id161 [lecun et al. 2015]. therefore a useful future direc-
tion is to harness the power of deep learning techniques to learn low-dimensional vec-
tor representations of nodes while preserving the fundamental understanding about
signed social networks from social theories.

4. link-oriented tasks
the objects of link-oriented tasks are links among nodes, which aim to reveal    ne-
grained and comprehensive understandings of links. the availability of negative links
in signed networks not only enriches the existing link-oriented tasks for unsigned net-
works such as link prediction and tie strength prediction, but only encourages novel

(a) link prediction

(b) sign prediction

fig. 6: an illustration of the differences of link prediction and sign prediction.

link-oriented tasks speci   c to signed networks such as sign prediction and negative
link prediction. in this section, we review two extensively investigated link-oriented
tasks in signed networks including link prediction and sign prediction. we would like
to clarify the differences of these two tasks since they are used interchangeably in some
literature. the differences of link prediction and sign prediction are demonstrated in
figure 6:

    in link prediction, signs of old links are given, while no signs are given to links in

sign prediction; and

    link prediction predicts new positive and negative links, while sign prediction pre-

dicts signs of existing links.

4.1. link prediction in signed networks
link prediction infers new positive and negative links by giving old positive and neg-
ative links [leskovec et al. 2010a; chiang et al. 2011]. existing link prediction algo-
rithms can be roughly divided into two groups, which correspond to supervised and
unsupervised methods. supervised methods consider the link prediction problem as
a classi   cation problem by using the existence of links as labels, while unsupervised
methods make use of the topological properties of the snapshot of the network. next,
we will review each group with representative algorithms.

4.1.1. supervised methods. supervised methods treat link prediction as a classi   cation
problem and usually consist of two important steps. one is to prepare labeled data and
the other is to construct features for each pair of users. the    rst step is trivial since
the signs of links can be naturally treated as labels. therefore different algorithms in
this family provide different approaches to construct features.

in addition to indegree and outdegree of positive (or negative) links, triangle-based
features according to balance theory are extracted in [leskovec et al. 2010a]. since
signed social networks are usually very sparse and most users have few of indegree
or outdegree, many users could have no triangle-based features and triangle-based
features may not be robust [chiang et al. 2011]. a link prediction algorithm can be
developed based on any quantitative social imbalance measure of a signed network.
hence, k-cycle-based features are proposed in [chiang et al. 2011], where triangle-
based features are special cases of k-cycle-based features when k = 3. in addition
to k-cycle-based features, incoming local bias (or the percentage of negative reviews
it receives in all the incoming reviews) and outgoing local bias (or the percentage of
negative reviews it gives to all of its outgoing reviews) are also reported to be help-
ful for the performance improvement in link prediction [zhang et al. 2013]. in chem-
ical and biological sciences, the quantitative structure-activity relationship hypoth-
esis suggests that    similar molecules    show    similar activities   , e.g., the toxicity of
a molecule can be predicted by the alignment of its atoms in the three-dimensional

space. this hypothesis may be applicable to social networks     the structure and net-
work patterns of the ego-networks are strongly associated with the signs of their
generated links. therefore, frequent sub-networks from the ego-networks are used
as features in [papaoikonomou et al. 2014]. besides features extracted from topo-
logical information, attributes of users such as gender, career interest, hometown,
movies, thinking are also used as features in [patidar et al. 2012] where it    rst trains
a classi   er based on these features, then suggests new links and    nally re   nes them
which either maintain or enhance the balance index according to balance theory.
other types of features are also used for the problem of link prediction in signed net-
works including user interaction features [dubois et al. 2011] and review-based fea-
tures [borzymek and sydow 2010]. interaction features are reported to be more useful
than node attribute features in [dubois et al. 2011].

4.1.2. unsupervised methods. unsupervised methods are usually based on certain topo-
logical properties of signed networks. algorithms in this family can be categorized into
similarity-based, propagation-based, and low-rank approximation-based methods.
similarity-based methods: similarity-based methods predict the signs of links
based on node similarity. note that similarity-based methods are typically designed
for undirected signed networks. a typical similarity-based method consists of two
steps. first, it de   nes a similarity metric to calculate node similarities. then, it pro-
vides a way to predict positive and negative links based on these node similarities.

one popular way of calculating node similarity is based on user id91. we dis-

cuss two representative approaches below:

    the network is partitioned into a number of clusters using the method
in [doreian and mrvar 1996]. then, the conditional similarity for two clusters a and
b with a third cluster c is de   ned according to [javari and jalili 2014]:

sima,b|c =

ps   sa,b|c ma,smb,s

qs     sa,b|c m2

a,sqs     sa,b|cm2

b,s

(27)

where sa,b|c is the set of nodes in the cluster c, which are linked by nodes in a and
b, and ma,s is the average signs of links from nodes in cluster a to node s. node
similarity is calculated as the similarity between clusters where these two nodes are
assigned.

    spectral id91 based on the laplacian matrix for signed networks is per-
formed [symeonidis and mantas 2013]. then, two similarities are de   ned. the    rst
is the similarity of nodes that are assigned to the same cluster:

simsc(i, j) = 1     kd(i, ci)     d(j, cj )k

the second is the similarity of nodes that are assigned to different clusters:

simdc(i, j) =

1

1 + d(i, ci) + d(j, cj)

(28)

(29)

where d(., .) is a distance metric.

another way of calculating node similarity is based on status theory. according
to status theory, the positive in-degree |i +| and the negative out-degree |o   | of a
node increase its status. in contrast, the positive out-degree |o+|, and negative in-
degree |i    | decrease its status. according to this intuition, similarity is de   ned as

acm computing surveys, vol. 9, no. 4, article 39, publication date: march 2014.

a survey of signed network mining in social media

follows [symeonidis and tiakas 2013]:

sim(i, j) =

1

  (i) +   (j)     1

  (i) = |i +

i | + |o   

i |     |o+

i |     |i    
i |

39:21

(30)

with node similarity, the second step is to determine the signs of links. since we have
pair-wise node similarities, user-oriented collaborative    ltering are used to aggregate
signs from similar nodes to predict positive and negative links [javari and jalili 2014].
another approach is based on status theory and the sign from i to j is pre-
dicted as the sign of the sum of sign(sim(i, k) + sim(k, j)) over all triplets
(i, j, k) [symeonidis and tiakas 2013].
propagation-based methods: the vast majority of propagation-based methods are
proposed for trust-distrust networks, which are a special (and important) class of
signed networks. the adjacency matrix a is very sparse and many entries in a
are zero. the basic idea of propagation-based methods is to compute a dense ma-
trix   a with the same size of a by performing certain propagation operators on
a. then the sign of a link from ui to uj is predicted as sign(   aij) and the likeli-
hood is |   aij|.
in [guha et al. 2004], trust propagation is treated as a repeating se-
quence of matrix operations, which consists of four types of atomic trust propaga-
tions. these four types are direct propagation, trust coupling, co-citation and trans-
pose trust as shown in figure 7. two strategies are studied for incorporating distrust.
the    rst is that of one-step distrust propagation, in which we propagate multiple step
trust and then propagate one-step distrust. the second is that of multiple step dis-
trust propagation in which trust and distrust propagate together. one step distrust
propagation often outperforms multiple step distrust propagation [guha et al. 2004].
however, one step distrust propagation might not converge, when the network is
dominated by distrust links. on the other hand, multiple step distrust propagation
may yield some unexpected behaviors [ziegler and lausen 2005]. to mitigate these
two problems, ziegler and lausen [2005] propose to integrate distrust into the pro-
cess of the appleseed trust metric computation instead of superimposing distrust
afterwards. methods in [guha et al. 2004] and [ziegler and lausen 2005] are based
on the matrix representation. there are methods in this family investigating other
representations such as subjective logic [knapskog 1998], intuitionistic fuzzy rela-
tions [de cock and da silva 2006] and bilattice [victor et al. 2006], which can natu-
rally perform both trust and distrust propagation by de   ning corresponding operators.

low-rank approximation methods: the notion of balance is generalized by
davis in [1967] to weak balance, which allows triads with all negative links. low-
rank approximation methods are based on weak structural balance as suggested
in [hsieh et al. 2012] that weakly balanced networks have a low-rank structure and
weak structural balance in signed networks naturally suggests low-rank models for
signed networks. low-rank approximation methods compute the dense matrix   a via
the low-rank approximation of a instead of propagation operators for propagation-
based methods. with   a, the sign and the likelihood of a link from ui to uj are predicted
as sign(   aij) and |   aij |, respectively. in [hsieh et al. 2012], the link prediction prob-
lem in signed networks is mathematically modeled as a low-rank id105
problem as follows:

(aij     (wt h)ij)2 +   (kwk2

f + khk2

where wt h is the low-rank matrix to approximate a. the square function is chosen
as the id168 in (aij    (wt h)ij)2. pair-wise empirical error, similar to the hinge
loss convex surrogate for 0/1 loss in classi   cation, is used in [agrawal et al. 2013]. they
use of this particular variation since it elegantly captures the correlations amongst
the users and thereby makes the technique more robust to    uctuations in individual
behaviors. in [cen et al. 2013], a low-rank tensor model is proposed for link prediction
in dynamic signed networks.

4.2. sign prediction
most social media services provide unsigned social networks such as the friendship
network in facebook and the following network in twitter, while only few services
provide signed social networks. the task of sign prediction is to infer the signs of ex-
isting links in the given unsigned network. it is dif   cult, if not impossible, to predict
signs of existing links by only utilizing the given unsigned network [yang et al. 2012].
therefore, most of the existing sign predictors use additional sources of information.
the most widely used sources are user interaction information and cross-media infor-
mation.

4.2.1. sign prediction with interaction data. in reality, we are likely to adopt the opinions
from our friends while    ghting the opinions of our foes. as a consequence, decisions of
users with positive links are more likely to agree, whereas for users with negative con-
nections, the chance of disagreement would be considerably higher. in social media,
users can perform positive or negative interactions with other users. positive inter-
actions show agreement and support, while negative interactions show disagreement
and antagonism. there are strong correlations between positive (or negative) links and
positive (or negative) interactions [yang et al. 2012]. tang et al. suggest a straightfor-
ward algorithm for sign prediction based on the correlation between interactions and
links. the    rst step is to initialize signs of links based on interactions. positive signs
are used for positive interactions, whereas negative signs are used for negative in-
teractions. next, the signs of links are re   ned according to status theory or balance
theory [tang et al. 2015]. more sophisticated algorithms incorporate link and interac-
tion information into coherent frameworks. in [yang et al. 2012], a framework with a
set of latent factor models is proposed to infer signs for unsigned links, which capture
user interaction behavior, social relations as well as their interplay. it also models the

principles of balance and status theories for signed networks. a one-dimensional la-
tent factor   i is introduced for ui and then we model the sign between ui and uj as
sij =   i  j, which can capture balance theory. the vector parameter    is introduced
for users to capture their partial ordering, and then the status    i of ui is modeled as
   i =     i where   i is the latent factor vector of ui. status theory characterizes the sign
from ui to uj as their relative status difference    ij =    i        j. yu and xie    nd signi   -
cant correlations and mutual in   uence between user interactions and signs of links.
they propose a mutual latent random graph framework to    exibly model evidence
from user interactions and signs. this approach is used to perform user interaction
prediction and sign prediction simultaneously [yu and xie 2014b; yu and xie 2014a].

4.2.2. sign prediction with cross-media data. in the task of link prediction in signed net-
works leskovec et al.    nd that the learned link predictors have very good generaliza-
tion power across social media sites. this observation suggests that general guiding
principles might exist for sign id136 across different networks, even when links
have different semantic interpretations in different networks [leskovec et al. 2010a].
another useful source for sign prediction is cross-media information. the goal is to pre-
dict signs of a target network with a source signed network. the basic approach is to
learn knowledge or patterns from the source signed network, and use it to predict link
signs in the target network. the vast majority of algorithms in this family use transfer
learning to achieve this goal. one representative way is to construct generalizable fea-
tures that can transfer patterns from the source network to the target network for sign
prediction. since some social theories such as status and balance theories are applica-
ble for all signed networks, it is possible to extract generalizable features suggested by
social theories, such as balance and status theory. in [tang et al. 2012], a factor-graph
model is learned with features from the source network to infer signs of the target
network. although links in different signed networks may have different semantics,
a certain degree of similarity always exists across domains, e.g., similar degree distri-
butions and diameters. with this intuition, an alternative way is to project the source
and target networks into the same latent space. latent topological features are con-
structed to capture the common patterns between the source and target networks. this
is obtained through the following optimization problem [ye et al. 2013]:

min

us,  ,vs,ut,vt

kas     us  v   

s k2

f + kat     ut  v   

t k2

f +   k  k2

f

(32)

where as and at denote the adjacency matrices for the source and target net-
work, respectively. us, vs, ut and vt are four latent topological feature matri-
ces [ye et al. 2013].    is the common latent space for both networks, which ensures
that the extracted topological features of both graphs are expressed in the same space.
with the latent topological features, a id21 with instance weighting al-
gorithm is proposed to predict signs of the target unsigned network at by learning
knowledge from the source signed network as.

4.3. promising directions for link-oriented tasks
for many social media sites, negative links are usually unavailable, which might limit
the applications of mining signed networks. therefore, it is helpful to predict negative
links. furthermore, for most signed social networks in social media, only binary rela-
tions are available and strengths of the relations are not available. in other words, we
would like to perform tie strength prediction. in this subsection, we discuss these two
link-oriented tasks.

4.3.1. negative link prediction. it is evident from recent work that negative links
have signi   cant added value over positive links in various analytical tasks such as

fig. 8: an illustration of the problem of negative link prediction.

positive link prediction [guha et al. 2004; leskovec et al. 2010a], and recommender
systems [victor et al. 2009; ma et al. 2009]. however, it is generally not very de-
sirable for online social networks to explicitly collect negative links [hardin 2004;
kunegis et al. 2013]. as a consequence, the vast majority of social media sites such
as twitter and facebook do not enable users to explicitly specify negative links.
therefore, it is natural to question whether one can predict negative links automati-
cally from the available data in social networks. while this problem is very challeng-
ing [chiang et al. 2013], the results of such an approach have the potential to improve
the quality of the results of a vast array of applications. the negative link prediction
problem is illustrated in figure 8. the negative link prediction problem is different
from both the link prediction and sign prediction problems as follows:

    link prediction in signed networks predicts positive and negative links from existing
positive and negative links. on the other hand, negative link prediction does not
assume the existence of negative links.

    sign prediction predicts signs of already existing links. while the negative link pre-
diction problem needs to identify the pairs of nodes between which negative links are
predicted to exist.

a recent work in [tang et al. 2015] found that negative links can be predicted with
user interaction data by using the correlation between negative interactions and nega-
tive links. furthermore, the proposed negative link predictor in [tang et al. 2015] has
very good generalization across social media sites, which suggests that cross-media
data might be also helpful in the problem. it is possible to build signed networks via
id31 of texts [hassan et al. 2012b; wang et al. 2014], which suggests
that user-generated content has signi   cant potential in predicting negative links in
social media.

4.3.2. tie-strength prediction. the cost of forming links in social media is very low,
as a result of which many weak ties are formed [xiang et al. 2010]. the authors
of [huberman et al. 2008] show that users can have many followees and followers in
twitter with whom they are only weakly associated in the physical world. users with
strong ties tend to be more similar than those with weak ties. since homophily is a use-
ful property from the perspective of mining tasks, such as recommendation and friend
management, it suggests that tie-strength prediction can also be very useful. for un-
signed networks in social media, such as friendship in facebook and twitter, we often
choose a binary adjacency matrix representation where 1 denotes a positive link from
ui to uj and 0 otherwise. the tie-strength prediction task in unsigned networks is to
infer a strength in [0, 1] for a given positive link. the original binary matrix represen-
tation with values in {0, 1} is converted into a continuous valued matrix representation
with values in [0, 1] by tie-strength prediction in unsigned networks.

if we choose one adjacency matrix a to represent a signed network with {   1, 0, 1}
to denote negative, missing and positive links, a tie strength predictor infers strength
values in [-1,0] for negative links and [0,1] for positive links. if we choose two adjacency

a survey of signed network mining in social media

39:25

matrices ap and an in {0, 1} to represent positive and negative links separately, a tie
strength predictor infers strength values in [0,1] for positive and negative links.

previous studies in positive tie-strength prediction problem suggest that pairwise
user similarity is re   ected in strong ties. therefore, the strengths of positive ties are
modeled as the hidden impacts of node similarities. furthermore, the strengths of
positive ties are modeled as the hidden causes of user interactions since they affects
the frequency and nature of user interactions [xiang et al. 2010]. a preliminary work
in [tang et al. 2014b]    nds that it is more likely for two users to have negative links if
they have more negative interactions. analogously, this suggests the following direc-
tions for tie-strength prediction: (a) what is the relation between negative tie strength
and node-node similarities and how negative tie strength impacts user interactions;
and (b) how negative and positive tie strength affect one another.

5. application-oriented tasks
just as unsigned networks are used frequently in the context of various applica-
tions such as data classi   cation [zhu et al. 2007], data id91 [long et al. 2006],
information propagation [kempe et al. 2003] and recommendation [tang et al. 2013],
signed networks can be leveraged as well. application-oriented tasks augment tradi-
tional algorithms with signed networks. for example, in addition to rating information,
recommender systems with signed networks can also make use of signed networks. in
this section, we review the recommendation and information diffusion applications
and discuss promising research directions.

5.1. recommendation with signed networks
assume that r is the user-item ratings matrix where rij is the rating from the i-th
user to the j-th item. in a typical recommender system, most of the entries are miss-
ing. traditional recommender systems aim to predict these missing values by using ob-
served values in r. in the physical world, we always seek recommendations from our
friends, which suggests that social information may be useful to improve recommen-
dation performance. many recommender systems are proposed to incorporate ones   
friends for recommendation and gain performance improvement. a comprehensive re-
view about social recommendation can be found in [tang et al. 2013; tang et al. 2014].
scholars have noted that negative links may be more noticeable and credible than
the positive links with a similar magnitude [cho 2006]. negative links may be as im-
portant as positive links for recommendation. in recent years, systems based on col-
laborative    ltering (cf) are proposed to incorporate both positive and negative links
for recommendation. typically, a cf-based recommender system with signed networks
contains two components corresponding to the basic cf model and the model extracted
from the signed network. the basic cf models are categorized into memory-based and
model-based systems.

5.1.1. memory-based methods. memory-based recommender systems with signed net-
works choose memory-based collaborative    ltering, and especially user-oriented mod-
els [victor et al. 2009; victor et al. 2013; chen et al. 2013b; nalluri 2014]. a typical
user-oriented model    rst calculates pair-wise user similarity based on some similarity
metrics such as pearson   s correlation coef   cient or cosine similarity. then, a missing
rating of user i for item j is predicted by aggregating ratings from the similar peers of
user i as follows:

  rij =   ri + pv   ni

wiv(rvj       rv)

wiv

pv   ni

where ni is the set of similar users of ui,   ri is the average rating from ui and wiv is the
connection strength between ui and uv. there are several strategies for incorporating
negative links into the above user-oriented model as:

    one is to use negative links to avoid recommendations from these    unwanted    users

di is the set of users to whom ui has negative links.

    another way is to consider negative links as negative weights, i.e., considering neg-

ative links as dissimilarity measurements, as [victor et al. 2013]:

div(rvj       rv)

  rij =   ri + pv   ni

where div is the dissimilarity between ui and uv.

    in reality, positive and negative links in signed networks are very sparse therefore
nalluri proposes a recommender system, which    rst propagates positive and nega-
tive values in signed networks and then reduces the in   uence from negative values
as [nalluri 2014]:

  rij =   ri + pv   ni

5.1.2. model-based methods. model-based recommender systems with negative links
use model-based collaborative    ltering. id105 methods are particularly
popular [ma et al. 2009; forsati et al. 2014]. assume that ui is the k-dimensional pref-
erence latent factor of ui and vj is the k-dimensional characteristic latent factor of
item j. a typical id105-based collaborative    ltering method models the
rating from ui to the j-th item rij as the interaction between their latent factors, i.e.,
rij = u   
i vj where ui and vj can be obtained by solving the following optimization
problem:

n and m are the numbers of users and items in a recommender system. the term

f is introduced to avoid over-   tting, controlled by the parameter   . w    
rn  m is a weight matrix where wij is the weight for the rating for ui to vj . a common
way to set w is wij = 1 if we observe a rating from ui to the j-th item, and wij = 0
otherwise. the optimization problem in eq. (37) is convex for u and v, respectively.
therefore it is typically solved by gradient decent methods or alternating least squares.
if ui positively link to uj, ui and uj are likely to share similar preferences. therefore, to
capture positive links, ma et al. [ma et al. 2011] added a term to minimize the distance
of the preference vectors of two users with a positive link based on eq. (37) as follows:

if ui has a negative link to uj, it is likely that ui thinks that uj has totally different
tastes. with this intuition, for a negative link from ui to uj, ma et al. [ma et al. 2009]
introduce a term to maximize the distance of their latent factors based on the matrix
factorization model as follows:

(39)

xi=1

xj=1

where sn
ij is the strength of the negative link for ui to uj. the underlying assumption
of eq. (39) is to consider negative links as dissimilarity measurements. gradient de-
scent is performed in [ma et al. 2009] to obtain a local minimum of the objective func-
tion given by eq. (39). however, recent research suggests that negative links may not
denote dissimilarity and users with negative links tend to be more similar than ran-
domly selected pairs [tang et al. 2014a]. it also observes that users with positive links
are likely to be more similar than pairs of users with negative links, which is very con-
sistent with the extension of the notion of structural balance in [cygan et al. 2012]     a
structure in signed network should ensure that users are able to have their    friends   
closer than their    enemies   , i.e., users should sit closer to their    friends    (or users with
positive links) than their    enemies    (or users with negative links). with this intuition,
for hi, j, ki where ui has a positive link to uj while has a negative link to uk, the latent
factor of ui should be more similar to the latent factor of uj than that of uk to capture
negative links. in particular, for each triple as hi, j, ki, a id173 term is added
as follows:

   (d(ui, uj), d(ui, uk))

(40)

where d is a similarity metric and     is a penalty function that assesses the viola-
tion of latent factors of users with positive and negative links [forsati et al. 2014].
possible choices of    (z) are the hinge id168    (z) = max(0, 1     z) and the lo-
gistic id168    (z) = log(1 + e   z).
in [forsati et al. 2014], stochastic gradient
descent (sgd) method is employed to optimize eq. (40). for a signed network with
n users, there could be n 3 triples that indicates we need to introduce n 3 possi-
ble id173 terms as eq. (40) to capture the signed network for recommen-
dations [forsati et al. 2014]. therefore, the computational cost of the system is very
high. in [tang et al. 2016b], a system with only n extra id173 terms is pro-
posed that is much more ef   cient. a sophisticated recommender system is proposed
in [yang et al. 2012]. this system has several advantages     (1) it can perform recom-
mendation and sign prediction simultaneously; and (2) it is the    rst framework to
model balance theory and status theory explicitly for recommendation with signed
networks.

5.2. information diffusion
information diffusion can enable various online applications such as effec-
tive viral marketing and has attracted increasing attention [kempe et al. 2003;
chen et al. 2009]. there are many information diffusion models for unsigned social
networks including the classic voter model [clifford and sudbury 1973], susceptible-
infected-recovered (sir) epidemic model [may and lloyd 2001],
independent cas-
cade (ic) model [goldenberg et al. 2001a; goldenberg et al. 2001b], and the threshold
model [granovetter 1978; schelling 2006]. one can apply these models of unsigned
networks to signed networks by ignoring negative links. however, ignoring negative
links might result in over-estimation of the impact of positive links [li et al. 2013].
therefore studying information diffusion and maximization in signed networks can
not only help us understand the impact of user interactions on information diversity

but also can push the boundaries of researches about dynamical process in complex
networks. in addition, empirical results on real-world signed networks demonstrate
that incorporating link signs into information diffusion models usually gains in   u-
ence [li et al. 2013; li et al. 2014b; shafaei and jalili 2014]. for example, the voter
model with negative links generates at maximum of 38% and 21% more in   uence in
the epinions dataset compared to the model with only positive links [li et al. 2013].
in the rest of this section, we will review representative diffusion models for signed
networks

5.2.1. voter model for signed networks. a typical scenario of the application of the voter
model is when users    opinions switch forth and back according to their interactions
with other users in networks. the authors of [li et al. 2013; li et al. 2014] investigate
how two opposite opinions diffuse in signed networks based on the voter model pro-
posed in [clifford and sudbury 1973]. it is more likely for users to adopt and trust
opinions from their friends, while users are likely to adopt the opposite opinions of
their foes. this intuition corresponds to the principles of    enemies    enemies are my
friends    and    my enemies    friends are my enemies   . hence, each node ui selects one
user uj from his/her outgoing social networks randomly and performs two possible ac-
tions     (1) if ui has a positive link to the selected user uj, ui adopts uj   s opinion; and
(2) if ui has a negative link to uj, ui chooses the opinion opposite to uj   s.

5.2.2. susceptible-infected-recovered (sir) epidemic model for signed networks. using epi-
demiology to study information spread has become increasingly popular in recent
years [may and lloyd 2001] because the information spread mechanisms are qual-
itatively similar to those of the biological disease spread [volz and meyers 2007].
the standard susceptible-infected-recovered (sir) model assigns one of three states
(susceptible,
infected, or recovered) to each user. based on sir, the authors
of [li et al. 2013; fan et al. 2012] de   ne    ve states for signed networks     (1) s0: sus-
ceptible with neutral opinions; (2) i   : infected with negative opinions; (3) i+: infected
with positive opinions; (4) r   : recovered with negative opinions; and (5) r+: recov-
ered with positive opinions. users with s0 can be infected by users with i    or i+; and
users with r+ or r    do not spread their opinions any more. with the same intuition
in [li et al. 2013], users are likely to adopt and trust opinions from their friends, while
adopting the opposite opinions of their foes. at each step, users with state i+ (or i   )
pick up one user from their social networks to interact with, and they can perform four
possible actions depending on probabilities and the sign of links as shown in table iv.

5.2.3. independent cascade model

in the network
are assigned one of
two states, active or inactive, by independent cascade
model [goldenberg et al. 2001a]. at the t-th step, every active node ui has one
single opportunity to activate inactive users uj in his/her network with an indepen-
dently successful id203 pij. uj becomes active in the t + 1-th step if ui succeeds.
after this opportunity, ui cannot take actions on uj any more in subsequent steps.
the authors of [li et al. 2014b] propose a polarity-related independent cascade
(icp) model for signed networks. each node in the icp model is assigned to one of

three states     (1) negative: adopting but opposing the spreading opinion, (2) positive:
adopting and supporting the opinion, and (3) inactive: not adopting the opinion. there
are two major differences between icp model and the standard ic model. first, each
user can be only activated once in each step for icp. second, if ui activates uj, the
state sj of uj depends on ui   s state si and the sign of their link as sj = si    sij

p uj active neighbor of ui

5.2.4. threshold model for signed networks. the node ui becomes active in the thresh-
old model if and only if his/her active neighbors are more than a threshold   i as -
bij >   i where bij is a weight between ui and uj. the authors
of [shafaei and jalili 2014] introduce an information diffusion model based on the
threshold model for signed networks where each node maintains a payoff matrix. if
the payoff matrices for all nodes are the same, the proposed model boils down to the
standard threshold model. we assume that there are two behaviors    b    and    a   ; all
nodes start with    b    and then some randomly selected nodes change to    a   . in each
iteration, every node observes his/her social network, calculates the payoff matrix and
then adopts the behavior maximizing the bene   ts to him/her. note that the payoff ma-
trix is calculated only for these nodes with behavior    b   . if many friends have the same
behavior, doing the behavior changes can increase the payoff gain, which also increases
if few foes have the behavior.

5.3. promising directions for application-oriented tasks
unsigned networks are exploited to help various real-world applications such as
data classi   cation [sindhwani et al. 2005], data id91 [long et al. 2006], active
learning [bilgic et al. 2010], information propagation [kempe et al. 2003], recommen-
dation [tang et al. 2013], id31 [speriosu et al. 2011] and feature selec-
tion [tang and liu 2012]. therefore, there are many opportunities in the signed net-
work setting. in this subsection, we focus our discussions on two application-oriented
tasks, which are data classi   cation and id91. we focus on these tasks because
these problems are very general and have applicability to many problems such as
id31 [tan et al. 2011; hu et al. 2013]. furthermore, we can follow sim-
ilar ways for data classi   cation and id91 problems to de   ne other application-
oriented tasks such as active learning and feature selection.

5.3.1. data classi   cation with signed networks. figure 9 demonstrates a simple example
for data classi   cation with signed networks. the signed network in figure 9a has
four users (u1, . . . , u4) and each user has some posts (e.g., u1 has two posts p1 and p2).
we use posts in a loose way to cover various types of user-generated content such as
posts, tweets, or images. in data classi   cation with signed networks, there is additional
link information such as user-post and user-user links as shown in figure 9c. let

j. tang et al.

f = {f1, f2, . . . , ff } be a set of f features and p = {p1, p2, . . . , pm } be the set of m
posts. p     rn   m denotes the user-post authorship matrix where pij = 1 if ui creates
pj, and 0 otherwise; x     rm  f denotes the attribute-value representation of p and
y     rm  c is the label indicator matrix where yij = 1 if pi is labeled as the j-th
class and 0 otherwise. the problem of data classi   cation with signed networks is that
of training classi   ers to predict class labels for unseen posts by utilizing data instances
{x, y} and their contextual information from signed networks {p, a}.

research on data classi   cation with unsigned networks found that class labels
of posts from the same user are likely to be consistent, and that users with links
are likely to generate posts with similar class labels [tang and liu 2012]. there are
two popular ways of exploiting contextual information from unsigned networks for
data classi   cation based on these two    ndings. one way is to convert contextual in-
formation into correlation links between posts. this boils down to the problem of
combining content and correlation links for data classi   cation [qi and davison 2009].
the other way is that we    rst extract constraints from contextual information for
posts and extend traditional classi   ers to model these constraints such as laprls
from least squares in [belkin et al. 2006] and lapid166 from support vector ma-
chines [sindhwani et al. 2005]. to address the problem of data classi   cation with
signed networks, we may need to understand the structure of positive and negative
links in signed networks in relation to attributes and labels of posts. for example,
what are the properties of posts from users with negative links in terms of attributes
and labels? if users have both positive and negative links, what are the differences in
terms of their posts? if users with positive links are more likely to generate similar
posts to users with negative links, then the problem boils down to that of classi   cation
with relative comparisons [schultz and joachims 2004].

5.3.2. data id91 with signed networks. different from data classi   cation, data clus-
tering is unsupervised learning, i.e., the label information y is not available. the prob-
lem of data id91 with signed networks is to    nd f that identi   es k post clusters
so that posts in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other
clusters by using information in {x, p, a} and can be formulated as follows:

f : {x, p, a}     {c1, c2, . . . , ck}

(41)

where ci is the i-th clusters identi   ed by a id91 function f .

by introducing the concept of pseudo-labels, unsupervised learning problems can be
transformed into supervised learning problems [masaeli et al. 2010; cai et al. 2010].
hence an intuitive research direction is to transform id91 with signed networks
into classi   cation with signed networks with pseudo-labels. it is likely that posts from
users with negative links may be from different clusters and negative links may serve
as additional constraints when we cluster posts. therefore, another possible direction
for data id91 with signed networks is to transform data id91 algorithms
with unsigned networks by considering negative links as constraints and these con-
straints force posts from users with negatives links to different clusters, which be-
haviors similarly to traditional constraint id91 problem [wagstaff et al. 2001].
recent research investigates how to embed signed networks into a latent space
where nodes sit closer to their    friends    than their    enemies    [cygan et al. 2012;
pardo et al. 2013; kermarrec and thraves 2014]. similarly we can develop algorithms
to embed the combination of signed networks and posts to learn representations for
users and posts simultaneously.

6. conclusions
the availability of large-scale signed networks in social media has encouraged increas-
ing attention on mining signed networks. signed networks are unique in terms of basic
concepts, principles and properties of speci   c computational tasks. this survey article
provides a comprehensive overview about mining signed networks in social media.
we    rst introduce basic concepts, principles and properties of signed networks, in-
cluding signed network representations (section 2.1), properties of positive and nega-
tive links and social theories for signed networks. then, we classify various tasks into
node-oriented, link-oriented, and application-oriented groups. some of these tasks are
well-studied, whereas others need further investigation. for each group, we review
well-studied tasks with representative algorithms and also discuss some tasks that
are not suf   ciently studied with formal de   nitions together with promising research
directions.

in reviewing representative algorithms of well-studied tasks, for the methodology
perspective, we notice that social theories such as balance theory and status theory
are widely used in mining signed networks and we summarize three major ways in ap-
plying social theories in mining signed networks, i.e., feature engineering, constraint
generating and objective de   ning.

    feature engineering: it helps extract features for computational models according
to social theories. for example, in link prediction, triangle-based features are ex-
tracted based on balance theory to improve link predilection [leskovec et al. 2010a],
while triad features are extracted based on status theory to predict signs of links
in [tang et al. 2012].

    constraint generating: it generates constraints from social theories for com-
putational models. id173 is one of the most popular ways to imple-
ment constraint generating. for example, a id173 term is added to cap-
ture signed networks for recommendation based on generalized balance the-
ory [forsati et al. 2014], and balance id173 is de   ned in [tang et al. 2015]
to apply balance theory for negative link prediction.

    objective de   ning: it uses social theories to de   ne the objectives of the compu-
tational models. for example, in [amelio and pizzuti 2013], based on balance the-
ory, two objectives are developed for community detection, and balance theory and
status theory are explicitly captured in the objective functions for sign predic-
tion [yang et al. 2012].

while from the technique perspective, we    nd that similar techniques such as ran-
dom walk, low-rank approximation and spectral id91 are adopted by various
tasks of mining signed networks:

    random walk: given a network and a starting node, we select one of its neighbors
randomly, and move to the neighbor. then we choose a neighbor of this node at ran-
dom, and walk to it etc. the (random) sequence of nodes selected this way is a random
walk on the network [lov   asz 1993]. the techniques of random walk are used in var-
ious tasks of mining signed networks such as node ranking [traag et al. 2010] and
community detection [yang et al. 2007].

    low-rank approximation: low-rank approximation aims to    nd a low-rank matrix
such that the cost function, which measures the    t between the low-rank matrix and
a given matrix, is optimized. it captures the low-rank structure of signed networks
for link prediction [hsieh et al. 2012] and it is one of the major techniques to build
recommender systems with signed networks.

    spectral id91: spectral id91 is derived from the graph partition problem,
which aims to    nd a partition such that the cut (the number of links between two

disjoint sets of nodes) is minimized. spectral id91 is one of the most popular
approaches for community detection [kunegis et al. 2010]. meanwhile, it can natu-
rally generate vector representations for nodes thus it is also widely used in other
tasks such as link prediction [chiang et al. 2013].
