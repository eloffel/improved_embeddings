abstract

   advances in tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) steadily increase the rate
   of generation of ms/ms spectra. as a result, the existing approaches
   that compare spectra against databases are already facing a bottleneck,
   particularly when interpreting spectra of modified peptides. here we
   explore a concept that allows one to perform an ms/ms database search
   without ever comparing a spectrum against a database. we propose to
   take advantage of spectral pairs, which are pairs of spectra obtained
   from overlapping (often nontryptic) peptides or from unmodified and
   modified versions of the same peptide. having a spectrum of a modified
   peptide paired with a spectrum of an unmodified peptide allows one to
   separate the prefix and suffix ladders, to greatly reduce the number of
   noise peaks, and to generate a small number of peptide reconstructions
   that are likely to contain the correct one. the ms/ms database search
   is thus reduced to extremely fast pattern-matching (rather than
   time-consuming matching of spectra against databases). in addition to
   speed, our approach provides a unique paradigm for identifying
   posttranslational modifications by means of spectral networks analysis.

     * [151]    ^   the peptide sequence tag approach reduces the number of
       considered peptides but does not eliminate the need to match
       spectra against the filtered database.
     * [152]    ^  in a blind database search, the list of possible
       modifications is not known in advance, and p suffices to interpret
       s(p*) ([153]7). in a restrictive database search, one also needs
       the list of possible modifications in order to interpret s(p*).
     * [154]       in contrast to the standard de novo algorithms, we do not
       insist on reconstructing the entire peptide and often shorten the
       found path by removing its prefix/suffix if the path does not
       explain any peaks. as a result, the found path does not necessarily
       start/end at the beginning/end of the peptide.
     * [155]        condition (ii) can be viewed as a variation of condition
       (i) if one considers extending a peptide by a few residues as a
       single    mutation    (such variations are common in ms/ms samples).
       more generally, peptides p [1] and p [2] form a peptide pair if
       either (i) p [1] is a modified/mutated version of p [2] or (ii) p
       [1] and p [2] overlap. although our techniques also work for this
       generalization, we decided to limit our analysis to simple peptide
       pairs, as described above. we found that such simple pairs alone
       allow one to interpret most spectra. adding pairs of spectra that
       have more subtle similarities further increases the number of
       spectral pairs but slows down the algorithm.
     * [156]           we remark that the assignments of upper indexes to
       spectra s [1,i] ^b and s [1,i] ^y are arbitrary, and it is not
       known in advance which of these spectra represents b ions and which
       represents y ions.
     * [157]           in the case of spectrum vs. peptide, one knows the sets
       of b and y ions in the theoretical spectrum of the peptide, whereas
       in the spectrum vs. spectrum case this partition is unknown. a
       similar problem was considered by zhang and mcelvain ([158]32) in
       case of ms2 and ms3 spectra comparison.
