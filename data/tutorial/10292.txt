[28]abstract

background

   negation occurs frequently in scientific literature, especially in
   biomedical literature. it has previously been reported that around 13%
   of sentences found in biomedical research articles contain negation.
   historically, the main motivation for identifying negated events has
   been to ensure their exclusion from lists of extracted interactions.
   however, recently, there has been a growing interest in negative
   results, which has resulted in negation detection being identified as a
   key challenge in biomedical id36. in this article, we
   focus on the problem of identifying negated bio-events, given gold
   standard event annotations.

results

   we have conducted a detailed analysis of three open access bio-event
   corpora containing negation information (i.e., genia event, bioinfer
   and bionlp   09 st), and have identified the main types of negated
   bio-events. we have analysed the key aspects of a machine learning
   solution to the problem of detecting negated events, including
   selection of negation cues, feature engineering and the choice of
   learning algorithm. combining the best solutions for each aspect of the
   problem, we propose a novel framework for the identification of negated
   bio-events. we have evaluated our system on each of the three open
   access corpora mentioned above. the performance of the system
   significantly surpasses the best results previously reported on the
   bionlp   09 st corpus, and achieves even better results on the genia
   event and bioinfer corpora, both of which contain more varied and
   complex events.

conclusions

   recently, in the field of biomedical id111, the development and
   enhancement of event-based systems has received significant interest.
   the ability to identify negated events is a key performance element for
   these systems. we have conducted the first detailed study on the
   analysis and identification of negated bio-events. our proposed
   framework can be integrated with state-of-the-art event extraction
   systems. the resulting systems will be able to extract bio-events with
   attached polarities from textual documents, which can serve as the
   foundation for more elaborate systems that are able to detect mutually
   contradicting bio-events.

introduction

   owing to the rapid advances in biomedical research, scientific
   literature is being published at an ever-increasing rate [[31]1]. for
   example, the size of pubmed is increasing at the rate of approximately
   two papers per minute [[32]2]. as a result, it is becoming increasingly
   difficult for biologists to keep abreast of developments within
   biomedicine, and automated means are required to satisfy their
   information needs. consequently, id111 is receiving increasing
   interest within the biomedical field [[33]3-[34]5], as it enriches text
   via the addition of semantic metadata, and thus permits tasks such as
   analysing molecular pathways [[35]6] and performing semantic searches
   [[36]7].

event-based id111

   event-based id111 approaches constitute a promising alternative
   to the traditional approaches, which are mainly based on the
   bag-of-words principle [[37]7-[38]9]. textual events are template-like,
   structured representations of pieces of knowledge contained within
   documents. id111 systems that are able to extract events
   automatically can allow much more precise and focussed retrieval and
   extraction of information than the traditional keyword-based systems
   [[39]8]. event-based retrieval allows the user to specify one or more
   constraints on the events to be retrieved, without having to be
   concerned about the precise wording used in the text. these constraints
   could be in terms of the type of the event, and/or the type(s) of its
   participants, and/or the precise format of participants playing
   particular roles in the event. an example of such a system is medie
   [[40]7], a semantic search engine for medline [[41]10] abstracts.

   furthermore, the event representation of text allows a document to be
   viewed as a collection of nested textual events. we call this the event
   view of a document. when used in conjunction with event and term
   ontologies, the event view can facilitate the extraction of the
   implicit relations present in the text. therefore, the events extracted
   from a document can be used to facilitate more challenging id111
   tasks like recognition of textual id136, i.e., detection of
   entailment and contradiction in textual sources [[42]11].

significance of detecting negated bio-events

   negation is considered a universal property of all human languages
   [[43]12]. however, the concept and manifestation of negation in natural
   languages is far more subtle and complex in force and scope than it is
   in formal logic [[44]13-[45]15]. nonetheless, negation occurs
   frequently in scientific literature, especially in the domain of
   biomedicine. vincze et al. [[46]16] report that around 13% of sentences
   found in biomedical research articles contain some form of negation.
   our analysis of three open access bio-event corpora showed that more
   than 6% of bio-events are negated.

   historically, in the field of biomedical id111, the main
   motivation for the identification of negated events has been to ensure
   their exclusion from an extracted list of interactions. this was mainly
   because most biomedical research has been focussed around the
   publication and analysis of positive results [[47]17]. however, over
   the past decade, there has been a growing interest in negative results,
   for example:
     * the journal of negative results in biomedicine [[48]18] has been
       launched, which, as the name suggests, focusses specifically on
       negative results.
     * the negatome database [[49]19] has been released, which provides
       information about non-interacting protein pairs.
     * efforts have been made to incorporate negation in the popular
       biomedical ontologies [[50]20].

   furthermore, negation detection has been identified as the foremost
   challenge in biomedical id36 [[51]21]. more
   specifically, it has been argued that the recognition of negated
   bio-events is of fundamental practical significance for researchers in
   most biomedical disciplines [[52]22].

   in response to the importance of detecting negated bio-events, we have
   carried out an in-depth analysis of three open access bio-event corpora
   containing negation information, and propose a new classification of
   negated bio-events. we have subsequently used the information resulting
   from our analysis to feed into the design of a machine learning
   solution to the problem of detecting negated bio-events. the resulting
   novel framework for the identification of negated bio-events has been
   evaluated on each of the three open access corpora mentioned above,
   achieving significantly better results than the existing
   state-of-the-art systems.

the task of identifying negated bio-events

   this section provides a brief overview of bio-events and describes the
   problem of identifying negated bio-events.

bio-events

   in its most general form, a textual event is as an action, relation,
   process or state expressed in the text [[53]23]. more specifically, a
   textual event is a structured semantic representation of a certain
   piece of information contained within the text. textual events are
   usually anchored to particular text fragments that are central to the
   description of the event. the most important of these text fragments is
   the event-trigger, which is usually a verb or a noun that indicates the
   occurrence of the event. events are often represented as a
   template-like structure with slots that are filled by the event
   participants. these event participants describe the different aspects
   of the event, e.g., what causes the event, what is affected by it,
   where it took place, etc. based on its function, each participant is
   usually assigned a role within the event. the participants can
   correspond to entities, concepts or even other events. if an event
   contains other events as its participants, then it is called a complex
   event. this kind of event representation allows the information
   contained within a piece of text to be represented as a collection of
   nested events.

   a bio-event is a textual event specialised for the biomedical domain.
   kim et al. [[54]9] define a bio-event as a dynamic bio-relation
   involving one or more participants. these participants can be
   bio-entities or (other) bio-events, and are usually each assigned a
   semantic role/slot like theme and cause, etc. each bio-event is
   typically assigned a type/class from a chosen bio-event
   taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the genia event ontology [[55]9]. similarly,
   the bio-entities are normally also assigned types/classes from a chosen
   taxonomy/ontology, e.g., the gene ontology [[56]24]. the template of a
   bio-event can also contain additional slots, e.g., to denote temporal
   and spatial attributes.
   as an example, consider the following sentence from the genia event
   corpus (pmid: 3035558):    the results suggest that the narl gene product
   activates the nitrate reductase operon   . according to the genia event
   annotation scheme, this sentence contains a single bio-event, anchored
   to the verb activates. figure   [57]1 shows the structured representation
   of this bio-event.
   [58]figure 1 figure 1
   figure 1

   typical structured representation of the bio-event contained in the
   above sentence.

   the fact that the event is anchored to the word activates allows the
   event-type of positive_regulation to be assigned. the event has two
   slots, i.e., theme and cause, whose labels help to characterise the
   contribution that the slot filler makes towards the meaning of the
   event. in this case, the slots are filled by the subject and object of
   the verb activate, both of which correspond to different types of
   bio-entities (i.e., operon and protein).
   figure   [59]2 shows a simple hypothetical sentence with a more complex
   event structure. the event e1 is anchored to the word expression and
   has been assigned the event-type of gene_expression. it has a single
   participant, the arbitrary gene x, which acts as the theme of the
   event. e1 also has a location attribute, which has the arbitrary value
   of z. the word activates has been identified as the event-trigger for
   the complex event e2, which has been classed as a positive_regulation
   event. it has two participants: the arbitrary protein y and the event
   e1, which act as the cause and the theme of the event, respectively.
   [60]figure 2 figure 2
   figure 2

bio-event corpora for training and evaluation

   recently, significant effort has been put into the creation of various
   bio-event corpora. although each of these corpora has been created with
   different aims and motivations, they all contain bio-events of varying
   levels of generality. furthermore, while the general definition of
   bio-events in all corpora complies with the description above, the
   exact specification of a bio-event, the types of participants and the
   semantic roles ascribed to them vary from corpus to corpus. a brief
   description of some of these corpora is as follows:
     * genia event: the genia event corpus [[61]9] contains 1,000 medline
       abstracts in which 36,858 bio-events have been identified. each
       event belongs to one of the 36 event classes defined in the genia
       event ontology. the event participants can be bio-entities or other
       bio-events. each bio-entity belongs to one of the 46 classes
       defined in the genia term ontology. other than the participants, an
       event may contain additional attributes including location, time
       and experimental context.
     * bioinfer: the bioinfer corpus [[62]25] contains 1,100 sentences in
       which 2,662 bio-events have been identified. each event belongs to
       one of the 60 event classes defined in the bioinfer relationship
       ontology. it is important to note that a more general definition of
       bio-event has been used in bioinfer, in that static bio-relations
       [[63]26] have also been marked as bio-events.
     * grec: the gene regulation event corpus (grec) [[64]27] contains 240
       medline abstracts in which 3,067 bio-events have been identified.
       each event has a set of arguments, which can include both the event
       participants and attributes like time, location and manner, etc.
     * genereg: the genereg [[65]28] corpus contains 314 medline abstracts
       in which 1,770 bio-events have been identified. each event belongs
       to one of the 4 classes from the gene regulation ontology.
     * bionlp   09 st (shared task): the bionlp   09 st corpus [[66]29]
       contains 950 medline abstracts. this corpus contains two subsets:
       the development subset, comprising 150 abstracts and the training
       subset, comprising 800 abstracts. the corpus contains a total of
       11,480 bio-events, and each bio-event belongs to one of 9 event
       classes, which form a subset of the classes in the genia event
       ontology.

negated bio-events

   vincze et al. [[67]16] define negation in the context of biomedical
   literature as    the implication of the non-existence of something   .
   negation at the bio-event level is non-existence of an event, i.e., a
   negated bio-event indicates the non-existence of that event. the
   indication of non-existence could be explicit (e.g., the presence of a
   negation marker) or implicit (e.g., semantic id136).
   amongst the bio-event corpora introduced above, only three contain
   annotations relating to event polarity, i.e., genia event, bioinfer and
   bionlp   09 st. negation cues (i.e., words and phrases that explicitly
   indicate a negation) have been explicitly annotated only in bioinfer.
   table   [68]1 shows statistics regarding the annotations present in each
   of the three corpora. in terms of volume, the genia event corpus is the
   largest, with almost 37,000 events, while bioinfer is the smallest,
   with fewer than 2,700 bio-events. regarding event-types, bioinfer is
   the richest, with 60 event-types, whilst bionlp   09 st is the simplest,
   with only 9 event-types. interestingly, the distribution of negated
   bio-events in all three corpora is fairly uniform, ranging between 6.1%
   and 6.4%.

    identification of negated bio-events: task description and analysis

   following previous work [[69]29-[70]33], we treat the task of
   identifying negated bio-events as an independent task in itself. that
   is, we assume that event annotation has already been performed, and aim
   to create an automated means of classifying the identified events
   according to their polarity.

   a related negation detection task, which has recently received
   significant attention, is the detection of negation scopes [[71]34].
   this involves the identification of the sequence of words within in a
   sentence that is affected by a particular negation cue. despite the
   apparent similarities, identification of negated bio-events is
   essentially different from negation scope detection. while scope
   annotation focusses on linguistic properties of the text, the goal of
   bio-event annotation is to identify which kinds of biological
   information appear in which parts of text. therefore, the
   identification of bio-events in text has two distinguishing
   characteristics [[72]9, [73]25, [74]27]:
    1. 1.
       bio-event annotation is information-centred and depends entirely on
       biologists    conception of the relationship between an event, its
       participants and other events expressed in the text.

    2. 2.
       the event-trigger and participants of an event are each mapped to a
       span of text. this usually causes the description of an event to be
       spread over several discontinuous spans in text, which could belong
       to different clauses within a sentence.

   in contrast to the above characteristics, the scopes of negation cues
   are continuous and relatively less ambiguous [[75]16]. a few
   interesting consequences of this contrast are:

     * a sentence containing a negation cue may not contain any negated
       events at all.
     * at the other extreme, negated events may be present even when a
       negation cue is not present in the sentence.
     * the event-triggers and/or participants of several events may fall
       under the scope of a negation cue. however, it is highly unlikely
       that all of these events will be negated.

   vincze et al. [[76]35] conducted an in-depth comparison of a
   linguistically annotated corpus of negation scopes (bioscope) and a
   biologically annotated corpus of negated bio-events (genia event). they
   found that only half (51%) of the bio-events with event-triggers inside
   the scope of a negation cue were actually negated. conversely, 16% of
   negated bio-events had event-triggers which were outside the scope of
   the negation cues present in the sentence containing the event. they
   concluded that negation scope detection is not sufficient for the
   identification of negated bio-events, as the latter is a more complex
   task, which requires a deeper and more complex analysis than other
   negation detection tasks, like negated term detection and negation
   scope detection.

  related work

   this section provides a brief overview of the previous work done on
   types of negation, negation cues, detection of negated terms and
   negation scopes, detection of negated protein-protein interactions
   (ppis) and identification of negated bio-events.

    types of negation

   one of the first attempts at classifying negation in natural language
   was made by aristotle. he concluded that negations can be divided into
   four types, which he named as correlation (e.g., double vs. half),
   contrariety (e.g., good vs. bad), privation (e.g., blind vs. sighted)
   and contradiction (e.g., he sits vs. he does not sit) [[77]14]. in
   terms of more recent work, tottie [[78]13] presented a taxonomy of
   clausal negations in english. she identified 6 top-level categories of
   clausal negation: denials, rejections, imperatives, questions, supports
   and repetitions. harabagiu et al. [[79]36] identified two main classes
   of negation: directly licensed negations and indirectly licensed
   negations. the directly licensed negations include: overt negative
   markers (such as not), negative quantifiers (like no) and strongly
   negative adverbs (like never). the indirectly licensed negations
   include: verbs or phrasal verbs (such as fail), prepositions (such as
   without), weak quantifiers (such as few) and traditional negative
   polarity items (such as a red cent). huang and lowe [[80]37] proposed a
   classification of negations found in medical reports. their
   classification was based on the syntactic category of the negation
   signal and phrase patterns. they identified 4 syntactic categories of
   negation signals: adjective-like (such as no, absent and without),
   adverb (such as not), verb (such as deny) and noun (such as absence).
   they also identified 9 phrase patterns corresponding to the syntactic
   categories.

   to our knowledge, the only previous study on the classification of
   negated bio-events was reported by sanchez-graillet and poesio
   [[81]38], who analysed negated ppis in 50 biomedical articles. they
   identified seven classes of negation for ppis, based on lexical and
   syntactic patterns.

   the different studies outlined above suggest that the best way to
   classify negations appears to be domain-specific. although the work of
   sanchez-graillet and poesio concerns bio-events, their classification
   is specific to ppis and cannot be trivially extended to all types of
   bio-events. therefore, a more general framework is required, which can
   be applied to classify all types negated bio-events.

    negation cues

   a number of different studies have identified negation cues that appear
   in medical and biomedical texts. chapman et al. [[82]39] compiled a
   comprehensive list of 272 negation cues specific to medical discharge
   summaries. they reported that two negation cues (no and without)
   accounted for a large proportion of negative statements. their results
   showed that the distribution of negation cues is zipfian in nature.
   similar results were also reported by mutalik et al. [[83]15], who,
   despite identifying over 60 negation cues, found that only a small set
   of cues account for the majority of negation instances. in their corpus
   of 40 medical documents, only four negation cues accounted for almost
   93% of all negation instances. these cues are no (49%), denies/denied
   (21%), not (13%) and without (10%). a further study by tolentino et al.
   [[84]40] analysed negated biomedical concepts occurring in a corpus of
   41 medical documents. they found that only 5 negation cues (no,
   neither/nor, ruled out, denies and without) accounted for 89% of all
   negated concepts found in the corpus.

   elkin et al. [[85]41] created an ontology of terms that start negations
   (e.g., no, denies and ruled out) and another set which stop the
   propagation of the assignment of negation (e.g., other than). kilicoglu
   and bergler [[86]30] created a list of 9 negation cues from the
   bionlp   09 st corpus. morante [[87]42] compiled a list of negation cues
   observed in the bioscope [[88]16] corpus, identifying 8 ambiguous and
   21 unambiguous negation cues. she also provided a description for the
   scope of each cue based on its syntactic context. sarafraz and nenadic
   [[89]33] used the previous studies on negation to derive a primary list
   of 14 negation cues. they further compiled a secondary list of 18
   additional negation cues that were semi-automatically extracted from
   the bionlp   09 st corpus. interestingly, their list contains the word
   inhibit, which is treated as an indicator of negative_regulation (i.e.,
   a positive event indicating down-regulation) rather than a marker of
   negation in the bionlp   09 st, genia event and bioinfer corpora.

   in terms of automated approaches, morante and daelemans [[90]43]
   proposed a machine learning system for the identification of negation
   cues. their system achieved an f-score of over 99% for both clinical
   notes and biomedical abstracts. however, their system treated 17
   strings as unambiguous negation markers, i.e., every occurrence of
   these strings was treated as a negation cue. these unambiguous cues
   accounted for 95% of all instances of negations. agarwal and yu
   [[91]44] developed a system for the automatic identification of
   negation cues using id49 (crf). their system
   achieved an f-score of 98% for clinical notes and 97% for biomedical
   abstracts.

   the numbers of negation cues identified in the above studies vary
   considerably. it appears that the optimal negation cue list varies,
   both according to the domain of the text and the exact context/task in
   which they are identified.

    detection of negated terms, negated sentences and negation scopes

   the bulk of work on negation detection in the biomedical domain has
   been focussed on the detection of negated terms in medical reports.
   this work includes both rule-based and machine learning approaches. the
   key rule-based solutions include those presented by chapman et al.
   [[92]39], mutalik et al. [[93]15], elkin et al. [[94]41], huang and
   lowe [[95]37] and boytcheva et al. [[96]45]. the key machine learning
   approaches include the systems presented by averbuch et al. [[97]46],
   goldin and chapman [[98]47], goryachev et al. [[99]48], rokach et al.
   [[100]49] and councill et al. [[101]50].

   wilbur et al. [[102]51] created a corpus of 6,945 text fragments
   (sentences and clauses) in which each fragment is annotated along five
   dimensions, one of which is polarity. their corpus contained 6,498
   (94%) positive and 447 (6%) negative fragments. shatkay et al.
   [[103]52] used this corpus to develop an automated system for
   identifying negated text fragments. their system achieved a precision
   of 96% and a recall of 93%.

   vincze et al. [[104]16] developed bioscope, an open access corpus of
   biomedical text containing token level annotations for negation cues
   and their respective scopes. the bioscope corpus comprises three
   sub-corpora: (1) clinical reports containing 6,383 sentences, (2)
   biomedical articles containing 2,670 sentences and (3) biomedical
   abstracts containing 11,871 sentences. morante and daelemans [[105]43]
   presented a machine learning approach to detecting the scope of
   negation cues and tested their system on the bioscope corpus. their
   system determined the full scope of negation cues with an accuracy of
   66% for abstracts, 41% for papers and 71% for clinical notes.

    detection of negated ppis

   sanchez-graillet and poesio [[106]38] developed a set of heuristics for
   extracting negated ppis from biomedical articles. they implemented
   their system using a functional dependency grammar (fdg) parser. their
   preliminary results ranged from 54% to 63%   f-score, depending on the
   method of protein name recognition. the system achieved 77%   f-score
   when used with gold standard protein annotations.

    detection of negated bio-events

   identification of negated bio-events was an optional sub-task in the
   bionlp   09 shared task challenge [[107]29]. six teams participated in
   this task and reported the first results on the identification of
   negated bio-events. the rule-based system of kilicoglu and bergler
   [[108]30] was ranked in first position, with 14% recall, 51% precision
   and 23%   f-score. van landeghem et al. [[109]32] achieved the second
   best results of 11% recall, 45% precision and 17%   f-score. they also
   used a customised rule-based system. mackinlay et al. [[110]31] used a
   machine-learning approach with complex deep parse features. their
   system achieved the third best results with 5% recall, 34% precision
   and 9%   f-score. it is important to note that these systems did not
   operate on gold standard event annotations. instead, they performed
   event extraction as a preliminary step to the identification of negated
   events. the approximated f-scores for these systems if gold standard
   event annotations were provided are 38%, 26% and 28%, respectively.
   these values have been calculated using a linear extrapolation function
   and the maximum (100%) recall value for event extraction.

   sarafraz and nenadic [[111]33] proposed a machine learning approach for
   the identification of negated bio-events. they implemented an id166
   classifier with a linear kernel using features engineered from a
   sentence parse tree with lexical cues. they trained their classifier on
   the bionlp   09 training dataset and tested it on the bionlp   09
   development dataset. they achieved 38% precision, 76% recall and
   51%   f-score. in a further experiment, they split the data into smaller
   sets containing different event-types, and trained and tested the
   classifier separately for each smaller dataset. this way, they achieved
   a micro average of 49% precision, 88% recall and 63%   f-score.

[112]methods

types of negated bio-events

   we conducted an in-depth analysis of the types of negation observed in
   the three open access bio-event corpora containing negation annotation.
   we analysed a total of 1,000 randomly selected negated bio-events, of
   which 600 were from the genia event corpus (over 25% of all negated
   events in the corpus), 300 were from the bionlp   09 shared task corpus
   (over 40% of all negated bio-events in the corpus) and 100 were from
   the bioinfer corpus (over 60% of all the negated bio-events in the
   corpus). our analysis revealed five main types of negated bio-events:

inherently negative bio-events

   these are bio-events in which the event-trigger is itself a negation
   cue, like independent, immobilization, unaffected, dysregulation, etc.
   as an example, consider the sentence shown in figure   [113]3. the event
   e1 is triggered by the word infection and represents the initiation of
   viral infection of hiv-1. the event e2 is triggered by the word
   dysregulation and expresses the non-existence of the regulation of
   cytokine caused by e1; therefore it has been annotated as a negated
   event.
   [114]figure 3 figure 3
   figure 3

   inherently negative bio-event example (source: genia event corpus;
   pmid: 9427533).

negated event-trigger

   in this category, an explicit negation cue modifies the event-trigger.
   for example, consider the sentence shown in figure   [115]4. the event e1
   indicates the positive regulation of nf-kappab by il-1beta, where the
   events e2 and e3 indicate the regulation of e1 by the gtpases (protein
   molecules) rac1 and cdc42, respectively. both e2 and e3 are negated, as
   they are both triggered by the word required, which is being modified
   by the explicit negation cue not. interestingly, the scope of the
   negation cue (not), according to the bioscope annotation guidelines,
   also includes the trigger for event e1 (which is not negated).
   [116]figure 4 figure 4
   figure 4

   bio-event example with negated event-trigger (source: genia event
   corpus; pmid: 10022882).

negated participant

   this category corresponds to bio-events in which at least one
   participant (theme or cause) is modified by an explicit negation cue.
   as an example, consider the sentence shown in figure   [117]5. both
   events, e1 and e2, are triggered by the phrase synergistically induced;
   however, they have opposite polarities. event e1 expresses the
   positive_regulation of irf-1 by il-2 and il-12, while e2 expresses the
   non-existence of positive_regulation of irf-1 by ifn-alpha and il-12.
   the explicit negation cue not modifies the two causes of e2, i.e.,
   ifn-alpha and il-12. again, it is important to note that the scope of
   this cue (not) includes neither the trigger for event e2 nor any of its
   participants.
   [118]figure 5 figure 5
   figure 5

   bio-event example with negated participant (source: genia event corpus;
   pmid: 10358173).

negated attribute

   there are bio-events in which an explicit negation cue modifies an
   event attribute, such as location. an example of this type of negation
   is shown in figure   [119]6. the events e1, e2, e3, e4, e5 and e6 are all
   triggered by the word coexpressed. however, e1 and e4 represent the
   expression of the genes 5-lox and flap (respectively) in lymphoid
   cells, while e2, e3, e5 and e6 represent the expression of these genes
   in monocytic and epithelial cells respectively. the explicit negation
   cue not modifies the phrase in monocytic or epithelial cells. this
   phrase contains the location for e2, e3, e5 and e6, making these events
   negated.
   [120]figure 6 figure 6
   figure 6

   bio-event example with negated attribute (source: bionlp st corpus;
   pmid: 10022882).

   despite its relatively low frequency, this is an important type of
   negated bio-event. in a recent article on biologists    perspective of
   negation, krallinger [[121]22] identified events with negated locations
   as of particular interest to biomedical practitioners.

comparison and contrast

   this category corresponds to bio-events where the negation is signalled
   via contrast or comparison, normally with another bio-event. sentences
   containing such negated events often lack an explicit negation marker.
   however, the bioinfer corpus is unique in the sense that it annotates
   even contrast and comparison markers as negation cues. figure   [122]7
   shows an example of this type of negation. the event e1 is triggered by
   the word activate, and it expresses the positive_regulation of p38 mapk
   by mkk3 in lps-treated neutrophils. the events e2 and e3 are similar to
   e1 except that they are caused by mkk4 and mkk6, respectively. both e2
   and e3 have been annotated as negated; this is despite the fact that
   the sentence lacks an explicit negation cue.

distribution

   our analysis revealed that the instances of each of the five main types
   of negated bio-events are present in the three corpora with varying
   frequencies. table   [124]2 shows the distributions in the three
   different corpora and the macro and micro averages for each type.

   the frequency of inherently negative bio-events ranges between 9% and
   13%, with a micro average of 12%. this is the second most prevalent
   type in genia event and the third most prevalent in bioinfer and
   bionlp   09 st. the frequency of negated trigger events ranges between
   61% and 67% in the three corpora, with a micro average of 63%. this is
   the predominant type in all three corpora. the frequency of the negated
   participants type ranges between 10% and 17%, with a micro average of
   11%. this is the second most prevalent type in bionlp   09 st and
   bioinfer and the third most prevalent type in genia. on average, 6% of
   negated events are of the negated attribute type; however, the
   frequency within the different corpora ranges between 2% and 7%. we
   note that the bioinfer corpus does not mark temporal or spatial
   attributes of bio-events. instead, it incorporates specialized
   event-types for capturing this type of information. finally, the
   comparisons and contrasts type accounts for 8% of negated bio-events.

    discussion

   previous work on the identification of negated events has primarily
   been focussed on negated trigger events, i.e., the cases where a
   negation cue modifies the event-trigger. however, our analysis shows
   that a significant proportion (37%) of negated events belongs to the
   other types. therefore, a system for effectively identifying negated
   bio-events should have the ability to recognise all types of negated
   events.

   the most direct method of facilitating the recognition of a particular
   negated event-type by the system is to engineer features corresponding
   to that type, e.g., features based on constituency or dependency
   relations between the negation cue and the event constituents
   (triggers, participants and attributes). since the manifestations of
   the comparison and contrast type usually lack an explicit negation cue,
   a different approach is required for this type. one possibility would
   be to identify the comparison/contrast markers and patterns and
   engineer features based on them. feature engineering is discussed in
   detail in the    feature design    section below.

  analysis of negation cues

   although the context and syntactic structure of a sentence play
   important roles in determining the negation status of a bio-event
   contained within the sentence, the presence of a negation cue is the
   most important factor to be considered.

    ambiguity of negation cues

   negation cues can be ambiguous [[125]42, [126]53], i.e., in some
   contexts they may not trigger negations. wilson et al. [[127]54]
   pointed out the difference between the lexical and contextual
   polarities of a word. the lexical polarity is the prior or fixed
   polarity ascribed to a word, based on its meaning and general usage in
   the language. the contextual polarity of a word is more dynamic, and
   depends on the context of the text fragment containing the word. the
   contextual polarity can be different from the lexical polarity, and
   this difference is the key source of ambiguity in determining whether a
   word or phrase constitutes a negation cue. for example, consider the
   words lack and loss. both of these words have a negative lexical
   polarity, as they convey the    state of not having something   . that is
   why they have been identified as negation cues in the bioscope corpus.
   morante [[128]42] also identified both of these words as unambiguous
   negation cues. however, from a biological perspective, these words have
   a positive polarity when used in the context of a negative_regulation
   event. hence, a positive contextual polarity can be ascribed to these
   words in certain instances. similarly, the words absent and absence may
   also be used to convey negative regulation rather than negation.

   figure   [129]8 shows a case of conflicting lexical and contextual
   polarities. in the sentence shown, the event e1 is anchored to the word
   loss, and it expresses the negative_regulation of the protein molecule
   stat1 in cells from patients treated with fludrabine in vivo. note that
   the polarity of e1 is positive.
   [130]figure 8 figure 8
   figure 8

   an instance of the word loss with positive contextual (biological)
   polarity; source   =   pmid: 10202937.

   based on our analysis of negated bio-events, we conclude that the
   ambiguity status of a negation cue is not universal. rather, it is
   determined by the:

     * nature of text under consideration
     * annotation perspective (e.g., linguistic or biological)
     * context of the surrounding text and the lexical polarity of the cue

    indicators of low manner of interaction

   sometimes, the text containing a bio-event also contains a word or
   phrase that provides an indication of the rate, level, strength or
   intensity of the interaction. in [[131]55], we refer to this indication
   as the manner of the event, and three types of manner are
   distinguished: high, neutral and low. the words indicating a low manner
   include adjectives and adverbs like weak, weakly, slight, slightly,
   slow, small, little, low, etc.

   indicators of low manner have historically been treated as negation
   cues. in the field of id31, such indicators have been
   considered as a special class of negative polarity indicators. wiegand
   et al. [[132]53] refer to this class of cues as diminishers, while
   wilson et al. [[133]54] have labelled them as negative polarity
   shifters. similarly, indicators of low manner have been treated as
   negation cues in the field of biomedical id111. examples can be
   found in the three corpora of negated bio-events (i.e., genia event,
   bioinfer and bionlp   09 st), as well as in the bioscope corpus.
   figure   [134]9 shows an example sentence where the low manner indicator
   little has been interpreted as a negation cue for the event e3.
   [135]figure 9 figure 9
   figure 9

   an instance of the low manner indicator little being treated as a
   negation cue; source   =   pmid: 20562282.

   in [[136]55], we proposed an alternative approach to event
   interpretation. we argued that polarity and manner should be treated as
   orthogonal dimensions of event interpretation, i.e., the value of
   manner should not influence the value of polarity and vice-versa.
   according to this approach, the event e3 in figure   [137]9 would have a
   low manner but a positive polarity.

    deactivators of negation cues

   the ability of some words to act as negation cues is affected by the
   syntactic constructions in which they are used. this means that a word
   that normally acts as a negation cue can cease to act in that capacity
   if it is preceded and/or followed by certain other words. we refer to
   these syntactic patterns as negation deactivation patterns. here, we
   focus only on the two most common negation cues i.e., no and not.

     * deactivators of not: the word not is the most frequent negation cue
       in the bioscope corpus and accounts for over 41% of the total
       negation instances in the corpus. however, in almost 8% of cases,
       it does not indicate a negation, i.e., it ceases to act as a
       negation cue. in our analysis, we focussed on a simple deactivation
       pattern: not   <   deactivatorofnot>. the pattern indicates an
       occurrence of the word not immediately followed by one of its
       deactivators. we only considered the following five deactivators:
       clear, evident, known, necessarily and only.

   in our analysis of the genia event corpus, we discovered a total of 261
   events which belonged to the sentences containing the above pattern.
   amongst these, 258 events (99%) were positive and only 3 events (1%)
   were negated, suggesting that this is an effective pattern for
   identifying the deactivated instances of the word not.

     * deactivators of no: the word no is the second most frequent
       negation cue in the bioscope corpus and accounts for almost 30% of
       the total negation instances in the corpus. however, in over 6% of
       cases, it does not indicate a negation. morante [[138]42] has
       identified several constructions which contain the word no, but do
       not trigger a negation. these constructions include: no sign of, no
       evidence of, no proof and no guarantee that.

   our analysis of the genia event corpus revealed that in some cases,
   these constructions do trigger negated events. for example, consider
   the sentence in figure   [139]10, where the construction no evidence
   triggers the negation of event e2. based on our analysis, we conclude
   that the deactivation patterns identified for linguistic (scope)
   annotation may not hold for biological (event) annotation.

   figure 10

   source   =   pmid: 10221643.

    relationship between the negation cues and event-types

   we investigated the relationship between negation cues and different
   types of bio-events. our analysis revealed two classes of negation cues
   with respect to event-types. these are:

     * type-independent negation cues: this class includes typical
       negation markers like no, not and fail etc. some inherently
       negative event-triggers which can be applied to various types of
       events are also included in this category. for example,
       event-triggers like unaffected and independent can be used for
       various types of events including positive_regulation,
       negative_regulation and correlation events.
     * type-dependent negation cues: this class includes cues like
       immobilize, decoupling and dysregulation, which act as negation
       cues for specific event-types: immobilize and decoupling are used
       only for localization events, while dysregulation is used only for
       regulation events.

    corpus / domain idiosyncrasies

   certain cues which are unambiguous and/or frequent in one corpus can be
   ambiguous and/or scarce in another. for example, words like protected
   and abolish are treated as negation cues in bioinfer. however, they are
   mostly interpreted as indicators of negative_regulation, rather than
   negation, in the genia event and bionlp   09 st corpora.

   on the other hand, the verb fail is frequent and mostly unambiguous as
   a negation cue in the genia event and bionlp   09 st corpora. however, in
   the bioinfer corpus, it does not appear as a negation cue even once.

    compilation of cue lists

   having identified negation cues as an important factor in the
   identification of negated bio-events, we conclude that it is important
   to:

     * determine the impact of the choice of cue lists on the overall task
       performance
     * identify an optimum cue list for the task

   based on the above analysis, we decided: (1) not to create separate
   lists for ambiguous and unambiguous cues, (2) to treat low manner
   indicators as negation cues. we then compiled four separate lists of
   negation cues for comparison. table   [141]3 depicts the elements in each
   list. a brief description of each list is as follows:

     * c40: we formulated a list of 40 cue words by combining the
       previously published lists and cues discovered during our own
       initial analysis of negated bio-events.
     * cbioinfer: we extracted negation cues from the bioinfer corpus.
       this was a straightforward task, because the cues had already been
       annotated. we discarded the cues which occurred only once in the
       corpus and labelled the remaining list as cbioinfer.
     * cbioscope: this is the list of 28 negation cues, compiled by
       morante [[142]42] from the bioscope corpus.
     * ccore: we analysed 1,000 randomly selected negated bio-events from
       the three corpora containing negated bio-events. we recorded all
       the negation cues observed in these bio-events, and selected the 20
       most frequent cues to form this list.

  feature design

   feature engineering and selection is a vital part of any machine
   learning system. various types of features have previously been used
   for different negation detection tasks. however, most previous work has
   concentrated on event-triggers, whilst the other semantic aspects of
   the event (like location and participants) have been ignored. based on
   our analysis of negated bio-events, we engineered various syntactic,
   semantic, lexical, lexico-syntactic and lexico-semantic features. we
   used the enju parser [[143]56] for extracting the part of speech (pos)
   tags, phrase structure trees and the dependency relations. a brief
   explanation of each feature set is as follows:

     * syntactic features: these include the pos tags of the
       event-trigger, event-themes, event-causes and the negation cues
       found in the sentence.
     * semantic features: these features are constructed from the semantic
       information available for the bio-event. they include the semantic
       type of the bio-event (e.g., gene_expression, localization,
       positive_regulation etc.), the semantic type of each participant
       (e.g., lipid, dna molecule and protein complex etc.) and the role
       of each participant (e.g., theme and cause, etc.). we have also
       used a complexity feature, which indicates whether a bio-event is
       complex, i.e., whether it has one or more participants which are
       bio-events themselves.
     * lexical features: these include: whether there is a negation cue
       present in the sentence, the cue itself, whether a negation
       deactivator is present and its relative position with respect to
       the negation cue.
     * lexico-semantic features: these features are constructed using a
       combination of the    textual    bio-event information and the sentence
       containing the bio-event. the textual bio-event information
       includes the text fragment indicating the occurrence of the
       bio-event (i.e., the event-trigger), the text fragments identifying
       the event participants and the text fragments indicating any event
       attributes, like location, etc. these features also include the
       surface distances between the negation cue and the event-trigger
       and event-location, whether the negation cue is part of the
       event-trigger and whether the negation cue precedes or follows the
       event-trigger.
     * dependency (lexico-syntactic) features: these features are
       constructed using the textual bio-event information and the
       dependency relations found in the sentence. they include: whether
       direct and/or indirect dependency relations exist between the
       negation cue and the event-trigger and/or event-location, the types
       of these dependency relations and the length of the dependency
       chains.
     * constituency (lexico-syntactic) features: these include command and
       scope features. the concept of a command relation was first
       introduced by langacker [[144]57] as a means of identifying the
       nodes affected by a given element in the constituency parse tree of
       a sentence. he defined an s-command relation as follows:    a node x
       commands a node y if neither x nor y dominates the other and the s
       (sentence) node most immediately dominating x also dominates y   . we
       used several command features including the existence of s-, vp-
       and np-command relations between the negation cue and the
       event-trigger and/or event-location. the scope features were
       engineered using the information pertaining to whether the
       event-trigger, event-participants or event-location fall under the
       syntactic scope of the negation cue.

  machine learning algorithms

   the choice of machine learning algorithm can significantly influence
   the performance of a classification task. this has been demonstrated
   for various natural language processing tasks including text
   categorisation [[145]58], id51 [[146]59] and the
   detection of negated terms [[147]48]. in order to measure the impact of
   the choice of learning algorithm on the task of identifying negated
   bio-events, we decided to compare the performance of the most commonly
   used learning algorithms. we chose the following six algorithms, and
   used their weka [[148]60] library implementations to carry out our
   experiments:

     * id90: decision tree algorithms learn rules that are
       expressed as    conjunctions of constraints on the attribute values
       of instances. each path from the tree root to a leaf corresponds to
       a conjunction of attribute tests and the tree itself to a
       disjunction of these conjunctions    [[149]61]. various decision tree
       algorithms have been proposed over the years. however, we
       concentrated on c4.5 [[150]62], which is an enhanced version of  
       [[151]63]. the c4.5 algorithm constructs the decision tree by
       choosing the attribute with the highest value of normalised
       information gain at each node and creates new branches
       corresponding to the different values of this attribute. once the
       initial tree has been created, the algorithm tries to identify and
       remove the least useful branches. id90 have been used
       extensively for various problems in bioinformatics [[152]64]. they
       have also been used to detect negations in medical texts [[153]47].
       our implementation of c4.5 used the following optimisation
       settings: (1) apply sub-tree replacement, (2) apply sub-tree
       raising, (3) require a minimum of 2 instances per leaf, (4) set a
       confidence threshold for pruning of 0.25.
     * id79: the id79 [[154]65] algorithm develops an
       ensemble (i.e., a forest) of id90 from randomly sampled
       subspaces of the input features. once the forest has been created,
       new objects are classified using a two-step process: (1) an
       individual classification is obtained from each tree in the forest,
       (2) the final classification of the object is determined by
       majority votes among the classes obtained from individual trees.
       despite being successfully used for various id111 and
       bioinformatics tasks [[155]66, [156]67], the id79
       algorithm has not been previously used for detecting negation
       scopes, negated concepts or negated events. our implementation of
       id79 used the following optimisation settings: (1) set the
       number of trees in the forest to 10, (2) set the number of features
       used to build individual trees to log(n   +   1), where n is the total
       number of features, (3) set no restrictions on the depth of
       individual trees.
     * id28: id28 classifiers try to predict
       the class id203 of an object by fitting the training data to
       a logistic function [[157]61]. id28 classifiers have
       previously been used to identify negated bio-events [[158]31].
     * na  ve bayes: na  ve bayes is one of the simplest probabilistic
       classification algorithms. it uses the bayes id203 model for
       predicting the class probabilities of inputs. the word na  ve
       indicates that the algorithm assumes class conditional
       independence, i.e., it assumes that the effect of a variable value
       on a given class is independent of the values of other variables
       [[159]61]. despite its simplicity, the na  ve bayes algorithm
       achieves good results for many complex classification problems
       [[160]68]. it has also been used to detect negations in medical
       texts [[161]47, [162]48]. our implementation of na  ve bayes used a
       default precision of 0.1 for numeric attributes for cases of zero
       training instances.
     * id166: support vector machines (id166s) [[163]69] perform
       classification by constructing an n-dimensional hyperplane that
       optimally separates the data into two categories. they use a kernel
       function to transform the data into a higher dimensional space,
       which paves the way for optimal separation. many previous studies
       in negation detection have used id166s [[164]33, [165]43, [166]48].
       our implementation of id166 replaced all missing values, and
       converted the nominal attributes to binary attributes. it also
       normalised all attributes by default. we used: (1) a polynomial
       kernel, (2) the default value of the complexity constant.
     * instance-based algorithms: instance-based (also known as
       memory-based) learning algorithms do not derive generalisations or
       abstractions from the complete training data. rather, they keep all
       training data in memory, and generate classification predictions
       using only the most similar training instances. ib1 [[167]70] is an
       instance-based learning algorithm. it uses normalised euclidean
       distance to find the training instance closest to a given test
       instance, and predicts the same class as this training instance.
       ib1 is similar to the nearest neighbour algorithm, except that it
       normalises its attributes    ranges, processes instances
       incrementally, and has a simple policy for tolerating missing
       values. instance-based learning algorithms have previously been
       used for detecting negation cues and their scopes [[168]43].

[169]results

   we ran a series of experiments to obtain the best results for each
   dataset and to systematically evaluate the impact of using different
   cue lists and learning algorithms. this section describes the results
   of our experiments. all results are based on 10-fold cross validation.
   we have used the standard metrics of precision, recall and f-score for
   reporting and comparing results. precision is the number of true
   positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives;
   recall is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true
   positives and false negatives; and f-score is the first harmonic mean
   of precision and recall.

best results for each dataset

   on the genia event dataset, the best results were achieved by the
   id79 classifier using the c40 cue list. the classifier
   achieved 83% precision and 67% recall, which equates to an f-score of
   74%. the same classifier achieved the best results on the bionlp   09 st
   dataset, achieving approximately 78% precision, 64% recall and
   70%   f-score. the best results on the bioinfer dataset were also
   achieved by a id79 classifier. however, the cbioinfer cue list
   was used to engineer the features. this classifier achieved 86%
   precision, 85% recall and 85%   f-score. table   [170]4 shows the best
   results achieved for each dataset.

  cue list comparison

   in order to compare the performance of the four cue lists, we ran a
   series of experiments using each cue list (in turn) to engineer the
   features. in all cases, the id79 algorithm was used, as it had
   consistently produced the best results for all datasets. table   [171]5
   shows the performance of the classifiers trained using the four cue
   lists for each of the datasets. the key results are as follows:

     * the use of the c40 cue list resulted in high performance on all
       three datasets. this list resulted in better performance than other
       cue lists on genia event and bionlp   09 st, achieving the highest
       precision and recall on both datasets. however, on bioinfer it
       resulted in lower performance than when the cbioinfer and ccore
       lists were used.
     * the use of the ccore cue list resulted in consistent performance,
       achieving the second best results (f-score) for all three datasets.
       the results were very close to the top performing cue list for
       genia event and bionlp   09 st, with margins of 0.5% and 1.8%,
       respectively. however, on bioinfer, the f-score was 7% less than
       when the cbioinfer list was used.
     * using the cbioinfer cue list caused a significant performance drop
       on genia event and bionlp   09 st (by almost 5% and 8%,
       respectively), compared to when c40 and ccore were used. however,
       as expected, it resulted in the best performance on bioinfer by a
       fair margin (over 7%).
     * the classifiers trained using the cbioscope cue list achieved the
       lowest results for all three datasets by significant margins
       (ranging between 6% and 8%).

   the difference between the best and the worst performance caused by the
   choice of cue list was 5% for genia event, 7% for bioinfer and 8% for
   bionlp   09 st. this provides sufficient evidence in favour of the
   hypothesis that the choice of the negation cues used for engineering
   the feature set has a significant impact on the performance of a system
   designed for the identification of the negated bio-events.

  algorithm comparison

   in order to compare the performance of the chosen learning algorithms
   for the task of identifying negated bio-events, we ran a series of
   experiments on each dataset. in each experiment, we constructed a
   classifier using the chosen algorithm. the features were engineered
   from the ccore cue list. we chose the ccore cue list because it had
   performed consistently on all three datasets. table   [174]6 shows the
   results for each dataset. the key findings are as follows:

     * c4.5 performed consistently (in terms of f-score) on all three
       datasets. it outperformed the other algorithms on bionlp   09 st,
       scored second on genia event and fourth on bioinfer.
     * id79 outperformed the other algorithms on genia event and
       bioinfer, and scored second on the bionlp   09 st by a narrow margin
       of 0.8%.
     * id28 achieved the third best results on both genia
       event and bioinfer. it scored fourth on bionlp   09 st.
     * na  ve bayes achieved the highest recall for all datasets. however,
       its precision was noticeably low (ranging between 32% and 42%),
       which led to the lowest f-scores for all datasets.
     * id166 scored fifth for all three datasets. although it performed much
       better than na  ve bayes, it was significantly behind id79
       and c4.5.
     * ib1 produced the second best results for bioinfer and the fourth
       best results for both genia event and bionlp   09 st.

   rest of the algorithms, the difference was still 10% for genia event,
   5% for bioinfer and 8% for bionlp   09 st. this provides sufficient
   evidence in favour of the hypothesis that in addition to the choice of
   negation cue list, the choice of learning algorithm also has a
   significant impact on the performance of a (machine learning) system
   for identifying negated bio-events.

[177]discussion

comparison with previous results

   as mentioned earlier, the identification of negated bio-events is a new
   area of research and only a few results have been reported previously.
   the best results on the identification of negated bio-events were
   reported by sarafraz and nenadic [[178]33]. they used the training
   subset of the bionlp   09 st dataset for training their system and the
   development subset for testing. they achieved 38% precision, 76% recall
   and 51%   f-score. in comparison, our system achieved an f-score of above
   70% with 10-fold cross validation on the entire bionlp   09 st dataset.
   in order to obtain a more direct comparison, we conducted further
   experiments with the same experimental settings as those used by
   sarafraz and nenadic. that is, we trained our id79 classifier
   on the training subset of the bionlp   09 st data and tested it on the
   development subset. in this setting, our system achieved an f-score of
   just under 70%, which is significantly higher than the results of
   sarafraz and nenadic.

   our system achieved even better results on the genia event
   (74%   f-score) and bioinfer (85%   f-score) datasets. this is particularly
   encouraging, as these corpora contain more complex and varied
   bio-events than the bionlp   09 st corpus.

selection of negation cues

   various lists of negation cues have previously been proposed for
   different negation detection tasks. with respect to the task of
   identifying negated bio-events, the main questions about the nature,
   role and processing of negation cues are as follows:
     * does a    universal    list of negation cues exist? our analysis of
       negated bio-events confirmed that negation cues are ambiguous.
       whether a word acts as a negation cue for a bio-event depends on
       the lexical as well as the contextual polarity of the word. while
       the lexical polarity of a word remains fixed, its contextual
       polarity depends on a number of factors, including the
       nature/domain of the text, the annotation perspective, the context
       and the syntactic structure of the sentence. therefore, it is hard
       to compile a universal list of negation cues. however, the
       potential utility of domain specific lists has been reinforced by
       our experiments. the c40 and ccore cue lists showed consistently
       high performance across the three bio-event corpora.
     * what is the impact of the choice of a negation cue list on the
       overall system performance? we designed experiments to measure the
       impact of the choice of a negation cue list on the overall system
       performance. we found that a significant variation (ranging between
       5% and 8%, depending on the corpus) in the system performance was
       caused by the cue list used.
     * should negation cues be annotated in gold standard corpora?
       bioinfer is the only corpus of bio-events containing annotation of
       negation cues. we compiled a list of negation cues identified in
       the corpus, and labelled it cbioinfer. the use of the cue list did
       not result in high performance when applied to the other two
       datasets (i.e., genia event and bionlp   09 st). however, its use on
       the bioinfer dataset resulted in better performance than when other
       cue lists were used, by a significant margin of 7%. these results
       provide strong evidence that both event and corpus characteristics,
       as well domain, can determine the most appropriate set of negation
       cues to use in a classifier. thus, although some sets of domain
       specific cue lists (e.g., c40 and ccore) can provide consistent
       performance across different corpora, explicit annotation of
       negation cues in different gold standard corpora will allow further
       sets of cue lists to be produced. these lists will be tuned not
       only to the domain, but also to different types of event
       specifications. these findings favour the wider argument that we
       made in nawaz et al. [[179]55] for the annotation of lexical cues
       indicating different aspects of the correct interpretation of an
       event.

feature engineering and selection

   in comparison to previous work, our feature engineering approach has
   the following unique aspects:
     * use of a combination of syntactic, lexical, semantic,
       lexico-semantic and lexico-syntactic features
     * incorporation of all available textual fragments associated with
       the bio-event (including the trigger, participants and attributes
       of the event)
     * incorporation of event hierarchy information (i.e., complexity
       status)
     * incorporation of negation deactivators
     * incorporation of constituency as well as dependency
       relations/scopes.

   we conducted additional experiments to evaluate the relative
   performance and contribution of the different types of features and
   their combinations. we were particularly interested in the comparison
   of the dependency and the constituency features, as both have
   previously been used for the task of identifying negated bio-events.
   kilicoglu and bergler [[180]30] used a rule-based approach based on
   dependency relations between the negation cues and the event-triggers,
   whilst mackinlay et al. [[181]31] used features derived from the
   dependency parse of the sentence containing the bio-event. however,
   sarafraz and nenadic [[182]33] used command features to achieve better
   performance.

   the evaluation of the individual feature sets showed that dependency
   and lexical features achieved results more than twice as high as
   command features. similarly, the combination of lexical and dependency
   features achieved significantly better results than the combination of
   the lexical and command features. based on these results, we conclude
   that, in terms of individual contribution, dependency features
   outperform constituency features by a significant margin. this is
   consistent with the previously reported comparisons between dependency
   and constituency features for the tasks of opinion mining [[183]71,
   [184]72] and ppi extraction [[185]73]. however, it is important to
   emphasise that our conclusions are based on specific representations of
   constituency features that we have used in our experiments. it would be
   interesting to explore and compare other representations of
   constituency features for this task.

   we also observed that the features based on the pos tags of negation
   cues, event-triggers, event-themes and event-causes did not improve the
   performance. similarly, the features based on the semantic types of
   event-themes and event-causes did not influence the performance either.
   this suggests that the polarity status of a bio-event is influenced
   neither by the semantic types of its participants nor by the pos tags
   of text fragments associated with the event.

algorithm selection

   we designed a series of experiments to evaluate and compare the
   performance of six learning algorithms with respect to the task of
   identifying negated bio-events. all of these algorithms, with the
   exception of id79, had previously been used for different
   negation detection tasks with varying degrees of success. our results
   showed that, on average, the id79 algorithm performs the best,
   while the na  ve bayes algorithm achieves the lowest results by a huge
   (26%) margin.

   our results are consistent with caruana and niculescu-mizil [[186]74],
   who conducted a wide-ranging study, comparing the performance of ten
   supervised learning methods. they measured the performance of each
   method on 11 different binary classification problems, and found that
   id79 outperformed the other algorithms. our results are also
   consistent with goryachev et al. [[187]48], who compared the
   performance of id166 and na  ve bayes for the task of detecting negations
   in medical texts. they found that id166 outperformed na  ve bayes by a
   significant margin (8%). on the other hand, goldin and chapman
   [[188]47] compared the performance of naive bayes and id90
   for the task of identifying negated terms in medical texts. they found
   that na  ve bayes outperforms id90 by a small (1%) margin.
   similarly, for the task of identifying negation scopes in biomedical
   research literature, morante and daelemans [[189]43] obtained analogous
   results for instance-based learning and id166. in contrast to these
   results, we found that na  ve bayes performs significantly worse than
   id90, and that instance-based learning outperforms id166. this
   contrast shows that different learning algorithms do not perform
   consistently for different negation detection tasks. this leads us to
   the following conclusions:
     * despite the apparent similarities, the task of identifying negated
       bio-events is inherently different from the other negation
       detection tasks like negated term detection and negation scope
       detection.
     * since the id79 algorithm clearly outperforms the other
       learning algorithms for the task of identifying negated bio-events,
       its feasibility for other negation detection tasks should be
       investigated.

effect of corpus size

   we used all three open access corpora of negated bio-events in our
   experiments. table   [190]1 shows the statistics for these corpora. the
   genia event corpus is the largest and contains bio-events of 36
   different semantic types. the bionlp   09 st corpus contains only 9 types
   of bio-events, and it is over three times smaller than the genia event
   corpus. the best results (10-fold cross validation) achieved on the
   bionlp   09 st corpus were 4% less than the best results achieved on the
   genia event corpus. the bioinfer corpus is the smallest in size (almost
   14 times smaller than genia event) and the most complex, with 60
   different event types. despite these factors, consistently better
   results were achieved on bioinfer, irrespective of the cue list used.
   this suggests that there is not necessarily a close correlation between
   the size of the corpus used for training and the overall performance of
   the system. we further tested this hypothesis by conducting an
   additional experiment on the genia event corpus. instead of performing
   10-fold cross validation, we trained the classifier using only half the
   instances and tested on the other half. we repeated this experiment ten
   times with randomly selected training and testing datasets, and the
   average f-score was only slightly (0.5%) less than the f-score achieved
   by the 10-fold cross validation. although it goes without saying that
   very small corpora would not be effective for training, our results
   suggest that it is not necessarily the case that the larger the corpus
   used for training, the better the results will be. rather, the specific
   features of the annotated events appear to have more of an impact on
   the performance. in general, it seems that the level of detail of the
   information annotated for each event, in particular the text fragments
   associated with the event, is more important than the corpus size. the
   relatively poor performance achieved on the bionlp   09 st corpus could
   also be explained by the fact that both genia event and bioinfer
   contain more information about the location of the events than
   bionlp   09 st.

correlation between event-type and polarity

   our analysis of negated bio-events revealed that certain words act as
   negation cues only in the context of specific types of events (see
   section 5.1.4). apart from this, we did not find any evidence of
      linguistic correlation    between the semantic type of an event and its
   polarity. however, we did find some    statistical correlation    between
   event-type and polarity. for example, in the bionlp   09 st corpus, 9% of
   regulation events are negated, whereas only 5% of binding events are
   negated. based on this observation, we engineered two semantic
   features: one based on the event-type and the other on its complexity
   status (i.e., whether the event is simple or complex). both of these
   features scored low gain ratios on all three datasets. however, the
   addition of these features improved the overall performance by 0.5% to
   1%, depending on the dataset.

   in order to further investigate the correlation between event-type and
   polarity, we designed two experiments:
     * three-way splitting: this experiment was similar to the one
       reported by sarafraz and nenadic [[191]33]. the bio-events in the
       bionlp   09 st dataset were split into three classes. the
       localization, transcription, protein_catabolism, gene_expression
       and phosphorylation events were grouped together as class-1. the
       binding events were grouped as class-2, and the regulation events
       (regulation, positive_regulation and negative_regulation) were
       grouped together as class-3. the id79 classifier was
       trained and tested for each class, separately. the micro averages
       for precision, recall and f-score were used to measure the overall
       performance. in comparison to the results achieved without data
       splitting, the three-way splitting model showed a considerable
       (21%) improvement in precision. however, the recall dropped
       significantly (15%), causing an f-score decrease of almost 2%. this
       is in contrast to sarafraz and nenadic, who achieved an increase in
       both recall and precision. in terms of individual classes, class-3
       and class-1 achieved results which were slightly higher and
       slightly lower than the single-class model, respectively. however,
       class-2 scored significantly (29%) worse. we experimented with
       various algorithms and cue-lists, but we were not able to improve
       the performance for class-2 by more than 2%.
     * two-way splitting: in this experiment, we split the bio-events
       according to their complexity status, i.e., simple or complex. we
       performed the two-way splitting on the bionlp   09 st data, then
       trained and tested our id79 classifier separately for each
       class. the results were even worse than the three-way splitting
       model, and an overall (micro-averaged) performance loss of 5% was
       observed. in order to test the concept further, we repeated the
       two-way splitting experiment with the genia event corpus. again, we
       observed a significant (4%) decrease in performance. in terms of
       individual classes, the complex class performed better than the
       simple class. we further experimented with various algorithms and
       cue-lists, but we were not able to improve the performance on the
       simple class by more than 1%. we also observed that over 10% of
       complex events are negated, whereas only 4% of simple events are
       negated. therefore, a complex event is 2.5 times more likely to be
       negated than a simple event.

   these experiments show that there is some correlation between the
   event-type and polarity. however, designing individual classifiers for
   different types of events does not improve the overall system
   performance. the classification performance improves for certain
   classes of bio-events (e.g., complex event and regulation events), and
   deteriorates for certain other classes (e.g., binding and simple
   events). this variation in performance is mainly due to an uneven
   distribution of negated bio-events across these classes.

[192]conclusion

   we have conducted a detailed analysis of the problem of identifying
   negated bio-events, given gold standard event annotations. we examined
   the types of negation in three open access corpora of negated
   bio-events (i.e., genia event, bioinfer and bionlp   09 st), and
   identified five main types of negated bio-events, based on the
   lexico-semantic mechanisms affecting the polarity of an event. our
   analysis showed that a significant proportion (37%) of negated
   bio-events cannot be detected by considering the event-trigger alone.
   it also revealed that identification of negated bio-events is a complex
   task that requires a deeper level of analysis than that required for
   tasks such as negated term detection and negation scope detection.
   following our analysis of negated event types, we identified the three
   key aspects of a machine learning based solution to the problem of
   negated bio-id37. these are: the compilation of a negation
   cue list, the design and selection of suitable features and the choice
   of machine learning algorithm. in order to analyse these aspects, we
   conducted a series of experiments on the three bio-event corpora. the
   results confirmed that each one of the three aspects can have a
   significant impact on the overall system performance. our analysis
   showed that the ability of a word/phrase to act as a negation cue
   depends not only on the context and domain of text, but also on the
   annotation/information perspective (e.g., linguistic vs. biological
   perspective). therefore, there is a need for domain specific lists of
   negation cues. we compiled two such lists (c40 and ccore), both of
   which performed consistently in all experiments. we also discovered
   that, for the task of identifying negated bio-events, the id79
   algorithm consistently outperforms five other learning algorithms.
   combining the best cue lists, feature sets and learning algorithms, we
   created a novel framework for the identification of negated bio-events.
   we evaluated our system on the three open access corpora of negated
   bio-events mentioned above. our results on the bionlp   09 st corpus were
   significantly higher than the previously reported best results. we
   achieved even better results on the genia event and bioinfer corpora,
   both of which contain more varied and complex events.

   as mentioned earlier, our system assumes that event annotation has
   already been performed. as future work, we plan to integrate our system
   with the eventmine system [[193]75]. the resulting system will be able
   to extract bio-events of the specified polarity from plain text
   documents, and will serve as the foundation for a more elaborate system
   for detecting textual contradictions. we also intend to use our system
   for enriching other bio-event corpora (like grec) with polarity
   information. although we have focussed on the identification of negated
   bio-events, our approach can be modified straightforwardly for events
   in other textual domains. we also plan to explore this further.
