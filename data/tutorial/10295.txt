abstract

   detecting negative and speculative information is essential in most
   biomedical text   mining tasks where these language forms are used to
   express impressions, hypotheses, or explanations of experimental
   results. our research is focused on developing a system based on
   machine   learning techniques that identifies negation and speculation
   signals and their scope in clinical texts. the proposed system works in
   two consecutive phases: first, a classifier decides whether each token
   in a sentence is a negation/speculation signal or not. then another
   classifier determines, at sentence level, the tokens which are affected
   by the signals previously identified. the system was trained and
   evaluated on the clinical texts of the bioscope corpus, a freely
   available resource consisting of medical and biological texts:
   full   length articles, scientific abstracts, and clinical reports. the
   results obtained by our system were compared with those of two
   different systems, one based on id157 and the other based
   on machine learning. our system's results outperformed the results
   obtained by these two systems. in the signal detection task, the
   f   score value was 97.3% in negation and 94.9% in speculation. in the
   scope   finding task, a token was correctly classified if it had been
   properly identified as being inside or outside the scope of all the
   negation signals present in the sentence. our proposal showed an f
   score of 93.2% in negation and 80.9% in speculation. additionally, the
   percentage of correct scopes (those with all their tokens correctly
   classified) was evaluated obtaining f scores of 90.9% in negation and
   71.9% in speculation.
