abstract

we present a novel response generation sys-
tem that can be trained end to end on large
quantities of unstructured twitter conversa-
tions. a neural network architecture is used
to address sparsity issues that arise when in-
tegrating contextual information into classic
statistical models, allowing the system to take
into account previous dialog utterances. our
dynamic-context generative models show con-
sistent gains over both context-sensitive and
non-context-sensitive machine translation and
information retrieval baselines.

introduction

until recently, the goal of training open-domain con-
versational systems that emulate human conversation
has seemed elusive. however, the vast quantities
of conversational exchanges now available on so-
cial media websites such as twitter and reddit raise
the prospect of building data-driven models that can
begin to communicate conversationally. the work
of ritter et al. (2011), for example, demonstrates that
a response generation system can be constructed from
twitter conversations using statistical machine trans-
lation techniques, where a status post by a twitter
user is    translated    into a plausible looking response.
   this paper appeared in the proceedings of naacl-hlt
2015 (submitted december 4, 2014, accepted february 20, 2015,
and presented june 1, 2015).

figure 1: example of three consecutive utterances occur-
ring between two twitter users a and b.

however, an approach such as that presented in rit-
ter et al. (2011) does not address the challenge of
generating responses that are sensitive to the context
of the conversation. broadly speaking, context may
be linguistic or involve grounding in the physical or
virtual world, but we here focus on linguistic context.
the ability to take into account previous utterances
is key to building id71 that can keep con-
versations active and engaging. figure 1 illustrates
a typical twitter dialog where the contextual infor-
mation is crucial: the phrase    good luck    is plainly
motivated by the reference to    your game    in the    rst
utterance. in the mt model, such contextual sensitiv-
ity is dif   cult to capture; moreover, naive injection
of context information would entail unmanageable
growth of the phrase table at the cost of increased
sparsity, and skew towards rarely-seen context pairs.
in most statistical approaches to machine translation,
phrase pairs do not share statistical weights regard-
less of their intrinsic semantic commonality.

we propose to address the challenge of context-
sensitive response generation by using continuous
representations or embeddings of words and phrases

contextbecause of your game ?messageyeah i   m on my way nowresponseok good luck !to compactly encode semantic and syntactic simi-
larity. we argue that embedding-based models af-
ford    exibility to model the transitions between con-
secutive utterances and to capture long-span depen-
dencies in a domain where traditional word and
phrase alignment is dif   cult (ritter et al., 2011). to
this end, we present two simple, context-sensitive
response-generation models utilizing the recurrent
neural network language model (rlm) architec-
ture of (mikolov et al., 2010). these models    rst
encode past information in a hidden continuous repre-
sentation, which is then decoded by the rlm to pro-
mote plausible responses that are simultaneously    u-
ent and contextually relevant. unlike typical complex
task-oriented multi-modular id71 (young,
2002; stent and bangalore, 2014), our architecture
is completely data-driven and can easily be trained
end-to-end using unstructured data without requiring
human annotation, scripting, or automatic parsing.

this paper makes the following contributions. we
present a neural network architecture for response
generation that is both context-sensitive and data-
driven. as such, it can be trained from end to end on
massive amounts of social media data. to our knowl-
edge, this is the    rst application of a neural-network
model to open-domain response generation, and we
believe that the present work will lay groundwork for
more complex models to come. we additionally in-
troduce a novel multi-reference extraction technique
that shows promise for automated evaluation.

2 related work

our work naturally lies in the path opened by ritter
et al. (2011), but we generalize their approach by
exploiting information from a larger context. rit-
ter et al. and our work represent a radical paradigm
shift from other work in dialog. more traditional
id71 typically tease apart dialog manage-
ment (young, 2002) from response generation (stent
and bangalore, 2014), while our holistic approach
can be considered a    rst attempt to accomplish both
tasks jointly. while there are previous uses of ma-
chine learning for response generation (walker et al.,
2003), dialog state tracking (young et al., 2010), and
user modeling (georgila et al., 2006), many compo-
nents of typical id71 remain hand-coded:
in particular, the labels and attributes de   ning dia-
log states. in contrast, the dialog state in our neural

network model is completely latent and directly opti-
mized towards end-to-end performance. in this sense,
we believe the framework of this paper is a signif-
icant milestone towards more data-driven and less
hand-coded dialog processing.

continuous representations of words and phrases
estimated by neural network models have been ap-
plied on a variety of tasks ranging from information
retrieval (ir) (huang et al., 2013; shen et al., 2014),
online recommendation (gao et al., 2014b), ma-
chine translation (mt) (auli et al., 2013; cho et al.,
2014; kalchbrenner and blunsom, 2013; sutskever
et al., 2014), and id38 (lm) (bengio
et al., 2003; collobert and weston, 2008). gao et
al. (2014a) successfully use an embedding model to
re   ne the estimation of rare phrase-translation prob-
abilities, which is traditionally affected by sparsity
problems. robustness to sparsity is a crucial prop-
erty of our method, as it allows us to capture context
information while avoiding unmanageable growth of
model parameters.

our work extends the recurrent neural network
language model (rlm) of (mikolov et al., 2010),
which uses continuous representations to estimate a
id203 function over natural language sentences.
we propose a set of conditional rlms where contex-
tual information (i.e., past utterances) is encoded in
a continuous context vector to help generate the re-
sponse. our models differ from most previous work
in the way the context vector is constructed. for
example, mikolov and zweig (2012) and auli et al.
(2013) use a pre-trained topic model. in our models,
the context vector is learned along with the condi-
tional rlm that generates the response. additionally,
the learned context encodings do not exclusively cap-
ture contentful words. indeed, even    stop words    can
carry discriminative power in this task; for exam-
ple, all words in the utterance    how are you?    are
commonly characterized as stop words, yet this is a
contentful dialog utterance.

3 recurrent language model

we give a brief overview of the recurrent language
model (rlm) (mikolov et al., 2010) architecture that
our models extend. a rlm is a generative model
of sentences, i.e., given sentence s = s1, . . . , st , it

estimates:

t(cid:89)

t=1

p(s) =

p(st|s1, . . . , st   1).

(1)

the model architecture is parameterized by three
weight matrices,   id56 = (cid:104)win, wout, whh(cid:105): an in-
put matrix win, a recurrent matrix whh and an output
matrix wout, which are usually initialized randomly.
the rows of the input matrix win     rv   k contain
the k-dimensional embeddings for each word in the
language vocabulary of size v . let us denote by st
both the vocabulary token and its one-hot representa-
tion, i.e., a zero vector of dimensionality v with a 1
corresponding to the index of the st token. the em-
bedding for st is then obtained by s(cid:62)
t win. the recur-
rent matrix whh     rk  k keeps a history of the sub-
sequence that has already been processed. the output
matrix wout     rk  v projects the hidden state ht
into the output layer ot, which has an entry for each
word in the vocabulary v . this value is used to gen-
erate a id203 distribution for the next word in
the sequence. speci   cally, the forward pass proceeds
with the following recurrence, for t = 1, . . . , t :

(cid:62)
(cid:62)
(cid:62)
t   1whh), ot = h
t win + h
ht =   (s
t wout

(2)

where    is a non-linear function applied element-
wise, in our case the logistic sigmoid. the recurrence
is seeded by setting h0 = 0, the zero vector. the
id203 distribution over the next word given the
previous history is obtained by applying the softmax
activation function:

p (st = w|s1, . . . , st   1) =

(cid:80)v

exp(otw)
v=1 exp(otv)

.

(3)

the rlm is trained to minimize the negative log-
likelihood of the training sentence s:

l(s) =     t(cid:88)

log p (st|s1, . . . , st   1).

(4)

t=1

the recurrence is unrolled backwards in time us-
ing the back-propagation through time (bptt) al-
gorithm (rumelhart et al., 1988), and gradients are
accumulated over multiple time-steps.

t(cid:89)

unrolled representation for two time steps (right).

4 context-sensitive models

we distinguish three linguistic entities in a conver-
sation between two users a and b: the context1 c,
the message m and response r. the context c rep-
resents a sequence of past dialog exchanges of any
length; then b emits a message m to which a reacts
by formulating its response r (see figure 1).

we use three context-based generation models to
estimate a generation model of the response r, r =
r1, . . . , rt , conditioned on past information c and m:

p(r|c, m) =

p(rt|r1, . . . , rt   1, c, m).

(5)

t=1

these three models differ in the manner in which
they compose the context-message pair (c, m).

4.1 tripled language model
in our    rst model, dubbed rlmt, we straightfor-
wardly concatenate each utterance c, m, r into a
single sentence s and train the rlm to minimize
l(s). given c and m, we compute the id203
of the response as follows: we perform the forward
propagation over the known utterances c and m to ob-
tain a hidden state encoding useful information about
previous utterances. subsequently, we compute the
likelihood of the response from that hidden state.

an issue with this simple approach is that the con-
catenated sentence s will be very long on average,
especially if the context comprises multiple utter-
ances. modelling such long-range dependencies with
an rlm is dif   cult and is still considered an open
problem (pascanu et al., 2013). we will consider

1in this work, the context is purely linguistic, but future work
might integrate further contextual information, e.g., geographical
location, time information, or other forms of grounding.

woutwinwhhhtotstwoutwinwhhhtotstot+1ht+1st+1cabulary.2 these are different from those employed
in the rlm and play a crucial role in promoting the
specialization of the context encoder to a distinct
task. the hidden layer of the decoder rlm takes the
following form:

ht =   (h

(cid:62)
(cid:62)
t   1whh + kl + s
t win)

(cid:62)
ot = h
t wout

p(st+1|s1, . . . , st   1, c, m) = softmax(ot)

(7a)

(7b)

(7c)

this model conditions on the previous utterances via
biasing the hidden layer state on the context repre-
sentation kl. note that the context representation
does not change through time. this is useful because:
(a) it forces the context encoder to produce a repre-
sentation general enough to be useful for generating
all words in the response and (b) it helps the rlm
decoder to remember context information when gen-
erating long responses.

4.3 dynamic-context generative model ii

because dcgm-i does not distinguish between c and
m, that model has the propensity to underestimate
the strong dependency that holds between m and r.
our third model (dcgm-ii) addresses this issue by
concatenating the two linear mappings of the bag-of-
words representations bc and bm in the input layer of
the feed-forward network representing c and m (see
figure 3 right). concatenating continuous representa-
tions prior to deep architectures is a common strategy
to obtain order-sensitive representations (bengio et
al., 2003; devlin et al., 2014).

the forward equations for the context encoder are:

k1 = [b(cid:62)
c w 1
(cid:96)   1w (cid:96)
f )

f , b(cid:62)
mw 1
f ],
for (cid:96) = 2,       , l

k(cid:96) =   (k(cid:62)

(8)

where [x, y] denotes the concatenation of x and y vec-
tors. in dcgm-ii, the bias on the recurrent hidden
state and the id203 distribution over the next
token are computed as described in eq. 7.

2notice that the    rst layer of the encoder network is linear.
we found that this helps learning the embedding matrix as it
reduces the vanishing gradient effect partially due to stacking of
squashing non-linearities (pascanu et al., 2013).

figure 3: compact representations of dcgm-i (left) and
dcgm-ii (right). the decoder rlm receives a bias from
the context encoder. in dcgm-i, we encode the bag-of-
words representation of both c and m in a single vector
bcm. in dcgm-ii, we concatenate the representations bc
and bm on the    rst layer to preserve order information.

rlmt as an additional context-sensitive baseline for
the models we present next.

4.2 dynamic-context generative model i

the above limitation of rlmt can be addressed by
strengthening the context bias. in our second model
(dcgm-i), the context and the message are encoded
into a    xed-length vector representation the is used
by the rlm to decode the response. this is illus-
trated in figure 3 (left). first, we consider c and m as
a single sentence and compute a single bag-of-words
representation bcm     rv . then, bcm is provided
as input to a multilayered non-linear forward archi-
tecture that produces a    xed-length representation
that is used to bias the recurrent state of the decoder
rlm. at training time, both the context encoder and
the rlm decoder are learned so as to minimize the
negative log-id203 of the generated response.
the parameters of the model are   dcgm-i =
(cid:104)win, whh, wout,{w (cid:96)
(cid:96)=1 are
the weights for the l layers of the feed-forward con-
text networks. the    xed-length context vector kl is
obtained by forward propagation of the network:

5.1 dataset construction
for computational ef   ciency and to alleviate the bur-
den of human evaluators, we restrict the context se-
quence c to a single sentence. hence, our dataset is
composed of    triples           (c   , m   , r   ) consisting of
three sentences. we mined 127m context-message-
response triples from the twitter firehose, covering
the 3-month period june 2012 through august 2012.
only those triples where context and response were
generated by the same user were extracted. to mini-
mize noise, we selected triples that contained at least
one frequent bigram that appeared more than 3 times
in the corpus. this produced a corpus of 29m twitter
triples. additionally, we hired crowdsourced raters to
evaluate approximately 33k candidate triples. judg-
ments on a 5-point scale were obtained from 3 raters
apiece. this yielded a set of 4232 triples with a mean
score of 4 or better that was then randomly binned
into a tuning set of 2118 triples and a test set of 2114
triples3. the mean length of responses in these sets
was approximately 11.5 tokens, after cleanup (e.g.,
stripping of emoticons), including punctuation.

5.2 automatic evaluation
we evaluate all systems using id7 (papineni et al.,
2002) and meteor (banerjee and lavie, 2005), and
supplement these results with more targeted human
pairwise comparisons in section 6.3. a major chal-
lenge in using these automated metrics for response
generation is that the set of reasonable responses
in our task is potentially vast and extremely diverse.
the dataset construction method just described yields
only a single reference for each status. accordingly,
we extend the set of references using an ir approach
to mine potential responses, after which we have hu-
man judges rate their appropriateness. as we see in
section 6.3, it turns out that by optimizing systems
towards id7 using mined multi-references, id7
rankings align well with human judgments. this lays
groundwork for interesting future correlation studies.
multi-reference extraction we use the following
algorithm to better cover the space of reasonable re-
sponses. given a test triple        (c   , m   , r   ), our

goal is to mine other responses {r    } that    t the con-
text and message pair (c   , m   ). to this end, we    rst
select a set of 15 candidate triples {    } using an ir
system. the ir system is calibrated in order to select
candidate triples      for which both the message m    
and the response r     are similar to the original mes-
sage m   and response r   . formally, the score of a
candidate triple is:
s(     ,    ) = d(m     , m   ) (   d(r     , r   ) + (1      ) ), (9)

where d is the bag-of-words bm25 similarity func-
tion (robertson et al., 1995),    controls the impact
of the similarity between the responses and   is a
smoothing factor that avoids zero scores for candi-
date responses that do not share any words with the
reference response. we found that this simple for-
mula provided references that were both diverse and
plausible. given a set of candidate triples {    }, hu-
man evaluators are asked to rate the quality of the
response within the new triples {(c   , m   , r     )}. af-
ter human evaluation, we retain the references for
which the score is 4 or better on a 5 point scale, re-
sulting in 3.58 references per example on average
(table 1). the average lengths for the responses in
the multi-reference tuning and test sets are 8.75 and
8.13 tokens respectively.

5.3 feature sets
the response generation systems evaluated in this pa-
per are parameterized as id148 in a frame-
work typical of id151 (och
and ney, 2004). these id148 comprise
the following feature sets:

mt mt features are derived from a large response
generation system built along the lines of ritter et
al. (2011), which is based on a phrase-based mt de-
coder similar to moses (koehn et al., 2007). our
mt feature set includes the following features that
are common in moses: forward and backward maxi-
mum likelihood    translation    probabilities, word and

phrase penalties, linear distortion, and a modi   ed
kneser-ney language model (kneser and ney, 1995)
trained on twitter responses. for the translation prob-
abilities, we built a very large phrase table of 160.7
million entries by    rst    ltering out twitterisms (e.g.,
long sequences of vowels, hashtags), and then se-
lecting candidate phrase pairs using fisher   s exact
test (ritter et al., 2011). we also included mt de-
coder features speci   cally motivated by the response
generation task: jaccard distance between source and
target phrase, fisher   s exact id203, and a score
relating the lengths of source and target phrases.
ir we also use an ir feature built from an index of
triples, whose implementation roughly matches the
irstatus approach described in ritter et al. (2011): for
a test triple   , we choose r     as the candidate response
iff      = arg max     d(m   , m     ).
cmm neither mt nor ir traditionally take into ac-
count contextual information. therefore, we take into
consideration context and message matches (cmm),
i.e., exact matches between c, m and r. we de   ne
8 features as the [1-4]-gram matches between c and
the candidate reply r and the [1-4]-gram matches
between m and the candidate reply r. these exact
matches help capture and promote contextual infor-
mation in the replies.
rlmt, dcgm-i, dcgm-ii we consider the
rlm trained on the concatenated triples, denoted as
rlmt (section 4.1), to be a context-sensitive rlm
baseline. each neural network model contributes an
additional feature corresponding to the likelihood of
the candidate response given context and message.

5.4 model training
the proposed models are trained on a 4m subset of
the triple data. the vocabulary consists of the most
frequent v = 50k words. in order to speed up train-
ing, we use the noise-contrastive estimation (nce)
loss, which avoids repeated summations over v by

approximating the id203 of the target word (gut-
mann and hyv  arinen, 2010). parameter optimization
is done using adagrad (duchi et al., 2011) with a
mini-batch size of 100 and a learning rate    = 0.1,
which we found to work well on held-out data. in
order to stabilize learning, we clip the gradients to
a    xed range [   10, 10], as suggested in mikolov et
al. (2010). all the parameters of the neural models
are sampled from a normal distribution n (0, 0.01)
while the recurrent weight whh is initialized as a
random orthogonal matrix and scaled by 0.01. to
prevent over-   tting, we evaluate performance on a
held-out set during training and stop when the objec-
tive increases. the size of the rlm hidden layer is
set to k = 512, where the context encoder is a 512,
256, 512 multilayer network. the bottleneck in the
middle compresses context information that leads to
similar responses and thus achieves better generaliza-
tion. the last layer embeds the context vector into
the hidden space of the decoder rlm.

5.5 rescoring setup
we evaluate the proposed models by rescoring the
n-best candidate responses obtained using the mt
phrase-based decoder and the ir system. in contrast
to mt, the candidate responses provided by ir have
been created by humans and are less affected by    u-
ency issues. the different n-best lists will provide
a comprehensive testbed for our experiments. first,
we augment the n-best list of the tuning set with the
scores of the model of interest. then, we run an itera-
tion of mert (och, 2003) to estimate the log-linear
weights of the new features. at test time, we rescore
the test n-best list with the new weights.

cate that a phrase-based mt decoder outperforms
a purely ir approach. second, adding cmm features
to the baseline systems helps. third, the neural net-
work models contribute measurably to improvement:
rlmt and dcgm models outperform baselines, and
dcgm models provide more consistent gains than
rlmt.

mt vs. ir id7 and meteor scores indicate
that the phrase-based mt decoder outperforms a
purely ir approach, despite the fact that ir proposes
   uent human generated responses. this may be be-
cause the ir model only loosely captures important
patterns between message and response: it ranks
candidate responses solely by the similarity of their
message with the message of the test triple (  5.3). as
a result, the top ranked response is likely to drift from
the purpose of the original conversation. the mt ap-
proach, by contrast, more directly models statistical
patterns between message and response.

cmm mt+cmm, totaling 17 features (9 from mt
+ 8 cmm), improves 0.38 id7 points, a 9.5%
relative improvement, over the baseline mt model.
ir+cmm, with 10 features (ir + word penalty +
8 cmm), bene   ts even more, attaining 1.8 id7
points and 1.5 meteor points over the ir base-

random system so as to make id7 scores comparable.

line. figure 4 (a) and (b) plots the magnitude of
the learned cmm feature weights for mt+cmm
and ir+cmm. cmm features help in both these hy-
pothesis spaces and especially on the ir n-best list.
figure 4 (b) supports the hypothesis formulated in the
previous paragraph: since ir solely captures inter-
message similarities, the matches between message
and response are important, while context matches
help in providing additional gains. the phrase-based
statistical patterns captured by the mt system do a
good job in explaining away 1-gram and 2-gram mes-
sage matches (figure 4 (a)) and the performance gain
mainly comes from context matches. on the other
hand, we observe that 4-gram matches may be impor-
tant in selecting appropriate responses. inspection of
the tuning set reveals instances where responses con-
tain long subsequences of their corresponding mes-
sages, e.g., m =    good night best friend, i love you   ,
r =    i love you too, good night best friend   . although
infrequent, such higher-order id165 matches, when
they occur, may provide a more robust signal of the
quality of the response than 1- and 2-gram matches,
given the highly conversational nature of our dataset.

rlmt and dcgm both rlmt and dcgm
models outperform their respective mt and ir base-
lines. both models also exhibit similar performance
and show improvements over the mt+cmm mod-
els, albeit using a lower dimensional feature space.
we believe that their similar performance is due to
the limited diversity of mt n-best list together with
gains in    uency id30 from the strong language
model provided by the rlm. in the case of ir mod-
els, on the other hand, there is more headroom for
improvement and    uency is already guaranteed. any

as evidence that cmm exact matches and dcgm
semantic matches interact positively, a    nding that
comports with gao et al. (2014a), who show that
semantic relationships mined through phrase embed-
dings correlate positively with classic co-occurrence-
based estimations. analysis of cmm feature weights
in figure 4 (c) and (d) suggests that 1-gram matches
are explained away by the dcgm model, but that
higher order matches are important. it appears that
dcgm models might be improved by preserving
word-order information in context and message en-
codings.

6.3 human evaluation
human evaluation was conducted using crowd-
sourced annotators. annotators were asked to com-
pare the quality of system output responses pairwise
(   which is better?   ) in relation to the context and
message strings in the 2114 item test set. identical
strings were held out, so that the annotators only saw
those outputs that differed. paired responses were
presented in random order to the annotators, and each
pair of responses was judged by 5 annotators.

table 4 summarizes the results of human evalua-
tion, giving the difference in mean scores (pairwise
preference margin) between systems and 95% con   -
dence intervals generated using welch   s t-test. iden-
tical strings not shown to raters are incorporated with
an automatically assigned score of 0.5. the pattern in
these results is clear and consistent: context-sensitive
systems (+cmm) outperform non-context-sensitive
systems, with preference gains as high as approxi-
mately 5.3% in the case of dcgm-ii+cmm versus
ir, and about 3.1% in the case of dcgm-ii+cmm
versus mt. similarly, context-sensitive dcgm sys-
tems outperform non-dcgm context-sensitive sys-
tems by 1.5% (mt) and 2.3% (ir). these results are
consistent with the automated id7 rankings and
con   rm that our best performing dcgm models out-
perform both raw baseline and the context-sensitive
baseline using cmm features.

6.4 discussion
table 5 provides examples of responses generated on
the tuning corpus by the mt-based dcgm-ii+cmm
system, our best system in terms of both id7 and
human evaluation. responses from this system are on
average shorter (8.95 tokens) than the original human

gains must come from context and message matches.
hence, rlmt underperforms with respect to both
dcgm and ir+cmm. the dcgm models appear to
have better capacity to retain contextual information
and thus achieve similar performance to ir+cmm
despite their lack of exact id165 match information.
in the present experimental setting, no striking
performance difference can be observed between the
two versions of the dcgm architecture. if multiple
sequences were used as context, we expect that the
dcgm-ii model would likely bene   t more owing to
the separate encoding of message and context.

dcgm+cmm we also investigated whether mix-
ing exact cmm id165 overlap with semantic in-
formation encoded by the dcgm models can bring
additional gains. dcgm-{i-ii}+cmm systems each
totaling 10 features show increases of up to 0.48
id7 points over mt+cmm and up to 0.88 id7
over the model based on ritter et al. (2011). me-
teor improvements similarly align with id7 im-
provements both for mt and ir lists. we take this

table 5: sample responses produced by the mt-based dcgm-ii+cmm system.

responses in the tuning set (11.5 tokens). overall, the
outputs tend to be generic or commonplace, but are
often reasonably plausible in the context as in ex-
amples 1-3, especially where context and message
contain common conversational elements. example 2
illustrates the impact of context-sensitivity: the word
   book    in the response is not found in the message.
nonetheless, longer generated responses are apt to
degrade both syntactically and in terms of content.
we notice that longer responses are likely to present
information that con   icts either internally within the
response itself, or is at odds with the context, as in ex-
amples 4-5. this is not unsurprising, since our model
lacks mechanisms both for re   ecting agent intent in
the response and for maintaining consistency with
respect to sentiment polarity. longer context and
message components may also result in responses
that wander off-topic or lapse into incoherence as in
6-8, especially when relatively low frequency uni-
grams (   bass   ,    threat   ) are echoed in the response.
in general, we expect that larger datasets and incorpo-
ration of more extensive contexts into the model will
help yield more coherent results in these cases. con-
sistent representation of agent intent is outside the
scope of this work, but will likely remain a signi   cant
challenge.

7 conclusion

we have formulated a neural network architecture
for data-driven response generation trained from so-
cial media conversations, in which generation of
responses is conditioned on past dialog utterances
that provide contextual information. we have pro-
posed a novel multi-reference extraction technique
allowing for robust automated evaluation using stan-
dard smt metrics such as id7 and meteor.
our context-sensitive models consistently outper-
form both context-independent and context-sensitive
baselines by up to 11% relative improvement in
id7 in the mt setting and 24% in the ir setting, al-
beit using a minimal number of features. as our mod-
els are completely data-driven and self-contained,
they hold the potential to improve    uency and con-
textual relevance in other types of id71.

our work suggests several directions for future
research. we anticipate that there is much room for
improvement if we employ more complex neural net-
work models that take into account word order within
the message and context utterances. direct genera-
tion from neural network models is an interesting and
potentially promising next step. future progress in
this area will also greatly bene   t from thorough study
of automated id74.
