abstract

conversational modeling is an important task in
natural language understanding and machine in-
telligence. although previous approaches ex-
ist, they are often restricted to speci   c domains
(e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-
crafted rules.
in this paper, we present a sim-
ple approach for this task which uses the recently
proposed sequence to sequence framework. our
model converses by predicting the next sentence
given the previous sentence or sentences in a
conversation. the strength of our model is that
it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires
much fewer hand-crafted rules. we    nd that this
straightforward model can generate simple con-
versations given a large conversational training
dataset. our preliminary results suggest that, de-
spite optimizing the wrong objective function,
the model is able to converse well.
it is able
extract knowledge from both a domain speci   c
dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general do-
main dataset of movie subtitles. on a domain-
speci   c it helpdesk dataset, the model can    nd
a solution to a technical problem via conversa-
tions. on a noisy open-domain movie transcript
dataset, the model can perform simple forms of
common sense reasoning. as expected, we also
   nd that the lack of consistency is a common fail-
ure mode of our model.

1. introduction

advances in end-to-end training of neural networks have
led to remarkable progress in many domains such as speech
recognition, id161, and language processing.
recent work suggests that neural networks can do more

than just mere classi   cation, they can be used to map com-
plicated structures to other complicated structures. an ex-
ample of this is the task of mapping a sequence to another
sequence which has direct applications in natural language
understanding (sutskever et al., 2014). the main advan-
tage of this framework is that it requires little feature en-
gineering and domain speci   city whilst matching or sur-
passing state-of-the-art results. this advance, in our opin-
ion, allows researchers to work on tasks for which domain
knowledge may not be readily available, or for tasks which
are simply too hard to design rules manually.

conversational modeling can directly bene   t from this for-
mulation because it requires mapping between queries and
reponses. due to the complexity of this mapping, conver-
sational modeling has previously been designed to be very
narrow in domain, with a major undertaking on feature en-
gineering. in this work, we experiment with the conversa-
tion modeling task by casting it to a task of predicting the
next sequence given the previous sequence or sequences
using recurrent networks (sutskever et al., 2014). we    nd
that this approach can do surprisingly well on generating
   uent and accurate replies to conversations.

we test the model on chat sessions from an it helpdesk
dataset of conversations, and    nd that the model can some-
times track the problem and provide a useful answer to
the user. we also experiment with conversations obtained
from a noisy dataset of movie subtitles, and    nd that the
model can hold a natural conversation and sometimes per-
form simple forms of common sense reasoning. in both
cases, the recurrent nets obtain better perplexity compared
to the id165 model and capture important long-range cor-
relations. from a qualitative point of view, our model is
sometimes able to produce natural conversations.

2. related work

our approach is based on recent work which pro-
posed to use neural networks to map sequences to se-
quences (kalchbrenner & blunsom, 2013; sutskever et al.,
2014; bahdanau et al., 2014). this framework has been

used for id4 and achieves im-
provements on the english-french and english-german
translation tasks from the wmt   14 dataset (luong et al.,
2014; jean et al., 2014).
it has also been used for
other tasks such as parsing (vinyals et al., 2014a) and
image captioning (vinyals et al., 2014b).
is
well known that vanilla id56s suffer
from vanish-
ing gradients, most researchers use variants of long
short term memory (lstm)
recurrent neural net-
works (hochreiter & schmidhuber, 1997).

since it

our work is also inspired by the recent success of neu-
ral id38 (bengio et al., 2003; mikolov et al.,
2010; mikolov, 2012), which shows that recurrent neural
networks are rather effective models for natural language.
more recently, work by sordoni et al. (sordoni et al., 2015)
and shang et al. (shang et al., 2015), used recurrent neural
networks to model dialogue in short conversations (trained
on twitter-style chats).

building bots and conversational agents has been pur-
sued by many researchers over the last decades, and it
is out of the scope of this paper to provide an exhaus-
tive list of references. however, most of these systems
require a rather complicated processing pipeline of many
stages (lester et al., 2004; will, 2007; jurafsky & martin,
2009). our work differs from conventional systems by
proposing an end-to-end approach to the problem which
lacks domain knowledge. it could, in principle, be com-
bined with other systems to re-score a short-list of can-
didate responses, but our work is based on producing an-
swers given by a probabilistic model trained to maximize
the id203 of the answer given some context.

3. model

our approach makes use of the sequence-to-sequence
(id195) framework described in (sutskever et al., 2014).
the model is based on a recurrent neural network which
reads the input sequence one token at a time, and predicts
the output sequence, also one token at a time. during train-
ing, the true output sequence is given to the model, so learn-
ing can be done by id26. the model is trained
to maximize the cross id178 of the correct sequence given
its context. during id136, given that the true output se-
quence is not observed, we simply feed the predicted output
token as input to predict the next output. this is a    greedy   
id136 approach. a less greedy approach would be to
use id125, and feed several candidates at the previ-
ous step to the next step. the predicted sequence can be
selected based on the id203 of the sequence.

concretely, suppose that we observe a conversation with
two turns: the    rst person utters    abc   , and second person
replies    wxyz   . we can use a recurrent neural network,

figure1.using the id195 framework for modeling conversa-
tions.

and train to map    abc    to    wxyz    as shown in figure 1
above. the hidden state of the model when it receives the
end of sequence symbol    <eos>    can be viewed as the
thought vector because it stores the information of the sen-
tence, or thought,    abc   .

the strength of this model lies in its simplicity and gener-
ality. we can use this model for machine translation, ques-
tion/answering, and conversations without major changes
in the architecture. applying this technique to conversa-
tion modeling is also straightforward: the input sequence
can be the concatenation of what has been conversed so far
(the context), and the output sequence is the reply.

unlike easier tasks like translation, however, a model
like sequence-to-sequence will not be able to successfully
   solve    the problem of modeling dialogue due to sev-
eral obvious simpli   cations: the objective function being
optimized does not capture the actual objective achieved
through human communication, which is typically longer
term and based on exchange of information rather than next
step prediction. the lack of a model to ensure consistency
and general world knowledge is another obvious limitation
of a purely unsupervised model.

4. datasets

in our experiments we used two datasets: a closed-domain
it helpdesk troubleshooting dataset and an open-domain
movie transcript dataset. the details of the two datasets are
as follows.

4.1. it helpdesk troubleshooting dataset

in our    rst set of experiments, we used a dataset which was
extracted from a it helpdesk troubleshooting chat service.
in this service, costumers face computer related issues, and
a specialist help them by conversing and walking through
a solution. typical interactions (or threads) are 400 words
long, and turn taking is clearly signaled. our training set
contains 30m tokens, and 3m tokens were used as valida-
tion. some amount of clean up was performed, such as
removing common names, numbers, and full urls.

4.2. opensubtitles dataset

also tested our model on the opensubtitles
we

dataset (tiedemann, 2009).
movie conversations in xml format.
it contains sen-
tences uttered by characters in movies. we applied a
simple processing step removing xml tags and obvi-
ous non-conversational text (e.g., hyperlinks) from the
dataset. as turn taking is not clearly indicated, we treated
consecutive sentences assuming they were uttered by
different characters. we trained our model to predict the
next sentence given the previous one, and we did this for
every sentence (noting that this doubles our dataset size,
as each sentence is used both for context and as target).
our training and validation split has 62m sentences (923m
tokens) as training examples, and the validation set has
26m sentences (395m tokens). the split is done in such a
way that each sentence in a pair of sentences either appear
together in the training set or test set but not both. unlike
the previous dataset, the opensubtitles is quite large, and
rather noisy because consecutive sentences may be uttered
by the same character. given the broad scope of movies,
this is an open-domain conversation dataset, contrasting
with the technical troubleshooting dataset.

5. experiments

in this section, we describe the experimental results with
the two datasets and show some samples of the interac-
tions with the system that we trained. we also compare
the performance of our system against a popular rule-based
bot (cleverbot1) using human evaluations on a set of 200
questions.

5.1. it helpdesk troubleshooting experiments

in this experiment, we trained a single layer lstm with
1024 memory cells using stochastic id119 with
gradient clipping. the vocabulary consists of the most
common 20k words, which includes special tokens indi-
cating turn taking and actor.

at convergence, this model achieved a perplexity of 8,
whereas an id165 model achieved 18. below is a few sam-
ples of simulated troubleshooting sessions for most three
of the most common it problems (remote access, software
crashes, and password issues). in these conversations, ma-

5.2. opensubtitles experiments

in this experiment, we trained a two-layered lstm using
adagrad with gradient clipping. each layer of the lstm
has 4096 memory cells, and we built a vocabulary consist-
ing of the most frequent 100k words. to speed up the soft-
max, we project the memory cells to 2048 linear units be-
fore feeding the information to the classi   er.

at convergence the perplexity of the recurrent model on the
validation set is 17. our smoothed 5-gram model achieves
a perplexity of 28.
interestingly, adding the soft atten-
tion mechanism of (bahdanau et al., 2014) did not signi   -
cantly improve the perplexity on neither training or valida-
tion sets.

5.2.1. model samples

in addition to the perplexity measure, our simple recur-
rent model does often produce plausible answers. here
are a few sample question-answer pairs that allowed us to
understand the capabilities of the model when trained on
the noisy but large dataset of opensubtitles from movies.

versational model, and human the human actor interacting
with it.

human: what do you like to talk about ?
machine: nothing .

conversation 6: opinions (notice the model outputs    he    ,
   she    or    it    depending on the subject being asked)

human: what do you think about tesla ?
machine: he    s a good conductor .
human: what do you think about bill gates ?
machine: he    s a good man .
human: what do you think about messi ?
machine: he    s a great player .
human: what do you think about cleopatra ?
machine: oh , she    s very regal .
human: what do you think about england dur-
ing the reign of elizabeth ?
machine: it was a great place .

we    nd it encouraging that the model can remember facts,
understand contexts, perform common sense reasoning
without the complexity in traditional pipelines. what sur-
prises us is that the model does so without any explicit
id99 component except for the param-
eters in the word vectors.

perhaps most practically signi   cant is the fact that the
model can generalize to new questions.
in other words,
it does not simply look up for an answer by matching the
question with the existing database. in fact, most of the
questions presented above, except for the    rst conversation,
do not appear in the training set.

nonetheless, one drawback of this basic model is that it
only gives simple, short, sometimes unsatisfying answers
to our questions as can be seen above. perhaps a more

problematic drawback is that the model does not capture
a consistent personality. indeed, if we ask not identical but
semantically similar questions, the answers can sometimes
be inconsistent. this is expected due to the simplicity of
our model and the dataset in our experiments. the conver-
sation below illustrates such failure:

conversation 7: job and personality

human: what is your job ?
machine: i    m a lawyer .
human: what do you do ?
machine: i    m a doctor .

lastly, as a comparison of other traditional bots that are
rule-based, we provide the output of cleverbot for some of
the questions in our test:2

human: are you a follower or a leader ?
cleverbot: no !!
human: my name is david . what is my name ?
cleverbot: how old are you david ?
human: my name is john . what is my name ?
cleverbot: john
human: what is the purpose of being intelligent
?
cleverbot: the purpose of life is to love god
and love people.
human: is sky blue or black ?
cleverbot: i am 200 years old.
human: what is the color of a yellow car ?
cleverbot: brown.
human: what is the usual color of a leaf ?
cleverbot: what is the color of the apple in the
fridge ?
human: what is the purpose of life ?
cleverbot: my purpose it to forward my species,
in other words to make it easier for future gener-
ations of mankind to live.
human: what do you think about tesla ?
cleverbot: i am tesla.
human: what do you think about cleopatra ?
cleverbot: cool is cool.
human: what do you think about england dur-
ing the reign of elizabeth ?
cleverbot: i like him. do you ?
human: what do you think about bill gates ?
cleverbot: lets talk about link.
human: what is moral ?
cleverbot: morality is the quality of being in
accord with standards of right or good conduct.
human: what is immoral ?

2the outputs of cleverbot are non-deterministic so the an-

swers may be different for different trials.

a neural conversational model

cleverbot: what is the objective of sistetic life ?
human: does a cat have a wing ?
cleverbot: what is the name of your husband.
human: can a cat    y ?
cleverbot:: what is your husband   s name ?
human: who is skywalker ?
cleverbot: there are two of them, anakin sky-
walker and luke skywalker, both characters from
star wars.
human: how many legs does a cat have ?
cleverbot: an ant.
human: how many legs does a centipede have
?
cleverbot: a centipede   s number of legs varies
from thirty to two hundred.
human: what is your job ?
cleverbot: i work in mental health.
human: what do you do ?
cleverbot: i have no job.

5.2.2. human evaluation

in order to fairly and objectively compare our model
against cleverbot, we picked 200 questions3, and asked
four different humans to rate our model (ncm) versus cle-
verbot (cb). human judges were asked to pick which of
the two bots they preferred, and were also allowed to de-
clare a tie if both answers were of equal quality.

if three out of four human judges agreed, we record that
score. our model was preferred in 97 out of 200 questions,
whereas cleverbot was picked in 60 out of 200. there was
a tie in 20 questions, and in 23 questions the judges were
in disagreement.

here are some samples of how the judges evaluated the sys-
tems (in bold we show their preferred answer, the third ex-
ample shows a tie, and the fourth examples shows diagree-
ment):

human: what is the deepest spot on the world ?
ncm: the paci   c ocean.
cb: what ?

human: do you like mexican food or indian
food ?
ncm: i hate it.
cb: i love mexican food.

human: who are you crazy about ?
ncm: you   re the one who   s crazy.
cb: who are you ?

we however believe that it remains an open research prob-
lem of designing a good metric to quickly measure the
quality of a conversational model. we did so by manual
inspection, by using mechanical turk to get human evalu-
ations comparing with a rule-based bot, and by computing
the perplexity. however, there are obvious drawbacks on
using those, and we are actively pursuing this and other re-
search directions.

6. discussion

in this paper, we show that a simple language model based
on the id195 framework can be used to train a conversa-
tional engine. our modest results show that it can gener-
ate simple and basic conversations, and extract knowledge
from a noisy but open-domain dataset. even though the
model has obvious limitations, it is surprising to us that a
purely data driven approach without any rules can produce
rather proper answers to many types of questions. how-
ever, the model may require substantial modi   cations to be
able to deliver realistic conversations. amongst the many
limitations, the lack of a coherent personality makes it dif-
   cult for our system to pass the turing test (turing, 1950).
