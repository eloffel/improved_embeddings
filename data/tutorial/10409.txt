abstract

id56s (id56) and
their recently proposed extension recur-
sive long short term memory networks
(rlstm) are models that compute rep-
resentations for sentences, by recursively
combining id27s according to
an externally provided parse tree. both
models thus, unlike recurrent networks,
explicitly make use of the hierarchical
structure of a sentence. in this paper, we
demonstrate that id56s nevertheless suf-
fer from the vanishing gradient and long
distance dependency problem, and that
rlstms greatly improve over id56   s on
these problems. we present an arti   cial
learning task that allows us to quantify the
severity of these problems for both mod-
els. we further show that a ratio of gra-
dients (at the root node and a focal leaf
node) is highly indicative of the success of
id26 at optimizing the relevant
weights low in the tree. this paper thus
provides an explanation for existing, supe-
rior results of rlstms on tasks such as
id31, and suggests that the
bene   ts of including hierarchical structure
and of including lstm-style gating are
complementary.

introduction

1
the id56 (id56) model be-
came popular since the work of socher et al.
(2010).
it has been employed to tackle several
nlp tasks, such as syntactic parsing (socher et al.,
2013a), machine translation (liu et al., 2014), and
id27 learning (luong et al., 2013).
like traditional recurrent neural net-
however,
works, the id56 seems to suffer from the vanish-

ing gradient problem, in which error signals prop-
agating from the root in a parse tree to the child
nodes shrink very quickly. moreover, it encoun-
ters dif   culties in capturing long range dependen-
cies:
information propagating from child nodes
deep in a parse tree can be obscured before reach-
ing the root node.

in the recurrent neural network world, the long
short term memory (lstm) architecture (hochre-
iter and schmidhuber, 1997) is often used as a so-
lution to these two problems. a natural extension
of the lstm can be de   ned for tree structures,
which we call recursive lstm (rlstm), as pro-
posed independently by tai et al. (2015), zhu et
al. (2015), and le and zuidema (2015). how-
ever, while there is intensive research showing
how the lstm architecture can overcome those
two problems compared to traditional recurrent
models (e.g., gers and schmidhuber (2001)), such
research is, to our knowledge, still absent for the
comparison between id56s and rlstms. there-
fore, in the current paper we investigate the fol-
lowing two questions:

1. is the rlstm more capable of capturing

long range dependencies than the id56?

2. does the rlstm overcome the vanishing
gradient problem more effectively than the
id56?

supervised learning requires annotated data,
which is often expensive to collect. as a result, ex-
amining a model on natural data on many different
aspects can be dif   cult because the portion of data
that    ts a speci   c aspect could not be suf   cient.
moreover, studying individual aspects separately
is hard since many aspects are often correlated
with each other. this, unfortunately, is true in our
case: answering those two questions requires us to
evaluate the examined models on datasets of dif-

ferent tree depths, in which the key nodes which
contain decisive information in a parse tree must
be identi   ed. using available annotated corpora
such as the stanford sentiment treebank (socher
et al., 2013b) and the id32 is thus inap-
propriate, as they are too small for this purpose
(10k, 40k trees, respectively, compared to 240k
trees in our experiments), and key nodes are not
marked. our solution is an arti   cial task where
sentences and parse trees can be randomly gener-
ated under any arbitrary constraints on tree depth
and key node   s position.

2 background
both the id56 and the rlstm model are in-
stances of a general framework which takes a sen-
tence, syntactic tree, and vector representations for
the words in the sentence as input, and applies a
composition function to recursively compute vec-
tor representations for all the phrases in the tree
and the complete sentence. technically speaking,
given a production p     x y, and x, y     rn
representing x, y, we compute p     rn for p by
p = f (x, y), where f is a composition function.
in the id56, f is a one-layer feed-forward neu-
ral network.
in the rlstm, a node u is repre-
sented by the vector u = [ur; uc] resulting from
concatenating a vector representing the phrase that
the node covers and a memory vector. f could
be any lstm that can combine two such con-
catenation vectors, such as structure-lstm (zhu
et al., 2015), tree-lstm (tai et al., 2015), and
lstm-id56 (le and zuidema, 2015). in the cur-
rent paper, we use the implementation1 of le and
zuidema (2015).

3 experiments
we now examine how the two problems, the van-
ishing gradient problem and the problem of how
to capture long range dependencies, affect the
rlstm model and the id56 model. to do so,
we propose the following arti   cial task, which re-
quires a model to distinguish useful signals from
noise. we de   ne:

    a sentence is a sequence of tokens which are

integer numbers in the range [0, 10000];

    a sentence contains one and only one keyword
token which is an integer number smaller
than 1000;

1https://github.com/lephong/lstm-id56

    a sentence is labeled with the integer result-
ing from dividing the keyword by 100. for
instance, if the keyword is 607, the label is
6. in this way, there are 10 classes, ranging
from 0 to 9.

the task is to predict the class of a sentence, given
its binary parse tree (figure 1). because the label
of a sentence is determined solely by the keyword,
the two models need to identify the keyword in the
parse tree and allow only the information from the
leaf node of the keyword to affect the root node. it
is worth noting that this task resembles sentiment
analysis with simple cases in which the sentiment
of a whole sentence is determined by one key-
word (e.g.    i like the movie   ). simulating com-
plex cases involving negation, composition, etc. is
straightforward and for future work. but here we
believe that the current task is adequate to answer
our two questions raised in section 1.

the two models, rlstm and id56, were im-
plemented with the dimension of vector represen-
tations and vector memories 50. following socher
et al. (2013b), we used tanh as the activation
function, and initialized word vectors by randomly
sampling each value from a uniform distribution
u (   0.0001, 0.0001). we trained the two models
using the adagrad method (duchi et al., 2011)
with a learning rate of 0.05 and a mini-batch size
of 20 for the id56 and of 5 for the rlstm. de-
velopment sets were employed for early stopping
(training is halted when the accuracy on the de-
velopment set is not improved after 5 consecutive
epochs).

3.1 experiment 1
we randomly generated 10 datasets. to generate a
sentence of length l, we shuf   e a list of randomly
chosen l     1 non-keywords and one keyword. the
i-th dataset contains 12k sentences of lengths from
10i    9 tokens to 10i tokens, and is split into train,
dev, test sets with sizes of 10k, 1k, 1k sentences.
we parsed each sentence by randomly generating
a binary tree whose number of leaf nodes equals
to the sentence length.

the test accuracies of the two models on the 10
datasets are shown in figure 2; for each dataset
we run each model 5 times and reported the high-
est accuracy for the id56 model, and the distribu-
tion of accuracies (via boxplot) for the rlstm
model. we can see that the id56 model per-
forms reasonably well on very short sentences

figure 1: example binary tree for the arti   cial task. the number enclosed in the box is the keyword of
the sentence.

(less than 11 tokens). however, when the sentence
length exceeds 10, the id56   s performance drops
so quickly that the difference between it and the
random guess    performance (10%) is negligible.
trying different learning rates, mini-batch sizes,
and values for n (the dimension of vectors) did not
give signi   cant differences. on the other hand,
the rlstm model achieves more than 90% ac-
curacy on sentences shorter than 31 tokens.
its
performance drops when the sentence length in-
creases, but is still substantially better than the ran-
dom guess when the sentence length does not ex-
ceed 70. when the sentence length exceeds 70,
both the rlstm and id56 perform similarly.

3.2 experiment 2
in experiment 1, it is not clear whether the tree
size or the keyword depth is the main factor of the
rapid drop of the id56   s performance. in this ex-

periment, we kept the tree size    xed and vary the
keyword depth. we generated a pool of sentences
of lengths from 21 to 30 tokens and parsed them by
randomly generating binary trees. we then created
10 datasets each of which has 12k trees (10k for
training, 1k for development, and 1k for testing).
the i-th dataset consists of only trees in which dis-
tances from keywords to roots are i or i + 1 (to
stop the networks from exploiting keyword depths
directly).

figure 3 shows test accuracies of the two mod-
els on those 10 datasets. similarly in experiment
1, for each dataset we run each model 5 times
and reported the highest accuracy for the id56
model, and the distribution of accuracies for the
rlstm model. as we can see, the id56 model
achieves very high accuracies when the keyword
depth does not exceed 3.
its performance then
drops rapidly and gets close to the performance

of the random guess. this is evidence that the
id56 model has dif   culty capturing long range de-
pendencies. by contrast, the rlstm model per-
forms at above 90% accuracy until the depth of the
keyword reaches 8. it has dif   culty dealing with
larger depths, but the performance is always better
than the random guess.

3.3 experiment 3
we now examine whether the two models can en-
counter the vanishing gradient problem. to do so,
we looked at the the back-propagation phase of
each model in experiment 1 on the third dataset
(the one containing sentences of lengths from 21
to 30 tokens). for each tree, we calculated the ra-
tio

(cid:107)

(cid:107)

   j

   xkeyword

(cid:107)    j

   xroot

(cid:107)

where the numerator is the norm of the error vector
at the keyword node and the denominator is the
norm of the error vector at the root node. this ratio
gives us an intuition how the error signals develop
when propagating backward to leaf nodes: if the
ratio (cid:28) 1, the vanishing gradient problem occurs;
else if the ratio (cid:29) 1, we observe the exploding
gradient problem.

figure 4 reports the ratios w.r.t.

the keyword
node depth in each epoch of training the id56
model. the ratios in the    rst epoch are always
very small.
in each following epoch, the id56
model successfully lifts up the ratios steadily (see
figure 6a for a clear picture at the keyword depth

10), but a clear decrease when the depth becomes
larger is observable. for the rlstm model (see
figure 5 and 6b), the story is somewhat different.
the ratios go up after two epochs so rapidly that
there are even some exploding error signals sent
back to leaf nodes. they subsequently go down
and remain stable with substantially less explod-
ing error signals. this is, interestingly, concurrent
with the performance of the rlstm model on the
development set (see figure 6b). it seems that the
rlstm model, after one epoch, quickly locates
the keyword node in a tree and relates it to the root
by building a strong bond between them via error
signals. after the correlation between the keyword
and the label at the root is found, it tries to stabilize
the training by reducing the error signals sent back
to the keyword node. comparing the two models
by aligning figure 4 with figure 5, and figure 6a
with figure 6b, we can see that the rlstm model
is more capable of transmitting error signals to leaf
nodes.

it is worth noting that we do see the vanish-
ing gradient problem happening when training the
id56 model in figure 4; but figure 6a suggests
that the problem can become less serious after a
long enough training time. this might be because
depth 10 is still manageable for the id56 model.
(notice that in the stanford sentiment treebank,
more than three quarters of leaf nodes are at depths
less than 10.) the fact the the id56 model still
doesnot perform better than random guessing can
be explained using the arguments given by ben-
gio et al. (1994), who show that there is a trade-off

the experimental results show that the rlstm
is superior to the id56 in terms of overcoming
the vanishing gradient problem and capturing long
term dependencies. this is in parallel with general
conclusions about the power of the lstm archi-
tecture compared to traditional recurrent neural
networks. in future work we focus on more com-
plex cases involving negation, composition, etc.
