abstract

id4 (mt) has
reached state-of-the-art results. however,
one of the main challenges that neural mt
still faces is dealing with very large vo-
cabularies and morphologically rich lan-
guages.
in this paper, we propose a neural mt
system using character-based embeddings
in combination with convolutional and
highway layers to replace the standard
lookup-based word representations. the
resulting unlimited-vocabulary and af   x-
aware source id27s are tested
in a state-of-the-art neural mt based on
an attention-based bidirectional recurrent
neural network. the proposed mt scheme
provides improved results even when the
source language is not morphologically
rich. improvements up to 3 id7 points
are obtained in the german-english wmt
task.

introduction

machine translation (mt) is the set of algorithms
that aim at transforming a source language into
a target language. for the last 20 years, one of
the most popular approaches has been statistical
phrase-based mt, which uses a combination of
features to maximise the id203 of the tar-
get sentence given the source sentence (koehn et
al., 2003). just recently, the neural mt approach
has appeared (kalchbrenner and blunsom, 2013;
sutskever et al., 2014; cho et al., 2014; bahdanau
et al., 2015) and obtained state-of-the-art results.
among its different strengths neural mt does
not need to pre-design feature functions before-
hand; optimizes the entire system at once because

it provides a fully trainable model; uses word em-
beddings (sutskever et al., 2014) so that words (or
minimal units) are not independent anymore; and
is easily extendable to multimodal sources of in-
formation (elliott et al., 2015). as for weaknesses,
neural mt has a strong limitation in vocabulary
due to its architecture and it is dif   cult and com-
putationally expensive to tune all parameters in the
deep learning structure.

in this paper, we use the neural mt baseline
system from (bahdanau et al., 2015), which fol-
lows an encoder-decoder architecture with atten-
tion, and introduce elements from the character-
based neural language model (kim et al., 2016).
the translation unit continues to be the word, and
we continue using id27s related to
each word as an input vector to the bidirectional
recurrent neural network (attention-based mecha-
nism). the difference is that now the embeddings
of each word are no longer an independent vec-
tor, but are computed from the characters of the
corresponding word. the system architecture has
changed in that we are using a convolutional neu-
ral network (id98) and a highway network over
characters before the attention-based mechanism
of the encoder. this is a signi   cant difference
from previous work (sennrich et al., 2015) which
uses the neural mt architecture from (bahdanau
et al., 2015) without modi   cation to deal with sub-
word units (but not including unigram characters).
subword-based representations have already
been explored in natural language process-
ing (nlp), e.g.
for id52 (santos and
zadrozny, 2014), name entity recognition (san-
tos and aes, 2015), parsing (ballesteros et al.,
2015), id172 (chrupala, 2014) or learning
word representations (botha and blunsom, 2014;
chen et al., 2015). these previous works show
different advantages of using character-level in-
formation.
in our case, with the new character-

based neural mt architecture, we take advantage
of intra-word information, which is proven to be
extremely useful in other nlp applications (san-
tos and zadrozny, 2014; ling et al., 2015a), es-
pecially when dealing with morphologically rich
languages. when using the character-based source
id27s in mt, there ceases to be un-
known words in the source input, while the size
of the target vocabulary remains unchanged. al-
though the target vocabulary continues with the
same limitation as in the standard neural mt sys-
tem, the fact that there are no unknown words
in the source helps to reduce the number of un-
knowns in the target. moreover, the remaining un-
known target words can now be more successfully
replaced with the corresponding source-aligned
words. as a consequence, we obtain a signi   cant
improvement in terms of translation quality (up to
3 id7 points).

the rest of the paper is organized as follows.
section 2 brie   y explains the architecture of the
neural mt that we are using as a baseline sys-
tem. section 3 describes the changes introduced in
the baseline architecture in order to use character-
based embeddings instead of the standard lookup-
based word representations. section 4 reports the
experimental framework and the results obtained
in the german-english wmt task. finally, sec-
tion 5 concludes with the contributions of the pa-
per and further work.

2 id4

neural mt uses a neural network approach to
compute the id155 of the tar-
get sentence given the source sentence (cho et
al., 2014; bahdanau et al., 2015). the approach
used in this work (bahdanau et al., 2015) fol-
lows the encoder-decoder architecture.first, the
encoder reads the source sentence s = (s1, ..si )
and encodes it into a sequence of hidden states
h = (h1, ..hi ). then, the decoder generates a
corresponding translation t = t1, ..., tj based on
the encoded sequence of hidden states h. both en-
coder and decoder are jointly trained to maximize
the conditional log-id203 of the correct trans-
lation.

this baseline autoencoder architecture is im-
proved with a attention-based mechanism (bah-
danau et al., 2015), in which the encoder uses
a bi-directional gated recurrent unit (gru). this
gru allows for a better performance with long

sentences. the decoder also becomes a gru and
each word tj is predicted based on a recurrent hid-
den state, the previously predicted word tj   1, and
a context vector. this context vector is obtained
from the weighted sum of the annotations hk,
which in turn, is computed through an alignment
model   jk (a feedforward neural network). this
neural mt approach has achieved competitive re-
sults against the standard phrase-based system in
the wmt 2015 evaluation (jean et al., 2015).

3 character-based machine translation

id27s have been shown to boost the
performance in many nlp tasks, including ma-
chine translation. however, the standard lookup-
based embeddings are limited to a    nite-size vo-
cabulary for both computational and sparsity rea-
sons. moreover, the orthographic representation
of the words is completely ignored. the standard
learning process is blind to the presence of stems,
pre   xes, suf   xes and any other kind of af   xes in
words.

as a solution to those drawbacks, new alterna-
tive character-based id27s have been
recently proposed for tasks such as language mod-
eling (kim et al., 2016; ling et al., 2015a), pars-
ing (ballesteros et al., 2015) or id52 (ling
et al., 2015a; santos and zadrozny, 2014). even
in mt (ling et al., 2015b), where authors use the
character transformation presented in (ballesteros
et al., 2015; ling et al., 2015a) both in the source
and target. however, they do not seem to get clear
improvements. recently, (luong and manning,
2016) propose a combination of word and char-
acters in neural mt.

for our experiments in neural mt, we selected
the best character-based embedding architecture
proposed by kim et al. (kim et al., 2016) for lan-
guage modeling. as the figure 1 shows, the com-
putation of the representation of each word starts
with a character-based embedding layer that as-
sociates each word (sequence of characters) with
a sequence of vectors. this sequence of vectors
is then processed with a set of 1d convolution
   lters of different lengths (from 1 to 7 charac-
ters) followed with a max pooling layer. for each
convolutional    lter, we keep only the output with
the maximum value. the concatenation of these
max values already provides us with a representa-
tion of each word as a vector with a    xed length
equal to the total number of convolutional ker-

nels. however, the addition of two highway layers
was shown to improve the quality of the language
model in (kim et al., 2016) so we also kept these
additional layers in our case. the output of the
second highway layer will give us the    nal vec-
tor representation of each source word, replacing
the standard source id27 in the neural
machine translation system.

figure 1: character-based id27

in the target size we are still limited in vocabu-
lary by the softmax layer at the output of the net-
work and we kept the standard target word em-
beddings in our experiments. however, the results
seem to show that the af   x-aware representation of
the source words has a positive in   uence on all the
components of the network. the global optimiza-
tion of the integrated model forces the translation
model and the internal vector representation of the
target words to follow the af   x-aware codi   cation
of the source words.

4 experimental framework

this section reports the data used, its preprocess-
ing, baseline details and results with the enhanced
character-based neural mt system.

4.1 data
we used the german-english wmt data1 includ-
ing the epps, news and commoncrawl. pre-
processing consisted of tokenizing,
truecasing,
normalizing punctuation and    ltering sentences
with more than 5% of their words in a language

other than german or english. statistics are shown
in table 1.

4.2 baseline systems
the phrase-based system was built using moses
(koehn et al., 2007), with standard parameters
such as grow-   nal-diag for alignment, good-
turing smoothing of the relative frequencies, 5-
gram id38 using kneser-ney dis-
counting, and lexicalized reordering, among oth-
ers. the neural-based system was built using the
software from dl4mt2 available in github. we
generally used settings from previous work (jean
et al., 2015): networks have an embedding of 620
and a dimension of 1024, a batch size of 32, and
no dropout. we used a vocabulary size of 90 thou-
sand words in german-english. also, as proposed
in (jean et al., 2015) we replaced unknown words
(unks) with the corresponding source word using
the alignment information.

4.3 results
table 3 shows the id7 results for the baseline
systems (including phrase and neural-based, nn)
and the character-based neural mt (char). we
also include the results for the char and nn
systems with post-processing of unknown words,
which consists in replacing the unks with the cor-
responding source word (+src), as suggested in
(jean et al., 2015). id7 results improve by al-
most 1.5 points in german-to-english and by more
than 3 points in english-to-german. the reduction
in the number of unknown words (after postpro-
cessing) goes from 1491 (nn) to 1260 (char)
in the direction from german-to-english and from
3148 to 2640 in the opposite direction. note the

number of out-of-vocabulary words of the test set
is shown in table 1.

the character-based embedding has an impact
in learning a better translation model at various
levels, which seems to include better alignment,
reordering, morphological generation and disam-
biguation. table 2 shows some examples of the
kind of improvements that the character-based
neural mt system is capable of achieving com-
pared to baseline systems. examples 1 and 2 show
how the reduction of source unknowns improves
the adequacy of the translation. examples 3 and 4
show how the character-based approach is able to
handle morphological variations. finally, example
5 shows an appropriate semantic disambiguation.

5 conclusions
neural mt offers a new perspective in the way
mt is managed. its main advantages when com-
pared with previous approaches, e.g.
statistical
phrase-based, are that the translation is faced with
trainable features and optimized in an end-to-end
scheme. however, there still remain many chal-
lenges left to solve, such as dealing with the limi-

tation in vocabulary size.

in this paper we have proposed a modi   cation to
the standard encoder/decoder neural mt architec-
ture to use unlimited-vocabulary character-based
source id27s. the improvement in
id7 is about 1.5 points in german-to-english
and more than 3 points in english-to-german.

as further work, we are currently studying dif-
ferent alternatives (chung et al., 2016) to extend
the character-based approach to the target side of
the neural mt system.
