abstract

identifying topics of discussions in on-
line health communities (ohc) is crit-
ical to various applications, but can be
dif   cult because topics of ohc content
are usually heterogeneous and domain-
dependent.
in this paper, we provide a
multi-class schema, an annotated dataset,
and supervised classi   ers based on convo-
lutional neural network (id98) and other
models for the task of classifying discus-
sion topics. we apply the id98 classi-
   er to the most popular breast cancer on-
line community, and carry out a longitudi-
nal analysis to show topic distributions and
topic changes throughout members    par-
ticipation. our experimental results sug-
gest that id98 outperforms other classi-
   ers in the task of topic classi   cation, and
that certain trajectories can be detected
with respect to topic changes.

introduction

1
the involvement of the internet in healthcare gives
rise to new perspectives in ehealth (oh et al.,
2005) and changes the way patients consume and
contribute health-related information. tradition-
ally, patients with life-threatening conditions re-
ceive most of the information about their disease
from their care providers. while providers tend
to focus on the clinical impact of the disease and
might ignore the impact of the disease on a pa-
tient   s emotional wellbeing and daily life (hart-
zler and pratt, 2011), support groups, and more re-
cently online health communities (ohcs), can act
as a complementary source of support for patients
(davison et al., 2000). in particular, public online
health communities such as breast cancer forum
(wang et al., 2012; elhadad et al., 2014; zhang et

al., 2014), the csn network (portier et al., 2013;
qiu et al., 2011), and facebook groups (ben-
der et al., 2011) are getting increasingly popular
among patients, and have produced unprecedented
amount of user-generate content which could be
valuable resources for studying ohcs.

there are many challenges in understanding the
very large amount of content authored and read
by online health community members, however.
some relate to the quality of information, as well
as how the information is consumed and integrated
by community members into their daily lives and
disease management decisions. one fundamen-
tal content-related task that is important to down-
stream content analysis is to identify topics of dis-
cussions (biyani et al., 2014). previous research
suggested that topic, along with emotions, are two
basic building blocks of content with respect to
ohc content (portier et al., 2013). in this study,
we focus on investigating prevalences and dynam-
ics of discussion topics in a popular online breast
cancer forum. the task is challenging because top-
ics discussed in such ohcs are usually heteroge-
neous and domain-dependent, and can be different
from themes in other biomedical content such as
clinical notes, as well as those in other types of
general-purpose communities such as facebook.
previously, topic classi   cation has also been a cen-
tral issue of id111 in general (blei et al.,
2003), but to our best knowledge no studies has
been focused on automated and supervised topic
modeling for online health communities.

in this paper, our study objectives are (i) to pro-
vide an annotation schema for topic classi   cation;
(ii) to contribute an annotated dataset of sentences
and posts according to the coding schema; (iii)
to experiment with different supervised classi   -
cation tools, including convolutional neural net-
works, support vector machines, and labeled la-
tent dirichlet allocation, to automate the annota-

tion process; and (v) to explore the prevalence and
dynamics of different discussion topics in the en-
tire breast cancer community and across member
with different disease severities. speci   cally, we
ask following research questions:

1 what is the most effective supervised learn-
ing tool in classifying topic of discussions in
an online health community?

2 what are the most prevalent topics in discus-

sions in the breast cancer forum?

3 are there any differences of topic foci among

patients of different cancer stages?

4 how does the distribution of topics change
through time, as members participate longer
in the community?

1.1 related work
previously, sharf observed that in an online breast
cancer group,
topics regarding basic classi   ca-
tions or de   nitions of tumors and diagnosis are
most prevalent, indicating that internet support
was primarily a complementary source of infor-
mation in early years (sharf, 1997). a variety
of themes such as relationship/family issues be-
came popular in online peer discussions later on
(lewallen et al., 2014; owen et al., 2004), but
disease speci   c topics like treatment, diagnosis,
and interpretation of lab test results are still most
prevalent (civan and pratt, 2007; meier et al.,
2007a; cappiello et al., 2007). speci   c topics
of discussion were identi   ed as well. for ex-
ample, based on content analysis, meier and col-
leagues found that the most common topics in 10
cancer mailing lists were about treatment infor-
mation and how to communicate with healthcare
providers (meier et al., 2007a). owen and col-
leagues proposed a topic schema which includes
seven categories: outcome of cancer treatment,
disease status and processes associated with the
cancer, healthcare facilities and personnel, medi-
cal test and procedures, cancer treatment, physi-
cal symptoms and side effects, and description of
cancer in the body (owen et al., 2004). based
on such schema, prevalence of different topics can
be quanti   ed to facilitate content analysis of can-
cer support groups. more recently, relying on
quantitative methods, id96 is carried out
for public ohcs, but in an unsupervised fashion
(portier et al., 2013).

2 methods
2.1 source of data and data processing
our work was approved by the columbia uni-
versity irb of   ce. we relied on the discussion
board of the publicly available community from
breastcancer.org. the entire content of the
discussion board was collected in january 2015.
the discussion board is organized in distinct fo-
rums, each with threads and posts. the following
pre-processing steps were carried out.

for each post, meta-data about the forum and
the thread in which it was authored was kept, along
with author and creation date. the content of each
post was pre-processed by (i) removing all non-
textual content (e.g., substituting emoticon icons
with emoticon-related codes); and (ii) identifying
sentence boundaries using the open-source tool
nltk (loper and bird, 2002).

2.2 creating the topic schema
to enable reliable and useful annotation of top-
ics, we established a coding schema of discussion
topics through a literature review of information
needs in online health communities, with an em-
phasis on breast cancer communities (meier et al.,
2007b; civan and pratt, 2007; blank et al., 2010;
skeels et al., 2010; wen et al., 2011; bender et
al., 2013; kim et al., 2013). our objectives were
(i) to devise a coding scheme that is both rele-
vant to describing the information needs of com-
munity members as well as applicable to and ro-
bust enough for automatic topic classi   cation; and
(ii) to design a coding scheme that can be applied
to characterizing topics of discussion for either an
entire post or its individual sentences. further-
more, the annotation schema is such that each unit
of annotation can be labeled according to one or
more topics. for instance, a given post, and even
a given sentence can simultaneously convey infor-
mation about a treatment and the health system.

the coding scheme was developed using an it-
erative process to re   ect the main topics of dis-
cussion of post content. preliminary coding of
439 sentences (corresponding to 37 posts) pro-
vided the initial categories and guidelines for cod-
ing. upon review and discussion, infrequently
used categories were collapsed into larger con-
cepts, and the 439 sentences were coded again to
verify suf   cient agreement between the two ini-
tial coders. the 439 sentences and their codes
were used as training instances for the later coders,

along with the coding guidelines.

our    nal topical scheme contains 11 topics, as
listed in table 1. it is noteworthy that the topics
focus on informational support, rather than emo-
tional dimensions and range from clinical to daily
matters.

we also learned from the preliminary coding
that members may shift topic of discussion in a
post, which reminded us that to achieve better
granularity sentence-level coding would be neces-
sary. as such, our manual annotation described
below were carried out at sentence level rather
than post-level.

2.3 manual annotation
we selected a subset of posts (1008 posts consist-
ing of 9016 sentences) from the original dataset
described above. the posts were selected from
the different forums, where each forum focuses
on speci   c aspects of breast cancer management,
such as diagnosis and treatment options, support
through chemotherapy, nutrition, alternative treat-
ments, and daily life. posts were thus grouped in
batches of 50 posts per manual annotation session.
sentences were coded according to double an-
notation followed by an adjudication step from
one dedicated adjudicator throughout the anno-
tated dataset. three coders were hired for the an-
notation, all female native english speakers with
undergraduate degrees. to train for the annota-
tions, coders practiced annotating the 439 sen-
tences (37 posts) referred to above using the an-
notation guidelines.
inter-annotator agreement
with gold-standard topic annotation was moni-
tored throughout training, and training was ter-
minated when a coder had achieved a 0.6 kappa
(agreement statistic) with the gold-standard an-
notation (cohen and others, 1960). note that
given the large number of potential labels in the
schema and the fact that each sentence can be la-
beled according to multiple topics, this is a par-
ticularly stringent training constraint. afterwards,
each batch of posts was assigned two coders and
was doubly annotated at the sentence level. fi-
nally, the adjudicator went through all posts, re-
solved differences between coders and made    nal
decisions over sentence topic labels.

2.4 topic classi   cation
because a given sentence in a post can be de-
scribed according to multiple topics (e.g., a sen-
tence can be about a treatment, nutrition, and daily

matters all at once), the task of automating the
topic coding can be cast as a multi-label classi-
   cation:
for each sentence, there can be up to
n labels, where n is the number of topics in
the schema. this type of classi   cation is more
challenging than single-label classi   cation, where
one sentence can be described by only one la-
bel chosen from the n topics in a schema. tra-
ditionally,
there are two approaches for multi-
label, multi-class classi   cation: problem transfor-
mation methods and algorithm adaptation methods
(tsoumakas and katakis, 2007).

in this paper, we rely on three different super-
vised classi   ers, a labeled lda class   er (ram-
age et al., 2003), an id166 (suykens and vande-
walle, 1999), and a convolutional neural network
(kim, 2014). they represent three types of main-
stream supervised learning frameworks: genera-
tive id114, discriminative max-margin
linear classi   ers, and neural networks. within
these three models, labeled lda and neural net-
works are able to handle multi-label classi   cation
naturally since they allow multiple outputs. for
the id166, we consider n binary, single-label clas-
si   ers and aggregates the n outputs into one multi-
label.

for the labeled lda classi   er, we rely on an
self-implemented gibbs sampler for labeled lda,
based on the open source lda implementation
(heinrich, 2005)1. the two hyper-parameters of
the model, alpha and beta, are set as 0.1 and 0.5
experimentally. for id166, we rely on the open
source tool libid166 (chang and lin, 2011), us-
ing linear kernel and all default parameters.

the convolutional neural network we used has
one hidden convolutional layer. first,
the se-
quence of words is represented as a sequence of
vector of dimension d = 100, by using a lookup
table. the id27s used in this lookup
table were pre-trained, by using the id97 al-
gorithm, on the entire unannotated dataset from
the same forum. then we take the convolutions
of this sequence of    word vectors    with h    lters,
obtaining a score for each    lter and each position
in the sentence.
in order to obtain a    xed-size
representation of the sentence, we perform max-
pooling (over the positions in the sentence). we
   nally apply a fully connected layer to obtain a
score for each topic. since the dataset is imbal-
anced, we propose to use asymetric costs for pos-

periments, h is set to 800 and    is set to 0.25.

prior to training the classi   ers, the following
pre-processing and feature selection steps were
carried out: (1) all the words in the corpus were
stemmed; (2) stopwords were removed from the
vocabulary;
(3) id84 were
carried out by doing id39
(using stanford ner (finkel et al., 2005)) to rec-
ognize person, location, organization names as
well as special tokens such as number, money,
time. in addition, to make the comparison across
tools more meaningful, we also use the word em-
bedding input of id98 as features for id166, exam-
ining how it differs from bag of words representa-
tions.

2.5 application to the entire community to

support longitudinal analysis

we applied the best performed classi   er on all sen-
tences in the entire unannotated dataset. for each
post, we assigned it topic labels that are associated
with more than 1/10 of sentences in the post. as
such, based on the aggregated post-level topic la-
bels, we are able to identify 1) what are the most
prevalent topics in general in the community; 2)
if there are any differences of topics among mem-
bers of different cancer stages. we did not exam-
ine other factors than cancer stage in this study,
because cancer stage is one particular pro   le in-
formation that can be accessed.

armed with topic labels for each post in the
dataset, we also conducted following longitudinal

analyses to take timestamp into account. the pri-
mary objective for our analysis was to assess if
participation in the community has an impact on
topic of discussion. we thus compared distribu-
tions of topics of posts published in different peri-
ods of time with respect to users registration date,
and tracked their changes. as such, each data
point is the average frequency of a topic within all
posts in a given time slice (e.g., all posts published
by their authors after 3 weeks of their joining the
community). to show both short-term and long-
term changes, three measures of time progression
are used (represented as x-axis): post, day, and
week.

3.1 manual annotation
table 2 shows distributions and example sentences
for different
topics in the manually-annotated
dataset. treatment and miscellaneous sentences
are the most frequent
topics in our annotated
dataset, whereas alternative medicine and test
topics are the least prevalent. the high number of
miscellaneous sentences is explained by the fact
that most posts start with greetings and end with
encouragements, blessings, and signatures (all cat-
egorized as miscellaneous in our coding).

table 3 shows the inter-annotator agreement for
each pair of annotators across the three annotators.
among the three coders, the    rst coder annotated
all 1008 posts, while the other two complimentary
coders are assigned part of the whole data set. the

3.2 topic classi   cation
the classi   ers were evaluated in a 5-fold cross val-
idation framework using precision, recall, and f
measure. in order to evaluate the overall perfor-
mance of the system across all topics, micro av-
erage precision, recall and f are also calculated
(yang, 1999). micro average takes distribution of
labels into consideration, and it makes more sense
in this study because of the imbalance of labels
in the dataset. experiments with a baseline sys-
tem are also carried out, which simply tags every
sentence with all possible labels. aggregated re-
sults for the sentence-level classi   cation are given
in table 4.

3.3 general prevalence of topics
prevalence of all topics in the entire forum at post-
level is given in table 5. the most prevalent topic
is personal (pers), with 24.6% of posts labeled as
such, followed by treatment (trea, 24.6%) and
diagnosis (diag, 9.3%). the least prevalent top-
ics are alternative medicine (altr, 0.2%) and test
(test, 1.0%). it is noteworthy that misc did not
show up in post-level annotation, because it is a
default category assigned only when no other top-
ics are identi   ed in all sentences of the post. as
such, its prevalence is extremely low at post-level
and it is not of interest to our following analysis.

clinically relevant topics such as treatment, di-

clinical ones across the breast cancer forum, with
one exception of pers. topic distribution in the
entire bc dataset is more skewed that that in the
annotated dataset, because the annotated dataset
was sampled toward collecting more posts of rare
topics such as alternative medicine (altr).

stage

in the bc dataset, many users self-reported dis-
ease information in pro   les, including cancer di-
agnoses and treatment histories. these pro   le
information show up in signatures when authors
post, which is available to the public. in particular,
out of all 57,424 authors in the dataset we crawled,
17,950 (31.3%) have their cancer stage informa-
tion available in signatures. among them, 2,325
are stage 0 (total number of posts: 170,610), 5,968

tive medicine (altr), laboratory test (test), and
resources (rsrc) are unpopular topics through-
out members    participation. the results seem to
suggest that members    focus shifted from infor-
mational support, represented by clinically con-
centrated topics such as diagnosis and treatment,
to emotional support, represented by personal fo-
cused on topics such as nutrition and daily lives.

4 discussions

a wide range of topics are discussed in the breast
cancer community, ranging from clinically rele-
vant ones such as diagnosis and treatment to more
daily matters such as nutritional supplements and
personal lives.
in the breast cancer forum, per-
sonal matters and treatment are the most domi-
nant topics, possibly representing a mix of emo-
tional support and informational support being ex-
changed.

cancer stage plays a role in deciding members   
topics of discussions. early stage members, many
of whom are newcomers to the community, care
more about diagnosis related information. stage 0
members, in particular, focus on whether certain
signs indicate cancer. they also exchange anec-
dotes about their experiences of visiting healthcare
providers when being diagnosed. late stage mem-
bers, such as stage iv members, usually stay in
the community for longer time as their cancer de-
velop. for these members, seeking information is
no longer the primary motivation of participation;
on the contrary, they establish closer relationships
with their online peers, and disclose more personal
information and support each other emotionally.
it it noteworthy, however, that cancer stage infor-
mation extracted from signatures may be inaccu-
rate, since members may not report stage change
timely. also, it is naturally the case that mem-
bers with late stage cancer are more likely to be
long time users, which makes length of member-
ship an important confounder in considering dif-
ferences between members of different stages.

finally, we found that members shifted their fo-
cus in participation, from clinically relevant topics
to more casual topics. this coincides with the dif-
ference between cancer stages, and con   rms that
the difference is at least partly caused by length of
participation. as members stay longer in the com-
munity and build up closer relationship with their
peers, they tend to disclose more personal infor-
mation, discuss more private stories, and exchange

are stage i (total number of posts: 600,500), 5,907
are stage ii (total number of posts: 661,990), 2,447
are stage iii (total number of posts: 229,955),
and 2,438 are stage iv (total number of posts:
460,313).

topic distributions of posts published by mem-
bers of different cancer stages are given in table
1. statistical tests (multi-variate and univariate)
were also carried out between numbers of differ-
ent stages. most visible differences in    gure 1 are
statistical signi   cant, given relatively large sample
size. stage 0 users focus more on cancer diagno-
sis and health systems, which are typical topics at
early times of cancer journeys. stage iv mem-
bers, counter-intuitively, discuss more about per-
sonal lives but signi   cantly less about treatment
and clinical    ndings. this seems to suggest that
stage iv members rely on the forum to exchange
emotional more than informational support with
their peers. another explanation might be that
these members are so sick that few treatment op-
tions are effective for them.

3.5 topic trajectory of users
figure 2 shows changes of frequencies of topics
after members    joining the community, in weeks,
days, and individual posts, respectively. several
types of trajectories are identi   ed. first, diag-
nosis is the most dominant topic at early stages
of participation, especially in    rst posts and    rst
days. second, prevalence of some topics such as
personal (pers), daily matters (dail), and nu-
trition (nutr) grow steadily, while prevalences
of diagnosis (diag) and treatment (trea) de-
cline as members stay longer in the community.
third, frequencies of health systems (hsys) and
   ndings (find) increase at the beginning, but
slide after reaching the peaks. finally, alterna-

5 conclusion

in this paper, we provide a multi-class schema, an
annotated dataset, and supervised classi   ers based
on convolutional neural network (id98) and other
models for the task of topic classi   cation for on-
line health community text. we apply the classi-
   er on the most popular breast cancer online com-
munity, the discussion boards of breastcancer.org,
and carry out longitudinal analysis at scale to show
topic distributions and topic changes throughout
members    participation. our experimental results
suggest that id98 outperforms other classi   ers in
the task of topic classi   cation. we also found that
although personal and disease related topics are
most prevalent, members of different cancer stages
have different foci of topics. finally, members
change their interest as they participate, becoming
increasingly interested in more personal topics in
online discussions.
