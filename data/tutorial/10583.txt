abstract

in this paper, we propose a novel    netuning
algorithm for the recently introduced multi-
way, mulitlingual neural machine translate
that enables zero-resource machine transla-
tion. when used together with novel many-
to-one translation strategies, we empirically
show that this    netuning algorithm allows the
multi-way, multilingual model to translate a
zero-resource language pair (1) as well as a
single-pair neural translation model trained
with up to 1m direct parallel sentences of the
same language pair and (2) better than pivot-
based translation strategy, while keeping only
one additional copy of attention-related pa-
rameters.

for zero-resource machine translation,

in this paper, we conduct in-depth investigation
into the recently proposed multi-way, multilingual
neural machine
(firat et al., 2016).
speci   cally, we are interested in its poten-
tial
in
which there does not exist any direct paral-
lel examples between a target
language pair.
zero-resource
translation has been addressed
by pivot-based translation in traditional ma-
chine translation research (wu and wang, 2007;
utiyama and isahara, 2007), but we explore a way
to use the multi-way, multilingual neural model to
translate directly from a source to target language.

in doing so, we begin by studying different trans-
lation strategies available in the multi-way, multi-
lingual model in sec. 3   4. the strategies include
a usual one-to-one translation as well as variants
of many-to-one translation for multi-source transla-
tion (zoph and knight, 2016). we empirically show
that the many-to-one strategies signi   cantly outper-
form the one-to-one strategy.

we move on to zero-resource translation by    rst
evaluating a vanilla multi-way, multilingual model
on a zero-resource language pair, which revealed
that the vanilla model cannot do zero-resource trans-
lation in sec. 6.1. based on the many-to-one strate-
gies we proposed earlier, we design a novel    netun-

ing strategy that does not require any direct paral-
lel corpus between a target, zero-resource language
pair in sec. 5.2, which uses the idea of generating
a pseudo-parallel corpus (sennrich et al., 2015a).
this strategy makes an additional copy of the atten-
tion mechanism and    netunes only this small set of
parameters.

large-scale experiments with spanish, french
and english show that the proposed    netuning strat-
egy allows the multi-way, multilingual neural trans-
lation model to perform zero-resource translation as
well as a single-pair neural translation model trained
with up to 1m true parallel sentences. this result
re-con   rms the potential of the multi-way, multilin-
gual model for low/zero-resource language transla-
tion, which was earlier argued by firat et al. (2016).

2 multi-way, multilingual

id4

recently firat et al. (2016) proposed an exten-
sion of attention-based neural machine transla-
tion (bahdanau et al., 2015) that can handle multi-
way, multilingual translation with a shared attention
mechanism. this model was designed to handle
multiple source and target languages.
in this sec-
tion, we brie   y overview this multi-way, multilin-
gual model. for more detailed exposition, we refer
the reader to (firat et al., 2016).

2.1 model description
the goal of multi-way, multilingual model is to
build a neural translation model that can translate a
source sentence given in one of n languages into
one of m target languages. thus to handle those
n source and m target languages, the model con-
sists of n encoders and m decoders. unlike these
language-speci   c encoders and decoders, only a sin-
gle attention mechanism is shared across all m    n
language pairs.

encoder an encoder for the n-th source language
reads a source sentence x = (x1, . . . , xtx ) as a
sequence of linguistic symbols and returns a set of
tx(cid:9). the en-
context vectors c n = (cid:8)hn
coder is usually implemented as a bidirectional re-
current network (schuster and paliwal, 1997), and
t is a concatenation of the for-
each context vector hn
ward and reverse recurrent networks    hidden states

1 , . . . , hn

at time t. without loss of generality, we assume
that the dimensionalities of the context vector for all
source languages are all same.

decoder and attention mechanism a decoder
for the m-th target language is a conditional recur-
rent language model (mikolov et al., 2010). at each
time step t   , it updates its hidden state by

zm
t    =   m(zm

t      1,   ym

t      1, cm

t    ),

based on the previous hidden state zm
target symbol   ym
text vector cm
(cho et al., 2014)).

t       1, previous
t      1 and the time-dependent con-
t    .   m is a gated recurrent unit (gru,

the time-dependent context vector is computed
by the shared attention mechanism as a weighted
sum of the context vectors from the encoder c n:

the scoring function fscore returns a scalar and is
implemented as a feedforward neural network with
a single hidden layer. for more variants of the
attention mechanism for machine translation, see
(luong et al., 2015b).

the initial hidden state of the decoder is initial-

ized as

with the new hidden state zm

tribution over the next symbol is computed by

2.2 learning
training this multi-way, multilingual model does
not require multi-way parallel corpora but only a

set of bilingual corpora. for each bilingual pair, the
conditional log-id203 of a ground-truth transla-
tion given a source sentence is maximize by adjust-
ing the relevant parameters following the gradient of
the log-id203.

3 translation strategies

3.1 one-to-one translation

in the original paper by firat et al. (2016), only one
translation strategy was evaluated, that is, one-to-
one translation. this one-to-one strategy works on
a source sentence given in one language by taking
the encoder of that source language, the decoder of
a target language and the shared attention mecha-
nism. these three components are glued together as
if they form a single-pair neural translation model
and translates the source sentence into a target lan-
guage.

we however notice that this is not the only transla-
tion strategy available with the multi-way, multilin-
gual model. as we end up with multiple encoders,
multiple decoder and a shared attention mechanism,
this model naturally enables us to exploit a source
sentence given in multiple languages,
leading to
a many-to-one translation strategy which was pro-
posed recently by zoph and knight (2016) in the
context of id4.

unlike (zoph and knight, 2016), the multi-way,
multilingual model is not trained with multi-way
parallel corpora. this however does not necessar-
ily imply that the model cannot be used in this way.
in the remainder of this section, we propose two al-
ternatives for doing multi-source translation with the
multi-way, multilingual model.

3.2 many-to-one translation

in this section, we consider a case where a source
sentence is given in two languages, x1 and x2.
however, any of the approaches described below ap-
plies to more than two source languages trivially.

in this multi-way, multilingual model, multi-
source translation can be thought of as averaging
two separate translation paths. for instance, in the
case of es+fr to en, we want to combine es   en
and fr   en so as to get a better english translation.
we notice that there are two points in the multi-way,

multilingual model where this averaging may hap-
pen.

early average the    rst candidate is to averag-
ing two translation paths when computing the time-
dependent context vector (see eq. (1).) at each time
t in the decoder, we compute a time-dependent con-
t re-
text vector for each source language, c1
spectively for the two source languages. in this early
averaging strategy, we simply take the average of
these two context vectors:

t and c2

ct =

c1
t + c2
t

2

.

(5)

similarly, we initialize the decoder   s hidden state to
be the average of the initializers of the two encoders:

z0 =

1

2 (cid:16)  init(  1

init(h1

tx1

)) +   init(  2

init(h2

tx1

))(cid:17) ,
(6)

where   init is the decoder   s initializer (see eq. (3).)

late average alternatively, we can average those
two translation paths (e.g., es   en and fr   en) at
the output level. at each time t, each translation path
computes the distribution over the target vocabulary,
i.e., p(yt = w|y<t, x1) and p(yt = w|y<t, x2). we
then average them to get the multi-source output dis-
tribution:

(7)

p(yt = w|y<t, x1, x2) =

1
2

(p(yt = w|y<t, x1) + p(yt = w|y<t)).
an advantage of this late averaging strategy over
the early averaging one is that this can work even
when those two translation paths were not from a
single multilingual model. they can be two sepa-
rately single-pair models. in fact, if x1 and x2 are
same and the two translation paths are simply two
different models trained on the same language pair   
direction, this is equivalent to constructing an en-
semble, which was found to greatly improve trans-
lation quality (sutskever et al., 2014)

early+late average the two strategies above
can be further combined by late-averaging the out-
put distributions from the early averaged model and
the late averaged one. we empirically evaluate this
early+late average strategy as well.

4 experiments: translation strategies and

multi-source translation

before continuing on with zero-resource machine
translation, we    rst evaluate the translation strate-
gies described in the previous section on multi-
source translation, as these translation strategies
form a basic foundation on which we extend the
multi-way, multilingual model for zero-resource
machine translation.

4.1 settings
when evaluating the multi-source translation strate-
gies, we use english, spanish and french, and focus
on a scenario where only en-es and en-fr parallel
corpora are available.

4.1.1 corpora
en-es we combine the following corpora to form
34.71m parallel es-en sentence pairs: un (8.8m),
europarl-v7 (1.8m), news-commentary-v7 (150k),
ldc2011t07-t12 (2.9m) and internal
technical-
domain data (21.7m).

en-fr we combine the following corpora to form
65.77m parallel en-fr sentence pairs: un (9.7m),
europarl-v7 (1.9m), news-commentary-v7 (1.2m),
ldc2011t07-t10 (1.6m), reutersun (4.5m), in-
ternal technical-domain data (23.5m) and gigaword
r2 (20.66m).

evaluation sets we use newstest-2012 and
newstest-2013 from wmt as development and test
sets, respectively.

monolingual corpora we do not use any addi-
tional monolingual corpus.

byte pair encoding (bpe, (sennrich et al., 2015b))
to get subword symbols, we end up with 37k, 43k
and 45k unique tokens for english, spanish and
french, respectively.
for training, we only use
sentence pairs in which both sentences are only up
to 50 symbols long.

4.2 models and training

we start from the code made publicly available
as a part of (firat et al., 2016). we made two
changes to the original code. first, we replaced
the decoder with the conditional gated recurrent net-
work with the attention mechanism as outlines in
(firat and cho, 2016). second, we feed a binary in-
dicator vector of which encoder(s) the source sen-
tence was processed by to the output layer of each
w in eq. (4)). each dimension of the in-
decoder (gm
dicator vector corresponds to one source language,
and in the case of multi-source translation, there may
be more than one dimensions set to 1.

we train the following models: four single-pair
models (es   en and fr   en) and one multi-way,
multilingual model (es,fr,en   es,fr,en). as pro-
posed by firat et al. (2016), we share one attention
mechanism for the latter case.

training we closely follow the setup from
(firat et al., 2016). each symbol is represented as
a 620-dimensional vector. any recurrent
layer,
be it in the encoder or decoder, consists of 1000
id149 (gru, (cho et al., 2014)), and
the attention mechanism has a hidden layer of
1200 tanh units (fscore
in eq. (2)). we use
adam (kingma and ba, 2015) to train a model, and
the gradient at each update is computed using a
minibatch of at most 80 sentence pairs.
the
gradient is clipped to have the norm of at most
1 (pascanu et al., 2012). we early-stop any training
using the t-b score on a development set.

4.3 one-to-one translation
we    rst con   rm that the multi-way, multilingual
translation model indeed works as well as single-
pair models on the translation paths that were con-
sidered during training, which was the major claim
in (firat et al., 2016). in table 2, we present the re-

t-b score is de   ned as ter   id7

which we found to be
more stable than either ter or id7 alone for the purpose of
early-stopping (zhao and chen, 2009).

the multi-way, multilingual

cases with less parameters (due to the shared
attention mechanism.)
in
(firat et al., 2016), we also see that the multilingual
model performs better when a target language is en-
glish.

as observed earlier

4.4 many-to-one translation

we consider translating from a pair of source sen-
tences in spanish (es) and french (fr) to english
(en).
it is important to note that the multilingual
model was not trained with any multi-way parallel
corpus. despite this, we observe that the early aver-
aging strategy improves the translation quality (mea-
sured in id7) by 3 points in the case of the test set
(compare table 2 (a   b) and table 3 (a).) we con-
jecture that this happens as training the multilingual
model has implicitly encouraged the model to    nd a
common context vector space across multiple source
languages.

the late averaging strategy however outperforms
the early averaging in both cases of multilingual
model and a pair of single-pair models (see ta-
ble 3 (b)) albeit marginally. the best quality was
observed when the early and late averaging strate-

gies were combined at the output level, achieving up
to +3.5 id7 (compare table 2 (a) and table 3 (c).)
we emphasize again that there was no multi-way
parallel corpus consisting of spanish, french and
english during training. the result presented in
this section shows that the multi-way, multilingual
model can exploit multiple sources effectively with-
out requiring any multi-way parallel corpus, and
we will rely on this property together with the pro-
posed many-to-one translation strategies in the later
sections where we propose and investigate zero-
resource translation.

5 zero-resource translation strategies

the network architecture of multi-way, multilingual
model suggests the potential for translating between
two languages without any direct parallel corpus
available.
in the setting considered in this paper
(see sec. 4.1,) these translation paths correspond to
es   fr, as only parallel corpora used for training
were es   en and fr   en.
the most naive approach for translating along a
zero-resource path is to simply treat it as any other
path that was included as a part of training. this
corresponds to the one-to-one strategy from sec. 3.1.
in our experiments, it however turned out that this
naive approach does not work at all, as can be seen
in table 4 (a).

in this section, we investigate this potential of
zero-resource translation with the multi-way, mul-
tilingual model in depth. more speci   cally, we
propose a number of approaches that enable zero-
resource translation without requiring any additional
bilingual corpus.

5.1 pivot-based translation

the target

zero-resource

the fact
the    rst set of approaches exploits
that
translation path
can be decomposed into a sequence of high-
resource translation paths
(wu and wang, 2007;
utiyama and isahara, 2007). for instance,
in our
case, es   fr can be decomposed into a sequence of
es   en and en   fr. in other words, we translate
a source sentence (es) into a pivot language (en)
and then translate the english translation into a tar-
get language (fr).

one-to-one translation the most basic ap-
proach here is to perform each translation path in
the decomposed sequence independently from each
other. this one-to-one approach introduces only a
minimal computational complexity (the multiplica-
tive factor of two.) we can further improve this one-
to-one pivot-based translation by maintaining a set
of k-best translations from the    rst stage (es   en),
but this increase the overall computational complex-
ity by the factor of k, making it impractical in prac-
tice. we therefore focus only on the former approach
of keeping the best pivot translation in this paper.

many-to-one translation with the multi-way,
multilingual model considered in this paper, we can
extend the naive one-to-one pivot-based strategy by
replacing the second stage (en   fr) to be many-to-
one translation from sec. 4.4 using both the origi-
nal source language and the pivot language as a pair
of source languages. we    rst translate the source
sentence (es) into english, and use both the original
source sentence and the english translation (es+en)
to translate into the    nal target language (fr).

both approaches described and proposed above
do not require any additional action on an already-
trained multilingual model. they are simply differ-
ent translation strategies speci   cally aimed at zero-
resource translation.

5.2 finetuning with pseudo parallel corpus

the failure of the naive zero-resource translation
earlier (see table 4 (a)) suggests that the context vec-
tors returned by the encoder are not compatible with
the decoder, when the combination was not included
during training. the good translation qualities of the
translation paths included in training however im-
ply that the representations learned by the encoders
and decoders are good. based on these two obser-
vations, we conjecture that all that is needed for a
zero-resource translation path is a simple adjustment
that makes the context vectors from the encoder to
be compatible with the target decoder. thus, we
propose to adjust this zero-resource translation path
however without any additional parallel corpus.

first, we generate a small set of pseudo bilin-
gual pairs of sentences for the zero-resource lan-
guage pair (es   fr) in interest. we randomly select
n sentences pairs from a parallel corpus between

the target language (fr) and a pivot language (en)
and translate the pivot side (en) into the source lan-
guage (es). then, the pivot side is discarded, and we
construct a pseudo parallel corpus consisting of sen-
tence pairs of the source and target languages (es-
fr).

we make a copy of the existing attention mech-
anism, to which we refer as target-speci   c atten-
tion mechanism. we then    netune only this target-
speci   c attention mechanism while keeping all the
other parameters of the encoder and decoder intact,
using the generated pseudo parallel corpus. we do
not update any other parameters in the encoder and
decoder, because they are already well-trained (evi-
denced by high translation qualities in table 2) and
we want to avoid disrupting the well-captured struc-
tures underlying each language.

once the model has been    netuned with the
pseudo parallel corpus, we can use any of the trans-
lation strategies described earlier in sec. 3 for the
   netuned zero-resource translation path. we ex-
pect a similar gain by using many-to-one translation,
which we empirically con   rm in the next section.

6 experiments:

zero-resource translation

6.1 without finetuning
6.1.1 settings

we use the same multi-way, multilingual model
trained earlier in sec. 4.2 to evaluate the zero-
resource translation strategies. we emphasize here
that this model was trained only using es-en and
fr-en bilingual parallel corpora without any es-fr
parallel corpus.

we evaluate the proposed approaches to zero-
resource translation with the same multi-way, multi-
lingual model from sec. 4.1. we speci   cally select

the path from spanish to french (es   fr) as a target
zero-resource translation path.

against which we compare the multi-way, multilin-
gual models.

6.1.2 result and analysis

as mentioned earlier, we observed that the multi-
way, multilingual model cannot directly translate
between two languages when the translation path
between those two languages was not included in
training (table 4 (a).) on the other hand, the model
was able to translate decently with the pivot-based
one-to-one translation strategy, as can be see in ta-
ble 4 (b). unsurprisingly, all the many-to-one strate-
gies resulted in worse translation quality, which is
due to the inclusion of the useless translation path
(direct path between the zero-resource pair, es-fr.)
these results clearly indicate that the multi-way,
multilingual model trained with only bilingual par-
allel corpora is not capable of direct zero-resource
translation as it is.

6.2 finetuning with a pseudo parallel corpus
6.2.1 settings

the proposed    netuning strategy raises a number
of questions. first, it is unclear how many pseudo
sentence pairs are needed to achieve a decent trans-
lation quality. because the purpose of this    netuning
stage is simply to adjust the shared attention mecha-
nism so that it can properly bridge from the source-
side encoder to the target-side decoder, we expect it
to work with only a small amount of pseudo pairs.
we validate this by creating pseudo corpora of dif-
ferent sizes   1k, 10k, 100k and 1m.

in order

language pair.

second, we want to know how detrimental it
is to use the generated pseudo sentence pairs
compared to using true sentence pairs between
the target
to answer
this question, we compiled a true multi-way par-
allel corpus by combining the subsets of un
(7.8m), europral-v7 (1.8m), opensubtitles-2013
(1m), news-commentary-v7 (174k), ldc2011t07
(335k) and news-crawl (310k), and use it to    netune
the model. this allows us to evaluate the effect of
the pseudo and true parallel corpora on    netuning
for zero-resource translation.

lastly, we train single-pair models translating di-
rectly from spanish to french by using the true par-
allel corpora. these models work as a baseline

see the last row of table 1.

training unlike the usual training procedure de-
scribed in sec. 4.2, we compute the gradient for each
update using 60 sentence pairs only, when    netuning
the model with the multi-way parallel corpus (either
pseudo or true.)

6.2.2 result and analysis

table 5 summarizes all the result. the most im-
portant observation is that the proposed    netuning
strategy with pseudo-parallel sentence pairs outper-
forms the pivot-based approach (using the early av-
eraging strategy from sec. 4.4) even when we used
only 1,000 such pairs (compare (b) and (d).) as we
increase the size of the pseudo-parallel corpus, we
observe a clear improvement. furthermore, these
models perform comparably to or better than the
single-pair model trained with 1m true parallel sen-
tence pairs, although they never saw a single true
bilingual sentence pair of spanish and french (com-
pare (a) and (d).) even when we trained a single-pair
model with 11m true parallel pairs, the model could
not match the multilingual model    netuned with 1m
true parallel pairs by achieving the translation qual-
ity of 24.26 id7 on the test set.

another interesting    nding is that it is only ben-
e   cial to use true parallel pairs for    netuning the
multi-way, mulitilingual models when there are
enough of them (1m or more). when there are only
a small number of true parallel sentence pairs, we
even found using pseudo pairs to be more bene   -
cial than true ones. this effective as more apparent,
when the direct one-to-one translation of the zero-
resource pair was considered (see (c) in table 5.)
this applies that the misalignment between the en-
coder and decoder can be largely    xed by using
pseudo-parallel pairs only, and we conjecture that it
is easier to learn from pseudo-parallel pairs as they
better re   ect the inductive bias of the trained model.
when there is a large amount of true parallel sen-
tence pairs available, however, our results indicate
that it is better to exploit them.

unlike we observed with the multi-source trans-
lation in sec. 3.2, we were not able to see any im-
provement by further averaging the early-averaged
and late-average decoding schemes (compare (d)

table 5: zero-resource translation from spanish (es) to french (fr) with    netuning. when pivot is    , english is used as a pivot
language. row (a) is from table 4 (b).

and (e).) this may be explained by the fact that the
context vectors computed when creating a pseudo
source (e.g., en from es when es   fr) already con-
tains all the information about the pseudo source. it
is simply enough to take those context vectors into
account via the early averaging scheme.

these results clearly indicate and verify the po-
tential of the multi-way, multilingual neural trans-
lation model in performing zero-resource machine
translation. more speci   cally, it has been shown that
the translation quality can be improved even without
any direct parallel corpus available, and if there is a
small amount of direct parallel pairs available, the
quality may improve even further.

7 conclusion:

implications and limitations

implications there are two main results in this
paper. first, we showed that the multi-way, multilin-
gual neural translation model by firat et al. (2016)
is able to exploit common, underlying structures
across many languages in order to better trans-
late when a source sentence is given in multi-
ple languages. this con   rms the usefulness of
positive language transfer, which has been be-
lieved to be an important factor in human language
learning (odlin, 1989; ringbom, 2007), in machine
translation. furthermore, our result signi   cantly
expands the applicability of multi-source transla-
tion (zoph and knight, 2016), as it does not assume
the availability of multi-way parallel corpora for
training.

second, the experiments on zero-resource trans-
lation revealed that it is not necessary to have a
direct parallel corpus, or deep linguistic knowl-
edge, between two languages in order to build a
machine translation system.
importantly we ob-
served that the proposed approach of zero-resource
translation is better both in terms of translation
quality and data ef   ciency than a more tradi-
tional pivot-based translation (wu and wang, 2007;
utiyama and isahara, 2007). considering that this
is the    rst attempt at such zero-resource, or ex-
tremely low-resource, translation using neural ma-
chine translation, we expect a large progress in near
future.

limitations despite the promising empirical re-
sults presented in this paper, there are a number
of shortcomings that needs to addressed in follow-
up research.
first, our experiments have been
done only with three european languages   spanish,
french and english. more investigation with a di-
verse set of languages needs to be done in order to
make a more solid conclusion, such as was done
in (firat et al., 2016; chung et al., 2016). further-
more, the effect of varying sizes of available parallel
corpora on the performance of zero-resource trans-
lation must be studied more in the future.

second, although the proposed many-to-one
translation is indeed generally applicable to any
number of source languages, we have only tested
a source sentence in two languages. we expect
even higher improvement with more languages, but
it must be tested thoroughly in the future.

lastly, the proposed    netuning strategy requires
the model to have an additional set of parameters rel-
evant to the attention mechanism for a target, zero-
resource pair. this implies that the number of pa-
rameters may grow linearly with respect to the num-
ber of target language pairs. we expect future re-
search to address this issue by, for instance, mix-
ing in the parallel corpora of high-resource language
pairs during    netuning as well.
