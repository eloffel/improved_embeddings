abstract

one major de   ciency of most semantic repre-
sentation techniques is that they usually model
a word type as a single point in the semantic
space, hence con   ating all the meanings that
the word can have. addressing this issue by
learning distinct representations for individ-
ual meanings of words has been the subject of
several research studies in the past few years.
however, the generated sense representations
are either not linked to any sense inventory or
are unreliable for infrequent word senses. we
propose a technique that tackles these prob-
lems by de-con   ating the representations of
words based on the deep knowledge it derives
from a semantic network. our approach pro-
vides multiple advantages in comparison to
the past work, including its high coverage and
the ability to generate accurate representations
even for infrequent word senses. we carry out
evaluations on six datasets across two seman-
tic similarity tasks and report state-of-the-art
results on most of them.

introduction

modeling the meanings of linguistic items in a
machine-interpretable form, i.e., semantic represen-
tation, is one of the oldest, yet most active, areas
of research in natural language processing (nlp).
the    eld has recently experienced a resurgence of
research interest with the new blood injected in its
veins by neural network-based models that view the
representation task as a id38 problem
and learn dense representations (usually referred to
as embeddings) by ef   ciently processing massive

amounts of texts. however, either in its conventional
count-based form (turney and pantel, 2010) or the
recent predictive approach, the prevailing objective
of representing each word type as a single point in
the semantic space has a major limitation: it ignores
the fact that words can have multiple meanings and
con   ates all these meanings into a single represen-
tation. this objective can have negative impacts on
accurate semantic modeling, e.g., semantically unre-
lated words that are synonymous to different senses
of a word are pulled towards each other in the se-
mantic space (neelakantan et al., 2014).

recently, there has been a growing interest in ad-
dressing the meaning con   ation de   ciency of word
representations. a series of techniques tend to as-
sociate a word to multiple points in the semantic
space by id91 its contexts in a given text cor-
pus and learning distinct representations for individ-
ual clusters (reisinger and mooney, 2010; huang
et al., 2012). though, these techniques usually as-
sume a    xed number of word senses per word type,
disregarding the fact that the number of senses of
a word can range from one (monosemy) to dozens.
neelakantan et al. (2014) tackled this issue by allow-
ing the number to be dynamically adjusted for each
word during training. however, the approach and
all the other id91-based techniques still suffer
from the fact that the computed sense representa-
tions are not linked to any sense inventory, a link-
ing which would require large amounts of sense-
annotated data (agirre et al., 2006).
in addition,
because of their dependence on knowledge derived
from a text corpus, these techniques are generally
unable to learn accurate representations for word

senses that are infrequent in the underlying corpus.
knowledge-based techniques tackle these issues
by deriving sense-speci   c knowledge from exter-
nal sense inventories, such as id138 (fellbaum,
1998), and learning representations that are linked
to the sense inventory. these approaches either use
sense de   nitions and employ word sense disam-
biguation (wsd) to gather sense-speci   c contexts
(chen et al., 2014; iacobacci et al., 2015) or take
advantage of the properties of id138, such as
synonymy and direct semantic relations (rothe and
sch  utze, 2015). however, the non-optimal wsd
techniques and the shallow utilization of knowl-
edge from id138 do not allow these techniques
to learn accurate and high-coverage semantic repre-
sentations for all senses in the inventory.

we propose a technique that de-con   ates a given
word representation into its constituent sense repre-
sentations by exploiting deep knowledge from the
semantic network of id138. our approach pro-
vides the following three main advantages in com-
parison to the past work: (1) our representations are
linked to the id138 sense inventory and, accord-
ingly, the number of senses for a word is a dynamic
parameter which matches that de   ned by id138;
(2) the deep exploitation of id138   s semantic net-
work allows us to obtain accurate semantic repre-
sentations, even for word senses that are infrequent
in generic text corpora; and (3) our methodology in-
volves only minimal parameter tuning and can be ef-
fectively applied to any sense inventory that is view-
able as a semantic network and to any word repre-
sentation technique. we evaluate our sense repre-
sentations in two tasks: word similarity (both in-
context and in-isolation) and cross-level semantic
similarity. experimental results show that the pro-
posed technique can provide consistently high per-
formance across six datasets, outperforming the re-
cent state of the art on most of them.

2 de-con   ated representations

preliminaries. our proposed approach takes a set
of pre-trained word representations and uses the
graph structure of a semantic lexical resource in or-
der to de-con   ate the representations into those of
word senses. therefore, our approach    rstly re-
quires a set of pre-trained word representations (e.g.,

id27s). any model that maps a given
word to a    xed-size vector representation (i.e., vec-
tor space model) can be used by our approach. in our
experiments, we opted for a set of publicly available
id27s (cf.   3.1).

secondly, we require a lexical resource whose se-
mantic relations allow us to view it as a graph g =
(v, e) where each vertex in the set of vertices v cor-
responds to a concept and edges in e denote lexico-
semantic relationships among these vertices. each
concept c     v is mapped to a set of word senses by
a mapping function   (c) : c     {s1, . . . , sl}. word-
net, the de facto community standard sense inven-
tory, is a suitable resource that satis   es these prop-
erties. id138 can be readily represented as a se-
mantic graph in which vertices are synsets and edges
are the semantic relations that connect these synsets
(e.g., hypernymy and meronymy). the mapping
function in id138 maps each synset to the set of
synonymous words it contains (i.e., word senses).

2.1 overview of the approach
our goal is to compute a semantic representation
that places a given word sense in an existing seman-
tic space of words. we achieve this by leveraging
word representations as well as the knowledge de-
rived from id138. the gist of our approach lies
in its computation of a list of sense biasing words for
a given word sense. to this end, we    rst analyze the
semantic network of id138 and extract a list of
most representative words that can effectively pin-
point the semantics of individual synsets (  2.2). we
then leverage an effective technique which learns se-
mantic representations for individual word senses by
placing the senses in the proximity of their corre-
sponding sense biasing words (  2.3).
2.2 determining sense biasing words
algorithm 1 shows the procedure we use to extract
from id138 a list of sense biasing words for a
given target synset yt. the algorithm receives as its
inputs the semantic graph of id138 and the map-
ping function   (  ), and outputs an ordered list of bi-
asing words bt for yt. the list comprises the most
semantically-related words to synset yt which can
best represent and pinpoint its meaning. we lever-
age a graph-based algorithm for the computation of
the sense biasing words.

speci   cally, we use the personalized id95
(haveliwala, 2002, ppr) algorithm which has been
extensively used by several nlp applications (yeh
et al., 2009; niemann and gurevych, 2011; agirre
et al., 2014). to this end, we    rst represent the se-
mantic network of id138 as a row-stochastic tran-
sition matrix m     rm  m where m is the number of
synsets in id138 (|v |). the cell mij of m is set
to the inverse of the degree of i if there is a seman-
tic relationship between synsets i and j and to zero
otherwise. we compute the ppr distribution for a
target synset yt by using the power iteration method
p t+1 = (1       )p 0 +   mp t, where    is the damp-
ing factor (usually set to 0.85) and p 0 is a one-hot
initialization vector with the corresponding dimen-
sion of yt being set to 1.0. the weight pi in line 5
is the value of the ith dimension of the ppr vector
p computed for the synset yt. this weight can be
seen as the importance of the corresponding synset
of the ith dimension (i.e., yi) to yt. when applied to
a semantic network, such as the id138 graph, this
importance can be interpreted as semantic relevance.
hence, the value of pi denotes the extent of seman-
tic relatedness between yi and yt. we use this no-
tion and retrieve a list of most semantically-related
words to yt. to achieve this, we sort the synsets
{y        v : y    (cid:54)= yt} according to their ppr values

tracted for the two senses of the noun digit:
the
numerical and the anatomical senses.1 we explain
in   2.3 how we use the sense biasing lists to learn
sense-speci   c representations. note that the size
of the list is equal to the total number of strings
in id138. however, we observed that taking a
very small portion of the top-ranking elements in the
lists is enough to generate representations that per-
form very similarly to those generated when using
the full-sized lists (please see   3.1).
2.3 learning sense representations
let v be the set of pre-trained d-dimensional word
representations. our objective here is to compute
a set v    = {v   
sn} of representations for n
word senses {s1, . . . , sn} in the same d-dimensional
semantic space of words. we achieve this for each
sense si by de-con   ating the representation vsi of
its corresponding lemma and biasing it towards the
representations of the words in bi. speci   cally, we
obtain a representation v   
si for a word sense si by
solving:

sentations (    v) of the lemma of si and the jth

k)2. the    rst term in for-
mula 1 requires the representation of the word sense
si (i.e., v   
si) to be similar to that of its corresponding
lemma, i.e., vsi, whereas the second term encour-
ages v   
si to be in the proximity of its biasing words
in the semantic space. the above criterion is simi-
lar to the frameworks of das and smith (2011) and
faruqui et al. (2015) which, though being convex, is
usually solved for ef   ciency reasons by an iterative
method proposed by bengio et al. (2007). follow-
ing these works, we obtain the below equation for
computing the representation of a word sense si:

tially an exponential decay function that gives more
importance to the top-ranking biasing words for si.
the hyperparameter    denotes the extent to which
v   
si is kept close to its corresponding lemma repre-
sentation vsi. following faruqui et al. (2015), we
set    to 1. the only parameter to be tuned in our
experiments is   . we discuss the tuning of this pa-
rameter in   3.1. the representation of a synset yi

comparison of the two types of linguistic items. in
  3.3 we evaluate our approach in the word to sense
similarity measurement framework.

we show in table 2 the closest words to the word
bass and two of its senses, music and    sh,2 in our
uni   ed semantic space. we can see in row #1 a mix-
ture of both meanings when the word representation
is used whereas the closest words to the senses (rows
#2 and #3) are mostly in-domain and speci   c to the
corresponding sense.

to exhibit another interesting property of our
sense representation approach, we depict in figure
1 the word digit and its numerical and anatomical
senses (from the example in table 1) in a 2-d seman-
tic space, along with a sample set of words in their
proximity.3 we can see that the word digit is placed
in the semantic space in the neighbourhood of words
from the numerical domain (lower left of the    gure),
mainly due the dominance (sanderson and van ri-
jsbergen, 1999) of this sense in the general-domain
corpus on which the id27s in our ex-
periments were trained (cf.   3.1). however, upon
de-con   ation, the emerging anatomical sense of the

as a result of this procedure, we obtain the set
v    of n sense representations in the same semantic
space as word representations in v. in fact, we now
have a uni   ed semantic space which enables a direct

word is shifted towards the region in the semantic
space which is occupied by anatomical words (up-
per right of the    gure). a id91-based sense
representation technique would have failed in accu-
rately representing the infrequent anatomical mean-
ing of digit by analyzing a general domain corpus
(such as the one used here). but our sense repre-
sentation technique, thanks to its proper usage of
knowledge from a sense inventory, is effective in
unveiling and accurately modeling less frequent or
domain-speci   c senses of a given word.

please note that any vector space model represen-
tation technique can be used for the pre-training of
word representations in v. also, the list of sense
biasing words can be obtained for larger sense in-
ventories, such as freebase (bollacker et al., 2008)
or babelnet (navigli and ponzetto, 2012). we leave
the exploration of other ways of computing sense bi-
asing words to the future work.

3 experiments
we benchmarked our sense representation approach
against several recent techniques on two standard
tasks: word similarity (  3.2), for which we eval-
uate on both in-isolation and in-context similarity
datasets, and cross-level semantic similarity (  3.3).
3.1 experimental setup
pre-trained word representations. as our word
representations, we used the 300-d id97
(mikolov et al., 2013) id27s trained on
the google news dataset4 mainly for their popular-
ity across different nlp applications. however, our
approach is equally applicable to any count-based
representation technique (baroni and lenci, 2010;
turney and pantel, 2010) or any other embedding
approach (pennington et al., 2014; lecun et al.,
2015). we leave the evaluation and comparison of
various word representation techniques with differ-
ent training approaches, objectives, and dimension-
alities to the future work.
parameter tuning. recall from   2.3 that our pro-
cedure for learning sense representations needs only
one parameter to be tuned, i.e.,   . we did not per-
form an extensive tuning on the value of this param-
eter and set its value to 1/5 after trying four differ-
4https://code.google.com/archive/p/id97/

ent values (1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10) on a small validation
dataset. we leave the more systematic tuning of the
parameter and the choice of alternative decay func-
tions (cf.   2.3) to the future work.
the size of the sense biasing words lists. also
recall from   2.2 that the extracted lists of sense bias-
ing words were originally as large as the total num-
ber of unique strings in id138 (around 150k in
ver. 3.0). but, given that we use an exponential de-
cay function in our learning algorithm (cf.   2.3),
the impact of the low-ranking words in the list is
negligible. in fact, we observed that taking a very
small portion of the top-ranking words, i.e., the top
25, produces similarity scores that are on par with
those generated when the full lists were considered.
therefore, we experimented with the down-sized
lists which enabled us to generate very quickly sense
representations for all word senses in id138.

3.2 word similarity
comparison systems. we compared our results
against nine other sense representation techniques:
the id138-based approaches of pilehvar and nav-
igli (2015), chen et al. (2014), rothe and sch  utze
(2015), jauhar et al. (2015), and iacobacci et
al. (2015) and the id91-based approaches of
huang et al. (2012), tian et al. (2014), neelakan-
tan et al. (2014), and liu et al. (2015) (please see
  4 for more details). we also compared against the
approach of faruqui et al. (2015) which uses knowl-
edge derived from id138 for improving word rep-
resentations. from the different con   gurations pre-
sented in (faruqui et al., 2015) we chose the sys-
tem that uses glove (pennington et al., 2014) with
all id138 relations which is their best perform-
ing monolingual system. as for the approach of
jauhar et al. (2015), we show the results of the
em+retero system which performs most consis-
tently across different datasets.
benchmarks. as our word similarity benchmark,
we considered    ve datasets: rg-65 (rubenstein and
goodenough, 1965), yp-130 (yang and powers,
2005), men-3k (bruni et al., 2014), siid113x-999
(hill et al., 2015, sl-999), and stanford contextual
word similarity (huang et al., 2012, scws). the
latter benchmark provides for each word a context
that triggers a speci   c meaning of the word, making

similarity measurement. for the scws dataset,
we follow the past works (reisinger and mooney,
2010; huang et al., 2012) and report the results ac-
cording to two system con   gurations: (1) avgsim:
where the similarity between two words is computed
as the average of all the pairwise similarities be-
tween their senses, and (2) avgsimc: where each
pairwise sense similarity is weighted by the rele-

vance of each sense to its corresponding context. for
all the other datasets, since words are not provided
with any context (they are in isolation), we measure
the similarity between two words as that between
their most similar senses. in all the experiments, we
use the cosine distance as our similarity measure.

3.2.1 experimental results

tables 4 and 3 show the results of our system, de-
conf, and the comparison systems on the scws
and the other four similarity datasets, respectively.
in both tables we also report the word vectors base-
line, whenever they are available, which is computed
by directly comparing the corresponding word rep-
resentations of the two words (    v). please note that
the word-based baseline does not apply to the ap-
proach of pilehvar and navigli (2015) as it is purely
based on the semantic network of id138 and does
not use any pre-trained id27s.

we can see from the tables that our sense rep-
resentations obtain considerable improvements over
those of words across the    ve datasets. this high-
lights the fact that the de-con   ation of word rep-
resentations into those of their individual meanings
has been highly bene   cial. on the scws dataset,
deconf outperforms all the recent state-of-the-art
sense representation techniques (in their best set-
tings) which proves the effectiveness of our ap-
proach in capturing the semantics of speci   c mean-

ings of the words. the improvement is consistent
across both system con   gurations (i.e., avgsim and
avgsimc). moreover, the state-of-the-art id138-
based approach of rothe and sch  utze (2015) uses
the same initial word vectors as deconf does (cf.
  3.1). hence, the improvement we obtain indicates
that our approach has made better use of the sense-
speci   c knowledge encoded in id138.

as seen in table 3 our approach shows competitve
performance on the other four datasets. the yp-130
dataset focuses on verb similarity, whereas siid113x-
999 contains verbs and adjectives and men-3k has
word pairs with different parts of speech (e.g., a
noun compared to a verb). the results we obtain on
these datasets exhibit the reliability of our approach
in modeling non-nominal word senses.

3.2.2 discussion

the similarity scale of the siid113x-999 dataset is
different from our other word similarity benchmarks
in that it assigns relatively low scores to antonymous
pairs. for instance, sunset-sunrise and man-woman
in this dataset are assigned the respective similari-
ties of 2.47 and 3.33 (in a [0, 10] similarity scale)
which is in the same range as the similarity between
word pairs with slight domain relatedness, such as
head-nail (2.47), air-molecule (3.05), or succeed-
try (3.98).
in fact we observed that tweaking the
similarity scale of our system in a way that it dimin-
ishes the similarity scores between antonyms can re-
sult in signi   cant performance improvement on this
dataset. to this end, we performed an experiment in
which the similarity of a word pair was simply di-
vided by    ve whenever the two words belonged to
synsets that were linked by the antonymy relation.
we observed that the performance on the siid113x-
999 dataset increased to 61.1 (from 54.2) and 59.0
(from 51.7) according to pearson (r    100) and
spearman (     100) correlation scores, respectively.
3.3 cross-level semantic similarity
in addition to the word similarity benchmark, we
evaluated the performance of our representations
in the cross-level semantic similarity measurement
framework. to this end, we opted for the semeval-
2014 task on cross-level semantic similarity (jur-
gens et al., 2014, clss). the word to sense similar-
ity subtask of this task, with 500 instances in its test

set, provides a suitable benchmark for the evaluation
of sense representation techniques.

for a word sense s and a word w, we compute the
similarity score according to four different strate-
gies:
the similarity of s to the most similar sense
of w (maxsim), the average similarity of s to indi-
vidual senses of w (avgsim), the direct similarity of
s to w when the latter is modeled as its word repre-
sentation (sense-to-word or s2w) or as the centroid
of its senses    representations (sense to aggregated
word senses or s2a). for this task, we can only com-
pare against the publicly-available sense representa-
tions of iacobacci et al. (2015), rothe and sch  utze
(2015), pilehvar and navigli (2015) and chen et al.
(2014) which are linked to the id138 sense inven-
tory.

3.3.1 experimental results

table 5 shows the results on the word to sense
dataset of the semeval-2014 clss task, according
to pearson (r) and spearman (  ) correlations and for
the four strategies. as can be seen from the low
overall performances, the task is a very challenging
benchmark with many id138 out-of-vocabulary
or slang terms and rare usages. despite this, de-
conf provides consistent improvement over the
comparison sense representation techniques accord-
ing to both measures and for all the strategies.

across the four strategies, s2a proves to be the
most effective for deconf and the representations
of rothe and sch  utze (2015). the representations of
chen et al. (2014) perform best with the s2w strat-
egy whereas those of iacobacci et al. (2015) do not
show a consistent trend with relatively low perfor-
mance across the four strategies. also, a comparison
of our results across the s2w and s2a strategies re-
veals that a word   s aggregated representation, i.e.,
the centroid of the representations of its senses, is
more accurate than its original word representation.
our analysis showed that the performances of the
approaches of rothe and sch  utze (2015) and ia-
cobacci et al. (2015) were hampered partly due to
their limited coverage. in fact, the former was un-
able to model around 35% of the synsets in id138
1.7.1, mainly for its shallow exploitation of knowl-
edge from id138, whereas the latter approach did
not cover around 15% of synsets in id138 3.0.
chen et al. (2014) provide near-full coverage for

table 5: evaluation results on the word to sense similarity test dataset of the semeval-14 task on cross-level semantic similarity,
according to pearson (r    100) and spearman (      100) correlations. we show results for four similarity computation strategies
(see   3.3). the best results per strategy are shown in bold whereas they are underlined for the best strategies per system. systems
marked with     are evaluated on a slightly smaller dataset (474 of the original 500 pairs) so as to have a fair comparison with rothe
and sch  utze (2015) and chen et al. (2014) that use older versions of id138 (1.7.1 and 1.7, respectively).

word senses in id138. however, the relatively
low performance of their system shows that the us-
age of glosses in id138 and the automated dis-
ambiguation have not resulted in accurate sense rep-
resentations. thanks to its deep exploitation of the
underlying resource, our approach provides full cov-
erage over all word senses and synsets in id138.
the three best-performing systems in the task are
meerkat ma   a (kashyap et al., 2014) (r = 37.5,
   = 39.3), simcompass (banea et al., 2014) (r =
35.4,    = 34.9), and semantiklue (proisl et al.,
2014) (r = 17.9,    = 18.8). please note that these
systems are speci   cally designed for the cross-level
similarity measurement task. for instance, the best-
ranking system in the task leverages a compilation
of several dictionaries, including the american her-
itage dictionary, wiktionary and id138, in order
to handle slang terms and rare usages, which leads to
its competitive performance (kashyap et al., 2014).

4 related work

learning semantic representations for individual
senses of words has been an active area of research
for the past few years. based on the way they view
the problem, the recent techniques can be classi   ed
into two main branches: (1) those that, similarly to
our work, extract knowledge from external sense in-
ventories for learning sense representations; and (2)
those techniques that cluster the contexts in which a
word appears in a given text corpus and learn distinct
representations for individual clusters.

examples for the    rst branch include the ap-

proaches of chen et al. (2014), jauhar et al. (2015)
and rothe and sch  utze (2015), all of which use
id138 as an external resource and obtain sense
representations for this sense inventory. chen et
al. (2014) uses the content words in the de   nition
of a word sense and wsd. however, the sole us-
age of glosses as sense-distinguishing contexts and
the non-optimal wsd make the approach inaccu-
rate, particularly for highly polysemous words with
similar senses and for word senses with short def-
initions. similarly, rothe and sch  utze (2015) use
only polysemy and synonymy properties of words
in id138 along with a small set of semantic re-
lations. this signi   cantly hampers the reliability of
the technique in providing high coverage (discussed
further in   3.3.1). our approach improves over these
works by exploiting deep knowledge from the se-
mantic network of id138, coupled with an effec-
tive training approach. adw (pilehvar and navigli,
2015) is another id138-based approach which ex-
ploits only the semantic network of this resource an
obtains interpretable sense representations. other
work in this branch include sensembed (iacobacci
et al., 2015) and nasari (camacho-collados et al.,
2015; camacho-collados et al., 2016) which are
based on the babelnet sense inventory (navigli
and ponzetto, 2012). the former technique    rst
disambiguates words in a given corpus with the
help of a knowledge-based wsd system and then
uses the generated sense-annotated corpus as train-
ing data for id97. nasari combines structural
knowledge from the semantic network of babelnet

with corpus statistics derived from wikipedia for
representing babelnet synsets. however, the ap-
proach falls short of modeling non-nominal senses
as wikipedia, due to its very encyclopedic nature,
does not cover verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.

the second branch, which is usually referred to
as multi-prototype representation, is often associ-
ated with id91. reisinger and mooney (2010)
proposed one of the recent pioneering techniques
in this branch. other prominent work in the cate-
gory include topical id27s (liu et al.,
2015) which use latent topic models for assigning
topics to each word in a corpus and learn topic-
speci   c word representations, and the technique pro-
posed by huang et al. (2012) which incorporates
   global document context.    tian et al. (2014) mod-
i   ed the skip-gram model in order to learn multi-
ple embeddings for each word type. despite the fact
that these techniques do not usually take advantage
of the knowledge encoded in structured knowledge
resource, they generally suffer from two disadvan-
tages. the    rst limitation is that they usually make
an assumption that a given word has a    xed number
of senses, ignoring the fact that polysemy is highly
dynamic across words that can range from monose-
mous to highly ambiguous with dozens of associ-
ated meanings (mccarthy et al., 2016). neelakan-
tan et al. (2014) tackled this issue by estimating the
number of senses for a word type during the learn-
ing process. however, all techniques in the second
branch suffer from another disadvantage that their
computed sense representations are not linked to any
sense inventory, a linking which itself would require
the existence of high coverage sense-annotated data
(agirre et al., 2006).

another notable line of research incorporates
knowledge from external resources, such as ppdb
(ganitkevitch et al., 2013) and id138, to improve
id27s (yu and dredze, 2014; faruqui et
al., 2015). neither of the two techniques however
provide representations for word senses.

5 conclusions

we put forward a sense representation technique,
namely deconf, that provides multiple advantages
in comparison to the recent state of the art: (1) the
number of word senses in our technique is    exi-

ble and the computed representations are linked to
word senses in id138; (2) deconf is effective
in providing accurate representation of word senses,
even for those senses that do not usually appear
frequently in generic text corpora; and (3) our ap-
proach is general in that it can be readily applied
to any set of word representations and any seman-
tic network without the need for extensive param-
eter tuning. our experimental results showed that
deconf can outperform recent state of the art on
several datasets across two tasks. we release our
computed representations for around 118k synsets
and 205k word senses in id138 3.0 at https:
//github.com/pilehvar/deconf. as fu-
ture work, we plan to investigate the possibility of
using larger semantic networks, such as freebase
and babelnet, which would also allow us to ap-
ply the technique to languages other than english.
we also plan to evaluate the performance of our ap-
proach with other decay functions as well as with
other initial word representations.
