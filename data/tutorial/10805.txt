abstract

canonical correlation analysis (cca) is a
method for reducing the dimension of data
represented using two views.
it has been
previously used to derive id27s,
where one view indicates a word, and the
other view indicates its context. we describe a
way to incorporate prior knowledge into cca,
give a theoretical justi   cation for it, and test it
by deriving id27s and evaluating
them on a myriad of datasets.

1 introduction

in recent years there has been an immense in-
terest
in representing words as low-dimensional
continuous real-vectors, namely id27s.
id27s aim to capture lexico-semantic
information such that regularities in the vocabulary
are topologically represented in a euclidean space.
such id27s have achieved state-of-the-
art performance on many natural language process-
ing (nlp) tasks, e.g., syntactic parsing (socher et
al., 2013), word or phrase similarity (mikolov et al.,
2013b), id33 (bansal et al., 2014),
unsupervised learning (parikh et al., 2014) and oth-
ers. since the discovery that id27s are
useful as features for various nlp tasks, research on
id27s has taken on a life of its own, with
a vibrant community searching for better word rep-
resentations in a variety of problems and datasets.

these id27s are often induced from
large raw text capturing distributional co-occurrence
information via neural networks (bengio et al.,
2003; mikolov et al., 2013b; mikolov et al.,
2013c) or id106 (deerwester et al., 1990;
dhillon et al., 2015). while these general pur-
pose id27s have achieved signi   cant im-

provement in various tasks in nlp, it has been dis-
covered that further tuning of these continuous word
representations for speci   c tasks improves their per-
formance by a larger margin. for example, in de-
pendency parsing, id27s could be tai-
lored to capture similarity in terms of context within
syntactic parses (bansal et al., 2014) or they could
be re   ned using semantic lexicons such as id138
(miller, 1995), framenet (baker et al., 1998) and
the paraphrase database (ganitkevitch et al., 2013)
to improve various similarity tasks (yu and dredze,
2014; faruqui et al., 2015; rothe and sch  utze,
2015). this paper proposes a method to encode prior
semantic knowledge in spectral id27s
(dhillon et al., 2015).

spectral learning algorithms are of great inter-
est for their speed, scalability, theoretical guaran-
tees and performance in various nlp applications.
these algorithms are no strangers to word embed-
dings either.
in latent semantic analysis (lsa,
(deerwester et al., 1990; landauer et al., 1998)),
id27s are learned by performing svd
on the word by document matrix. recently, dhillon
et al. (2015) have proposed to use canonical cor-
relation analysis (cca) as a method to learn low-
dimensional real vectors, called eigenwords. un-
like lsa based methods, cca based methods are
scale invariant and can capture multiview informa-
tion such as the left and right contexts of the words.
as a result, the eigenid27s of dhillon
et al. (2015) that were learned using the simple lin-
ear methods give accuracies comparable to or better
than state of the art when compared with highly non-
linear deep learning based approaches (collobert
and weston, 2008; mnih and hinton, 2007; mikolov
et al., 2013b; mikolov et al., 2013c).

the main contribution of this paper is a technique

to incorporate prior knowledge into the derivation of
canonical correlation analysis. in contrast to previ-
ous work where prior knowledge is introduced in the
off-the-shelf embeddings as a post-processing step
(faruqui et al., 2015; rothe and sch  utze, 2015), our
approach introduces prior knowledge in the cca
derivation itself.
in this way it preserves the the-
oretical properties of spectral learning algorithms
for learning id27s. the prior knowl-
edge is based on lexical resources such as id138,
framenet and the paraphrase database.

our derivation of cca to incorporate prior
knowledge is not limited to eigenwords and can be
used with cca for other problems. it follows a sim-
ilar idea to the one proposed by koren and carmel
(2003) for improving the visualization of principal
vectors with principal component analysis (pca).
our derivation represents the solution to cca as
that of an optimization problem which maximizes
the distance between the two view projections of
training examples, while weighting these distances
using the external source of prior knowledge. as
such, our approach applies to other uses of cca in
the nlp literature, such as the one of jagarlamudi
and daum  e (2012), who used cca for translitera-
tion, or the one of silberer et al. (2013), who used
cca for semantically representing visual attributes.

2 background and notation

for an integer n, we denote by [n] the set of integers
{1, . . . , n}. we assume the existence of a vocabu-
lary of words, usually taken from a corpus. this set
of words is denoted by h = {h1, . . . , h|h|}. for a
square matrix a, we denote by diag(a) a diagonal
matrix b which has the same dimensions as a such
that bii = aii for all i. for vector v     rd, we de-
i . we
also denote by vj or [v]j the jth coordinate of v. for
a pair of vectors u and v, we denote their dot product
by hu, vi.

note its    2 norm by ||v||, i.e. ||v|| =qpd

i=1 v2

we de   ne a id27 as a function f from
h to rm for some (relatively small) m. for exam-
ple, in our experiments we vary m between 50 and
300. the id27 function maps the word
to some real-vector representation, with the inten-
tion to capture regularities in the vocabulary that are
topologically represented in the corresponding eu-

clidean space. for example, all vocabulary words
that correspond to city names could be grouped to-
gether in that space.

research on the derivation of id27s
that capture various regularities has greatly accel-
erated in recent years. various methods used for
this purpose range from low-rank approximations
of co-occurrence statistics (deerwester et al., 1990;
dhillon et al., 2015) to neural networks jointly learn-
ing a language model (bengio et al., 2003; mikolov
et al., 2013a) or models for other nlp tasks (col-
lobert and weston, 2008).

3 canonical correlation analysis for

deriving id27s

one recent approach to derive id27s,
developed by dhillon et al. (2015), is through the
use of canonical correlation analysis, resulting in so-
called    eigenwords.    cca is a technique for multi-
view id84.
it assumes the ex-
istence of two views for a set of data, similarly to
co-training (yarowsky, 1995; blum and mitchell,
1998), and then projects the data in the two views
in a way that maximizes the correlation between the
projected views.

dhillon et al. (2015) used cca to derive word
embeddings through the following procedure. they
   rst break each document in a corpus of documents
into n sequences of words of a    xed length 2k + 1,
where k is a window size. for example, if k = 2,
the short document    harry potter has been a best-
seller    would be broken into    harry potter has been
a    and    potter has been a best-seller.    in each such
sequence, the middle word is identi   ed as a pivot.

this

leads

1 , . . . , w(i)

k , w(i), w(i)

to the construction of

the fol-
lowing training set
from a set of documents:
k+1, . . . , w(i)
{(w(i)
2k ) | i     [n]}.
with abuse of notation, this is a multiset, as cer-
tain words are expected to appear in certain contexts
multiple times. each w(i) is a pivot word, and the
rest of the elements are words in the sequence called
   the context words.    with this training set in mind,
the two views for cca are de   ned as following.

we de   ne the    rst view through a sparse    context
matrix    c     rn  2k|h| such that each row in the
matrix is a vector, consisting of 2k one-hot vectors,
each of length |h|. each such one-hot vector corre-

figure 1: the word and context views represented as ma-
trix w and c. each row in w is a vector of length |h|,
corresponding to a one-hot vector for the word in the ex-
ample indexed by the row. each row in c is a vector
of length 2k|h|, divided into sub-vectors each of length
|h|. each such sub-vector is a one-hot vector for one of
the 2k context words in the example indexed by the row.

sponds to a word that    red in a speci   c index in the
context. in addition, we also de   ne a second view
through a matrix w     rn  |h| such that wij = 1 if
w(i) = hj. we present both views of the training set
in figure 1.

note that now the matrix m = w    c is in
r|h|  (2k|h|) such that each element mij gives the
count of times that hi appeared with the correspond-
ing context word and context index encoded by j.

1 m d   1/2

similarly, we de   ne a matrix d1 = diag(w    w )
and d2 = diag(c    c). finally, to get the word em-
beddings, we perform singular value decomposition
(svd) on the matrix d   1/2
. note that in
its original form, cca requires use of w    w and
c    c in their full form, and not just the correspond-
ing diagonal matrices d1 and d2; however, in prac-
tice, inverting these matrices can be quite intensive
computationally and can lead to memory issues. as
such, we approximate cca by using the diagonal
matrices d1 and d2.

from the svd step, we get two projections u    

r|h|  m and v     r2k|h|  m such that

d   1/2

    u   v

1 m d   1/2

where        rm  m is a diagonal matrix with
  ii > 0 being the ith largest singular value of
d   1/2
. in order to get the    nal word em-
beddings, we calculate d   1/2
u     r|h|  m. each
row in this matrix corresponds to an m-dimensional
vector for the corresponding word in the vocabulary.
this means that f (hi) for hi     h is the ith row of
the matrix d   1/2
u. the projection v can be used
to get    context embeddings.    see more about this in
dhillon et al. (2015).

this use of cca to derive id27s
follows the usual distributional hypothesis (harris,
1957) that most id27s techniques rely
on.
in the case of cca, this hypothesis is trans-
lated into action in the following way. cca    nds
projections for the contexts and for the pivot words
which are most correlated. this means that if a word
co-occurs in a speci   c context many times (either
directly, or transitively through similarity to other
words), then this context is expected to be projected
to a point    close    to the point to which the word is
projected. as such, if two words occur in a speci   c
context many times, these two words are expected to
be projected to points which are close to each other.
for the next section, we denote x = w d   1/2
and y = cd   1/2
. to refer to the dimensions of
x and y generically, we denote d = |h| and d    =
2k|h|. in addition, we refer to the column vectors
of u and v as u1, . . . , um and v1, . . . , vm.

mathematical intuition behind cca the pro-
cedure that cca follows    nds a projection of the
two views in a shared space, such that the correla-
tion between the two views is maximized at each co-
ordinate, and there is minimal redundancy between
the coordinates of each view. this means that cca
solves the following sequence of optimization prob-
lems for j     [m] where aj     r1  d and bj     r1  d   :

arg max
aj ,bj
such that

corr(ajw    , bj c    )

corr(ajw    , akw    ) = 0,
corr(bj c    , bkc    ) = 0,

k < j

k < j

where corr is a function that accepts two vectors
and return the pearson correlation between the pair-
wise elements of the two vectors. the approxi-
mate solution to this optimization problem (when
using diagonal d1 and d2) is   a   
ui and
i = d   1/2
  b   
cca also has a probabilistic interpretation as a
maximum likelihood solution of a latent variable
model for two normal random vectors, each drawn
based on a third latent gaussian vector (bach and
jordan, 2005).

the way we describe cca for deriving word
embeddings is related to id45
(lsi), which performs singular value decomposition
on the matrix m directly, without doing any kind
of variance id172. dhillon et al. (2015) de-
scribe some differences between lsi and cca. the
extra id172 step decreases the importance of
frequent words when doing svd.

4 incorporating prior knowledge into

canonical correlation analysis

in this section, we detail the technique we use to
incorporate prior knowledge into the derivation of
canonical correlation analysis. the main motiva-
tion behind our approach is to improve the opti-
mization of correlation between the two views by
weighing them using the external source of prior
knowledge. the prior knowledge is based on lex-
ical resources such as id138, framenet and the
paraphrase database. our approach follows a sim-
ilar idea to the one proposed by koren and carmel
(2003) for improving the visualization of principal
vectors with principal component analysis (pca). it
is also related to laplacian manifold id173
(belkin et al., 2006).

an important notion in our derivation is that of a
laplacian matrix. the laplacian of an undirected
weighted graph is an n    n matrix where n is the
number of nodes in the graph. it equals d   a where
a is the adjacency matrix of the graph (so that aij is
the weight for the edge (i, j) in the graph, if it exists,
and 0 otherwise) and d is a diagonal matrix such

that dii =pj aij. the laplacian is always a sym-

metric square matrix such that the sum over rows (or
columns) is 0. it is also positive semi-de   nite.

we propose a generalization of cca, in which we

introduce a laplacian matrix into the derivation of
cca itself, as shown in figure 2. we encode prior
knowledge about the distances between the projec-
tions of two views into the laplacian. the laplacian
allows us to improve the optimization of the correla-
tion between the two views by weighing them using
the external source of prior knowledge.

4.1 generalization of cca
we present three lemmas (proofs are given in ap-
pendix a), followed by our main proposition. these
three lemmas are useful to prove our    nal proposi-
tion.

the main proposition shows that cca maximizes
the distance between the two view projections for
any pair of examples i and j, i 6= j, while mini-
mizing the two view projection distance for the two
views of an example i. the two views we discuss
here in practice are the view of the word through
a one-hot representation, and the view which repre-
sents the context words for a speci   c word token.
the distance between two view projections is de-
   ned in eq. 2.
lemma 1. let x and y be two matrices of size n  d
and n    d   , respectively, for example, as de   ned in
i=1 xij = 0 for j     [d] and
i=1 yij = 0 for j     [d   ]. let l be an n    n

then x    ly equals x    y up to a multiplication by
a positive constant.
lemma 2. let a     rd  d   . then the rank m thin-
svd of a can be found by solving the following op-
timization problem:

and vi     rd     1 denote the right singular vectors.

figure 2: introducing prior knowledge in cca. w     rn  d and c     rn  d    denote the word and context views
respectively. l     rn  n is a laplacian matrix encoded with the prior knowledge about the distances between the
projections of w and c.

the last utility lemma we describe shows that in-
terjecting the laplacian between the two views can
be expressed as a weighted sum of the distances be-
tween the projections of the two views (these dis-
tances are given in eq. 2), where the weights come
from the laplacian.
lemma 3. let u1, . . . , um and v1, . . . , vm be two
sets of vectors of length d and d    respectively. let
l     rn  n be a laplacian and x     rn  d and y    
rn  d   . then:

equalspm
to maximization ofpm

proof. according to lemma 3, the objective in eq. 3
k=1(xuk)   l(y vk) where l is de   ned as
in eq. 1. therefore, maximizing eq. 3 corresponds
k=1(xuk)   l(y vk) under the
constraints that the u and v matrices have orthonor-
mal vectors. using lemma 2, it can be shown that
the solution to this maximization is done by doing
singular value decomposition on x    ly . accord-
ing to lemma 1, this corresponds to    nding u and
v by doing singular value decomposition on x    y ,
because a multiplicative constant does not change
the value of the right/left singular vectors.

the above proposition shows that cca tries to
   nd projections of both views such that the distances
between the two views for pairs of examples with in-
dices i 6= j are maximized (   rst term in eq. 3), while

minimizing the distance between the projections of
the two views for a speci   c example (second term
in eq. 3). therefore, cca tries to project a context
and a word in that context to points that are close to
each other in a shared space, while maximizing the
distance between a context and a word which do not
often co-occur together.

as long as l is a laplacian, proposition 4 is still

true, only with the maximization of the objective

xi,j

   lij(cid:0)dm
ij(cid:1)2

,

(4)

where lij     0 for i 6= j and lii     0. this result
lends itself to a generalization of cca, in which we
use prede   ned weights for the laplacian that encode
some prior knowledge about the distances that the
projections of two views should satisfy.

if the weight    lij is large for a speci   c (i, j),
then we will try harder to maximize the distance be-
tween one view of example i and the other view of
example j (i.e. we will try to project the word w(i)
and the context of example j into distant points in
the space).

this means that in the current formulation,    lij
plays the role of a dissimiliarity indicator between
pairs of words. the more dissimilar words are, the
larger the weight, and then the more distant the pro-
jections are for the contexts and the words.

4.2 from cca with dissimilarities to cca

with similarities

it is often more convenient to work with similarity
measures between pairs of words. to do that, we
can retain the same formulation as before with the
laplacian, where    lij now denotes a measure of
similarity. now, instead of maximizing the objective
in eq. 4, we are required to minimize it.

it can be shown that such mirror formulation can
be done with an algorithm similar to cca, leading
to a proposition in the style of proposition 4. to
solve this minimization formulation, we just need
to choose the singular vectors associated with the
smallest m singular values (instead of the largest).

once we change the cca algorithm with the
laplacian to choose these projections, we can de-
   ne l, for example, based on a similarity graph. the
graph is an undirected graph that has |h| nodes, for

each word in the vocabulary, and there is an edge be-
tween a pair of words whenever the two words are
similar to each other based on some external source
of information, such as id138 (for example, if
they are synonyms).

we then de   ne the laplacian l such that lij =
   1 if i and j are adjacent in the graph (and i 6= j),
lii is the degree of the node i and lij = 0 in all
other cases. by using this variant of cca, we strive
to maximize the distance of the two views between
words which are adjacent in the graph (or continuing
the example above, maximize the distance between
words which are not synonyms).
in addition, the
fewer adjacent nodes a word has (or the more syn-
onyms it has), the less important it is to minimize the
distance between the two views of that given word.

4.3 final algorithm
in order to use an arbitrary laplacian matrix with
cca, we require that the data is centered, i.e. that
the average over all examples of each of the coordi-
nates of the word and context vectors is 0. however,
such a prerequisite would make the matrices c and
w dense (with many non-zero values), and hard to
maintain in memory, and would also make singular
value decomposition inef   cient.

as such, we do not center the data to keep it
sparse, and as such, use a matrix l which is not
strictly a laplacian, but that behaves better in prac-
tice.1 given the graph mentioned in   4 which is ex-
tracted from an external source of information, we
use l such that lij =    for an        (0, 1) which
is treated as a smoothing factor for the graph (see
below the choices of   ) if i and j are not adjacent
in the graph, lij = 0 if i 6= j are adjacent, and
   nally lii = 1 for all i     [n]. therefore, this ma-
trix is symmetric, and the only constraint it does not
satisfy is that of rows and columns summing to 0.

scanning the documents and calculating the
statistic matrix with the laplacian is computation-
ally infeasible with a large number of tokens given
as input.
it is quadratic in that number. as such,
we make another modi   cation to the algorithm, and
calculate a    local    laplacian. the modi   cation re-
quires an integer n as input (we use n = 12),
and then it makes updates to pairs of word tokens
only if they are within an n-sized window of each.
the    nal algorithm we use is described in figure 3.
the algorithm works by directly computing the co-
occurrence matrix m (instead of maintaining w and
c). it does so by increasing by 1 any cells corre-
sponding to word-context co-occurrence in the doc-
uments and by    any cells corresponding to word
and contexts that are connected in the graph.

5 experiments

in this section we describe our experiments.

5.1 experimental setup
training data we used three datasets, wiki1,
wiki2 and wiki5, all based on the    rst 1, 2 and

1we note that other decompositions, such as pca, also re-
quire centering of the data, but in case of sparse data matrix,
this step is not performed.

5 billion words from wikipedia respectively.2 each
dataset is broken into chunks of length 13 (window
sizes of 6), corresponding to a document. the above
laplacian l is calculated within each document sep-
arately. this means that    lij is 1 only if i and j
denote two words that appear in the same document.
this is done to make the calculations computation-
ally feasible. we calculate id27s for the
top most frequent 200k words.

prior knowledge resources we consider three
sources of prior knowledge: id138 (miller,
1995), the paraphrase database of ganitkevitch et
al. (2013), abbreviated as ppdb,3 and framenet
(baker et al., 1998). since framenet and id138
index words in their base form, we use id138   s
stemmer to identify the base form for the text in our
corpora whenever we calculate the laplacian graph.
for id138, we have an edge in the graph if one
word is a synonym, hypernym or hyponym of the
other. for ppdb, we have an edge if one word is
a paraphrase of the other, according to the database.
for framenet, we connect two words in the graph if
they appear in the same frame.

system implementation we modi   ed the imple-
mentation of the swell java package4 of dhillon
et al. (2015). speci   cally, we needed to modify the
loop that iterates over words in each document to a
nested loop that iterates over pairs of words, in or-

der to compute a sum of the formpij xrilijyjs.5

dhillon et al. (2015) use window size k = 2, which
we retain in our experiments.6

5.2 baselines
off-the-shelf id27s we compare
our id27s with existing state-of-the-

calculated are available at http://cohort.inf.ed.ac.

dhillon et al. (2015) which controls the variance in the counts
accumulated from the corpus. see a justi   cation for this trans-
form in stratos et al. (2015).

table 1: results for the word similarity datasets, geographic analogies and np bracketing. the    rst upper blocks
(a   c) present the results with retro   tting. npk stands for no prior knowledge (no retro   tting is used), wn for
id138, pd for ppdb and fn for framenet. glove, skip-gram, global context, multilingual and eigen are the
id27s of pennington et al. (2014), mikolov et al. (2013b), huang et al. (2012), faruqui and dyer (2014)
and dhillon et al. (2015) respectively. the second middle blocks (d   f) show the results of our eigenid27s
encoded with prior knowledge using our method. each row in the block corresponds to a speci   c use of an    value
(smoothing factor), as described in figure 3. in the lower blocks (g   i) we take the id27s from the second
block, and retro   t them using the method of faruqui et al. (2015). best results in each block are in bold.

art id27s, such as glove (pennington
et al., 2014), skip-gram (mikolov et al., 2013b),
global context (huang et al., 2012) and multilin-
gual (faruqui and dyer, 2014). we also compare our
id27s with the eigen id27s
of dhillon et al. (2015) without any prior knowl-
edge.

retro   tting for prior knowledge we compare
our approach of incorporating prior knowledge into
the derivation of cca against the previous works
where prior knowledge is introduced in the off-the-
shelf embeddings as a post-processing step (faruqui
et al., 2015; rothe and sch  utze, 2015). in this pa-
per, we focus on the retro   tting approach of faruqui
et al. (2015).

retro   tting works by optimizing an objective
function which has two terms: one that tries to keep
the distance between the word vectors close to the
original distances, and the other which enforces the
vectors of words which are adjacent in the prior
id13 to be close to each other in the new

embedding space. we use the retro   tting package7
to compare our results in different settings against
the results of retro   tting of faruqui et al. (2015).

5.3 evaluation benchmarks

we evaluated the quality of our eigenword embed-
dings on three different tasks: word similarity, geo-
graphic analogies and np bracketing.

word similarity for the word similarity task we
experimented with 11 different widely used bench-
marks. the ws-353-all dataset (finkelstein et
al., 2002) consists of 353 pairs of english words
with their human similarity ratings. later, agirre et
al. (2009) re-annotated ws-353-all for similarity
(ws-353-sim) and relatedness (ws-353-rel) with
speci   c distinctions between them. the siid113x-
999 dataset (hill et al., 2015) was built to measure
how well models capture similarity, rather than relat-
edness or association. the men-tr-3000 dataset
(bruni et al., 2014) consists of 3000 word pairs

retrofitting.

sampled from words that occur at least 700 times
in a large web corpus. the datasets, mturk-287
(radinsky et al., 2011) and mturk-771 (halawi
et al., 2012), were scored by amazon mechanical
turk workers for relatedness of english word pairs.
the yp-130 (yang and powers, 2005) and verb-143
(baker et al., 2014) datasets were developed for verb
similarity predictions. the last two datasets, mc-30
(miller and charles, 1991) and rg-65 (rubenstein
and goodenough, 1965) consist of 30 and 65 noun
pairs respectively.

for each dataset, we calculate the cosine similar-
ity between the vectors of word pairs and measure
spearman   s rank correlation coef   cient between the
scores produced by the embeddings and human rat-
ings. we report the average of the correlations on all
11 datasets. each word similarity task in the above
list represents a different aspect of word similarity,
and as such, averaging the results points to the qual-
ity of the id27s on several tasks. we
later analyze speci   c datasets.

geographic analogies mikolov et al. (2013c)
created a test set of analogous word pairs such as
a:b c:d raising the analogy question of the form    a
    where d is unknown. we report
is to b as c is to
results on a subset of this dataset which focuses on
   nding capitals of common countries, e.g., greece
is to athens as iraq is to
. this dataset consists
of 506 word pairs. for given word pairs, a:b c:d
where d is unknown, we use the vector offset method
(mikolov et al., 2013b), i.e., we compute a vector
v = vb     va + vc where va, vb and vc are vector
representations of the words a, b and c respectively;
we then return the word d with the greatest cosine
similarity to v.

np bracketing here the goal is to identify the
correct bracketing of a three-word noun (lazaridou
et al., 2013). for example, the bracketing of annual
(price growth) is    right,    while the bracketing of (en-
try level) machine is    left.    similarly to faruqui and
dyer (2015), we concatenate the word vectors of the
three words, and use this vector for binary classi   -
cation into left or right.

since most of the datasets that we evaluate on in
this paper are not standardly separated into develop-
ment and test sets, we report all results we calculated
(with respect to hyperparameter differences) and do

not select just a subset of the results.

5.4 evaluation
preliminary experiments
in our    rst set of ex-
periments, we vary the dimension of the word em-
bedding vectors. we try m     {50, 100, 200, 300}.
our experiments showed that the results consistently
improve when the dimension increases for all the
different datasets. for example, for m = 50 and
wiki1, we get an average of 46.4 on the word sim-
ilarity tasks, 50.1 for m = 100, 53.4 for m = 200
and 54.2 for m = 300. the more data are available,
the more likely larger dimension will improve the
quality of the id27s. indeed, for wiki5,
we get an average of 49.4, 54.9, 57.0 and 59.5 for
each of the dimensions. the improvements with re-
spect to the dimension are consistent across all of
our results, so we    x m at 300.

we also noticed a consistent improvement in ac-
curacy when using more data from wikipedia. for
example, for m = 300, using wiki1 gives an av-
erage of 54.1, while using wiki2 gives an average
of 54.9 and    nally, using wiki5 gives an average of
59.5. we    x the dataset we use to be wiki5.

results table 1 describes the results from our    rst
set of experiments. (note that the table is divided
into 9 distinct blocks, labeled a through i.) in gen-
eral, adding prior knowledge to eigenword embed-
dings does improve the quality of word vectors for
the word similarity, geographic analogies and np
bracketing tasks on several occasions (blocks d   f
compared to last row in blocks a   c). for example,
our eigenword vectors encoded with prior knowl-
edge (ccaprior) consistently perform better than
the eigenword vectors that do not have any prior
knowledge for the word similarity task (59.5, eigen
in the    rst row under npk column, versus block d).
the only exceptions are for    = 0.1 with word-
net (59.1), for    = 0.7 with ppdb (59.3) and for
   = 0.9 with framenet (58.9), where    denotes the
smoothing factor.

in several cases, running the retro   tting algorithm
of faruqui et al. (2015) on top of our word embed-
dings helps further, as if    adding prior knowledge
twice is better than once.    results for these word
embeddings (ccaprior+rf) are shown in table 1.
adding retro   tting to our encoding of prior knowl-

edge often performs better for word similarity and
np bracketing tasks (block d versus g and block f
versus i). interestingly, ccaprior+rf embeddings
also often perform better than eigenword vectors
(eigen) of dhillon et al. (2015) when retro   tted
using the method of faruqui et al. (2015). for
example, in the word similarity task, eigenwords
retro   tted with id138 get an accuracy of 62.2
whereas encoding prior knowledge using both cca
and retro   tting gets a maximum accuracy of 63.3.
we see the same pattern for ppdb, with 63.6 for
   eigen    and 64.9 for    ccaprior+rf   . we hypoth-
esize that the reason for these changes is that the
two methods for encoding prior knowledge maxi-
mize different objective functions.

the performance with framenet is weaker, in
some cases leading to worse performance (e.g., with
glove and sg vectors). we believe that framenet
does not perform as well as the other lexicons be-
cause it groups words based on very abstract con-
cepts; often words with seemingly distantly related
meanings (e.g., push and growth) can evoke the
same frame. this also supports the    ndings of
faruqui et al. (2015), who noticed that the use of
framenet as a prior knowledge resource for improv-
ing the quality of id27s is not as helpful
as other resources such as id138 and ppdb.

we note that cca works especially well for the
geographic analogies dataset. the quality of eigen-
id27s (and the other embeddings) de-
grades when we encode prior knowledge using the
method of faruqui et al. (2015). our method im-
proves the quality of eigenid27s.

global picture of the results when comparing
retro   tting to cca with prior knowledge, there is
a noticable difference. retro   tting performs well
or badly, depending on the dataset, while the re-
sults with cca are more stable. we attribute this
to the difference between how our algorithm and
retro   tting work. retro   tting makes a direct use of
the source of prior knowledge, by adding a regular-
ization term that enforces words which are similar
according to the prior knowledge to be closer in the
embedding space. our algorithm, on the other hand,
makes a more indirect use of the source of prior
knowledge, by changing the co-occurence matrix on
which we do singular value decomposition.

speci   cally, we believe that our algorithm is more
stable to cases in which words for the task at hand
are unknown words with respect to the source of
prior knowledge. this is demonstrated with the ge-
ographical analogies task: in that case, retro   tting
lowers the results in most cases. the city and coun-
try names do not appear in the sources of prior
knowledge we used.

further analysis we further inspected the results
on the word similarity tasks for the rg-65 and ws-
353-all datasets. our goal was to    nd cases in
which either cca embeddings by themselves out-
perform other types of embeddings or that encoding
prior knowledge into cca the way we describe sig-
ni   cantly improves the results.

for the ws-353-all dataset, the eigenword em-
beddings get a correlation of 69.6. the next best
performing id27s are the multilingual
id27s (68.0) and skip-gram (58.3). in-
terestingly enough, the id73 embed-
dings also use cca to project words into a low-
dimensional space using a linear transformation,
suggesting that linear projections are a good    t for
the ws-353-all dataset. the dataset itself includes
pairs of common words with a corresponding simi-
larity score. the words that appear in the dataset
are actually expected to occur in similar contexts, a
property that cca directly encodes when deriving
id27s.

the best performance on the rg-65 dataset is
with the glove id27s (76.6). cca em-
beddings give an accuracy of 69.7 on that dataset.
however, with this dataset, we observe signi   cant
improvement when encoding prior knowledge using
our method. for example, using id138 with this
dataset improves the results by 4.2 points (73.9). us-
ing the method of faruqui et al. (2015) (with word-
net) on top of our cca id27s improves
the results even further by 8.7 points (78.4).

the role of prior knowledge we also designed
an experiment to test whether using distributional in-
formation is necessary for having well-performing
id27s, or whether it is suf   cient to rely
on the prior knowledge resource.
in order to test
this, we created a sparse matrix that corresponds to
the graph based on the external resource graph. we
then follow up with singular value decomposition on

that graph, and get embeddings of size 300. table 2
gives the results when using these embeddings. we
see that the results are consistently lower than the
results that appear in table 1, implying that the use
of prior knowledge comes hand in hand with the
use of distributional information. when using the
retro   tting method by faruqui et al. on top of these
id27s, the results barely improved.

6 related work

our ideas in this paper for encoding prior knowl-
edge in eigenid27s relate to three main
threads in existing literature.

one of the threads focuses on modifying the ob-
jective of word vector training algorithms. yu and
dredze (2014), xu et al. (2014), fried and duh
(2015) and bian et al. (2014) augment the training
objective in neural language models of mikolov et
al. (2013a) to encourage semantically related word
vectors to come closer to each other. wang et al.
(2014) propose a method for jointly embedding en-
tities (from freebase, a large community-curated
knowledge base) and words (from wikipedia) into
the same continuous vector space. chen and de
melo (2015) propose a similar joint model to im-
prove the id27s, but rather than us-
ing structured knowledge sources their model fo-
cuses on discovering stronger semantic connections
in speci   c contexts in a text corpus.

another research thread relies on post-processing
steps to encode prior knowledge from semantic lex-
icons in off-the-shelf id27s. the main
intuition behind this trend is to update word vec-
tors by running belief propagation on a graph ex-
tracted from the relation information in semantic
lexicons. the retro   tting approach of faruqui et
al. (2015) uses such techniques to obtain higher

quality semantic vectors using id138, framenet,
and the paraphrase database. they report on how
retro   tting helps improve the performance of vari-
ous off-the-shelf word vectors such as glove, skip-
gram, global context, and multilingual, on vari-
ous word similarity tasks. rothe and sch  utze (2015)
also describe how standard word vectors can be ex-
tended to various data types in semantic lexicons,
e.g., synsets and lexemes in id138.

most of the standard word vector training algo-
rithms use co-occurrence within window-based con-
texts to measure relatedness among words. sev-
eral studies question the limitations of de   ning re-
latedness in this way and investigate if the word
co-occurrence matrix can be constructed to encode
prior knowledge directly to improve the quality of
word vectors. wang et al. (2015) investigate the no-
tion of relatedness in embedding models by incor-
porating syntactic and lexicographic knowledge. in
spectral learning, yih et al. (2012) augment the word
co-occurrence matrix on which lsa operates with
relational information such that synonyms will tend
to have positive cosine similarity, and antonyms will
tend to have negative similarities. their vector space
representation successfully projects synonyms and
antonyms on opposite sides in the projected space.
chang et al. (2013) further generalize this approach
to encode multiple relations (and not just opposing
relations, such as synonyms and antonyms) using
multi-relational lsa.

in spectral learning, most of the studies on in-
corporating prior knowledge in word vectors focus
on lsa based id27s (yih et al., 2012;
chang et al., 2013; turney and littman, 2005; tur-
ney, 2006; turney and pantel, 2010).

from the technical perspective, our work is also
related to that of jagarlamudi et al. (2011), who
showed how to generalize cca so that it uses lo-
cality preserving projections (he and niyogi, 2004).
they also assume the existence of a weight matrix
in a multi-view setting that describes the distances
between pairs of points in the two views.

more generally, cca is an important component
for spectral learning algorithms in the unsupervised
setting and with latent variables (cohen et al., 2014;
narayan and cohen, 2016; stratos et al., 2016). our
method for incorporating prior knowledge into cca
could potentially be transferred to these algorithms.

7 conclusion

we described a method for incorporating prior
knowledge into cca. our method requires a rela-
tively simple change to the original canonical cor-
relation analysis, where extra counts are added to
the matrix on which singular value decomposition is
performed. we used our method to derive word em-
beddings in the style of eigenwords, and tested them
on a set of datasets. our results demonstrate several
advantages of encoding prior knowledge into eigen-
id27s.

appears in koren and carmel (2003) for lemma 3.1.
