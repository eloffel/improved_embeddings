abstract

recently, neural networks have achieved great
success on sentiment classi   cation due to their
ability to alleviate feature engineering. how-
ever, one of the remaining challenges is to
model long texts in document-level sentiment
classi   cation under a recurrent architecture
because of the de   ciency of the memory unit.
to address this problem, we present a cached
long short-term memory neural networks
(clstm) to capture the overall semantic in-
formation in long texts. clstm introduces
a cache mechanism, which divides memory
into several groups with different forgetting
rates and thus enables the network to keep
sentiment information better within a recur-
rent unit. the proposed clstm outperforms
the state-of-the-art models on three publicly
available document-level id31
datasets.

introduction

sentiment classi   cation is one of the most widely
used natural
language processing techniques in
many areas, such as e-commerce websites, online
social networks, political orientation analyses (wil-
son et al., 2009; o   connor et al., 2010), etc.

recently, deep learning approaches (socher et al.,
2013; kim, 2014; chen et al., 2015; liu et al., 2016)
have gained encouraging results on sentiment clas-
si   cation, which frees researchers from handcrafted
feature engineering. among these methods, recur-
rent neural networks (id56s) are one of the most

    corresponding author.

prevalent architectures because of the ability to han-
dle variable-length texts.

sentence- or paragraph-level id31
expects the model to extract features from limited
source of information, while document-level senti-
ment analysis demands more on selecting and stor-
ing global sentiment message from long texts with
noises and redundant local pattern. simple id56s
are not powerful enough to handle the over   ow and
to pick up key sentiment messages from relatively
far time-steps .

efforts have been made to solve such a scalabil-
ity problem on long texts by extracting semantic in-
formation hierarchically (tang et al., 2015a; tai et
al., 2015), which    rst obtain sentence representa-
tions and then combine them to generate high-level
document embeddings. however, some of these so-
lutions either rely on explicit a priori structural as-
sumptions or discard the order information within
a sentence, which are vulnerable to sudden change
or twists in texts especially a long-range one (mc-
donald et al., 2007; mikolov et al., 2013). re-
current models match people   s intuition of reading
word by word and are capable to model the intrinsic
relations between sentences. by keeping the word
order, id56s could extract the sentence representa-
tion implicitly and meanwhile analyze the semantic
meaning of a whole document without any explicit
boundary.

partially inspired by neural structure of human
brain and computer system architecture, we present
the cached long short-term memory neural net-
works (clstm) to capture the long-range senti-
ment information. in the dual store memory model

proposed by atkinson and shiffrin (1968), memo-
ries can reside in the short-term    buffer    for a lim-
ited time while they are simultaneously strengthen-
ing their associations in long-term memory. accord-
ingly, clstm equips a standard lstm with a sim-
ilar cache mechanism, whose internal memory is di-
vided into several groups with different forgetting
rates. a group with high forgetting rate plays a role
as a cache in our model, bridging and transiting the
information to groups with relatively lower forget-
ting rates. with different forgetting rates, clstm
learns to capture, remember and forget semantics in-
formation through a very long distance.
our main contributions are as follows:
    we introduce a cache mechanism to diversify
the internal memory into several distinct groups
with different memory cycles by squashing
their forgetting rates. as a result, our model can
capture the local and global emotional informa-
tion, thereby better summarizing and analyzing
sentiment on long texts in an id56 fashion.

    bene   ting from long-term memory unit with a
low forgetting rate, we could keep the gradi-
ent stable in the long back-propagation process.
hence, our model could converge faster than a
standard lstm.

    our model outperforms state-of-the-art meth-
ods by a large margin on three document-level
datasets (yelp 2013, yelp 2014 and imdb). it
worth noticing that some of the previous meth-
ods have utilized extra user and product infor-
mation.

2 related work
in this section, we brie   y introduce related work in
two areas: first, we discuss the existing document-
level sentiment classi   cation approaches; second,
we discuss some variants of lstm which address
the problem on storing the long-term information.

2.1 document-level sentiment classi   cation
document-level sentiment classi   cation is a sticky
task in id31 (pang and lee, 2008),
which is to infer the sentiment polarity or intensity
of a whole document. the most challenging part is
that not every part of the document is equally in-
formative for inferring the sentiment of the whole

document (pang and lee, 2004; yessenalina et al.,
2010). various methods have been investigated and
explored over years (wilson et al., 2005; pang and
lee, 2008; pak and paroubek, 2010; yessenalina
et al., 2010; moraes et al., 2013). most of these
methods depend on traditional machine learning al-
gorithms, and are in need of effective handcrafted
features.

recently, neural network based methods are
prevalent due to their ability of learning discrimina-
tive features from data (socher et al., 2013; le and
mikolov, 2014; tang et al., 2015a). zhu et al. (2015)
and tai et al. (2015) integrate a tree-structured
model
into lstm for better semantic composi-
tion; bhatia et al. (2015) enhances document-level
id31 by using extra discourse par-
ing results. most of these models work well on
sentence-level or paragraph-level sentiment classi   -
cation. when it comes to the document-level sen-
timent classi   cation, a bottom-up hierarchical strat-
egy is often adopted to alleviate the model complex-
ity (denil et al., 2014; tang et al., 2015b).

2.2 memory augmented recurrent models
although it is widely accepted that lstm has more
long-lasting memory units than id56s, it still suffers
from    forgetting    information which is too far away
from the current point (le et al., 2015; karpathy et
al., 2015). such a scalability problem of lstms is
crucial to extend some previous sentence-level work
to document-level id31.

various models have been proposed to increase
the ability of lstms to store long-range informa-
tion (le et al., 2015; salehinejad, 2016) and two
kinds of approaches gain attraction. one is to aug-
ment lstm with an external memory (sukhbaatar
et al., 2015; monz, 2016), but they are of poor per-
formance on time because of the huge external mem-
ory matrix. unlike these methods, we fully exploit
the potential of internal memory of lstm by adjust-
ing its forgetting rates.

the other one tries to use multiple time-scales
to distinguish different states (el hihi and bengio,
1995; koutn    k et al., 2014; liu et al., 2015). they
partition the hidden states into several groups and
each group is activated and updated at different fre-
quencies (e.g. one group updates every 2 time-step,
the other updates every 4 time-step). in these meth-

ods, different memory groups are not fully inter-
connected, and the information is transmitted from
faster groups to slower ones, or vice versa.

however, the memory of slower groups are not
updated at every step, which may lead to senti-
ment information loss and semantic inconsistency.
in our proposed clstm, we assign different forget-
ting rates to memory groups. this novel strategy
enable each memory group to be updated at every
time-step, and every bit of the long-term and short-
term memories in previous time-step to be taken into
account when updating.
3 id137
long short-term memory network (lstm) (hochre-
iter and schmidhuber, 1997) is a typical recurrent
neural network, which alleviates the problem of gra-
dient diffusion and explosion. lstm can capture
the long dependencies in a sequence by introducing
a memory unit and a gate mechanism which aims
to decide how to utilize and update the information
kept in memory cell.

formally, the update of each lstm component

can be formalized as:

i(t) =   (wix(t) + uih(t   1)),
f (t) =   (wf x(t) + uf h(t   1)),
o(t) =   (wox(t) + uoh(t   1)),
  c(t) = tanh(wcx(t) + uch(t   1)),
c(t) = f (t) (cid:12) c(t   1) + i(t) (cid:12)   c(t),
h(t) = o(t) (cid:12) tanh(c(t)),

(1)
(2)

(6)
where    is the logistic sigmoid function. opera-
tor (cid:12) is the element-wise multiplication operation.
i(t), f (t), o(t) and c(t) are the input gate, forget gate,
output gate, and memory cell activation vector at
time-step t respectively, all of which have the same
size as the hidden vector h(t)     rh. wi, wf ,
wo     rh  d and ui, uf , uo     rh  h are train-
able parameters. here, h and d are the dimension-
ality of hidden layer and input respectively.
4 cached long short-term memory

neural network

lstm is supposed to capture the long-term and
short-term dependencies simultaneously, but when

figure 1: (a) a standard lstm unit and (b) a cifg-
lstm unit. there are three gates in (a), the input
gate, forget gate and output gates, while in (b), there
are only two gates, the cifg gate and output gate.

dealing with considerably long texts, lstm also
fails on capturing and understanding signi   cant sen-
timent message (le et al., 2015). speci   cally, the
error signal would nevertheless suffer from gradient
vanishing in modeling long texts with hundreds of
words and thus the network is dif   cult to train.

since the standard lstm inevitably loses valu-
able features, we propose a cached long short-term
memory neural networks (clstm) to capture in-
formation in a longer steps by introducing a cache
mechanism. moreover, in order to better control and
balance the historical message and the incoming in-
formation, we adopt one particular variant of lstm
proposed by greff et al. (2015), the coupled input
and forget gate lstm (cifg-lstm).

coupled input and forget gate lstm previous
studies show that the merged version gives perfor-
mance comparable to a standard lstm on language
modeling and classi   cation tasks because using the
input gate and forget gate simultaneously incurs re-
dundant information (chung et al., 2014; greff et
al., 2015).

in the cifg-lstm, the input gate and forget gate
are coupled as one uniform gate, that is, let i(t) =
1     f (t). we use f (t) to denote the coupled gate.
formally, we will replace eq. 5 as below:

c(t) = f (t) (cid:12) c(t   1) + (1     f (t)) (cid:12)   c(t)

(7)

figure 1 gives an illustrative comparison of a stan-

dard lstm and the cifg-lstm.

cached lstm cached long short-term mem-
ory neural networks (clstm) aims at capturing
the long-range information by a cache mechanism,
which divides memory into several groups, and dif-

+c  +c~outputforgetinputinoutc  +c~outputcifginout       ,

ferent forgetting rates, regarded as    lters, are as-
signed to different groups.

different groups capture different-scale depen-
dencies by squashing the scales of forgetting rates.
the groups with high forgetting rates are short-term
memories, while the groups with low forgetting rates
are long-term memories.
specially, we divide the memory cells into k
groups {g1,       , gk}. each group includes a in-
ternal memory ck, output gate ok and forgetting
rate rk. the forgetting rate of different groups are
squashed in distinct ranges.

we modify the update of a lstm as follows.

k ),
where r(t)
represents forgetting rate of the k-th
k
memory group at step t;   k is a squash function,
which constrains the value of forgetting rate rk
within a range. to better distinguish the different
role of each group, its forgetting rate is squashed into
a distinct area. the squash function   k(z) could be
formalized as:

k ) (cid:12)   c(t)

rk =   k(z) =

(13)
where z     (0, 1) is computed by logistic sigmoid
function. therefore, rk can constrain the forgetting
rate in the range of ( k   1

,

intuitively, if a forgetting rate rk approaches to 0,
the group k tends to be the long-term memory; if a
rk approaches to 1, the group k tends to be the short-
term memory. therefore, group g1 is the slowest,
while group gk is the fastest one. the faster groups
are supposed to play a role as a cache, transiting in-
formation from faster groups to slower groups.

different styles of arrows indicate different forget-
ting rates. groups with stars are fed to a fully con-
nected layers for softmax classi   cation. here is an
instance of b-clstm with text length equal to 4
and the number of memory groups is 3.

bidirectional clstm graves and schmidhuber
(2005) proposed a bidirectional lstm (b-lstm)
model, which utilizes additional backward informa-
tion and thus enhances the memory capability.

we also employ the bi-directional mechanism on
clstm and words in a text will receive informa-
tion from both sides of the context. formally, the
outputs of forward lstm for the k-th group is
      
h (1)

[

h (t )
lstm for the k-th group is [

modeling long text, we can use our proposed model
to analyze sentiment in a document. figure 2 gives
an overview of the architecture.

since the    rst group, the slowest group, is sup-
posed to keep the long-term information and can bet-
ter represent a whole document, we only utilize the
   nal state of this group to represent a document. as
for the b-clstm, we concatenate the state of the
   rst group in the forward lstm at t -th time-step
and the    rst group in the backward lstm at    rst

6 experiment
in this section, we study the empirical result of our
model on three datasets for document-level senti-
ment classi   cation. results show that the proposed
model outperforms competitor models from several
aspects when modelling long texts.

6.1 datasets
most existing datasets for sentiment classi   cation
such as stanford sentiment treebank (socher et al.,
2013) are composed of short paragraphs with sev-
eral sentences, which cannot evaluate the effective-
ness of the model under the circumstance of encod-
ing long texts. we evaluate our model on three pop-
ular real-world datasets, yelp 2013, yelp 2014 and

the three datasets. all these datasets can be publicly
accessed1. we pre-process and split the datasets in
the same way as tang et al. (2015b) did.

    yelp 2013 and yelp 2014 are review datasets
derived from yelp dataset challenge2 of year
2013 and 2014 respectively. the sentiment po-
larity of each review is 1 star to 5 stars, which
reveals the consumers    attitude and opinion to-
wards the restaurants.

    imdb is a popular movie review dataset con-
sists of 84919 movie reviews ranging from 1
to 10. average length of each review is 394.6
words, which is much larger than the length of
two yelp review datasets.

6.2 id74
we use accuracy (acc.) and mse as evaluation
metrics for sentiment classi   cation. accuracy is a
standard metric to measure the overall classi   cation
result and mean squared error (mse) is used to    g-
ure out the divergences between predicted sentiment
labels and the ground truth ones.

6.3 baseline models
we compare our model, clstm and b-clstm
with the following baseline methods.

table 2: sentiment classi   cation results of our model against competitor models on imdb, yelp 2014 and
yelp 2013. id74 are classi   cation accuracy (acc.) and mse. models with * use user and
product information as additional features. best results in each group are in bold.

    cbow sums the word vectors and applies a
non-linearity followed by a softmax classi   ca-
tion layer.

    jmars is one of the state-of-the-art recom-
mendation algorithm, which leverages user and
aspects of a review with collaborative    ltering
and id96.

    id98 upnn (id98) (tang et al., 2015b) can be
regarded as a id98 (kim, 2014). multiple    l-
ters are sensitive to capture different semantic
features during generating a representation in a
bottom-up fashion.

    id56 is a basic sequential model to model texts

(elman, 1991).

    lstm is a recurrent neural network with mem-
ory cells and gating mechanism (hochreiter
and schmidhuber, 1997).

    blstm is the bidirectional version of lstm,
and can capture more structural information
and longer distance during looking forward and
back (graves et al., 2013).

    cifg-lstm & cifg-blstm are coupled
input forget gate lstm and blstm, de-
noted as cifg-lstm and cifg-blstm re-
spectively (greff et al., 2015). they combine
the input and forget gate of lstm and require
smaller number of parameters in comparison
with the standard lstm.

6.4 hyper-parameters and initialization

for parameter con   guration, we choose parameters
on validation set mainly according to classi   cation
accuracy for convenience because mse always has
strong correlation with accuracy. the dimension of
pre-trained word vectors is 50. we use 120 as the
dimension of hidden units, and choose weight de-
cay among { 5e   4, 1e   4, 1e   5 }. we use adagrad
(duchi et al., 2011) as optimizer and its initial learn-
ing rate is 0.01. batch size is chosen among { 32,
64, 128 } for ef   ciency. for clstm, the number of
memory groups is chosen upon each dataset, which
will be discussed later. we remain the total number
of the hidden units unchanged. given 120 neurons
in all for instance, there are four memory groups and
each of them has 30 neurons. this makes model
comparable to (b)lstm. table 3 shows the optimal
hyper-parameter con   gurations for each dataset.

for model initialization, we initialize all recur-
rent matrices with randomly sampling from uni-
form distribution in [-0.1, 0.1]. besides, we use
glove(pennington et al., 2014) as pre-trained word
vectors. the id27s are    ne-tuned during
training. hyper-parameters achieving best results on
the validation set are chosen for    nal evaluation on
test set.

the classi   cation accuracy and mean square error
(mse) of our models compared with other competi-
tive models are shown in table 2. when comparing
our models to other neural network models, we have
several meaningful    ndings.

id56 fails to capture and store semantic fea-
tures while vanilla lstm preserves sentimen-
tal messages much longer than id56. it shows
that internal memory plays a key role in text
modeling. cifg-lstm gives performance
comparable to vanilla lstm.

2. with the help of bidirectional architecture,
models could look backward and forward to
capture features in long-range from global per-
spective. in id31, if users show
their opinion at the beginning of their review,
single directional models will possibly forget
these hints.

3. the proposed clstm beats the cifg-lstm
and vanilla lstm and even surpasses the bidi-
rectional models.
in yelp 2013, clstm
achieves 59.4% in accuracy, which is only 0.4
percent worse than b-clstm, which reveals
that the cache mechanism has successfully and
effectively stored valuable information without
the support from bidirectional structure.

4. compared with existing best methods, our

model has achieved new state-of-the-art re-
sults by a large margin on all document-
level datasets in terms of classi   cation accu-
racy. moreover, b-clstm even has surpassed
jmars and id98 (upnn) methods which uti-
lized extra user and product information.

5. in terms of time complexity and numbers of pa-
rameters, our model keeps almost the same as
its counterpart models while models of hierar-
chically composition may require more compu-
tational resources and time.

6.6 rate of convergence
we compare the convergence rates of our mod-
els, including cifg-lstm, cifg-blstm and b-
clstm, and the baseline models (lstm and
blstm). we con   gure the hyper-parameter to
make sure every competing model has approxi-
mately the same numbers of parameters, and vari-
ous models have shown different convergence rates
in figure 3. in terms of convergence rate, b-clstm
beats other competing models. the reason why b-
clstm converges faster is that the splitting mem-
ory groups can be seen as a better initialization and
constraints during the training process.

6.7 effectiveness on grouping memory
for the proposed model, the number of memory
groups is a highlight. in figure 4, we plot the best
prediction accuracy (y-axis) achieved in validation

set with different number of memory groups on all
datasets. from the diagram, we can    nd that our
model outperforms the baseline method.
in yelp
2013, when we split the memory into 4 groups, it
achieves the best result among all tested memory
group numbers. we can observe the dropping trends
when we choose more than 5 groups.

for fair comparisons, we set the total amount of
neurons in our model to be same with vanilla lstm.
therefore, the more groups we split, the less the neu-
rons belongs to each group, which leads to a worse

capacity than those who have suf   cient neurons for
each group.

6.8 sensitivity on document length
we also investigate the performance of our model
on imdb when it encodes documents of different
lengths. test samples are divided into 10 groups
with regard to the length. from figure 5, we can
draw several thoughtful conclusions.

1. bidirectional models have much better perfor-

mance than the counterpart models.

2. the overall performance of b-clstm is bet-
ter than cifg-blstm. this means that our
model is adaptive to both short texts and long
documents. besides, our model shows power
in dealing with very long texts in comparison
with cifg-blstm.

3. cbow is slightly better than cifg-lstm due
to lstm forgets a large amount of information
during the unidirectional propagation.

7 conclusion

in this paper, we address the problem of effectively
analyzing the sentiment of document-level texts in
an id56 architecture. similar to the memory struc-
ture of human, memory with low forgetting rate cap-
tures the global semantic features while memory
with high forgetting rate captures the local seman-
tic features. empirical results on three real-world
document-level review datasets show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large mar-
gin.

for future work, we are going to design a strategy
to dynamically adjust the forgetting rates for    ne-
grained document-level id31.
