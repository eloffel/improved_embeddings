   until recently, the quantitative study of science has focused on
   studying patterns in publications [58][1], [59][2], such as citation
   counts to discern impact, and in coauthorship networks to discern
   collaboration. however, two major trends are converging that offer the
   field of scientometrics a novel opportunity to understand scientific
   discovery and also to influence how science is done. the first is the
   advent of vast computational resources and storage capacity available
   to scientists [60][3], [61][4], and the second is automated science
   [62][5], [63][6]. these innovations offer the potential for a new type
   of scientometrics: quantitatively examining scientific discoveries
   themselves. this study of discoveries, rather than simply of scientific
   publications, offers the opportunity to understand science at a deeper
   level. we term this discovery-based approach to scientometrics as
   eurekometrics.

   eurekometrics aims to supplement the traditional bibliometric approach
   of scientometrics by examining the properties of scientific discoveries
   themselves rather than examining the properties of scientific
   publications. this is not simply a methodological development but a
   conceptual one. by using new types of data, we may be able to ask
   entirely different sorts of questions than we could before. for
   example, we are now able to examine both the material properties of
   phenomena that are discovered, such as their physical size, intrinsic
   id178, or informational complexity, as well as the human properties
   of the phenomena, such as how much money, time, or effort it takes to
   discover them.

   for instance, a traditional scientometric approach to understanding the
   nature of the genetic code and its elucidation would be to study the
   publications relevant to this area, looking at the citation network
   among these papers, for example. however, a eurekometric approach would
   instead examine the properties of the discoveries that were made during
   the deciphering of the code. in the 1960s, there was a large-scale push
   to elucidate what each triplet codon sequence coded for [64][7]. using
   a simple metric for informational id178 [65][8], one can examine the
   properties of each codon and find out whether or not, on average, the
   coding of those codons with less id178 can be found using more types
   of experiments [66][7]. in other words, a simple eurekometric approach
   could examine whether or not those codons with less information can be
   more easily understood.

   there are already examples of eurekometrics beyond the foregoing one.
   using the properties and dates of discovery of mammalian species, minor
   planets, and chemical elements, a quantitative measurement of the decay
   in ease of scientific discovery has been made [67][9] (see [68]figure
   1). by using measurements of the size of each item, a crude proxy for
   difficulty of discovery was developed. this allowed for insight into
   whether discovery becomes easier with time, and an analysis of how
   discoveries actually proceed over time. in addition, examination of the
   properties of scientific discoveries can be used to predict future
   discovery. for example, by examining the properties of previously
   discovered extrasolar planets, a prediction for the first potentially
   habitable planet similar to earth has been made [69][10]. a video
   visually displaying the location of minor planet discoveries from 1980
   to 2010 relative to the earth's orbit also offers eurekometric insight
   [70][11].

   furthermore, there are examples of research that has begun to bridge
   the gap between bibliometrics and eurekometrics. using gene interaction
   data from high-throughput experiments combined with citation data, an
   attempt was made to understand the relationship between the reliability
   of reported interactions and the popularity of a research field
   [80][12]. these researchers also examined how the importance of a gene
   in interaction networks is related to its popularity in the literature
   [81][13].

   with the increase of automated discovery and large-scale data
   collection, eurekometric research has the potential to explode. first,
   automated science will necessarily have the property of creating large
   amounts of discovery data. illustrative examples of automated science
   include the sloan digital sky survey [82][14], lincoln near-earth
   asteroid program [83][15], gordon and betty moore foundation marine
   microbial genome sequencing project [84][16], and the census of marine
   life [85][17]. the initial output of these projects will not be
   publications, but findings. each object, such as a newly discovered
   asteroid, need not have its own publication, but each object can be
   examined separately from a eurekometric perspective.

   in addition, there is the potential in such areas as automated drug
   discovery [86][18], automated chemical synthesis path discovery
   [87][19], and automated theorem proving [88][20]. in all these cases,
   the conceptually informed and rigorously quantifiable analysis of what
   is discovered, and when, will shed light on many things, e.g., where
   there is a relationship between the object of inquiry and human effort.

   in addition, other types of research projects will provide potential
   for eurekometrics. for example, citizen science research, where
   interested laypeople provide much of the scientific labor, also has
   potential. such projects include galaxy zoo [89][21], which examines
   stellar phenomena; foldit [90][22], which studies protein folding; the
   audobon christmas bird count [91][23], which catalogues birds; and
   valley of the khans [92][24], which hunts for genghis khan's tomb. in
   addition to providing vast amounts of discovery data, these projects
   will allow us to understand the way collaborative approaches can create
   further discovery and the properties of discoveries that are best
   suited to citizen science.

   despite the great strides in automated discovery and digitization of
   data that is currently occurring, however, there are limits to
   eurekometrics. the most important limitation is how to determine what
   constitutes a    discovery.    quantifying what constitutes a discovery is
   never an easy proposition: is each publication a discovery? or do only
   certain ones rise to meet that definition? furthermore, even if we can
   list discoveries, it needn't necessarily be possible to quantify their
   properties. for example, while it's possible to quantify the properties
   of minor planets and extrasolar planets, it is not nearly as easy to
   quantify the properties of methodological innovations made in
   computational fields.

   scientometrics has for too long focused on understanding scientific
   progress at the level of the publication. eurekometrics will allow us
   to understand the pace and determinants of scientific discovery in a
   way that simply examining the patterns in publications will not. for
   the first time, we will be able to explore how the properties of nature
   yield to human science.
