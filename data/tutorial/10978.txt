abstract

   social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. while
   our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it
   has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the
   nature of this restriction on social group structure. we construct a
   social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical
   locations are also known. we also classify the individuals into groups
   according to a community detection algorithm. we study the variation of
   geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the
   relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of
   their members. we find that small social groups are geographically very
   tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about
   30 members. also, we find no correlation between the topological
   positions and geographic positions of individuals within network
   communities. these results suggest that spreading processes face
   distinct structural and spatial constraints.

introduction

   social groups are common among animals and humans [59][1]   [60][5]. in
   humans, they reflect friendship, kinship, and work relationships, and
   can also be seen as social networks. from an evolutionary and
   historical perspective, the formation of such network groups    
   consisting of agglomerations of dyadic interactions     has been
   constrained by geography. in contrast, larger social units, enabled by
   modern technology and political organization, offer drastically
   different opportunities for social interactions and for group assembly
   over larger geographic ranges. this raises two sorts of questions.
   first, is the structure of    old-fashioned    groups similar to the
   large-scale groups possible in modern society? and second, what role
   does geography play in group formation?

   if we represent the social relationships among a population of people
   as a network, then groups can be seen as    communities    within the
   population that consist of sets of nodes that are relatively densely
   connected to each other but sparsely connected to other nodes in the
   network [61][6], [62][7]. while social communities have been studied
   for a long time [63][8], it has recently become feasible, with mobile
   phone data, to monitor the social interactions and geographic positions
   of millions of individuals [64][9], [65][10], and to apply algorithmic
   detection of communities on a large scale [66][6], [67][7]. the
   structure of dyadic social interactions is known to depend on
   geography, for example, as shown by the decay of friendship id203
   with distance, based on voluntary self-reports of hometown and us
   state, in a blog community [68][11], and the decrease in communication
   id203 with distance based on the zip codes of cell phone billing
   addresses [69][12]. in addition, a previous study has shown that
   smaller communities are more homogeneous with respect to the billing
   postal codes of their members [70][13], while another presented
   evidence that this persists across a hierarchy of communities [71][14].
   however, there are no prior large-scale studies of the way in which
   community structure depends on geography, where the actual
   communication locations are used and where geographical properties of
   communities themselves are examined (see [72]fig. 1).

   figure 1. visualization of a community in the mobile phone network.

   this juxtaposition of (a) the topological structure and (b) the
   geographical structure demonstrates the interplay of these two
   dimensions. the purple and orange nodes are geographically close, but
   topologically they lie at five degrees of separation. in contrast, the
   red and green nodes are connected to each other, and also share several
   neighbors, yet they are geographically separated by a large distance.
   overlapping nodes in (b) have been moved slightly for visual clarity.

   [80]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016939.g001

   with respect to group formation, geography can be seen as a kind of
   constraint. that is, social connections not only face network
   constraints and opportunities (we tend to form ties with others who are
   the friends of our friends), but also, quite obviously, geographic
   constraints and opportunities. what is unclear, however, is the way in
   which such geographic constraints and opportunities affect and shape
   network communities above and beyond their effect on dyadic
   interactions.

results

dyadic interactions and geography

   we create a network of social interactions by measuring ties between
   individuals based on mobile phone call and text messaging data from an
   unnamed european country. based on the records of 72.4 millions calls
   and 17.1 million text messages accumulated over a one-month period, the
   resulting network has 3.4 million nodes connected by 5.2 million
   weighted (non-binary) ties, resulting in an average degree
   [journal.pone.0016939.e001] . each time a user initiated or received a
   call or a text message, the location of the tower routing the
   communication was recorded [81][10]. we exploited these records to
   assign each individual to the location where they conducted most of
   their cell phone communication, which for most individuals is likely to
   correspond to the location of their home or work. this resulted in one
   coordinate pair [journal.pone.0016939.e002] per user, which enabled us
   to define the geographic distance for any user pair as
   [journal.pone.0016939.e003] . we used this to compute the id203
   of a call-tie and the id203 of a text-tie as a function of
   distance ([82]fig. 2).

   figure 2. the id203 of having a tie decreases as a function of
   distance.

   two limiting cases, corresponding to exponents one and two, are shown
   as dashed lines. note that if geography played no role, we would expect
   [journal.pone.0016939.e004] to be independent of distance
   [journal.pone.0016939.e005] , resulting in a horizontal line in this
   plot. inset: tie strength, in contrast to the communication
   id203, is nearly flat with distance, although there is a minor
   decreasing trend for voice-ties.

   [90]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016939.g002

   although from the point of view of technology there is very little
   difference between placing a short-distance or long-distance
   communication (for either voice or text), we find that the id203
   of communication is strongly related to the distance between the
   individuals, and it decreases by approximately five orders of magnitude
   as distance increases from 1 km to 1,000 km. the behavior of voice-ties
   and text-ties is essentially identical. the average distance between
   two connected nodes is 42 km for voice ties and 51 km for text ties.
   the decay of the tie id203 approximately follows a power-law of
   the form [journal.pone.0016939.e006] , before it falls due to reaching
   the physical boundaries of the system. we used the maximum-likelihood
   method [91][15] to estimate both the exponent
   [journal.pone.0016939.e007] and the lower bound
   [journal.pone.0016939.e008] from which the power-law holds, and
   obtained [journal.pone.0016939.e009] for voice ties and
   [journal.pone.0016939.e010] for text ties, with the lower bounds
   estimated at 7.1 km and 4.1 km, respectively. in estimating these
   parameters, we constrained our search to ties whose distance was less
   than 800 km to avoid boundary effects, still leaving us over 99% of the
   ties.

   we define tie strength [journal.pone.0016939.e011] as the number of
   interactions between nodes [journal.pone.0016939.e012] and
   [journal.pone.0016939.e013] , and it can quantified either as the
   number of calls between the two nodes or, alternatively, as the number
   of text messages between them. interestingly, while geography is so
   strongly associated with the existence of a tie, tie strength varies
   only weakly with distance and is similar for both text and voice
   ([92]fig. 2 inset).

community interaction structure and geography

   it is clear that ties or dyads should be the building blocks of social
   groups or communities, but what constitutes a community and how it
   should be identified needs to be specified. we detect topological
   communities using the method of modularity maximization, which measures
   how well a given partition of a network compartmentalizes its
   communities [93][6], [94][7], [95][16], [96][17] (see [97]methods for
   details). for this purpose, we combine voice-ties and text-ties into
   one network.

   next, we examined how the topological centrality of nodes within
   communities is associated with their physical centrality. given the
   community membership of each individual, we computed the geographical
   center [journal.pone.0016939.e014] of community
   [journal.pone.0016939.e015] using [journal.pone.0016939.e016] and
   [journal.pone.0016939.e017] , where [journal.pone.0016939.e018] is the
   number of members (nodes) in the community. we measured topological
   centrality using betweenness centrality, whereas physical centrality
   was measured as the distance from a node to the geographic center of
   its corresponding community. given that both betweenness centrality and
   the physical span of communities increase as a function of community
   size, we normalized these quantities by considering their percentile
   values, instead of dealing with their absolute values. (note that while
   betweenness centrality can be normalized to be independent of network
   size, there is no similar id172 available for the physical
   distances.) we included communities whose size varied between 10 and
   1,000 nodes. while the community detection algorithm found communities
   that were significantly larger than this upper bound, we deemed them to
   be too large to be taken as social communities. including communities
   smaller than 10 led to discretization effects when computing
   percentiles.

   in historically relevant social arrangements, one might expect the two
   measures of betweenness centrality and geographic distance from the
   community center to be strongly correlated, but here we found
   essentially no correlation between them ([98]fig. 3). pearson's linear
   correlation coefficient between these two measures, both taken as
   percentiles, was    0.07 (we obtained 0.05 if communities smaller than 10
   were also included). therefore, there seems to be no relationship
   between topological centrality and physical centrality of nodes within
   communities in this network.

   figure 3. relationship between topological centrality and geographic
   centrality.

   42,123 nodes in communities varying in size from 10 to 1,000 are
   examined, and both quantities are measured in terms of percentiles. the
   number of observations (nodes) that lie within each bin is indicated by
   its color.

   [106]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016939.g003

   next, we characterized the overall geographical shape of the
   communities by defining the geographical span for a given community
   [journal.pone.0016939.e019] as [journal.pone.0016939.e020] (1)

   where [journal.pone.0016939.e021] is measured in units of distance, and
   large values of [journal.pone.0016939.e022] indicate that the members
   of the community are geographically spread out. we found an upward
   trend that persisted with a leveling off until, surprisingly, a large
   bump occurred for communities in excess of 30 nodes ([107]fig. 4).

   figure 4. average observed geographic community span
   [journal.pone.0016939.e023] (red) and average geographic community null
   span [journal.pone.0016939.e024] (blue).

   the dyadic null span with decay, denoted by [journal.pone.0016939.e025]
   , incorporates the decay of the connection id203 as a function of
   distance for various values of the scale parameter, shown as dashed
   lines. the solid black line is the dyadic null span without decay. both
   are measured in kilometers. we observe large deviations from both null
   models, which can be quantified as the areas between the empirical
   curve and any of the null curves.

   [115]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0016939.g004

   to put this result in a context, we introduced two null models. in the
   community null model, instead of using the true geographical
   coordinates [journal.pone.0016939.e026] of community members, we draw
   the [journal.pone.0016939.e027] coordinate pairs uniformly at random
   from the underlying distribution of all coordinate pairs, keeping a
   given [journal.pone.0016939.e028] -coordinate coupled with the
   associated [journal.pone.0016939.e029] -coordinate, resulting in the
   quantity [journal.pone.0016939.e030] . if [journal.pone.0016939.e031] ,
   this would suggest that the members of the community are randomly
   scattered in the country, i.e., regardless of being members of the same
   community, they are not geographically proximate. as shown in
   ([116]fig. 4), the real community span is much smaller than the span of
   the null community. what is especially notable is the constraining role
   of geography for small communities. as community sizes increase, say,
   from five to ten individuals, the value of the null span increases
   dramatically from about 70 km to about 300 km, quantifying the expected
   growth in geographical span if the impact of geography could, somehow,
   be turned off. instead, we observe relatively modest growth for the
   empirical span [journal.pone.0016939.e032] , which for communities of
   size ten reaches a value of just 50 km, and stays relatively unchanged
   until communities exceed 30 in size.

   the community null model does not incorporate our earlier finding that
   the connection id203 decays with distance as
   [journal.pone.0016939.e033] . we next asked whether this decay, coupled
   with the concentration of populations in cities, might explain the
   observed bump. to account for this possibility, we introduce the dyadic
   null model. the algorithm starts by picking one location, uniformly at
   random, as the geographical center of the community. it then samples
   other locations, again uniformly at random, and computes the
   id203 for there to be a tie between the center of the community
   and the current location, where the id203 distribution is assumed
   to follow a power-law with exponent [journal.pone.0016939.e034] . to
   determine whether the current location is included in the community,
   the algorithm performs a bernoulli trial with the given id203,
   and this continues until we have 50 members in the community. we
   compared the result of the dyadic null model without decay, achieved by
   accepting each trial location for inclusion, to the community null
   span. apart from a slight horizontal shift, the two null models produce
   very similar outcomes. we then consider the dyadic null model with
   decay, varying the value of the scale parameter
   [journal.pone.0016939.e035] , running each simulation 1,000 times.
   although the numerical values are not comparable between the dyadic
   null model and the community null model, the former demonstrates that
   inclusion of the decay of the connection id203 with distance
   yields a smooth curve for the span. in particular, decay with distance
   cannot explain the observed bump.

   we also explored the spatial distribution of the nodes within a
   community. in general, the nodes of a given community need not be
   distributed spatially uniformly. to quantify this    clumpiness    of a
   community, we wanted to determine the number of spatial clusters making
   up the community. we used [journal.pone.0016939.e036] -means id91
   [117][18] which aims to partition the set of data points into
   [journal.pone.0016939.e037] clusters such that each point belongs to
   the cluster with the nearest mean. since the number of clusters
   [journal.pone.0016939.e038] is given as input to the method, it can be
   seen as a model parameter, and it needs to be determined separately. at
   the extreme ends, one could assign every point to a single cluster, an
   approach likely to result in a large error measure, or one could assign
   every point to its own cluster, leading to zero error. we used the
   akaike information criterion to determine the optimal value for
   [journal.pone.0016939.e039] [118][19].

   we found that the number of spatial clusters increases linearly with
   community size, until communities of about size 20, when the behavior
   appears to change ([119]fig. 5). the increase in community span for
   communities larger than 20, without a comparable increase in the number
   of spatial clusters, suggests a threshold in structure and behavior
   based on community size. based on linear fits to data, the addition of
   an extra community member causes, on average, a marginal increase of
   0.67 spatial clusters in small (few members) communities, whereas in
   large (many members) communities, the addition of an extra community
   member causes, on average, a marginal increase of 0.29 spatial
   clusters. for example, an increase from 5 to 15 members increases the
   number of spatial clusters by 6.1, whereas an increase from 25 to 35
   members results in an increase of 2.7 clusters. communities therefore
   seem to grow initially by recruiting spatially more distant clusters,
   but less and less so as the communities get bigger.

   clusters are detected using the [journal.pone.0016939.e040] -means
   algorithm with the akaike information criterion. we fit two models to
   data. first, a linear model [journal.pone.0016939.e041] was fit in two
   parts, shown in green, as well as a non-linear model
   [journal.pone.0016939.e042] , shown in red. we obtained the values
   [journal.pone.0016939.e043] for the first slope and
   [journal.pone.0016939.e044] for the second slope of the linear fits,
   and [journal.pone.0016939.e045] for the exponent of the non-linear
   model, implying approximately square-root behavior.

discussion

   our findings on the geographic decay of ties differ from those obtained
   for a network constructed from the customers of a belgian mobile
   operator. using zip codes provided for billing purposes to compute
   distances between individuals, lambiotte et al. showed that the
   id203 for two individuals to be connected decays as
   [journal.pone.0016939.e046] , which led them to suggest that the decay
   follows a so-called gravity model [128][12]. our result, essentially
   showing that [journal.pone.0016939.e047] , differs for various possible
   reasons: we used the maximum-likelihood technique to estimate the value
   of the exponent [129][15]; our range of distances is larger (
   [journal.pone.0016939.e048] km vs. [journal.pone.0016939.e049] km),
   allowing for more statistical power; we used the location of maximal
   phone use as opposed to the location of the billing address (which is
   often not reliable); and the population density in our target country
   is significantly lower than that of belgium. our result that tie
   strength does not vary with distance is complementary to the finding of
   lambiotte et al., who report that the average duration of phone calls
   increases with distance, reaching a plateau around 40 km. therefore,
   while the number of calls made to long-distance individuals friends is
   slightly smaller than those made to short distance friends, the average
   duration may be twice as long [130][12].

   communities appear to have particular properties in relationship to
   geography, properties that are distinct from the underlying
   interactions between pairs of individuals. geography constrains group
   formation in important ways that nevertheless differ from the way it
   constrains dyadic interactions. on the one hand, comparison of
   topological and geographical centrality of nodes within communities
   demonstrated that the two are essentially uncorrelated. on the other
   hand, we find that the geographic shapes of social groups, measured in
   terms of geographic span and spatial id91, vary in regular ways
   with the size of the group. for small communities, as their size
   increases, their expected geographic span increases smoothly at first,
   but then experiences a sudden bounce as the community size reaches
   about 30 members. to exemplify this behavior, an increase in community
   size from 10 to 20 members is associated with an increase in span by
   about 40%, whereas, in contrast, an increase from 30 to 40 members
   leads to an increase of about 100% in geographic span. this suggests
   that the tendency of human groups to remain geographically cohesive
   gradually gives in as the group size exceeds 30. similarly, the number
   of clusters within a single topological group also increases with
   community size. intriguingly, the number 30 is also close to the
   optimal group size for which cooperation in social dilemma situations,
   modeled, for example, by the public goods game, is maximized [131][20],
   [132][21].

   just as the structures of observed social interactions may be compared
   to randomized networks, the observed localities of individuals in
   communities may be compared to randomized locations. indeed, if social
   ties could be formed without consideration for the underlying
   geography, we would expect the tie id203 to be independent of
   distance, and the geographic span of groups to follow the proposed null
   models closely. however, we observe neither of the two. this
   demonstrates that network ties and network communities, in this
   context, do not behave as if they were in well mixed populations,
   suggesting that geography continues to maintain its power as a
   compartmentalizing factor. thus, the assumption of perfect mixing of
   individuals, sometimes made in the study of infectious disease or
   technology diffusion in humans, does not then appear to hold either at
   the topological or at the geographic level.

   the extent to which a spreading process follows the assumptions of
   well-mixed populations often depends on a number of conditions,
   including the nature of the spreading process. for example, network
   models can better account for the spread of diseases that spread via
   the formation of a physical tie (such as std's) than those that spread
   by simple proximity (like the common cold). this is illustrated in a
   mobile phone context by wang et al. [133][22], who find that the nature
   of the spreading process, and its dependence on proximity, clearly
   affect the dynamics of the spreading. similarly, localization of
   interacting proteins within the geography of the cell can explain
   certain disease associations [134][23]. in addition, other work has
   suggested that the diffusion-like movement of people alone can often
   explain how a pathogen spreads, such as the plague in medieval europe
   [135][24]. on the other hand, with the onset of air travel, pathogens
   are not constrained in the same way, as the epidemics of sars and h1n1
   documented [136][25], [137][26].

   ideally, models of the flow of pathogens or information through human
   populations would account for the simultaneous roles of geographic and
   network constraints, and our work helps shed light on the intersecting
   relationship between the two. future work will explore the complex
   interrelationship between network topology and geography and their
   joint importance in understanding how phenomena spread through
   populations.

methods

   all networks were constructed from four weeks of anonymized mobile
   phone call and text messaging data from an operator based in an unnamed
   european country. only interactions that took place between customers
   of the operator were considered, and only individuals who made at least
   two calls were included as nodes. to filter out sporadic calls and
   texts that are unlikely to correspond to meaningful social
   interactions, we required there to be a minimal level of reciprocation
   for a tie to be included in the network; each person had to initiate at
   least one interaction, where the initial transaction could be either a
   call or a text, and this could be reciprocated by either a call or a
   text.

   we detected topological communities using the popular method of
   modularity maximization [138][6], [139][7], [140][16], [141][17] in the
   following manner. we first converted the original network consisting of
   directed voice calls and text messages into a symmetric unweighted
   network, effectively combining the two modes of interaction. we then
   proceeded to maximize modularity defined as [journal.pone.0016939.e050]
   (2)

   where the adjacency matrix element [journal.pone.0016939.e051] denotes
   the presence ( [journal.pone.0016939.e052] ) or absence (
   [journal.pone.0016939.e053] ) of a connection between nodes
   [journal.pone.0016939.e054] and [journal.pone.0016939.e055] ,
   [journal.pone.0016939.e056] is the degree of node
   [journal.pone.0016939.e057] , [journal.pone.0016939.e058] the total
   weight of the edges in the network, [journal.pone.0016939.e059] the
   community assignment of node [journal.pone.0016939.e060] , and
   [journal.pone.0016939.e061] is the kronecker delta function, which is
   unity if and only if [journal.pone.0016939.e062] , otherwise it is
   zero. modularity measures the difference between the total fraction of
   edges that fall within groups versus the fraction one would expect by
   chance. a common null model, sometimes called the newman-girvan null
   model, is codified by the [journal.pone.0016939.e063] term, and it
   takes degree heterogeneity into account by preserving the expected
   degree distribution. high values of [journal.pone.0016939.e064]
   indicate network partitions in which more of the edges fall within
   groups than expected by chance. while maximizing modularity is known to
   be an np-hard problem [142][27], there are numerous computational
   heuristics available [143][6], [144][7]. since we are dealing with
   networks consisting of millions of nodes, we chose the louvain method
   for its computational efficiency [145][28].
