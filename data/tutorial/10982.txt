during the past decade, we have identified seven examples of 
complementary noninteractive structures in the biomedical 
literature. each structure led to a novel, plausible, and 
testable hypothesis that, in several cases, was subsequently 
corroborated by medical researchers through clinical or 
laboratory investigation. we have also developed, tested, and 
described a systematic, computer-sided approach to iinding 
and identifying  complementary noninteractive literatures.

specialization,  fragmentation, 
and a connection  explosion 

-~ 

-r- 

by some obscure spontaneous process scientists have 
responded to the growth of science by organizing their 
work into soecialties, thus permitting each individual to 
focus on a small part of the total literature. specialties 
that grow too large tend to divide into subspecialties that 
have their own literatures which, by a process of repeated 
splitting, maintain more or less fixed and manageable size. 
as the total literature grows, the number of specialties, but 
not in general the size of each, increases (kochen, 1963; 
swanson, 199oc). 

but the unintended consequence of specialization is 

fragmentation. by dividing up the pie, the potential 
relationships among its pieces tend to be neglected. 
although scientific literature cannot, in the long run, grow 
disproportionately to the growth of the communities and 
resources that produce it, combinations of implicitly- 
related segments of literature can grow much faster than 
the literature itself and can readily exceed the capacity of 
the community to identify and assimilate such relatedness 
(swanson, 1993). the signilicance of the    information 
explosion    thus may lie not in an explosion of quantity per 
se, but in an incalculably greater combinatorial explosion 

of unnoticed and unintended logical connections. 

the significance of complementary 

noninteractive  literatures 

--- 

-f  -----l-----ry-?r-. 

if two literatures each of substantial size are linked by 
arguments that they respectively put forward -- that is, are 
   logically    related, or complementary -- one would expect 
to gain usefui information by combining them. for 
example, suppose that one (biomedical) literature 
establishes that some environmental factor a influences 
certain internal physiological conditions and a second 
literature establishes that these same physiological 
changes influence the course of disease c. presumably, 
then, anyone who reads both literatures could conclude 
that factor a might influence disease c. under such

two literatures to refer to each other. if, however, the two 
literatures were developed independently of one another, 
the logical linkage illustrated may be both unintended and 
unnoticed. to detect such mutual isolation, we examine 
the citation pattern. if  two literatures are    noninteractive

together, and if neither cites the other, - 
possible that scientists have not previously considered 
both iiteratures together, and so it is possible that no one is 
aware of the implicit a-c connection. the two 
conditions, complementarily and noninteraction, describe 
a model structure that shows how useful information can 
remain undiscovered even though its components consist 
of public knowledge (swanson, 1987,199l).

public  knowledge  / private  knowledge 

there is, of course, no way to know in any particular case 
whether the possibility of an ac relationship in the above 
model has or has not occurred to someone, or whether or 
not anyone has actually considered the two literatures on 
a and c together, a private matter that necessarily 
remains conjectural. however, our argument is based 
only on determining whether there is any printed evidence 
to the contrary. we are concerned with public rather than

private knowledge --  with the state of the record produced
rather than the state of mind of the producers (swanson,
1990d). the point of bringing together the ab and bc
literatures,  in any event, is  not to "prove" an ac linkage,
(by considering only transitive relationships) but rather 
call  attention to an apparently unnoticed association that
may be worth investigating. in principle any chain of
scientific, including analogic, reasoning in which different
links appear in noninteractive literatures may lead to the
discovery of new interesting connections.

"what people know" is  a  common understanding of

what is  meant by "knowledge". if  taken in this  subjective
sense, the idea of "knowledge discovery" could mean
merely that  someone discovered something they hadn   t
known before. our focus in the present paper is  on a
second sense of the  word "knowledge", a meaning
associated with the products of human intellectual
activity, as encoded in the public record, rather than with
the contents of the human mind. this abstract world of
human-created "objective" knowledge is  open to
exploration and discovery, for it  can contain territory that
is  subjectively unknown to anyone (popper, 1972). our
work is  directed toward the discovery of scientifically-
useful information implicit in the public record, but not
previously made explicit.  the problem we address
concerns structures within the scientific literature, not
within the mind.

the process  of  finding

complementary noninteractive  literatures

during the past ten years, we have pursued three goals: i)
to  show in  principle how new knowledge might be gained
by synthesizing logically- related noninteractive
literatures; ii)  to demonstrate that such structures do exist,
at least within the biomedical literature; and iii)  to develop
a systematic process for finding them.

in pursuit of goal iii,  we have created interactive

software and database search strategies that can facilitate
the discovery of complementary structures in the
published literature  of science. the universe or search-
space under consideration is  limited only by the coverage
of the major scientific  databases, though we have focused
primarily on the  biomedical field  and the  medline
database (8 million records). in 1991, a systematic
approach to  finding complementary structures  was
outlined and became a point of departure for software
development (swanson, 1991). the system that  has now
taken shape is  based on a  3-way interaction between
computer software, bibliographic databases, and a human
operator. tae interaction generates information structtues
that are used heuristically to guide the search for
promising complementary 

literatures.

the user of the system begins by choosing a question

(swanson & smalheiser,  1997),  that

or problem area of scientific interest that can be associated
with a literature,  c. elsewhere we describe and evaluate
experimental computer software, which we call
arrowsmith 
performs two separate functions that  can be used
independently. the first  function produces a list  of
candidates for a second literature,  a, complementary 
from which the user can select one candidate (at  a time) 
an input, along with c, to the second function. this first
function can be considered as a computer-assisted process
of problem-discovery, an issue identified in the ai
literature (langley, et  al.,  1987; p304-307). alternatively,
the user may wish to identify a second literature,  a, as a
conjecture or hypothesis generated independently of the
computer-produced 

list  of candidates.

to c,

is  used to  create two local computer title-files

our approach has been based on the use of article  titles
as a  guide to identifying complementary 
literatures.  as
indicated above, our point of departure for the second
function is  a tentative scientific hypothesis associated with
two literalxtres,  a and c. a title-word search of
medline 
associated with a and c, respectively. these files  are
used as input  to  the  arrowsmith 
produces a list  of all  words common 
titles,  except for words excluded by an extensive stoplist
(presently about 5000 words). the resulting list  of words
provides the basis for identifying title-word pathways that
might provide clues to  the presence of complementary
arguments within the literatures  corresponding to  a and
c. the output of this procedure is  a structured title-
display (plus journal citation), that serves as a heuristic
aid to identifying word-linked titles  and serves also as an
organized guide to the literature.

literature.based  knowledge synthesis

the concept of "undiscovered public knowledge" based
on complementary noninteractive literatures  was
introduced, developed, and exemplified in (swanson,
1986a, 1986b). since 1986, we have described six  more
examples, each representing a synthesis of two
complementary 
literatures  in  which biomedical
relationships not previously noted in print were brought to
light.  we describe also the hypotheses to  which they have
led, and the strategies we have followed in finding and
identifying these structures (swanson 1988, 1989a, 1989b,
1990a; smalheiser & swanson 1994, 1996). we identify
these examples here in  terms of a, b, and c, wherein
associations between a and b are found in one literature
and associations between b and c in  another literature,
leading us to  draw certain id136s about a previously
mreported association between a and c. in most cases
we analyzed multiple b-terms for  a  given a and c. in the

comment 

the objects of study in the work summarized here are 
complementary structures within the scientific literature. 
the recognition of meaningful associations and ultimately 
that of complementarity require a high level of subject 
expertise. the unruly problems of meaning within the 
natural language of titles and abstracts present serious 
obstacles to more fully automating this process of 
knowledge discovery. our computer aids are therefore 
designed to enhance and stimulate human ability to see 
connections and relationships. these aids necessarily 
derive from the immense databases that provide the routes 
of intellectual access to the literature. our goal thus far 
has been to produce a working practical system that yields 
immediate results in furthering the aims of biomedical 
re-w&. 
atd 
problems that contribute to understanding literature-based 
scientitic discovery.
