abstract

   the scientific literature represents a rich source for retrieval of
   knowledge on associations between biomedical concepts such as genes,
   diseases and cellular processes. a commonly used method to establish
   relationships between biomedical concepts from literature is
   co-occurrence. apart from its use in knowledge retrieval, the
   co-occurrence method is also well-suited to discover new, hidden
   relationships between biomedical concepts following a simple
   abc-principle, in which a and c have no direct relationship, but are
   connected via shared b-intermediates. in this paper we describe copub
   discovery, a tool that mines the literature for new relationships
   between biomedical concepts. statistical analysis using roc curves
   showed that copub discovery performed well over a wide range of
   settings and keyword thesauri. we subsequently used copub discovery to
   search for new relationships between genes, drugs, pathways and
   diseases. several of the newly found relationships were validated using
   independent literature sources. in addition, new predicted
   relationships between compounds and cell proliferation were validated
   and confirmed experimentally in an in vitro cell proliferation assay.
   the results show that copub discovery is able to identify novel
   associations between genes, drugs, pathways and diseases that have a
   high id203 of being biologically valid. this makes copub
   discovery a useful tool to unravel the mechanisms behind disease, to
   find novel drug targets, or to find novel applications for existing
   drugs.

author summary

   the biomedical literature is an important source of knowledge on the
   function of genes and on the mechanisms by which these genes regulate
   cellular processes. several id111 approaches have been developed
   to leverage this rich source of information by automatically extracting
   associations between concepts such as genes, diseases and drugs from a
   large body of text. here, we describe a new method that extracts novel,
   not yet recognized associations between genes, diseases, drugs and
   cellular processes from the biomedical literature. our method is built
   on the assumption that even if two concepts do not have a direct
   connection in literature, they may be functionally related if they are
   both connected to an overlapping set of concepts. using this approach
   we predicted several novel connections between genes, diseases, drugs
   and pathways. our results imply that our method is able to predict
   novel relationships from literature and, most importantly, that these
   newly identified relationships are biologically relevant. our method
   can aid the drug discovery process where it can be used to find novel
   drug targets, increase insight in mode of action of a drug or find
   novel applications for known drugs.

introduction

   a wealth of knowledge concerning the function of genes and their role
   in biological processes is present in the biomedical literature,
   embodied in full text articles or the medline abstract database.
   various id111 approaches have been developed to extract
   information on gene function from this body of literature [58][1],
   [59][2] and these have been successfully applied to annotate genes and
   proteins [60][3]   [61][7] and the interpretation of experimental results
   [62][8]   [63][14].

   a common method to establish relationships between biomedical concepts
   such as genes and pathways is co-occurrence [64][15]. this method is
   built on the assumption that biomedical concepts occurring in the same
   body of text are in some way biologically related. co-occurrence-based
   methods can also be used to discover new, hidden relationships,
   assuming that if a and c both are connected with b, a and c might also
   have a relationship, even if there is no published relationship between
   a and c ([65]figure 1). swanson has provided a classic example in his
   study in which he found that fish-oil intake is beneficial for patients
   suffering from raynaud's disease, a finding that was confirmed
   experimentally a few years later [66][16], [67][17]. hidden literature
   relationships can be used to confirm a hypothesis about a relationship
   between a and c in a so called closed discovery process
   [68][18]   [69][20]. in this process the user provides the hypothesis
   that a is related to c, which is then tested by mining the literature
   for shared biomedical concepts (b) that support the hypothesis
   ([70]figure 1). hidden relationships can also be used to generate novel
   hypotheses about a relationship between a and c, in a so-called open
   discovery process [71][18], [72][19], [73][21]   [74][23]. in this
   process the user provides a starting point a (e.g. a disease) and
   examines the literature for hidden relationships with other biomedical
   concepts (c; e.g. genes, drugs) that are bridged by intermediates (b)
   that share co-occurrences with a and c ([75]figure 1).

   figure 1. abc-principle of hidden relationships in literature.

   hidden relationships in literature between biomedical concepts (e.g.,
   genes, diseases, drugs), for which a and c have no direct relationship,
   but are connected indirectly via b-intermediates, can be analyzed in a
   closed discovery or open discovery setting. the inferred r-scaled
   (r[i]) score between a and c, which is a measure for the strength of a
   hidden relationship, is calculated by summation of the r-scaled scores
   of the weakest links (i.e. lowest r-scaled score), divided by the
   number of intermediates.

   [83]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943.g001

   the tools that are currently available for performing open discovery
   experiments are often limited to certain biomedical domains, have only
   limited number of keywords describing the biomedical terms, or retrieve
   hidden relationships formed by uninformative concepts, such as    in
   vitro    or    microarray    which are biologically less interesting
   [84][19], [85][22], [86][24]. moreover, a bottleneck with all open
   discovery tools is to identify true, biologically informative, hidden
   relationships from spurious hits.

   in a previous paper we described copub [87][25], a database of
   co-occurrences of    250.000 keywords (including gene names and symbols)
   in medline abstracts. copub is a database in which the statistical
   relevance of all co-occurrences is pre-computed, which makes it
   possible to perform statistical analyses of the significance of the
   retrieved hidden relationships between biomedical concepts. in
   addition, copub contains several categories of controlled vocabularies
   such as genes, drugs, or diseases etc. as such, this database is
   ideally suited for use in the discovery of hidden relationships.

   in this paper we describe copub discovery, a method that uses the copub
   database for the open and closed discovery of hidden literature
   relationships. statistical analysis of the results using roc curves
   show that with copub discovery true hidden relationships can be
   distinguished from true negatives. application of this method in open
   ended retrieval of hidden relations yielded novel hypotheses about
   gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-biological process relationships
   which were validated bibliographically. moreover, we used copub
   discovery to identify two novel compounds that would interact with cell
   proliferation. experimental validation showed that these compounds dose
   dependently inhibited t-cell proliferation.

results

copub discovery performance evaluation

   as described above the challenge in the discovery of hidden
   relationships is to robustly discriminate true, biologically relevant,
   relationships (tp) from spurious, false positive hits (fp). we used
   receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analyses to evaluate the
   ability of copub discovery to distinguish tp from fp hidden
   relationships using literature partitioning as described in detail in
   the [88]materials and methods section and outlined in [89]figure 2. all
   the roc curves had aucs (area under the curve) higher than the auc of
   the curve for no discrimination ([90]figure 3). high auc's were
   obtained for all types of hidden relationships and a wide range of
   combinations of settings for inclusion of the intermediates. re-running
   the analysis with alternative scoring schemes, such as the average
   instead of the minimal r-scaled scores between a and b, and b and c or
   using the average of only the 5 top scoring intermediates or using
   drugs rather than genes as intermediates yielded similar results (data
   not shown). as an additional measure of performance of copub discovery,
   we calculated the time lag between the average publication date of all
   a   b and b   c intermediates and compared this date with the date of first
   appearance of a and c in the literature ([91]figure 4). the average
   time lag was 6.5 years, which is an indication to which extent
   discoveries can be accelerated when this type of hypothesis generation
   is used.

   taken together, these results show that copub discovery is a robust
   method that can be applied to quickly detect a variety of biologically
   relevant hidden relationships.

   figure 2. copub discovery validation by literature-partitioning.

   a literature-partitioning analysis was performed to evaluate copub
   discovery's ability to filter true positive (tp) from false positive
   (fp) hidden relationships in literature. abstracts published in the
   year 2000 up to may 1, 2007 were used to validate relationships
   inferred from abstracts published before the year 2000.

   receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analyses were performed
   to statistically evaluate the ability of copub discovery to distinguish
   true positive (tp) from false positive (fp) hidden relationships in
   literature. in this figure, roc curves are shown of gene-disease,
   drug-disease and drug-biological process hidden relationship analyses
   for several intermediate inclusion criteria. for each tested setting,
   the false positive rate was plotted against the true positive rate for
   each inferred r-scaled (r[i]) score cutoff.

   relationships in literature.

   the time lag between the data needed for prediction of a hidden
   relationship and its actual assertion in literature is plotted for 1000
   hidden relationships. for each hidden relationship, the average
   publication date of all a   b and b   c literature appearances was
   calculated and compared with the date on which a and c were first
   mentioned in the literature. note: the data was derived from the
   literature-partitioning analysis.

case studies

   after the formal validation with roc curves we used copub discovery to
   study a number of cases in an open discovery approach. we now used all
   medline abstracts published before may 1, 2007 to find hidden
   relationships between genes, pathways, drugs and diseases. for each
   hidden relationship an inferred r-scaled score (ri) was calculated. the
   biological rationale of the hidden relations with the highest ri were
   studied in more detail using the underlying literature that describes
   the connecting intermediates, as provided in the copub discovery
   output.

case study 1: disease-gene hidden relationships.

   graves' disease (gd) is a complex autoimmune thyroid disorder, which is
   characterized by hyperthyroidism (i.e. over-production of thyroid
   hormones). auto-antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone
   receptor were shown to be responsible for the hyperthyroidism in gd
   [116][26]. the mechanisms behind the onset of gd are not completely
   understood, but it is thought that the development of gd depends on
   complex interactions among environmental and genetic factors [117][27].

   copub discovery was used to identify genes that might play a role in
   gd, but with no known relationship with gd. the analysis was conducted
   allowing only genes as intermediates. several genes were found in
   literature with a hidden relationship with gd that had a ri score above
   the significance cutoff ([118]table 1a). at the top of the gene list,
   connected with 21 genes to gd, is programmed cell death 1 (pdcd1).

   pdcd1 is a cell surface receptor that regulates t-cell proliferation
   and activation, which was linked in earlier studies to autoimmune
   diseases like type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis [127][28],
   [128][29]. genetic studies, published after may 1, 2007 (which was not
   used for constructing the relationship between pdcd1 and gd) showed
   that small genetic effects within pdcd1 contribute to the development
   of gd [129][30], [130][31], and confirms that the proposed association
   between pdcd1 and gd by copub discovery is indeed biologically
   relevant. one of the genes that was identified as an intermediate
   between pdcd1 and gd is cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated antigen 4
   (ctla4) ([131]figure 5a). ctla4, like pdcd1, is a negative regulator of
   t-cell activation [132][32], and polymorphisms in this gene are
   associated with the onset of gd [133][33], [134][34]. studies report
   that ctla4 and pdcd1 act as co-inhibitors of t-cell proliferation and
   activation [135][35], [136][36]. this functional association between
   pdcd1 and ctla4 explains the relationship between pdcd1 and gd, and
   indicates that the copub discovery predicted association between pdcd1
   and gd was correctly identified based on biological knowledge.

   [144]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943.g005

case study 2: drug-disease hidden relationships.

   milnacipran, a serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor (snri), is
   a regularly prescribed drug to treat depression [145][37]. snris
   prevent the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenalin by pre-synaptic
   cells, and thereby increase the extracellular availability of serotonin
   and noradrenalin to bind to post-synaptic receptors, which enhances
   their biological effect [146][38].

   depression is often accompanied by chronic pain. therefore,
   antidepressants like milnacipran also become more widely applied to
   treat chronic pain [147][39], [148][40]. serotonin and noradrenalin act
   as key mediators in various biological processes, and therefore snris,
   due to their dual action of preventing reuptake of both serotonin and
   noradrenalin, are used to treat a range of distinct disorders.

   we used copub discovery to predict new applications for milnacipran.
   several disorders were found by copub discovery that had a significant,
   hidden relationship in literature with milnacipran using genes as
   intermediates ([149]table 1b). the top scoring disorder, connected with
   7 gene intermediates, is obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd).

   ocd is a common chronic anxiety disorder that can have disabling
   effects on both adults and children. ocd is characterized by recurrent
   obsessions and uncontrolled compulsions such as repetitive behavioral
   or mental acts that are performed in response to an obsession
   [150][41]. marble-burying behavior in mice is recognized as a model for
   ocd [151][42]. in this model, inhibition of marble burying is
   correlated with reduction of anxiety, which can be achieved by
   treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)
   [152][43]. several studies have shown that in addition to ssris, snris
   are also promising drug candidates for treatment of ocd [153][44],
   [154][45]. again, to validate the predicted association between
   milnacipran and ocd, we inquired the literature from may 1, 2007 until
   present for studies that report on a functional relationship between
   milnacipran and ocd. indeed, in a study published after may 1, 2007,
   milnacipran was found to significantly inhibit marble-burying behavior
   in mice [155][46], which demonstrates that the inferred relationship
   between milnacipran and ocd by copub discovery appears biologically
   valid.

   two genes that connect milnacipran and ocd are the norepinephrine
   transporter slc6a2 and the serotonin transporter slc6a4 ([156]figure
   5b). milnacipran, slc6a2 and slc6a4 are linked in literature by studies
   that report on the inhibitory effect of milnacipran on norepinephrine
   and serotonin uptake [157][47], [158][48], whereas susceptibility to
   ocd was linked in literature to polymorphisms in slc6a4 and slc6a2
   [159][49], [160][50]. these reports underpin a functional relationship
   between milnacipran and ocd, and shows that the predicted relationship
   between milnacipran and ocd by copub discovery can be well explained by
   the biology of the intermediates.

case study 3: drug - biological process hidden relationship.

   pitavastatin is a new synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl
   glutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase, which was shown to be a potent
   cholesterol-lowering agent [161][51]. the short-term and long-term
   lipid-modifying effects of pitavastatin have already been investigated
   in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia
   and type 2 diabetes mellitus [162][51], and the drug has been in phase
   iii trials in europe, us and japan [163][52].

   the primary effect of a drug on its target and on related cellular
   processes is in many cases well known, whereas other beneficial,
   pleiotropic effects are often less well understood or are not
   immediately clear from literature. to predict additional cellular
   effects of pitavastatin and to understand its mode of action, copub
   discovery was used predict relationships between biological processes
   and pitavastatin using genes and biological processes as intermediates.

   it appeared that the four top scoring biological processes represent
   cell differentiation processes ([164]table 1c). to assess whether
   pitavastatin indeed affects cell differentiation, we inspected the
   literature from after may 1, 2007 that report on such an association.
   for adipocyte differentiation, indeed a direct link between
   pitavastatin administration and cell differentiation was reported
   [165][53]. in this study, pitavastatin was shown to have an inhibitory
   effect on preadipocyte differentiation into mature adipocytes by
   attenuating the expression of peroxisome proliferator activated
   receptor gamma (ppar  ), a known inducer of adipogenesis [166][54],
   [167][55] and one of the intermediates in the hidden relationship
   between pitavastatin and adipocyte differentiation. this indicates that
   the predicted linkage between pitavastatin and adipocyte
   differentiation by copub discovery is very likely and merits further
   research.

   pivastatin is connected to monocyte activation/differentiation with 26
   intermediates ([168]table 1c). activation of monocytes induces monocyte
   migration to sites of inflammation and induces differentiation of
   monocytes into macrophages, dendritic cells and osteoclasts [169][56],
   [170][57]. inspection of the intermediates identified, among others,
   chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 2 (ccl2, also known as mcp1) and ppar  
   ([171]figure 5c). the literature that links monocyte activation and
   differentiation to ccl2 and ccl2 to pitavastatin, show that ccl2 is an
   inducer of monocyte activation and migration [172][58] and that
   pitavastatin attenuates gene expression of ccl2 in smooth muscle and
   endothelial cells [173][59], [174][60]. this raises the hypothesis that
   pitavastatin is able to block monocyte activation and migration by
   downregulation of ccl2 gene expression in ccl2-secreting cells.

   similarly, the literature shows that pitavastatin downregulates the
   expression of ppar   in macrophages [175][61]. the expression of ppar  
   is upregulated in activated monocytes/macrophages and ppar   plays a
   role in induction of differentiation of macrophages into foam cells
   [176][62], raising the possibility that by downregulating ppar  
   expression, pitavastatin is able to suppress activation and
   differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. the hypothesis that
   pitavastatin is linked to cell differentiation is in line with studies
   on simvastatin, which is also a hmg-coa reductase inhibitor, that was
   shown to affect cell differentiation [177][63], [178][64].

   altogether, pitavastatin is strongly linked to cell differentiation by
   copub discovery. in cardiovascular disease, aberrant differentiation of
   macrophages into foam cells leads to plaque formation at vascular
   endothelium cells and can cause occlusion of blood vessels [179][65],
   whereas over-abundance of adipocytes causing obesity is considered to
   be a major risk factor for type ii diabetes [180][66]. although the
   beneficial effect of pitavastatin on atherosclerosis and diabetes has
   been well recognized [181][51], the underlying mechanisms on how
   pitavastatin initiates these effects have remained elusive. based on
   the results of copub discovery, it might be hypothesized that
   pitavastatin might prevent foam cell formation by blocking monocyte
   differentiation via suppression of ccl2 and ppar   expression.
   furthermore, the proposed relationship between pitavastatin and
   adipocyte differentiation, which was confirmed in the literature
   [182][53], may explain the beneficial effect of pitavastatin on obesity
   and diabetes [183][66].

   taken together, the results of copub discovery show that this tool is
   well-suited to predict mechanisms of drug action and to derive
   hypothesis about the biological pathways that are involved.

case study 4: biological process - drug hidden relationship.

   to experimentally test a number of predicted relationships we used
   copub discovery to search for drugs that could interfere with cell
   proliferation, a process for which assays are readily available.
   several drugs were found to have a significant hidden relationship when
   using genes as intermediates with the term    cell proliferation   
   ([184]table 2). from this list, two top-scoring compounds; dephostatin,
   a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor [185][67], and damnacanthal, a
   protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor [186][68], were selected to test
   their hypothesized association with cell proliferation in an in vitro
   cell assay.

   human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were pre-incubated
   with damnacanthal or dephostatin for concentrations ranging from 0.01
   to 10   m, followed by incubation with cd3/cd28 antibodies, which
   triggers t lymphocyte proliferation. both damnacanthal and dephostatin
   inhibited proliferation of pbmcs for concentrations in the   m-range,
   with ec[50]'s of 2.67   m and 1.96   m respectively ([195]figure 6). cell
   viability and apoptosis were not affected by damnacanthal and
   dephostatin indicating that damnacanthal and dephostatin specifically
   inhibit cell proliferation.

   the predicted influence of damnacanthal (red line and bullets) and
   dephostatin (blue line and triangles) on cell proliferation was tested
   in an in vitro cell assay. for both damnacanthal and dephostatin, the
   percentage of inhibition was measured and plotted against compound
   concentration. both compounds were shown to inhibit cell proliferation
   in pbmcs when using concentrations in the 1 to 10   m-range. the ec[50]
   was estimated at 1.96   m for dephostatin and for damnacanthal at 2.67
     m.

   [203]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943.g006

   an earlier study showed that damnacanthal inhibits ras function
   [204][69], which provides a mechanism of action of how damnacanthal
   might influence cell proliferation, as ras oncogenes are involved in
   cell cycle regulation. a study performed prior may 2007 showed that
   dephostatin inhibits the growth of jurkat cells [205][70], therefore it
   can be argued that the inhibitory effect of dephostatin on cell
   proliferation was already known. however the term    cell proliferation   
   was not mentioned in the abstract of this paper and therefore copub
   discovery qualified the relationship between dephostatin and    cell
   proliferation    as novel.

   these experiments provide evidence that the predicted hidden
   relationships with copub discovery of damnacanthal and dephostatin with
   cell proliferation were indeed correct.

discussion

   in this paper we described copub discovery, a web-based tool that mines
   the medline database for novel relationships between genes, diseases,
   drugs and pathways. the results show that using hidden relationships,
   we can successfully identify novel disease-related genes, generate
   novel hypotheses on drug mode of action and predict novel lead compound
   applications.

   drug discovery is a difficult and time-consuming process. despite the
   strong increase in funding of research and development the last decade,
   the number of drugs that reach the market each year is lagging behind
   [206][71]. several strategies have been adopted to bridge this gap. the
   use of systems biology for gaining better knowledge on the mechanisms
   of drug action and toxicity [207][72]   [208][75] and the use of
   biomarkers that are predictive for a certain biological outcome
   [209][76]   [210][78], are widely used solutions to improve decision
   making. in addition, drug repositioning, which is the use of existing
   drugs for new applications, is another area that is gaining much
   attention as a means to boost drug development [211][79]. several text
   mining solutions have been developed to assist in and speed up the
   above strategies.

   in a recent paper, compillos et al. showed how id111 of drug
   labels, can be used to infer whether two drugs share the same target
   [212][80]. our study identified several novel targets for known drugs,
   based on a different algorithm and another text corpus. this indicates
   that mining of literature is an interesting and fruitful approach to
   identify new drug-target relations, a first step in developing drugs
   towards new applications.

   detailed knowledge of the mechanism of action of a drug and the
   biological processes that are targeted by a drug is of importance for
   fine tuning drugs and biomarker discovery. in an earlier study, we
   showed that the application of id111 on expression data from a
   toxicogenomics experiment yielded detailed insight in the mode of
   toxicity of the tested compounds [213][13]. with the hidden
   relationship algorithm presented in this paper we provide a id111
   tool that is independent of gene expression data, to improve the
   understanding of a drug's mechanism of action and the pathways targeted
   by that drug.

   although copub discovery is successful in identifying novel,
   biologically relevant relationships in literature, several improvements
   may be envisioned. for example, incorporation of additional evidence
   for true relationships between concepts from sources other than
   literature, such as protein-protein interaction data or gene
   co-expression data, could help prioritize relationships by biological
   relevance. furthermore, an additional measure of confidence could come
   from analyzing the relationships between the intermediates that connect
   a and c. a highly interconnected set of intermediates could
   indicate/validate higher biological relevance compared to a set with
   few interconnections.

   co-occurrence-based id111 does not capture the type of the
   extracted relationships (e.g. a binds, blocks, induces b). therefore,
   in the copub discovery web server the results are linked to the
   original abstracts in which the relationships were found. this enables
   the scientist to read the facts to uncover the type of relationship
   between a and c. a good starting point for discovery would be to look
   for intermediate nodes (b) that have the highest r-scaled scores for
   both node a and node c, because they have the strongest link between a
   and c. after selecting a few of these nodes, the researcher can perform
   a detailed analysis on the functional association between a and c by
   reading the abstracts in which a and b, and b and c are mentioned.
   additionally, incorporation of natural language processing in hidden
   relationship analysis could assist in determining the type and
   direction of the relationship between a and c.

   in the validation procedure of copub discovery using roc curve analysis
   we define fps as a   c relationships that are predicted in the literature
   before the year 2000 that were not detected in subsequent literature.
   it might be well true that a fp is in fact a novel discovery, but is
   not yet discovered in subsequent literature. furthermore, one can argue
   that a high area under the curve (auc) score indicates that copub
   discovery discovers very little that would not have been eventually
   discovered without it. in this respect, the 6.5 year time lag between
   the copub discovery and the report in literature may be more indicative
   of the true value of copub discovery; it significantly speeds up
   hypothesis generation, filtering and testing as was demonstrated in
   case example 4 in which we exactly followed this approach.

   evaluating the roc curves in light of the performance of other text
   mining tools is hampered by the fact that not all of the tools are
   accessible or work on different text corpora or use different thesauri.
   development of tools for discovery of hidden relationships would
   benefit from the use of expert-curated test and training sets on
   well-defined literature corpora, as is done in the biocreative text
   mining challenges.

   the statistical underpinning of copub discovery provides a significant
   advantage over existing id111 tools applied in the area of drug
   development [214][19], [215][22], [216][24]. it allows confidence level
   calculations for hidden relationships and facilitates the
   discrimination of biologically relevant from biologically less
   interesting hidden relationships. to ensure the quality of the hidden
   relationships, several stringencies were placed on the biomedical
   concepts used in copub discovery. for example, the biomedical concepts
   used in literature mining were all pre-tested for false positive
   generation upon inclusion in one of the biomedical concept thesauri.
   furthermore, only genes and biological processes are allowed as
   intermediates, which avoid relationships being formed by
   non-informative concepts, such as    protein   ,    cell assay   , etc.

   in short, the results in this paper show that copub discovery is able
   to identify novel associations between genes, drugs, pathways and
   diseases that have a high id203 of being biologically valid. the
   fact that this is done rapidly, in an automated way, makes the tool
   especially useful in areas where large amounts of data need to be
   analyzed. a typical use of this tool could be to quickly rank potential
   new biomarkers obtained from e.g. a microarray experiment, based on
   their relation to diseases and drugs. copub discovery could also help
   in drug repositioning in which list of drugs are clustered and ranked
   on basis of their relation with diseases and biological processes of
   interest.

materials and methods

id111 medline abstracts

   six thesauri containing human genes, gene ontology biological
   processes, liver pathologies, diseases, pathways and drugs were used to
   search medline xml files containing title, abstract and substances
   (1966     august 2009,
   [217]http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/licensee/2009_stats/baseline_doc.html),
   as described previously [218][13], [219][25]. the keyword thesauri are
   based on biological items, which represent an instance of a biological
   concept (e.g., a gene, a pathway), and may contain multiple keywords
   (e.g., a gene is assigned a full gene name, a gene symbol and gene
   aliases). typical full gene names contain commas and often additional
   descriptions in parenthesis, which makes a full gene name an inadequate
   direct search term. therefore, full gene names were processed by
   deleting all terms included in parentheses and allow a white space for
   each comma in the full name. two-letter gene symbols and aliases were
   removed from the thesaurus and all other gene symbols were compared to
   an english dictionary to remove common english words (such as    and   ,
      cell   , etc.).

   id157 were used to search the compiled medline text files
   for the presence of all keywords (   250.000) from the biological concept
   thesauri. for the full gene name descriptions the characters "]
   [.-)(,:;" and space were allowed preceding and following the full gene
   name and also an optional    s    was permitted to follow the full gene
   name. any white space in the full gene name was allowed to be a white
   space or a dash. the same id157 were applied to the
   non-gene biomedical concept descriptions (e.g. diseases, biological
   processes).

   keywords that generated a hit in a medline abstract were stored,
   together with the pubmed identifiers (ids) of the medline records in
   which the hit occurred. for every biological item the hits were made
   non-redundant (note: multiple keywords of a biological item can occur
   in the same medline abstract), resulting in a pubmed id-biological item
   list. gene symbol hits were examined for ambiguity. this was done by
   matching words of the full gene name in the abstract in which the gene
   symbol had a hit. when parts of the full gene name matched in the
   abstract, the gene symbol hit was regarded as a true positive;
   otherwise the gene symbol hit was discarded. the performance of the
   thesaurus-based keyword matching algorithm including the symbol
   disambiguation step was evaluated by repeating the human gene
   id172 task of the biocreative ii contest
   ([220]www.biocreative.org). copub reached a recall of 0.78 and a
   precision of 0.68, resulting in an f-measure of 0.73. based on this
   f-measure, copub would have been ranked 11^th out of 21 participants
   [221][81].

   co-publication of biological items (e.g. a gene with a biological
   process) was retrieved from the database by matching medline abstract
   occurrences. an r-scaled score ranging from 1   100, which describes the
   strength of a co-citation between two biological items given their
   individual frequencies of occurrence, was used to assess the
   significance of a co-occurrence [222][15]. the r-scaled score is based
   on the mutual information measure (mim) and was calculated as
   s   =   p[ab]/p[a]*p[b] in which p[a] is the number of hits for biological
   item a divided by the total number of pubmed ids, p[b] is the number of
   hits for biological item b divided by the total number of pubmed ids,
   and p[ab] is the number of co-occurrences between biological item a and
   biological item b divided by the total number of pubmed ids. the
   relative score r is produced as a log10 conversion of s (r   =   ^10log s)
   and the 1   100 scaled-log-transformed relative score (r-scaled score) as
   r'   =   1+99 * (r     r[min])/(r[max]     r[min]), where r[min] and r[max] are
   the lowest and highest r values present in the biological item
   co-publication list, respectively. a high r-scaled score indicates that
   if two biological concepts occur in literature they are often published
   together, this in contrast to a low r-scaled score which indicates that
   two biological concepts often occur separately in literature and less
   often together. based on previous experiences using copub for the
   interpretation of microarray data, an r-scaled score of above 40 can be
   regarded as biologically significant.

   the scoring of hidden relationships between biomedical concepts was
   adapted from wren's minimal mim (mmim) model [223][82] where we used an
   r-scaled score instead of a mim score. the strength of the hidden
   relationship between a and c is calculated using the r-scaled scores
   between a and b, and between b and c. this inferred r-scaled (ri) score
   between a and c is calculated by summation of the r-scaled scores over
   the intermediates b, taking the lowest score in each pair (ab, bc), and
   dividing by the number of intermediates ([224]figure 1).

bibliographic prediction and validation by literature partitioning

   medline was divided into two sets ([225]figure 2). one set, the
   background set, contained abstracts published before the year 2000. the
   second set, the test set, contained abstracts published from the year
   2000 up to may 1, 2007. biomedical concept pairs were formed from the
   background set, using the following criteria: 1) the members of the
   pair do not co-occur in any abstract. 2) each member of the pair occurs
   in at least 10 distinct abstracts. 3) the members share at least 5
   intermediates.

   the test set was then used to evaluate whether the pairs from the
   background set had a true relationship or not. a true relationship for
   a pair (tp) was defined using the following criteria: 1) the pair
   should have at least 3 co-occurrences in the test set. 2) the r-scaled
   score for this pair should be >40. all other pairs (fp) were regarded
   as not having a true relationship. copub discovery was then evaluated
   for the ability to predict tps from the background set.

   to this end an inferred r-scaled (ri) score was calculated for each
   pair of the background set and the performance of copub discovery of
   separating tp from fp relationships was measured with roc curves
   generated by varying the ri threshold. the area under the curve (auc)
   of the roc curve is equal to the id203 that a method will rank a
   randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen
   negative one [226][83].

   to allow comparison of copub discovery with other literature-based
   discovery tools we have made the validation data of copub discovery
   (roc curve analyses) available in supplementary [227]table s1.
   furthermore, we provide a web service with which the thesauri and
   publication data can be downloaded. the web server and web service
   implementation of the method described in this paper, copub discovery,
   is available at [228]http://www.copub.org.
