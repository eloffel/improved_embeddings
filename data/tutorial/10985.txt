   abstract

   context controversy and uncertainty ensue when the results of clinical
   research on the effectiveness of interventions are subsequently
   contradicted. controversies are most prominent when high-impact
   research is involved.

   objectives to understand how frequently highly cited studies are
   contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar
   studies and to discern whether specific characteristics are associated
   with such refutation over time.

   design all original clinical research studies published in 3 major
   general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in
   1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were
   examined.

   main outcome measure the results of highly cited articles were compared
   against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and
   similar or better controlled designs. the same analysis was also
   performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly
   cited.

   results of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45
   claimed that the intervention was effective. of these, 7 (16%) were
   contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16%) had found effects
   that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were
   replicated, and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged. five of 6
   highly-cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found
   stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (p = .008).
   among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects
   were smaller (p = .009) than replicated or unchallenged studies
   although there was no statistically significant difference in their
   early or overall citation impact. matched control studies did not have
   a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited
   studies, but they included more studies with    negative    results.

   conclusions contradiction and initially stronger effects are not
   unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their
   outcomes. the extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions
   and vice versa needs more study. controversies are most common with
   highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited
   randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially
   small ones.

   clinical research on important questions about the efficacy of medical
   interventions is sometimes followed by subsequent studies that either
   reach opposite conclusions or suggest that the original claims were too
   strong. such disagreements may upset clinical practice and acquire
   publicity in both scientific circles and in the lay press. several
   empirical investigations have tried to address whether specific types
   of studies are more likely to be contradicted and to explain observed
   controversies. for example, evidence exists that small studies may
   sometimes be refuted by larger ones.^[397]1^,[398]2

   similarly, there is some evidence on disagreements between
   epidemiological studies and randomized trials.^[399]3^-[400]5 prior
   investigations have focused on a variety of studies without any
   particular attention to their relative importance and scientific
   impact. yet, most research publications have little impact while a
   small minority receives most attention and dominates scientific
   thinking and clinical practice. impact is difficult to measure in all
   its dimensions. however, the number of citations received by a
   publication is a surrogate of the attention it has received in the
   scientific literature and its influence on scientific debate and
   progress. citations are readily and objectively counted in established
   databases.^[401]6 high citation count does not necessarily mean that
   these studies are accepted; citations may sometimes be critical of an
   article. nevertheless, citation count is a measure of how much a study
   has occupied the thinking of other scientists and has drawn
   attention   for good or bad.

   it is important to evaluate the replication of clinical research
   studies that have the highest citation impact. how frequently are such
   studies eventually contradicted by other research or are found to have
   too strong results compared with subsequent evidence? is this more
   common for specific types of studies? answering these questions would
   be useful for interpreting the results of influential clinical
   research.
   methods
   eligible original studies

   eligible original studies for this analysis included all publications
   that had received more than 1000 institute for scientific information
   (isi)   indexed^[402]6 citations; had been published between 1990 and
   2003 in the 3 general medical journals with the current highest impact
   factor (new england journal of medicine, jama, lancet) or in medical
   specialty journals with impact factor exceeding 7.0 (according to the
   journal citation reports 2003) that are likely to publish clinical
   research (including in decreasing impact factor, the journal of the
   national cancer institute, gastroenterology, annals of internal
   medicine, circulation, journal of clinical oncology, archives of
   general psychiatry, blood, hepatology, american journal of respiratory
   and critical care medicine, diabetes, brain, annals of neurology,
   journal of the american college of cardiology, diabetes care, journal
   of the american society of nephrology, arthritis and rheumatism, and
   the american journal of psychiatry); addressed the efficacy of
   therapeutic or preventive interventions; and pertained to primary data
   (excluding reviews and meta-analyses).

   citation counts for articles published between january 1, 1990, and
   december 31, 2003, in these journals were downloaded from isi. citation
   counts are censored on august 20, 2004. all articles with more than
   1000 citations were screened further. studies with group authorship may
   be cited in various ways; therefore, i summed up citations cataloged
   under different entries for the same article (using the first author
   name, group abbreviations, and anonymous entries).^[403]7 the total
   citation count does not capture the few citations for which wrong name,
   journal, volume, or page might have been cited. since citations depend
   on the time interval since publication, a separate citation count was
   limited to the first 3 years after the publication year.
   other clinical research on the same questions

   for each eligible original study, a search was performed to identify
   whether there had been any other concurrently or subsequently published
   clinical research addressing the same question. other research was
   considered eligible, only if the sample size was close to or larger
   than that of the highly cited original study or if it used a
   theoretically better controlled design. thus, for highly cited
   randomized trials, i perused all randomized trials having at least 30%
   of the sample size of the eligible highly cited original study.
   whenever available, quantitative meta-analyses of trials were used as
   summaries of trial results. whenever several pertinent meta-analyses
   were available, the one including the largest number of studies was
   preferred. for highly cited nonrandomized studies, subsequently
   published pertinent randomized trials and meta-analyses thereof were
   eligible regardless of sample size; nonrandomized evidence was also
   considered, if randomized trials were not available.

   concurrently or subsequently published evidence was identified in
   pubmed using searches that combined terms pertaining to the tested
   interventions, disease and outcome, and terms pertinent to the search
   of randomized trials and meta-analyses. searches followed the cochrane
   algorithms for finding meta-analyses and randomized trials.^[404]8
   data extraction and classification of studies

   for each eligible original study, i recorded the study name,
   intervention, disease and outcomes of interest, study design, sample
   size, main conclusions, and citation counts. for the articles
   presenting or summarizing other relevant research, i recorded the study
   design, total sample size, and the findings as compared with those of
   the original highly cited study.

   highly cited studies were classified as negative (when they claimed the
   tested experimental intervention was ineffective, harmful, or no better
   from the control intervention), unchallenged (when no other clinical
   research of eligible design and sample size was available to validate
   the claimed efficacy), contradicted, initially stronger effects, or
   replicated effects. the classification of studies in these categories
   was based on the final interpretation of the results by the authors in
   the    abstract    and    discussion    sections of their original
   publications. highly cited articles were classified according to
   whether their authors suggested that an intervention was overall
   effective or ineffective. when both benefits and harms or caveats were
   presented, i focused on the net conclusion of whether the experimental
   intervention merits consideration for use in clinical practice.
   subsequent research was classified in the same manner. contradiction
   was declared when the original highly cited study claimed the
   intervention to be effective, while subsequent research showed it to be
   ineffective. when both original and subsequent research claimed the
   intervention was effective, studies were compared further regarding the
   effect size for the major clinical outcome, the durability of the
   treatment effect, and the generalizability and applicability to various
   settings. initially stronger effects were defined when the relative
   risk reduction for the main outcome in the subsequent research was half
   or less compared with what had been proposed by the original highly
   cited study (regardless of whether confidence intervals might overlap
   or not), or when the subsequent research showed that the originally
   proposed benefit was of short duration or its applicability and
   generalizability was limited. classification of the studies
   independently by another investigator yielded a highly similar profile
   (weighted cohen    = 0.92).
   correlates of contradicted or initially stronger effects

   among original highly cited studies with efficacy claims, analyses
   examined whether those with contradicted or initially stronger effects
   differed from the replicated and unchallenged ones in study design,
   publication year, sample size, type of disease (heart disease vs
   other), journal of publication, citation count, early citation count,
   and average citations per year after publication. comparisons used the
   mann-whitney u test for continuous variables and fisher exact test for
   binary variables.
   comparison of highly cited articles against less cited articles

   to evaluate whether highly cited studies differ from other studies that
   are not so highly cited in their findings and potential for
   contradiction, a control group of articles pertaining to the assessment
   of interventions was also assembled. control-group articles were 1:1
   matched for journal, year of publication, and design (randomized vs
   nonrandomized) against each of the highly cited articles. control
   articles were selected by screening chronologically the contents of the
   pertinent journals for each pertinent year starting july 1 (to ensure
   approximately similar follow-up for citations with the highly cited
   articles against which they were matched). other research was searched
   and the control articles were categorized in a similar fashion as
   described for the highly cited articles above. differences between
   highly cited and control articles were examined with conditional
   id28 to account for matching.
   analyses

   analyses were performed in spss version 12.0 (spss inc, chicago, ill)
   and statxact (cytel corp, boston, mass). p values are 2-tailed, and
   p<.05 was considered statistically significant.
   results
   eligible studies

   one hundred fifteen articles published between 1990 and 2003 had
   received more than 1000 citations (major general clinical journals,
   n = 91; specialty journals, n = 24). of those, 66 were excluded
   (nonsystematic reviews or editorials, n = 20; meta-analyses, n = 7;
   case-control studies of risk factors, n = 12; prevalence or incidence
   studies, n = 8; cohort studies of risk factors, n = 3; recommendations,
   n = 3; prognostic models, n = 4; time-trend analysis, n = 1; case
   series, n = 1; presentations of interviews, instruments, or assays
   n = 3, classification criteria n = 4). the remaining 49 articles were
   eligible ([405]table 1)^[406]9^-[407]57 of which 47 had appeared in
   major general medical journals. they included 43 randomized trials, 4
   prospective cohorts, and 2 case series. in recent years (1998 through
   2003), the 3 general journals have published an almost equal number of
   highly cited articles (new england journal of medicine, n = 4; jama,
   n = 3; lancet, n = 3). a smaller proportion of highly cited articles
   published in specialty journals than those published in general
   journals were eligible for the analysis (2/24 vs 47/91, p<.001),
   because highly cited articles in specialized journals were mostly
   nonsystematic reviews or editorials (10/24); classification criteria
   (4/24); or descriptions of standardized interviews, instruments, and
   assays (3/24). many diverse disciplines were represented, but the most
   common topic was heart disease (n = 27).

   four eligible highly cited studies showed no efficacy for the tested
   interventions. they contradicted prior claims for potential efficacy of
   vitamin e, beta carotene, and retinol for lung cancer and/or coronary
   artery disease; and showed an increased risk of coronary artery disease
   with hormone therapy in postmenopausal women ([408]table 2).

   of the 45 eligible highly cited studies with efficacy claims
   ([409]table 2), 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent research, and
   another 7 (16%) were found to have initially stronger effects. in all
   these 14 cases ([410]box 1), subsequent studies were either larger or
   better controlled (randomized vs a nonrandomized original study). the
   findings of 20 highly cited articles (44%) were replicated (also with a
   larger sample size in subsequent research compared with the original
   highly cited study) and 11 (24%) had remained largely
   unchallenged.^[411]58^-[412]78
   box section ref idbox 1. contradicted and initially stronger effects in
   highly cited studies

   contradicted findings

   the nurses    health study,^[413]13 a prospective cohort, found a 44%
   relative risk reduction in coronary artery disease events in women
   receiving hormone therapy. a small randomized trial^[414]42 found major
   beneficial effects of this intervention on surrogate markers of
   coronary artery disease (lipoprotein and fibrinogen levels) claiming
   that this should translate to a major clinical benefit. although the
   latter trial was not refuted at the level of surrogate outcomes,
   id136s for the anticipated effects on clinical outcomes were
   contradicted. the women   s health initiative,^[415]46 a large randomized
   trial, found that estrogen and progestin significantly increased the
   relative risk of coronary events by 29% among postmenopausal women, and
   refuting results were also seen in another large randomized trial, the
   heart and estrogen/progestin replacement study (hers).^[416]44

   two large prospective cohort studies, the health professionals
   follow-up study^[417]20 and the nurses    health study,^[418]21 found
   that vitamin e was significantly associated with a decreased risk of
   coronary artery disease and a trial of 2002 patients also suggested a
   47% relative risk reduction for cardiovascular deaths or nonfatal
   myocardial infarction with vitamin e.^[419]51 however, an even larger
   randomized trial^[420]66 subsequently showed absolutely no beneficial
   effect for vitamin e on coronary artery disease (relative risk 1.05 for
   cardiovascular deaths and 1.02 for myocardial infarction).

   a small randomized trial (n = 200) suggested that the human igm
   monoclonal antibody to endotoxin could almost halve mortality due to
   gram-negative sepsis.^[421]15 a subsequent randomized trial of more
   than 10-fold larger sample size^[422]62 found a nonsignificant 11%
   relative risk increase for mortality.

   finally, a small series of 9 patients^[423]22 proposed that nitric
   oxide inhalation is very effective in patients with respiratory
   distress syndrome by improving oxygenation. however 5 randomized trials
   involving 535 patients^[424]67 failed to show any clinical benefit.

   initially stronger effects

   the early results of a trial on zidovudine monotherapy in asymptomatic
   patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection^[425]9 showed a
   significant 60% relative risk reduction against disease progression in
   the first year. the short-term benefit was not exaggerated. yet this
   effect was short-lived and the benefit was lost after 18 months both in
   the same trial and also as shown in a subsequent meta-analysis.^[426]58

   a randomized trial of 395 patients^[427]18 showed that immediate
   angioplasty was superior to thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen
   activator in acute myocardial infarction, achieving a 58% relative risk
   reduction for death or reinfarction. however, a subsequent
   meta-analysis with more than 2500 patients^[428]65 suggested that the
   benefit is probably much smaller (relative risk reduction 30%) and the
   largest and most recent trial that involved both specialized and
   nonspecialized centers had not shown any sizeable benefit of
   angioplasty (nonsignificant 20% risk reduction for death and
   nonsignificant 33% risk reduction for reinfarction).

   two randomized trials of 410 and 520 patients,
   respectively,^[429]26^,[430]27 showed that stents were superior to
   balloon angioplasty for management of coronary artery disease with 31%
   and 42% relative risk reductions, respectively, in the need for
   revasularization. current evidence, as summarized by a meta-analysis of
   almost 10 000 patients, suggests that the benefit is probably much
   smaller that originally thought (approximately 10% relative risk
   reduction), and unblinding may have led to an increased effect on
   repeat angioplasty in these trials.^[431]69

   another trial suggested a prime role for tissue plasminogen activator
   in acute ischemic stroke.^[432]29 however, subsequent evidence has
   narrowed indications and the intervention is considered effective
   mostly when given very early after symptom onset.^[433]70

   carotid endarterectomy was initially reported to achieve a 5.9%
   absolute risk reduction for stroke or death, projected at 5
   years,^[434]43 in patients with asymptomatic stenosis of the carotid
   artery exceeding 60%. a meta-analysis of several trials suggested a
   more modest benefit with 2% absolute risk reduction at 3.1
   years.^[435]75

   finally, a cohort study of 805 people found a 68% adjusted relative
   risk reduction for coronary artery disease with flavonoids^[436]48
   while a meta-analysis of prospective cohorts with total sample size
   exceeding 100 000 suggests only a 20% relative risk reduction in the
   top vs bottom third of flavonoid uptake.^[437]76
   comparison of contradicted or initially stronger vs replicated or
   unchallenged findings

   five of 6 highly cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or
   had initially stronger effects while this was seen in only 9 of 39
   highly cited randomized trials (p = .008). [438]table 3 shows that
   trials with contradicted or initially stronger effects had
   significantly smaller sample sizes and tended to be older than those
   with replicated or unchallenged findings. there were no significant
   differences on the type of disease. the proportion of contradicted or
   initially stronger effects did not differ significantly across journals
   (p = .60). there was also no significant difference in the number of
   citations received in the first 3 years between these 2 groups or in
   the overall number of citations over time although the citations per
   year tended to be nonsignificantly fewer in trials with contradicted or
   initially stronger effects.

   20 there were also other interventions evaluated that had    negative   
   results although this mixture of    positive    and    negative    results had
   not been observed in any of the highly cited articles. the control
   articles had a larger number of    negative    findings compared with the
   highly cited articles (matched odds ratio [or], 8; 95% confidence
   interval [ci], 1.8-34; p = .006 for any    negative    finding; and matched
   or, 3.3; 95% ci, 0.92-12.0, p = .07 for exclusively    negative   
   findings). the highly cited articles did not have a smaller proportion
   of contradicted or initially stronger effects than the control articles
   if anything there was a trend for more contradicted or initially
   stronger effects in the highly cited articles (matched or, 1.6; 95% ci,
   0.6-4.0; p = .35; matched or, 6.0; 95% ci, 0.7-50; p = .10 when limited
   to contradicted findings).

   contradicted findings

   in a prospective cohort,^[501]91 vitamin a was inversely related to
   breast cancer (relative risk in the highest quintile, 0.84; 95%
   confidence interval [ci], 0.71-0.98) and vitamin a supplementation was
   associated with a reduced risk (p = .03) in women at the lowest
   quintile group; in a randomized trial^[502]128 exploring further the
   retinoid-breast cancer hypothesis, fenretinide treatment of women with
   breast cancer for 5 years had no effect on the incidence of second
   breast malignancies.

   a trial (n = 51) showed that cladribine significantly improved the
   clinical scores of patients with chronic progressive multiple
   sclerosis.^[503]119 in a larger trial of 159 patients, no significant
   treatment effects were found for cladribine in terms of changes in
   clinical scores.^[504]129

   initially stronger effects

   a trial (n = 28) of aerosolized ribavirin in infants receiving
   mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory syncytial virus
   infection^[505]82 showed significant decreases in mechanical
   ventilation (4.9 vs 9.9 days) and hospital stay (13.3 vs 15.0 days). a
   meta-analysis of 3 trials (n = 104) showed a decrease of only 1.8 days
   in the duration of mechanical ventilation and a nonsignificant decrease
   of 1.9 days in duration of hospitalization.^[506]130

   a trial (n = 406) of intermittent diazepam administered during fever to
   prevent recurrence of febrile seizures^[507]90 showed a significant 44%
   relative risk reduction in seizures. the effect was smaller in other
   trials and the overall risk reduction was no longer formally
   significant^[508]131; moreover, the safety profile of diazepam was
   deemed unfavorable to recommend routine preventive use.

   a case-control and cohort study evaluation^[509]92 showed that the
   increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome among infants who sleep
   prone is increased by use of natural-fiber mattresses, swaddling, and
   heating in bedrooms. several observational studies have been done
   since, and they have provided inconsistent results on these
   interventions, in particular, they disagree on the possible role of
   overheating.^[510]132

   a trial of 54 children^[511]95 showed that the steroid budenoside
   significantly reduced the croup score by 2 points at 4 hours, and
   significantly decreased readmissions by 86%. a meta-analysis
   (n = 3736)^[512]133 showed a significant improvement in the westley
   score at 6 hours (1.2 points), and 12 hours (1.9 points), but not at 24
   hours. fewer return visits and/or (re)admissions occurred in patients
   treated with glucocorticoids, but the relative risk reduction was only
   50% (95% ci, 24%-64%).

   a trial (n = 55) showed that misprostol was as effective as
   dinoprostone for termination of second-trimester pregnancy and was
   associated with fewer adverse effects than dinoprostone.^[513]96 a
   subsequent trial^[514]134 showed equal efficacy, but a higher rate of
   adverse effects with misoprostol (74%) than with dinoprostone (47%).

   a trial (n = 50) comparing botulinum toxin vs glyceryl trinitrate for
   chronic anal fissure concluded that both are effective alternatives to
   surgery but botulinum toxin is the more effective nonsurgical treatment
   (1 failure vs 9 failures with nitroglycerin).^[515]109 in a
   meta-analysis^[516]135 of 31 trials, botulinum toxin compared with
   placebo showed no significant efficacy (relative risk of failure, 0.75;
   95% ci, 0.32-1.77), and was also no better than glyceryl trinitrate
   (relative risk of failure, 0.48; 95% ci, 0.21-1.10); surgery was more
   effective than medical therapy in curing fissure (relative risk of
   failure, 0.12; 95% ci, 0.07-0.22).

   a trial of acetylcysteine (n = 83) showed that it was highly effective
   in preventing contrast nephropathy (90% relative risk
   reduction).^[517]110 there have been many more trials and many
   meta-analyses on this topic. the latest meta-analysis^[518]136 shows a
   nonsignificant 27% relative risk reduction with acetylcysteine.

   a trial of 129 stunted jamaican children found that both nutritional
   supplementation and psychosocial stimulation improved the mental
   development of stunted children; children who got both interventions
   had additive benefits and achieved scores close to those of nonstunted
   children.^[519]117 with long-term follow-up, however, it was found that
   the benefits were small and the 2 interventions no longer had additive
   effects.^[520]137
   comment

   original highly cited articles about medical interventions are
   published almost exclusively in 3 general medical journals. actually,
   there has been an approximate equal share of very highly cited articles
   among these 3 journals since 1998 as impact factor differences have
   diminished among these 3 journals. articles in specialty journals that
   reach such high numbers of citations are usually review articles or
   articles describing tools useful to specific diseases rather than
   original data. contradicted and potentially exaggerated findings are
   not uncommon in the most visible and most influential original clinical
   research: 16% of the top-cited clinical research articles on postulated
   effective medical interventions that have been published within the
   last 15 years have been contradicted by subsequent clinical studies and
   another 16% have been found to have initially stronger effects than
   subsequent research. contradiction or initially stronger effects have
   been encountered in 5 of 6 cases for which nonrandomized designs were
   used, but even randomized trials have not escaped controversy. more
   than a third of the top-cited randomized trials published from 1990
   through 1995 have already been affected, while for more recent trials,
   the time frame is still early and more may be contradicted in the
   future. sample size seems to be important, with smaller sample sizes in
   trials that have met controversy vs those that have not.

   the classification of studies in this analysis involves many judgments
   pertaining to the complexity of studying a given research question with
   somewhat different populations, interventions, durations, and outcomes.
   however, these studies are widely known for their id136s and this
   is also proven by the high interrater agreement. nevertheless, it
   should also be acknowledged that although the classification was
   performed in duplicate, the searches were performed by only 1
   investigator. it is unavoidable that some other investigators may feel
   differently about the categorization of specific studies, especially
   for topics that may also have heavy debates surrounding them. however,
   this is unlikely to change the aggregate picture about refutation
   rates.

   the examination of contradictions and refutations offers a fascinating
   look at the process of science. four of the highly cited articles
   examined herein were refuting investigations with    negative    results.
   however, in a sense, even the other highly cited articles with
      positive    results refuted prior knowledge and practice by introducing
   new concepts and proposing new interventions. we should acknowledge
   that there is no proof that the subsequent studies and meta-analyses
   were necessarily correct. a perfect gold standard is not possible in
   clinical research, so we can only interpret results of studies relative
   to other studies. whenever new research fails to replicate early claims
   for efficacy or suggests that efficacy is more limited than previously
   thought, it is not necessary that the original studies were totally
   wrong and the newer ones are correct simply because they are larger or
   better controlled. alternative explanations for these discrepancies may
   include differences in disease spectrum, eligibility criteria, or the
   use of concomitant interventions.^[521]156 different studies on the
   same question are typically not replicas of each other. in fact
   discrepancies may be interesting on their own because they require
   careful scrutiny of the data and reappraisal of our beliefs. thus, it
   is probably not surprising that the citation rate of these refuted
   studies did not seem to be much affected. nevertheless, the controversy
   generates considerable uncertainty for clinical practice and none of
   the contradicted interventions is currently recommended by practice
   guidelines.

   the mere fact that a study is highly cited suggests that there is a
   strong active interest in the questions addressed from a clinical or
   research perspective. this may increase the chances that other, larger
   trials may eventually be conducted. however, for most clinical
   questions of interest, no large trials are ever conducted and evidence
   is based only on small trials or nonrandomized studies.^[522]157 small
   trials or meta-analyses thereof may often be refuted subsequently by
   large trials^[523]1^,[524]2 when such large trials are performed. small
   studies using surrogate markers may also sometimes lead to erroneous
   clinical id136s.^[525]158 there were only 2 studies with typical
   surrogate markers among the highly cited studies examined herein, but
   both were subsequently contradicted in their clinical extrapolations
   about the efficacy of nitric oxide^[526]22 and hormone therapy.^[527]42
   in the case of initially stronger effects, the differences in the
   effect sizes could often be within the range of what would be expected
   based on chance variability. this reinforces the notion that results
   from clinical studies, especially early ones, should be interpreted
   using not only the point estimates but also the uncertainty surrounding
   them. however, besides differences in effect sizes, most initially
   stronger effects pertained also to issues of durability,
   generalizability, or applicability of the proposed effects, as
   discussed above. thus, clinicians should be aware that these important
   aspects may not be fully settled when an important treatment
   breakthrough is announced.

   a third of the most-cited clinical research seems to have replication
   problems, and this seems to be as large, if not larger, than the vast
   majority of other, less-cited clinical research. the current analysis
   found that matched studies that were not so highly cited had a greater
   proportion of    negative    findings and similar or smaller proportions of
   contradicted results as the highly cited ones. publication
   bias^[528]159^,[529]160 and time-lag bias^[530]161^,[531]162 favoring
   the rapid and prominent publication of    positive    findings may underlie
   some of the observed phenomena. highly cited articles are already a
   selected sample with underrepresentation of    negative    findings
   compared with the average article on interventions published in major
   journals. it is possible that high-profile journals may tend to publish
   occasionally very striking findings and that this may lead to some
   difficulty in replicating some of these findings.^[532]163 poynard et
   al^[533]164 evaluated the conclusions of hepatology-related articles
   published between 1945 and 1999 and found that, overall, 60% of these
   conclusions were considered to be true in 2000 and that there was no
   difference between randomized and nonrandomized studies or high- vs
   low-quality studies. allowing for somewhat different definitions, the
   higher rates of refutation and the generally worse performance of
   nonrandomized studies in the present analysis may stem from the fact
   that i focused on a selected sample of the most noticed and influential
   clinical research. for such highly cited studies, the turnaround of
      truth    may be faster; in particular nonrandomized studies may be more
   likely to be probed and challenged than nonrandomized studies published
   in the general literature.

   finally, a certain proportion of highly cited trials may remain
   unchallenged. sometimes the evidence from the original study may seem
   so overwhelming that further similar studies are deemed unethical to
   perform. the original study may be widely considered as a milestone for
   clinical practice and may provide the gold standard for testing new
   interventions. however, sometimes other, validating research may be in
   the works. clinical research is time-consuming and challenging results
   may take several years to generate and publish. therefore evidence from
   recent trials, no matter how impressive, should be interpreted with
   caution, when only one trial is available. it is important to know
   whether other similar or larger trials are still ongoing or being
   planned. therefore, transparent and thorough trial registration is of
   paramount importance^[534]165 in order to limit premature claims for
   efficacy.
