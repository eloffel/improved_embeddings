   abbreviations: ppv, positive predictive value

   we know there is a lot of lack of replication in research findings,
   most notably in the field of genetic associations [[62]1   3]. for
   example, a survey of 600 positive associations between gene variants
   and common diseases showed that out of 166 reported associations
   studied three or more times, only six were replicated consistently
   [[63]4]. lack of replication results from a number of factors such as
   publication bias, selection bias, type i errors, population
   stratification (the mixture of individuals from heterogeneous genetic
   backgrounds), and lack of statistical power [[64]5].

   in a recent article in plos medicine, john ioannidis quantified the
   theoretical basis for lack of replication by deriving the positive
   predictive value (ppv) of the truth of a research finding on the basis
   of a combination of factors. he showed elegantly that most claimed
   research findings are false [[65]6]. one of his findings was that the
   more scientific teams involved in studying the subject, the less likely
   the research findings from individual studies are to be true. the rapid
   early succession of contradictory conclusions is called the    proteus
   phenomenon    [[66]7]. for several independent studies of equal power,
   ioannidis showed that the id203 of a research finding being true
   when one or more studies find statistically significant results
   declines with increasing number of studies.

   as part of the scientific enterprise, we know that replication   the
   performance of another study statistically confirming the same
   hypothesis   is the cornerstone of science and replication of findings is
   very important before any causal id136 can be drawn. while the
   importance of replication is also acknowledged by ioannidis, he does
   not show how ppvs of research findings increase when more studies have
   statistically significant results. in this essay, we demonstrate the
   value of replication by extending ioannidis' analyses to calculation of
   the ppv when multiple studies show statistically significant results.

   the id203 that a study yields a statistically significant result
   depends on the nature of the underlying relationship. the id203
   is 1 -    (one minus the type ii error rate) if the relationship is
   true, and a (type i error rate) when the relationship is false, i.e.,
   there is no relationship. similarly, the id203 that r out of n
   studies yield statistically significant results also depends on whether
   the underlying relationship is true or not. let b(p,r,n) denote the
   id203 of obtaining at least r statistically significant results
   out of n independent and identical studies, with p being the
   id203 of a statistically significant result. b(p,r,n) is
   calculated as [journal.pmed.0040028.ex001] in this formula, p is 1 -   
   when the underlying relationship is true and a when it is false. let r
   be the pre-study odds and c be the number of relationships being probed
   in the field. the pre-study id203 of a relationship being true is
   given by r/(r + 1). the expected values of the 2    2 table are given in
   [67]table 1. when r is equal to one, entries in [68]table 1 are
   identical to those in table 3 of ioannidis [[69]6]. the id203
   that, in the absence of bias, at least r out of n independent studies
   find statistically significant results is given by (rb(1 -   ,r,n) +
   b(  ,r,n))/(r + 1) and the ppv when at least r studies are statistically
   significant is rb(1 -   ,r,n)/((rb(1 -   ,r,n) + b(  ,r,n)).

positive predictive value as a function of study replication

   we examine the ppv as a function of the number of statistically
   significant findings. [78]figure 1 shows the ppv of at least one, two,
   or three statistically significant research findings out of ten
   independent studies as a function of the pre-study odds of a true
   relationship (r) for powers of 20% and 80%. the lower lines correspond
   to ioannidis' finding and indicate the id203 of a true
   association when at least one out of ten studies shows a statistically
   significant result. as can be seen, the ppv is substantially higher
   when more research findings are statistically significant. thus, a few
   positive replications can considerably enhance our confidence that the
   research findings reflect a true relationship. when r ranged from
   0.0001 to 0.01, a higher number of positive studies is required to
   attain a reasonable ppv. the difference in ppv for power of 80% and
   power of 20% when at least three studies are positive is higher than
   when at least one study is positive. [79]figure 2 gives the ppv for
   increasing number of positive studies out of ten, 25, and 50 studies
   for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 for powers of 20% and
   80%. when there is at least one positive study (r = 1) and power equal
   to 80%, as indicated in ioannidis' paper, ppv declined approximately
   50% for 50 studies compared to ten studies for r values between 0.0001
   and 0.1. however, ppv increases with increasing number of positive
   studies and the percentage of positive studies required to achieve a
   given ppv declines with increasing number of studies. the number of
   positive studies required to achieve a ppv of at least 70% increased
   from eight for ten studies to 12 for 50 studies when pre-study odds
   equaled 0.0001, from five for ten studies to eight for 50 studies when
   pre-study odds equaled 0.01, from three for ten studies to six for 50
   studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.1, and from two for ten studies
   to five for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.5. the difference
   in ppv for powers of 80% and 20% declines with increasing number of
   studies.

id203 distribution of statistically significant results

   although the ppv increases with increasing statistically significant
   results, the id203 of obtaining at least r significant results
   declines with increasing r. this id203 and the corresponding ppv
   for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 are given for ten
   studies in [96]table 2. when power is 20% and pre-study odds are
   0.0001, the id203 of obtaining at least three statistically
   significant results is 1% and the corresponding ppv is 0.3%. this
   id203 and the corresponding ppv increase with increasing
   pre-study odds. for example, when r = 0.1, the id203 of obtaining
   at least three significant results is 4% and the ppv is 74%. as
   expected, both the id203 of obtaining statistically significant
   results and the corresponding ppv increase with increasing power.
   however, for very small r values (around 0.0001), the increase in power
   has a minimal impact in the id203 of obtaining at least one, two,
   or three statistically significant results. when power is 80%, the
   id203 of obtaining at least three statistically significant
   results is 1.2% and the corresponding ppv is 0.9% for r = 0.0001, and
   when pre-study odds are 0.1, the id203 of obtaining at least
   three statistically significant results increases to 10% and the
   corresponding ppv to 90%.

comment

   the importance of research replication was discussed in a nature
   genetics editorial in 1999 lamenting the nonreplication of association
   studies [[105]8]. the editor emphasized that when authors submit
   manuscripts reporting genetic associations, the study should include an
   effect size and it should contain either a replication in an
   independent sample or physiologically meaningful data supporting a
   functional role of the polymorphism in question. while we acknowledge
   that our assumptions of identical design, power, and level of
   significance reflect a somewhat simplified scenario of replication, we
   quantified the positive predictive value of true research findings for
   increasing numbers of significant results. true replication, however,
   requires a precise process where the exact same finding is reexamined
   in the same way. more often than not, genuine replication is not done,
   and what we end up with in the literature is corroboration or indirect
   supporting evidence. while this may be acceptable to some extent in any
   scientific enterprise, the distance from this to data dredging, moving
   the goal post, and other selective reporting biases is often very small
   and can contribute to    pseudo    replication.

   replication does not mean that we can have underpowered studies; even
   when we have several underpowered studies replicate a finding, the ppv
   remains low. good replication practices require adequately powered
   studies. more generally, meta-analysis is a more useful approach to
   assess the totality of evidence in a body of work. ioannidis discussed
   the importance of meta-analysis, and its weaknesses in cases where even
   the meta-analysis is underpowered.

   our calculations have not considered the possibility of bias, i.e.,
   selective reporting problems that may change some    negative    results to
      positive    or may leave    negative    results unpublished. john ioannidis
   has shown that modest bias can decrease the ppv steeply [[106]6].
   therefore if replication is to work in genuinely increasing the ppv of
   research claims, it should be coupled with full transparency and
   non-selective reporting of research results. note that when hypotheses
   are one-sided, according to our definition of replication, we only
   consider hypotheses that are in the same direction. under this
   definition, statistically significant results in both directions do not
   arise. however, in meta-analysis, one can combine results that are
   significant in opposite directions. calculations in a formal
   meta-analysis may not square fully with the id136 presented here,
   since meta-analysis would incorporate both effect sizes and their
   uncertainty rather than just the    positive    versus    negative   
   id136. for example, we may have the necessary number of    positive   
   studies, but if the observed    positive    effects are small and all the
   other studies have trends in the opposite direction, the summary effect
   may well be null.

   in summary, while we agree with ioannidis that most research findings
   are false, we clearly demonstrate that replication of research findings
   enhances the positive predictive value of research findings being true.
   while this is not unexpected, it should be encouraging news to
   researchers in their never-ending pursuit of scientific hypothesis
   generation and testing. nevertheless, more methodologic work is needed
   to assess and interpret cumulative evidence of research findings and
   their biological plausibility. this is especially urgent in the
   exploding field of genetic associations.
