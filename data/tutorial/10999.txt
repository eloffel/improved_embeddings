abstract

   there has been a long history of research into the structure and
   evolution of mankind's scientific endeavor. however, recent progress in
   applying the tools of science to understand science itself has been
   unprecedented because only recently has there been access to
   high-volume and high-quality data sets of scientific output (e.g.,
   publications, patents, grants) and computers and algorithms capable of
   handling this enormous stream of data. this article reviews major work
   on models that aim to capture and recreate the structure and dynamics
   of scientific evolution. we then introduce a general process model that
   simultaneously grows coauthor and paper id191. the
   statistical and dynamic properties of the networks generated by this
   model are validated against a 20-year data set of articles published in
   pnas. systematic deviations from a power law distribution of citations
   to papers are well fit by a model that incorporates a partitioning of
   authors and papers into topics, a bias for authors to cite recent
   papers, and a tendency for authors to cite papers cited by papers that
   they have read. in this tarl model (for topics, aging, and recursive
   linking), the number of topics is linearly related to the id91
   coefficient of the simulated paper citation network.

   models capturing the structure and evolution of mankind's scientific
   endeavor are expected to provide insights into the inner workings of
   science. they are developed to provide objective guidance to augment
   decisions concerning resource allocation (identification of research
   frontiers, determining award amount, many small vs. a few large
   grants), optimum interdisciplinary collaboration (too little
   collaboration might lead to duplication, too much may lead to rather
   shallow science), the influence of publishing mechanisms (books vs.
   fast e-journals), and so on.

   two kinds of models are commonly distinguished: descriptive models that
   aim to describe the major features of a (typically static) data set and
   process models that model the mechanisms and temporal dynamics by which
   real-world networks (e.g., coauthor or paper id191) are
   created. most research in bibliometrics ([142]1), scientometrics
   ([143]2), or knowledge domain visualizations ([144]3) has focused on
   descriptive models. for example, research has studied the statistical
   patterns of coauthorship networks, paper id191, individual
   differences in citation practice, the composition of knowledge domains,
   and the identification of research fronts as indicated by new but
   highly cited papers. recent work in statistical physics and sociology
   aims to design process models. of particular interest is the
   identification of elementary mechanisms that lead to the emergence of
   small-world ([145]4, [146]5) and scale-free network structures ([147]6,
   [148]7).

   the model proposed in this article is unique in that it simulates the
   simultaneous growth of more than one network structure, here authors
   and papers. the core assumption is that the twin networks of scientific
   researchers and scholarly articles mutually support one another.
   researchers connect articles to one another in coid191, and
   articles link researchers to one another in coauthorship networks.

   the model provides a grounded mechanism for modeling the
      rich-get-richer    phenomenon for paper id191 as an emergent
   property of the elementary networking activity of authors reading and
   citing articles and also the references listed in read articles. the
   generalized rich-get-richer phenomenon is also known as the mathew
   effect ([149]8), cumulative advantage ([150]9), or preferential
   attachment ([151]10).

   the growth of scientific publications and citations is governed by two
   underlying processes: growth and aging ([152]11). growth seems to be
   important for the development of scale-free networks. aging is an
   antagonistic force to preferential attachment. even highly connected
   nodes typically stop receiving links after time has passed. the bias to
   cite newer papers frequently prevents a scale-free distribution of
   connectivity ([153]12). in the proposed model, an aging bias offsets
   the rich-get-richer phenomenon for paper id191.

   a 20-year data set of articles published in pnas is used to validate
   the model in terms of major network properties of the interlinked
   coauthor and paper id191.

   the subsequent sections review related research on descriptive and
   process models of coauthor and paper id191, discuss
   desirable features and basic assumptions of the process model, validate
   the model by comparing simulated data to a 20-year isi[154]    pnas data
   set, and discuss the influence of model parameters such as the aging of
   papers in terms of their power to attract citations, the number of
   topics, and the length of the chain of references that authors consider
   when making citations. the article concludes with a discussion and
   outlook.

related work

   there is a long history in bibliometrics ([155]1) and scientometrics
   ([156]2) of describing the structure and evolution of science ([157]3).
   as early as 1964, garfield and his colleagues ([158]13) proposed using
   citation data to study and write the history of science. citation data
   has also been used to identify the associations between authors,
   publications, patents, grants, data, and more recently genes, proteins,
   diseases, etc. associations have been discovered over time, space, and
   fields to identify changing frontiers of science ([159]14), measure
   science ([160]15), or recognize research fronts ([161]16).

   research on process models seeks to simulate, statistically describe,
   or formally reproduce statistical characteristics of interest. of
   particular interest are models that    conform to the measured data not
   only on the level where the discovery was originally made but also at
   the level where the more elementary mechanisms are observable and
   verifiable    ([162]17).

   recent work in statistical physics aims to design models and tools to
   analyze the statistical mechanics of topology and dynamics of diverse
   physical, biological, and social networks. a major goal is to identify
   elementary mechanisms that lead to the emergence of small-world
   ([163]4, [164]5) and scale-free network structures ([165]6, [166]7)
   commonly observed in the real world.

   small-world networks have a short average path length among nodes but a
   high local id91 coefficient compared to random networks
   ([167]18). important small-world graph properties include the number of
   vertices (n), the average degree formula , the characteristic path
   length (l), and the id91 coefficient (c). the degree of a vertex
   is the total number of its connections. the characteristic path length
   describes how far apart any two nodes in the graph network are. it is
   computed by determining the shortest path l (i, j) between any two
   nodes i and j in the network and calculating the average of all l. the
   id91 coefficient is a more local measure of how    cliquish    a
   graph is or how tightly nodes in the graph are connected to each other.
   if a node has k edges that connect it to its neighbors, then the node's
   id91 coefficient is given by c = n/(k^*(k - 1)/2), where n is the
   number of edges connecting neighbors of the node to each other. the
   strength of a connection (e.g., the number of times two authors wrote
   papers together) is not considered during the computation of l or c.

   in scale-free networks, the frequency f of the degree of connectivity k
   of a vertex is a power function of k, f     k^-  . examples of real-world
   data sets that are well approximated by power law relationships include
   actor collaborations, power grids, and the worldwide web ([168]10). for
   these data sets, the power law applies over many orders of magnitude,
   and hence these networks are known as    scale-free.    with very few
   highly interlinked nodes and many weakly interlinked nodes, scale-free
   networks are surprisingly robust against random deletion of edges,
   e.g., network failures ([169]19).

   the watts-strogatz model was the first model to generate graphs with
   small-world properties ([170]20). their process model starts with a
   regular lattice network configuration. each edge is redirected with a
   id203 p to another randomly selected node. this process model is
   of limited direct utility for coauthor and paper id191
   because in those networks the links are fixed; no rewiring takes place.
   that is, once a paper has cited another paper, or two authors have
   collaborated on a paper, these associations are forever part of the
   permanent historical record.

   the barab  si and albert (ba) model has been a highly influential and
   successful attempt to simulate networks that show scale-free properties
   ([171]10). it starts with a small number (n[0]) of nodes, and at every
   time step, a new node is added as well as a set of m new edges that
   link the new node to the nodes already present in the system. the
   id203 p that a new node will be connected to node i is
   proportional to the degree k[i] of node i. hence a new node is
   preferentially attached to an already highly connected node. after t
   time steps the network has n = t + n[0] nodes and m^*t edges. this
   network evolves into a stationary scale-free state with the id203
   that a node has k edges following a power law with an exponent   [ba] =
   3. gradually adding nodes to the network over time appears to be
   critical in obtaining scale-free distributions ([172]21).

   copying behavior was introduced as an alternative to explain the power
   law degree distribution for the worldwide web ([173]22). recent
   work[174]       models the id203 distribution of citations by copying
   references used in other papers. the resulting network quantitatively
   matches the citation distribution observed in real id191.
   vazquez[175]       even suggested that authors do a recursive bibliographic
   search. in his model a new node is connected to a randomly selected
   node as well as nodes linked from (referenced by) this node. although
   these models attempt to capture preferential attachment, less is known
   about their small-world properties. numerous other attempts to model
   small-world and scale-free networks are reviewed in refs. [176]4 and
   [177]7.

   a number of mathematical models of network evolution have been
   developed in sociology. several models ([178]25) assume a fixed number
   of edges. snijders ([179]26) proposed a class of statistical models for
   longitudinal network data that assumes a directed graph with a fixed
   set of actors. however, neither the number of nodes nor edges is fixed
   for evolving coauthor or paper id191. the model by gilbert
   ([180]27) aims to simulate the structure of academic science. it
   assumes that papers generate future papers, giving authors a rather
   incidental role. the model was validated based on the number and
   distribution of citation counts. the small-world and scale-free
   properties of the resulting networks are unknown.

   to our knowledge no algorithmic approach exists that simultaneously
   models the evolution of different networks such as coauthor and paper
   id191 within an ecology of multiple interacting networks.
   here, we argue that to fully understand the structure, evolution, and
   utilization of networks, coauthor and paper id191 need to
   be considered simultaneously. for example, to understand how knowledge
   diffuses across authors via their papers at the same time that new
   authors and papers are accumulated, it is essential to model the
   coupled growth of both network structures.

process model for author-paper networks

   this section motivates the features and simplifying assumptions of a
   process model for the simultaneous growth of coauthor and paper
   id191 as seen in citation databases like pnas. given the
   importance of the interplay of topics, aging, and recursive follow-up
   of links (here citation references), it was named the tarl (topics,
   aging, and recursive linking) model.

   the tarl model attempts to capture the roles of authors and papers in
   the production, storage, and dissemination of knowledge. information
   diffusion is assumed to occur directly via coauthorships and indirectly
   via the consumption of other authors' papers. it assumes the existence
   of a set of authors and papers. each author and paper is assigned a
   single topic. ideally, several levels of topics would be organized
   hierarchically in terms of specificity. the same paper may belong to
   the coarse topic of immunology, the more specific topic of hiv
   infection, and the still more specific topic of hemolytic anemia in hiv
   patients with g6-pd deficiency. the current modeling uses the
   simplifying assumption that there is a single level of relatively
   specific topics. in contrast to the ephemeral lifespan of authors,
   papers, once written, exist forever.

   the set of authors is interlinked via undirected coauthorship
   relations. papers are interconnected via directed    provides input to   
   links. authors and papers are interlinked via directed    consumed    links
   denoting the flow of information from papers to authors as well as
   directed    produced    links representing the act of paper generation by
   authors. note that the decision to direct links according to the flow
   of information reverses the direction of the commonly used    cited by   
   link. the in-degree of a paper node refers to its number of references
   and the out-degree to its number of received citations.

   coauthor, citation, consumed, and produced links, once created, are
   permanent. coauthorship links may become stronger as more and more
   papers are coauthored together. the number of provides input to links
   representing received citations may grow over time. note that citation
   links can be created to any existing paper. however, coauthorship links
   can only be made to currently active authors. for simplicity, each
   paper has a fixed number of authors and a fixed number of references.

   topics are randomly assigned to authors at initialization time. papers
   inherit the topic of their author(s). in the current instantiation of
   the model, each author and each paper has exactly one topic. the
   initial number of used topics is typically lower than the total number
   of available topics. eventually all of the topics are covered as new
   authors with randomly assigned topics are added gradually.
   consumed-produced relationships among papers and authors are restricted
   to authors and papers within the same topic. although this is a rather
   unrealistic assumption, it parsimoniously models the fact that authors
   from one knowledge domain typically do not frequently read journals,
   attend conferences, coauthor, or interact from/with other domains.

   in the general model, the number of papers produced by an author would
   be a random variable. however, for the current instantiation of the
   model, a single fixed number of papers per author per year is assumed.
   we are aware that this is unrealistic and will not result in a gaussian
   or power law distribution for the number of coauthors nor the number of
   papers published per author. hence, only the properties of the paper
   citation network will be validated against the pnas data set.

   during model initialization, a set of authors and a set of papers with
   randomly assigned topics are generated (see pseudocode in [181]fig. 1).
   subsequently, a predefined number of coauthors sharing the same topic
   is randomly selected and assigned to each paper via produced by links.
   all papers have authors but there may be authors that have not yet
   produced papers. there are initially no coauthor or paper citation
   links, making it advantageous to start the model at least 1 year
   earlier than the time period of interest.

   process model in pseudo code. if no topics are considered then the
   number of topics is one, i.e., all papers and authors have the same
   topic. if no coauthors are considered then each paper has exactly one
   author. if the reference path length is 0 then no references are
   considered for citation. if no aging function is given then all papers
   have the same id203 of getting selected.

   at each time step (year), a specified number of new authors a    is
   created with a specific time stamp and added to the set of existing
   authors a[t] = a    u a[t-1]. a number of authors can be deactivated as
   well and subtracted from the set of authors. subsequently, each author
   in set a[t] randomly identifies a set of coauthors, reads a specified
   number of randomly selected papers from within his/her topic, and
   produces a specified number of new papers. each new paper will cite a
   fixed number of existing papers, a number frequently stipulated by
   publishers and constrained by the number of pages available per
   journal. to select the papers cited, authors consume (read) a rather
   small set of papers because of finite cognitive and time constraints.
   to model the local networking activity of authors, the number of levels
   of paper references that are followed up by an author is modeled
   explicitly. if it is zero, then only the papers that an author reads in
   a year, the set p[0], can be cited. if it is two, then an author can
   cite any paper that they have read, any paper p[1] that is cited in one
   of the p[0] papers, or any paper that is cited in any of the papers in
   set p[1]. with each deeper level of references, the set of papers, p   ,
   is added to p[r] = p    u p[r-1]. the set of papers available as citation
   references for a given year t and depth of reference level r is denoted
   by p[r,t].

   a parameterized model was implemented in java to simulate the
   simultaneous growth of interlinked coauthor networks and paper citation
   networks as described above. the model takes as input parameters that
   specify the number of authors and papers created in the initial year as
   well as the number of topics, the number of authors to be deleted per
   year, the number of papers an author produces per year, the number of
   papers cited by a new paper, the number of coauthors, the number of
   levels references are followed up, and the parameters of the aging
   function.

   the model can be started with or without topics, coauthorships,
   following up of references, aging of papers, or any combination of
   these variables. a small author-paper network for topics only and for
   coauthors only is shown in [186]fig. 2 a and b, respectively. [187]fig.
   2a shows three unconnected topic-based author and paper networks.
   during the simulation, authors read, cite, and produce papers from
   their topic area exclusively. given that authors exclusively coauthor
   with authors within their own topic, each paper has exactly one topic.
   author a4 was assigned a topic for which two papers existed after the
   initialization and hence both papers are assigned to the author. later
   on the author generates one paper each year that cites the author's own
   work on the topic. without any new authors or new topic areas for
   existing authors, all subsequently produced papers will belong to one
   of these three topic areas. with authors reading papers only of their
   own topic area, there will never be any links between the three topical
   clusters. if authors do not coauthor then there are no coauthor links.

   author-paper network generated by using the model with topics only (a)
   and coauthors only (b). the model was started with five topics,
   authors, and papers and run for 2 years. in each year, each author
   produces one paper, which cites two earlier papers. no authors were
   added or deactivated. the resulting networks has five authors (labeled
   a1-a5, blue circles) and 15 or 9 papers (labeled 0, 2, 3..., red
   triangles). papers are linked via red directed provided input to links.
   authors are connected by blue coauthorships links. light green
   indicates directed links denoting the flow of information from papers
   to authors and from authors to new papers via consumed and produced
   relations.

   if coauthorship is simulated, then each paper is authored by a
   predefined number of authors. at each time step, each author will
   select a number of coauthors to produce papers, and each produced paper
   has multiple authors. the model stops when the number of specified time
   steps is reached. in the network shown in [192]fig. 2b each newly
   generated paper has exactly two authors. blue, undirected lines
   represent coauthorships. line thickness indicates the number of papers
   that have been coauthored together, e.g., a1 and a3 coauthored several
   times. the total number of papers produced each year is lower than in
   [193]fig. 2a because two authors produce one paper together. if a topic
   area has fewer authors than needed for the collaborative production of
   a paper then no papers are produced.

   if no references and no aging are considered then references are
   randomly selected from the set of papers that a coauthor team selected
   for reading. when references in papers are followed up then authors
   consider not only the papers they read as potential reference
   candidates but also papers linked to those via citation references up
   to a path of a certain length. thus, a paper that was cited five times
   has six chances (or tokens) to get selected. the resulting paper
   citation network has some nodes, typically older papers, which are very
   highly cited, whereas the majority of papers are rarely, if at all,
   cited; see [194]fig. 3a.

   paper network without aging (a) and with aging (b). without aging,
   older papers are more likely to provide input to younger papers; i.e.,
   they are attracting most of the citation links. for example, in a,
   paper no. 0 generated at initialization time and paper no. 5 generated
   in year 1 provide input to four and six papers, respectively.

   if references as well as aging are considered, then the id203 of
   paper y being cited, p(y), corresponds to the normalized sum of the
   aging-dependent id203 for each of its tokens, embedded image
   embedded image

   where n is the total number of years considered. hence a paper that was
   published in year y and received four citations in year y + 1 and two
   citations in year y + 2 has seven tokens that are weighted by the
   id203 value for each year. the id203 of citing a paper
   written t years ago can be fit by a weibull distribution of the form
   embedded image embedded image

   where c is a scaling factor, a controls the variability of
   distribution, and b controls the rightward extension of the curve. as b
   increases, the id203 of citing older papers increases. for the
   present purposes, a small value of b represents a strong aging bias
   that favors citing papers that have been published recently. for small
   values of b, the function predicts very few citations for older papers.
   the introduction of aging offsets the rich-get-richer effect that
   favors the citation of older papers that have already been frequently
   cited.

   the parameters specified in the input script file provide flexibility
   to fit the model output to diverse data sets. the model is used to fit
   the pnas data in the next section. later, we examine the influence of
   aging, reference path length, and number of topics on the structure of
   interlinked coauthor and paper id191.

model validation

   to validate the tarl model, a 20-year (1982-2001) data set of pnas was
   used. subsequently, we describe the data set, select a set of model
   parameters, and compare the model output with the pnas data set in
   terms of network properties.

   the pnas data set. the pnas data set contains 45,120 regular articles.
   the number of unique authors for those papers is 105,915. [199]table 1
   provides counts of the total number of papers, authors, references, and
   citations received by all of the papers for each of the 20 years, as
   well as the average number of coauthors per author. the average number
   of papers published per author and the average number of references and
   citations per paper can be easily derived from [200]table 1. note that
   the citation counts, particularly for younger papers, are artificially
   low because they have not existed in the literature long enough to
   garner many citations. [201]table 1 also provides information on the
   number of citations received from papers within the pnas data set in
   the right-most column. only those intra-pnas citation links will be
   modeled. the paper most highly cited by papers within the set received
   285 citations.

   table 2. properties of coauthor and paper id191 comprising
   number of nodes n, average node degree formula , path length l, cluster
   coefficient c, and power law exponent   

   note that for undirected coauthor networks, the in-degree of a node
   equals its out-degree and hence the exponents for both distributions
   are identical. for directed paper id191, the number of
   references is rather small and constant. as typical, only the in-degree
   distribution (received citations) are considered ([212]7) and the   
   reported values for paper id191 characterize the in-degree
   distribution. for paper id191, we do not report the value
   for the characteristic path length as it reflects the time duration of
   the sample but little about the structure of the network.

   based on these values, the pnas data set can be classified as a
   medium-sized data set that has a similar average node degree formula ,
   path length l, cluster coefficient c, and power law exponent    to the
   networks previously examined. the formula value of the paper citation
   network is rather low. the total number of links within the pnas
   citation network is 114,003. on average, each paper receives about
   three citations from another paper in this data set. the coauthor
   network has 472,552 links.

   the power law exponent for the pnas coauthor network is 2.54 and seems
   to match the values reported for other networks well. it accounts for
   91% of the variance in the relation between number of coauthors and
   frequency of occurrence. the number of authors with very few coauthors
   is less than predicted by a power law relation, and the number of
   authors with a moderate number of coauthors is more than predicted. the
   best-fitting power law exponent for the paper citation network is 2.29,
   and the power law accounts for 87% of the variance. the systematic
   deviations from a power law are that most cited papers are cited less
   often than predicted by a power law, and the less cited papers are
   cited more often than predicted. a plausible account for these
   deviations are that networks in which aging occurs, e.g., actor
   networks, friendship networks, but also paper id191, show a
   connectivity distribution that has a power law regime followed by an
   exponential or gaussian decay or have an exponential or gaussian
   connectivity distribution ([213]12). newman ([214]30) showed that
   connectivity distributions of coauthor networks from astrophysics,
   condensed matter, high energy, and computer science databases can be
   fitted by a power law form with an exponential cutoff. following this
   lead, we fit a power law with exponential cutoff of the form f(x) =
   ax^-be^x/c. this function provided an excellent fit to the pnas paper
   citation network with values of a = 13,652, b = 0.49, and c = 4.21 (r^2
   = 1.00).

   model initialization. the statistical properties of the pnas data set
   were used to select the initialization values for the model. the model
   was run with topics, coauthors, references, and aging for 21 years
   covering 1981-2001. the year 1981 was used for initialization purposes.
   in 1981, 4,809 authors and 1,624 papers covering 1,000 topics were
   generated (see discussion of the linear relation between cluster
   coefficient and topics in the next section). in accordance with the
   pnas data, the number of active authors was increased by 430 each year.
   note that this increase in authors is caused mostly by external factors
   such as funding, which are not modeled in the current simulation and
   hence have to be supplied by hand. even though 20 years is a rather
   large time span, the simplifying assumption was made that all authors
   remained alive/active. although the number of coauthors increases
   continuously over time we decided to use the average value of 4. hence
   the number of authors per paper is five. one paper is produced by each
   author per year. the average number of references per paper to papers
   within pnas was set to 3 as determined by the actual data. one level of
   references was considered and the weibull aging function was used, with
   a parameter value of b = 3, providing a 12-year time window in which
   papers are cited.

   statistics. simulated data have been compared to the pnas article data
   set in terms of total number of papers, unique authors, and citations
   received per paper for each year given in [215]table 1, as well as in
   terms of their small-world properties. interestingly, the total number
   of papers in the simulation is slightly lower than the actual pnas
   data. this is because authors who do not manage to find a sufficient
   number of coauthors in their topic area will not produce any paper in
   this particular year. similarly, papers that are produced in a topic
   area with very few papers will not be able to reference the called for
   number of three papers. hence the average degree formula is slightly
   lower than the value observed for the pnas paper network.

   as shown in [216]fig. 5a the number of papers published in pnas
   increases slowly but steadily over the 20-year time period. the number
   of authors publishing in pnas increases more rapidly than the number of
   papers because the average number of coauthors per paper increases from
   3.49 in 1982 to 5.42 in 2001. the simulation assumes a linear increase
   in authors over time, but the increase in the number of papers produced
   naturally comes out of this increase in authors.

   total number of actual and simulated papers (#p) and authors (#a) (a)
   and received citations (#c_win) (b).

   the average number of received citations for each year is displayed in
   [221]fig. 5b. the model closely tracks the number of actual citations
   for all years after 1984. the fit for the first 2 years is poor because
   the model has no initial citation links nor record of papers before
   1981. given that no papers before 1981 are available as references,
   papers published in early years of the simulation receive a
   disproportionately large number of citations. this effect fades away in
   1985 as the aging function selects mostly papers published in the last
   12 years and papers published in the last 7 years have a particularly
   high id203 of being cited. the total number of citations received
   by papers within the pnas data set is 111,341. the artifacts during the
   initial phase of the model run could be eliminated by starting the
   model 10 years earlier and analyzing only the final 20 years. however,
   we believe the graph in [222]fig. 5b nicely illustrates the influence
   of aging and the model in action. both actual and modeled data sets
   reflect the fact that younger papers have shorter periods of time in
   which to draw citations.

   network properties. this section discusses the fit of the simulated
   paper citation network to the pnas data in terms of small-world
   properties as well as the power law exponent    for the paper
   connectivity graph. results for the best-fitting model parameters are
   reported in the last row of [223]table 2.

   the cluster coefficient for simulations in which all authors and papers
   have the same topic is rather low. the cluster coefficient increases
   considerably if topics are considered; see also the discussion on
   topics in the next section.

   the simulation with 1,000 topics and an aging parameter of b = 3
   provides a good fit to the pnas data set in terms of the distribution
   of citations. the model data r^2 was 0.996, which is substantially
   better than the best-fitting power law to the pnas data (r^2 = 0.87),
   and almost as good as the best-fitting power law with exponential tail
   (r^2 = 1.00). as with the pnas data, the simulated data were fit much
   better with a power law with exponential tail (r^2 = 0.999) than simple
   power law (0.987). although the simulation does not fit the pnas data
   any better than the power law with exponential tail, it does provide a
   process model for why this functional relation applies. very highly
   cited papers are more rare in the pnas and simulated data sets than
   predicted by a power law because of the bias toward citing recent
   papers. the tendency for highly cited older papers to attract still
   more citations is offset by a counteracting tendency to cite recent
   papers.

the influence of model parameters

   this section discusses the influence of different tarl model parameters
   on network properties such as cluster coefficient and power law
   exponent for the citation distribution.

   interestingly, the number of topics is linearly correlated with the
   id91 coefficient of the resulting network: c = 0.000073 ^* no.
   topics. hence our knowledge about the id91 coefficient in the
   pnas network governed the choice of 1,000 topics. the linear relation
   entails a desirable property of the simulation; a simple method exists
   for creating networks with a specific degree of id91.

   topics also influence the power law exponent for the citation
   distribution. increasing the number of topics increases the power law
   exponent as authors are now restricted to cite papers in their own
   topics area. by dividing science into separate fields, the global
   rich-get-richer effect is broken down into many local rich-get-richer
   effects, leading to a more egalitarian distribution of received
   citations.

   aging refers to the distribution of probabilities for papers being
   cited by new papers. the influence of the b value used to generate
   different weibull aging functions is shown in [224]fig. 6a. the aging
   distribution observed in the pnas data was used to determine the
   parameter value b = 3, marked with a star in [225]fig. 6. by increasing
   b, and hence increasing the number of older papers cited as references,
   the id91 coefficient decreases. this effect suggests a second
   kind of id91 that parallels the strong topic-induced id91
   described previously. papers are not only clustered by topic, but also
   in time, and as a community becomes increasingly nearsighted in terms
   of their citation practices, the degree of temporal id91
   increases.

   cluster coefficient as a function of the aging function (a) and the
   reference path length (b).

   last but not least, the length of the chain of paper citation links
   that is followed to select references for a new paper also influences
   the id91 coefficient. the dependence of the id91
   coefficient on the reference path length is given in [230]fig. 6b. this
   result indicates that temporal id91 is ameliorated by the
   practice of citing (and hopefully reading!) the papers that were the
   earlier inspirations for read papers.

   note that the aging and reference path length examinations were
   conducted for 200 topics.

discussion and outlook

   this article presented results on modeling the simultaneous evolution
   and structure of author-paper networks. although prior research has
   described the associations among different scientific structure (e.g.,
   authors, publications, topics, web) ([231]23), to our knowledge, nobody
   has yet attempted to model the simultaneous growth and dynamic
   interactions of multiple networks dealing with scientific output.

   models based on preferential attachment assume that new papers are
   linked to highly connected (cited) papers and new authors tend to
   coauthor with already highly interlinked authors. however, in today's
   dynamic scientific world of increasing specialization, an overview of
   the connectivity of a scientist or paper is not available to authors
   (even experts in a field). instead, each author can be seen as a part
   of a complex network with local connections. each author interacts
   directly only with a rather limited number of other authors and papers.
   however, papers that are cited frequently have a higher id203 of
   being cited again. similarly, authors that are highly interconnected
   with other authors in social networks are likely to attract more
   coauthors if we assume that authors tend to coauthor with coauthors of
   their coauthors. the presented model uses the reading and citing of
   paper references as a grounded mechanism to generate paper citation
   networks that are approximately scale-free. moreover, the particular
   deviations from scale-free properties are well predicted by a version
   of the model that incorporates a bias to cite recent papers and a
   scientific community that is subdivided into specialized topics. the
   model parameters that governed these two factors were b that reflects
   that influence of aging and    number of topics    reflecting the degree of
   splintering within science. the values for these parameters were not
   freely fit to the citation distribution data. instead, the number of
   topics was selected to approximate pnas's id91 coefficient, and b
   was selected to provide the optimal weibull fit to pnas's distribution
   of citations as a function of lag in years. thus, the highly
   respectable model-data fit involving the number of citations and their
   frequency is impressive because it involves no true free parameters.

   the incorporation of topics and recency bias was instrumental in
   achieving the qualitative violations of a power law distribution. there
   are fewer papers that receive a large number of citations than is
   predicted by a power law, because the bias toward citing recent papers
   offsets the rich-get-richer effect that generates a power law relation.
   it is difficult for a well cited paper to continue to receive
   additional citations as it ages. the citation bias toward recent papers
   combines with the within-topic citation constraint to create citations
   networks that have high degrees of id91 by both topic area and
   time. these model assumptions account for the observed citation
   distribution and suggest an interesting interplay between citation
   practices that lead to egalitarian versus lopsided distributions of
   citations.

   for the sake of simplicity the number of papers produced by each author
   per year was fixed and a fixed number of coauthors were randomly
   assigned to each author. if coauthors preferably collaborate with
   coauthors of their coauthors, this would provide a grounded mechanism
   for the generation of small-world and approximately scale-free network
   structures analogous to their construction in the paper network.
   similarly to the aging of papers, the    deactivation of authors    could
   also be modeled. if authors are more likely to cite papers of active
   authors, then the deactivation of all authors of a paper would decrease
   the    attraction    or    fitness    of a paper to receive citations by
   another paper. the deactivation of authors would also cause previous
   coauthors to search for new coauthors. having authors coauthor across
   topics would lead to a more realistic interconnection of papers from
   different topic areas via citation links.

   the productivity of an author may depend not only on his/her position
   in the author-paper network but also on available research funds,
   facilities, and students.

   to give an example, consider the feedback cycle of authors, papers, and
   funding. authors that manage to produce many high-quality papers also
   increase their chances of receiving funding. funding in return enables
   authors to hire (better) graduate students or postdocs, which in turn
   increases the number of coauthors and the amount and quality of paper
   output and hence the likelihood of attracting still more funding.
