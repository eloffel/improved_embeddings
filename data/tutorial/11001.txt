abstract

   pnas is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific
   journals. the pnas official classification structure of subjects is
   reflected in topic labels submitted by the authors of articles, largely
   related to traditionally established disciplines. these include broad
   field classifications into physical sciences, biological sciences,
   social sciences, and further subtopic classifications within the
   fields. focusing on biological sciences, we explore an internal
   soft-classification structure of articles based only on semantic
   decompositions of abstracts and bibliographies and compare it with the
   formal discipline classifications. our model assumes that there is a
   fixed number of internal categories, each characterized by multinomial
   distributions over words (in abstracts) and references (in
   bibliographies). soft classification for each article is based on
   proportions of the article's content coming from each category. we
   discuss the appropriateness of the model for the pnas database as well
   as other features of the data relevant to soft classification.

   "the proceedings is there to help bring new ideas promptly into play.
   new ideas may not always be right, but their prominent presence can
   lead to correction. we must be careful not to censor even those ideas
   which seem to be off beat."

   saunders maclane ([142]1)

   are there internal categories of articles in pnas that we can obtain
   empirically with statistical data-mining tools based only on semantic
   decompositions of words and references used? can we identify maclane's
      off-beat    but potentially path-breaking pnas articles by using these
   internal categories? do these empirically defined categories correspond
   in some natural way to the classification by field used to organize the
   articles for publication, or does pnas publish substantial numbers of
   interdisciplinary articles that transcend these disciplinary
   boundaries? these are examples of questions that our contribution to
   the mapping of knowledge domains represented by pnas explores.

   mathematical and statistical techniques have been developed for
   analyzing complex data in ways that could reveal underlying data
   patterns through some form of classification. computational advances
   have made some of these techniques extremely popular in recent years.
   for example, 2 of the 10 most cited articles from 1997-2001 pnas
   publications are on applications of id91 for gene-expression
   patterns ([143]2, [144]3). the traditional assumption in most methods
   that aim to discover knowledge in underlying data patterns has been
   that each subject (object or individual) from the population of
   interest inherently belongs to only one of the underlying
   subpopulations (clusters, classes, aspects, or pure type categories).
   this implies that a subject shares all its attributes, usually with
   some degree of uncertainty, with the subpopulation to which it belongs.
   given that a relatively small number of subpopulations is often
   necessary for a meaningful interpretation of the underlying patterns,
   many data collections do not conform with the traditional assumption.
   subjects in such populations may combine attributes from several
   subpopulations simultaneously. in other words, they may have a mixed
   collection of attributes originating from more than one subpopulation.

   several different disciplines have developed approaches that have a
   common statistical structure that we refer to as mixed membership. in
   genetics, mixed-membership models can account for the fact that
   individual genotypes may come from different subpopulations according
   to (unknown) proportions of an individual's ancestry. rosenberg et al.
   ([145]4) use such a model to analyze genetic samples from 52 human
   populations around the globe, identifying major genetic clusters
   without using the geographic information about the origins of
   individuals. in the social sciences, such models are natural, because
   members of a society can exhibit mixed membership with respect to the
   underlying social or health groups for a particular problem being
   studied. hence, individual responses to a series of questions may have
   mixed origins. woodbury et al. ([146]5) use this idea to develop
   medical classification. in text analysis and information retrieval,
   mixed-membership models have been used to account for different topical
   aspects of individual documents.

   in the next section, we describe a class of mixed-membership models
   that unifies existing special cases ([147]6). we then explain how this
   class of models can be adapted to analyze both the semantic content of
   a document and its citations of other publications. we fit this
   document-oriented mixed-membership model to a subcollection of the pnas
   database supplied to the participants in the arthur m. sackler
   colloquium mapping knowledge domains. we focus in our analysis on a
   high-level description of the fields in biological sciences in terms of
   a small number of extreme or basis categories. griffiths and steyvers
   ([148]7) use a related version of the model for abstracts only and
   attempt a finer level of description.

mixed-membership models

   the general mixed-membership model that we work with relies on four
   levels of assumptions: population, subject, latent variable, and
   sampling scheme. population level assumptions describe the general
   structure of the population that is common to all subjects.
   subject-level assumptions specify the distribution of observable
   responses given individual membership scores. membership scores are
   usually unknown and hence can be viewed also as latent variables. the
   next assumption is whether the membership scores are treated as fixed
   or random in the model. finally, the last level of assumptions
   specifies the number of distinct observed characteristics (attributes)
   and the number of replications for each characteristic. we describe
   each set of assumptions formally in turn.

   population level. assume there are k original or basis subpopulations
   in the populations of interest. for each subpopulation k, denote by
   f(x[j]|  [kj]) the id203 distribution for response variable j,
   where   [kj] is a vector of parameters. assume that, within a
   subpopulation, responses to observed variables are independent.

   subject level. for each subject, membership vector    = (  [1],...,   [k])
   provides the degrees of a subject's membership in each of the
   subpopulations. the id203 distribution of observed responses x[j]
   for each subject is defined fully by the id155
   formula and the assumption that response variables x[j] are
   independent, conditional on membership scores. in addition, given the
   membership scores, observed responses from different subjects are
   independent.

   latent-variable level. with respect to the latent variables, one could
   assume that they are either fixed unknown constants or random
   realizations from some underlying distribution.
    1. if the membership scores    are fixed but unknown, the conditional
       id203 of observing x[j], given the parameters    and
       membership scores, is embedded image embedded image 1
    2. if membership scores    are realizations of latent variables from
       some distribution d[  ], parameterized by vector   , then the
       id203 of observing x[j], given the parameters, is embedded
       image embedded image 2

   sampling scheme. suppose r independent replications of j distinct
   characteristics are observed for one subject, formula . then, if the
   membership scores are treated as realizations from distribution d[  ],
   the id155 is embedded image embedded image 3

   when the latent variables are treated as unknown constants, the
   id155 for observing r replications of j variables can
   be derived analogously. in general, the number of observed
   characteristics j does not need to be the same across subjects, and the
   number of replications r does not need to be the same across observed
   characteristics.

   one can derive examples of mixed-membership models from this general
   set up by specifying different choices of j and r and different
   latent-variable assumptions. thus, the    grade-of-membership    model of
   manton et al. ([149]8) assumes that polytomous responses are observed
   to j survey questions without replications and uses the fixed-effects
   assumption for the membership scores. potthoff et al. ([150]9) use a
   variation of the grade-of-membership model by treating the membership
   scores as dirichlet random variables; the authors refer to the
   resulting model as    dirichlet generalization of latent class models.   
   erosheva ([151]6) provides a formal latent-class representation for the
   grade-of-membership model approach. in genetics, pritchard et al.
   ([152]10) use a id91 model with admixture. for diploid
   individuals, the id91 model assumes that r = 2 replications
   (genotypes) are observed at j distinct locations (loci), treating the
   proportions of a subject's genome that originated from each of the
   basis subpopulations as random dirichlet realizations. variations of
   mixed-membership models for text documents called    probabilistic latent
   semantic analysis    ([153]11) and    id44   
   ([154]12) both assume that a single characteristic (word) is observed a
   number of times for each document, but the former model considers the
   membership scores as fixed unknown constants, whereas the latter treats
   them as random dirichlet realizations.

   the mixed-membership model framework presented above unifies several
   specialized models that have been developed independently in the social
   sciences, genetics, and text-mining applications. in the text-mining
   area, initial work by hofmann ([155]11) on probabilistic latent
   semantic analysis was followed by the work of blei et al. ([156]12),
   who proposed a dirichlet generating distribution for the membership
   scores and the use of variational methods to estimate the latent
   dirichlet allocation model parameters. minka and lafferty ([157]13)
   developed a more accurate approximation method for this model.

   a natural extension of the original analyses in the text-mining area
   that have been based on a single source is to combine information from
   multiple sources. cohn and hofmann ([158]14) propose a probabilistic
   model of document content and hypertext connectivity for text documents
   by considering links (or references) in addition to words, thus
   essentially combining two distinct characteristics; they treat the
   membership scores as fixed. following cohn and hofmann, we adopt a
   mixed-membership model for words and references in journal publications
   but treat the membership scores as random dirichlet realizations.
   barnard et al. ([159]15) develop similar and alternative approaches for
   combining different sources of information.

mixed-membership models for documents

   we can use the general model framework for documents consisting of
   abstracts and references by representing a document as formula , where
   formula is a word (w) in the abstract and formula is a reference (r) in
   the bibliography, r[j] = 1,..., r[j]. by adopting the    bag-of-words   
   assumption, we treat the words in each abstract as independent
   replications of the first observed characteristic (word). similarly,
   under the assumption of a    bag of references,    we treat references as
   independent replications of the second observed characteristic
   (reference). thus, the representation of a document consists of word
   counts n(w, d) (the number of times word w appears in document d) and
   reference counts n(r, d) (1 if the bibliography of d contains a
   reference to r, and 0 otherwise). in this context, subpopulations refer
   to topical aspects.

   the parameters    of our model are: dirichlet (hyper)parameters
     [1],...,   [k] for the generating distribution of the membership scores
   and aspect multinomial probabilities for words   [1k](w) = p(w|k) and
   references   [2k](r) = q(r|k), k = 1, 2,..., k.

   in the generative model, documents formula are sampled according to the
   following sequence, embedded image embedded image 4 embedded image
   embedded image 5 embedded image embedded image 6

   where   [w]   [1k](w) = 1 and   [r]   [2k](r) = 1, k = 1,..., k. because
   distributions of words and references in a document are convex
   combinations of the distributions of the aspects, the aspects can be
   thought of as extreme or basis categories for a collection of
   documents. the sampling of words and references in the model can be
   interpreted also as a latent classification process in which an aspect
   of origin is drawn first for each word and for each reference in a
   document, according to a multinomial distribution parameterized by the
   document-specific membership scores   , and words and references then
   are generated from corresponding distributions of the aspects of origin
   ([160]6). rather than a mixture of k latent classes, the model can be
   thought of as a    simplicial mixture    ([161]13) because the word and
   reference probabilities range over a simplex with corners   [1k] and
     [2k], respectively.

   the likelihood function is thus embedded image embedded image 7
   embedded image embedded image 8

   where integrals are over the (k - 1) simplex.

   it is important to note that the assumption of exchangeability among
   words and references (conditional independence given the membership
   scores) does not imply joint independence among the observed
   characteristics. instead, the assumption of exchangeability means that
   dependencies among words and references can be explained fully by the
   membership scores of the documents. for an extended discussion on
   exchangeability in this context, see ref. [162]16.

alternative model for references

   for the analysis of pnas publications in the next section, we assume
   multinomial sampling of words and references. although multinomial
   sampling is computationally convenient, it is not a realistic model of
   the way in which authors select references for the bibliography of an
   article. we briefly describe an example of more realistic generative
   assumptions for references.

   suppose an article focuses on a sufficiently narrow scientific area. in
   this case, the authors may have essentially perfect knowledge of the
   literature, and thus they would pay separate attention to each article
   in their pool of references as they consider whether to include it in
   the bibliography. under these circumstances, given that the pool of
   references contains r articles, we assume that a document is
   represented as formula , where formula is a word in the abstract, r is
   the number of references, and x[2],..., x[r+1] are all references in
   the pool. reference counts do not change: they are given by n(r, d) = 1
   if the bibliography of d contains a reference to r and by n(r, d) = 0
   if otherwise.

   then our model for generating documents would be to sample    and
   formula , according to eqs. 4 and 5, and sample x[j], j = 2,..., r + 1,
   according to embedded image embedded image 9

   the likelihood function based on this alternative model would not only
   take into account which documents contain which references, but it also
   would incorporate the information about which references documents do
   not contain.

   both the basic model for references and any alternatives still would
   need to reflect the time ordering on publications and include in the
   pool of possible references only those that have been published
   already, perhaps even with a short time lag. however, even such changes
   are unlikely to produce a    correct    model for citation practices.

estimating the model

   the primary complication in using a mixed-membership model such as is
   shown in eqs. 4-6, in which the membership probabilities are random
   rather than fixed, is that the integral in eq. 7 cannot be computed
   explicitly and therefore must be approximated. two approximation
   schemes have been investigated recently for this problem and the
   associated problem of fitting the model. in the variational approach
   ([163]12), the mixture terms formula are bounded from below in a
   product form that leads to a tractable integral; the lower bound is
   then maximized. a related approach, called expectation-propagation
   ([164]13), also approximates each mixture term in a product form but
   chooses the parameters of the factors by matching first and second
   moments. either of these approximations to the integral (eq. 7) can be
   used in an approximate id83 to
   estimate the parameters of the models. it is shown in ref. [165]13 that
   expectation-propagation in general leads to better approximations than
   the simple variational method for mixed-membership models, although we
   obtained comparable results with both approaches on the pnas
   collection. the results reported below use the variational
   approximation.

the pnas database

   the national academy of sciences provided the database for the
   participants of the colloquium. we focused on a subset of all
   biological sciences articles in volumes 94-98 (julian years 1997-2001)
   of pnas, thereby ignoring articles published in the social and physical
   sciences unless they have official dual classifications with one
   classification in the biological sciences. the reason for this
   narrowing of focus is 2-fold. first, the major share of pnas
   publications in recent years represents research developments in the
   biological sciences. thus, of 13,008 articles published in volumes
   94-98, 12,036 (92.53%) are in the biological sciences. the share of
   social and physical sciences articles in volumes 94-98 is a much more
   modest 7.47%. second, we assume that a collection of articles is
   characterized by mixed membership in a number of internal categories,
   and social and physical sciences articles are unlikely to share the
   same internal categories with articles from the biological sciences. we
   also automatically ignore other types of pnas publications such as
   corrections, commentaries, letters, and reviews, because these are not
   traditional research reports. among the biological sciences articles in
   our database, 11 articles were not processed because they did not have
   an abstract, and 1 article was not processed because it did not contain
   any references.

   pnas is one of world's most cited multidisciplinary scientific
   journals. historically, when submitting a research paper to pnas,
   authors have to select a major category from physical, biological, or
   social sciences and a minor category from the list of topics. pnas
   permits dual classifications between major categories and, in
   exceptional cases, within a major category. the lists of topics change
   over time to reflect changes in the national academy of sciences
   sections. pnas, in its information for authors (revised in june 2002),
   states that it classifies publications in biological sciences according
   to 19 topics; the numbers of published articles and numbers of
   dual-classified articles in each topic are shown in [166]table 1.

   table 1. biological sciences publications in pnas volumes 94-98 by
   subtopic

   the topic labels provide a classification structure for published
   materials, and most of the articles are members of only a single topic.
   for our mixed-membership model, we assume that there is a fixed number
   of extreme internal categories or aspects, each of which is
   characterized by multinomial distributions over words (in abstracts)
   and references (in bibliographies). aspects are determined from
   contextual decompositions in such a way that a multinomial distribution
   of words and references in each document is a convex combination of the
   corresponding distributions from the aspects. the convex combination
   for each article is based on proportions of the article's content
   coming from each category. these proportions, or membership scores,
   determine soft classifications of articles with respect to internal
   categories.

results

   choosing a suitable value for the number of internal categories or
   aspects, k, in this type of setting is difficult. in our analyses, we
   focused largely on two versions of the model: one with 8 aspects and
   the other with 10. the set of parameters in our model is given by
   multinomial word and reference probabilities for each aspect and by the
   parameters of dirichlet distribution, which is a generating
   distribution for membership scores. there are 39,616 unique words and
   77,115 unique references in our data; hence, adding an aspect
   corresponds to having 39,615 + 77,114 + 1 = 116,730 additional
   parameters. because of the large numbers of parameters involved, it is
   difficult to assess the extent to which the added pair of aspects
   actually improves the fit of the model to the data. on the basis of a
   set of preliminary comparisons, we found little to choose between them
   in fit and greater ease of interpretation for the eight-aspect model.
   therefore, we report only the results of the eight-aspect model here.

   to determine whether there are certain contexts that correspond to the
   aspects, we examine the most common words in the estimated multinomial
   distributions. in [169]table 2, we report the first 15 of the
   high-id203 words for each aspect, filtering out so-called stop
   words, words that are generally common in english. an alternative way
   would be to discard the words from the    stop list    before fitting the
   model. if the distribution of stop words is not uniform across the
   internal categories, this alternative approach may potentially produce
   different results.

   table 2. high-id203 words for each aspect

   the following interpretations are based on examination of 50
   high-id203 words for each aspect. note that enumeration of the
   aspects is arbitrary. the first aspect includes words such as ca^2+,
   kinase, phosphorylation, receptor, and g (protein) channel, which
   pertain to cell signaling and intracellular signal transduction. it is
   likely that, in this aspect, signal transduction is considered as
   applied to neuron signaling as indicated by the words synaptic,
   neurons, voltage. it is interesting that ca^2+ in the first aspect is
   the highest-id203 contextual word over all the aspects. frequent
   words for the second aspect indicate that its context is related to
   molecular evolution that deals with natural selection on the population
   and intraspecies level and mechanisms of acquiring genetic traits.
   words in aspect 3 pertain mostly to the plant molecular biology area.
   high-id203 words in aspect 4 relate to studies of neuronal
   responses in mice and humans, which identify this aspect as related to
   developmental biology and neurobiology. aspect 5 contains words that
   can be associated with biochemistry and molecular biology. words in
   aspect 6 point to genetics and molecular biology. frequent words for
   aspect 7 contain such terms as immune, il (or interleukin), antigen,
   (ifn) gamma, and mhc class ii, which point to a relatively new area in
   immunology, namely, tumor immunology. the presence of such words as hiv
   and virus in aspect 7 indicates a more general immunology content. for
   aspect 8, words such as increase or reduced, treatment, effect, fold,
   and p (assuming it stands for p value) correspond to general reporting
   of experimental results, likely in the area of endocrinology.

   as for words, multinomial distributions are estimated for the
   references that are present in our collection. for estimation, we only
   need unique indicators for each referenced article. after the model is
   fitted, attributes of high-id203 references for each aspect
   provide additional information about its contextual interpretation.
   [172]table 3 provides attributes of 15 high-id203 references for
   each aspect that were available in the database together with pnas
   citation counts (number of times cited by pnas articles in the
   database). notice that, because the model draws from the contextual
   decomposition, having a high citation count is not necessary for having
   high aspect id203. in [173]table 3, high-id203 references
   for aspect 1 are dominated by publications in nature; references in
   aspect 7 are mostly nature, cell, and science publications from the
   mid-1990s.

   table 3. high-id203 references by aspect

   examining titles of the references (see table 5, which is published as
   supporting information on the pnas web site, [177]www.pnas.org), we see
   that manuals, textbooks, and references to methodology articles seem to
   be prominent for many aspects. thus, among the first 15
   high-id203 references, all 15 from aspect 3 and more than half
   from aspect 4 are of this methodological type. in contrast, most
   high-id203 references for aspect 7 are those that report new
   findings. titles of the references indicate neurobiology content for
   aspect 1, molecular evolution for aspect 2, and plant molecular biology
   for aspect 3, which is in agreement with our conclusions based on
   high-id203 words. for other aspects, titles of high-id203
   references help us refine the aspects. thus, aspect 4 mostly pertains
   to the study of brain development, in particular, via genetic
   manipulation of mouse embryo. aspect 5, identified as biochemistry and
   molecular biology by the words, can be described as protein structural
   biology by the references. aspect 6 may be labeled in a more detailed
   way as    dna repair, mutagenesis, and cell cycle.    the references for
   aspects 7 and 8 shift their focuses more toward hiv infection and
   studies of molecular mechanisms of obesity.

   among frequent references for the eight aspects, there are seven pnas
   articles that share a special feature: they were all either coauthored
   or contributed by a distinguished member of the national academy of
   sciences. in fact, one article was coauthored by a nobel prize winner,
   and two were contributed by other nobelists. although these articles do
   not have the highest counts in the database, they are notable for
   various reasons; e.g., one is on id91 and gene expression
   ([178]2), and it is also one of the two highly cited pnas articles on
   id91 that we mentioned in the introduction. these seven articles
   may not necessarily be off-beat, but they may be among those that
   fulfill maclane's petition regarding the special nature of pnas.

   from our analysis of high-id203 words, it is difficult to
   determine whether the majority of aspects correspond to a single topic
   from the official classifications in pnas biological science
   publications. to investigate whether there is a correspondence between
   the estimated aspects and the given topics, we examine aspect loadings
   (means of posterior membership scores) for each article. given
   estimated parameters of the model, the distribution of each article's
   loadings can be obtained by means of bayes' theorem. the variational
   and expectation-propagation procedures provide dirichlet approximations
   to the posterior distribution p(  |d,   ) for each document d. we use the
   mean of this dirichlet as an estimate of the weight of the document on
   each aspect. histograms of these loadings are provided in [179]fig. 1
   for articles in evolution and genetics. relatively high histogram bars
   near zero correspond to the majority of articles having small posterior
   membership scores for the given aspect. among the articles published in
   genetics, some can be considered as full members in aspects 2, 3, 4,
   and 6, but many have mixed membership in these and other aspects.
   articles published in evolution, on the other hand, show a somewhat
   different behavior: the majority of these articles comes fully from
   aspect 2.

   distributions by aspect of the posterior means of membership scores for
   articles published in evolution and genetics.

   the sparsity of the loadings can be gauged also by the parameters of
   the dirichlet distribution, which are estimated as   [1] = 0.0195,   [2]
   = 0.0203,   [3] = 0.0569,   [4] = 0.0346,   [5] = 0.0317,   [6] = 0.0363,
     [7] = 0.0411, and   [8] = 0.0255. the estimated dirichlet, which is the
   generative distribution of membership scores, is    bathtub-shaped    on
   the simplex; as a result, articles tend to have relatively high
   membership scores in only a few aspects.

   to summarize the aspect distributions for each topic, we provide mean
   loadings and the graphical representation of these values in [184]table
   4 upper. larger values correspond to darker colors, and the values
   below some threshold are not shown (white) for clarity. as an example,
   the mean loading of 0.2883 for pharmacology in the first aspect is the
   average of the posterior means of the membership scores for this aspect
   over all pharmacology publications in the database. note that this
   percentage is based on the assumption of mixed membership and can be
   interpreted as indicating that 29% of the words in pharmacology
   articles originate from aspect 1, according to our model.

   table 4. mean decompositions of aspect membership scores (lower),
   together with a graphical representation of this table (upper)

   examining the rows of [188]table 4, we see that most subtopics in
   biological sciences have major components from more than one aspect
   (extreme or basis category). examining the columns, we can gain
   additional insights in interpretation of the extreme categories. aspect
   8, for example, is the aspect of origin for a combined 37% of
   physiology, 30% of pharmacology, and 25% of medical sciences articles,
   according to the mixed-membership model. the most prominent subtopic is
   evolution; it has the greatest influence in defining an extremal
   category, aspect 2. this is consistent with a special place that
   evolution holds among the biological sciences by standing apart both
   conceptually and methodologically.

   finally, we compare the loadings (posterior means of the membership
   scores) of dual-classified articles to those that are singly
   classified. we consider two articles as similar if their loadings are
   equal for the first significant digit for all aspects. one might
   interpret singly classified articles that are similar to
   dual-classified as articles that should have had dual classification
   but did not. we find that, for 11% of the singly classified articles,
   there is at least one similar dual-classified article. for example,
   three biophysics dual-classified articles with loadings 0.9 for the
   second and 0.1 for the third aspect turned out to be similar to 86
   singly classified articles from biophysics, biochemistry, cell biology,
   developmental biology, evolution, genetics, immunology, medical
   sciences, and microbiology.

concluding remarks

   we have presented results from fitting a mixed-membership model to pnas
   biological sciences publications, from 1997 to 2001, providing an
   implicit semantic decomposition of words and references in the
   articles. the model allows us to identify extreme internal categories
   of publications and to provide soft classifications of articles into
   these categories. our results show that the traditional discipline
   classifications correspond to a mixed distribution over the internal
   categories. our analyses and modeling were intended to capture a
   high-level description of a subset of pnas articles.

   in an often-quoted statement, box remarked:    all models are wrong   
   ([189]17). in our case, the assumption of a bag of words and references
   in the mixed-membership model clearly oversimplifies reality; the model
   does not account for the general structure of the language, nor does it
   capture the compositional structure of bibliographies. many interesting
   extensions of the basic model we have explored are possible, from
   id187 of topics to more detailed models of citations and
   dynamic models of the evolution of scientific fields over time.
   nevertheless, as box notes, even wrong models may be useful. our
   results indicate that mixed-membership models can be useful for
   analyzing the implicit structure of scientific publications.
