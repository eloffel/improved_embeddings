abstract

   altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly
   advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and
   usefulness. nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific
   evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility
   although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between
   specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or
   fields. to fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with web of
   science citations for 76 to 208,739 pubmed articles with at least one
   altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. it
   also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by
   different citation and usage windows. statistically significant
   associations were found between higher metric scores and higher
   citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with
   sufficient evidence (twitter, facebook wall posts, research highlights,
   blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for google+ posts.
   evidence was insufficient for linkedin, pinterest, question and answer
   sites, and reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles
   with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between
   altmetrics and citations. nevertheless, comparisons between citations
   and metric values for articles published at different times, even
   within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so
   publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time
   when using altmetrics to rank articles. finally, the coverage of all
   the altmetrics except for twitter seems to be low and so it is not
   clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.

introduction

   although scholars may traditionally have found relevant articles by
   browsing journals, attending meetings and checking correspondence with
   peers, in the era of digital sources they may rely upon keyword
   searches or online browsing instead. whilst desktop access to many
   digital libraries and indexes provides potential access to numerous
   articles, scholars sometimes need strategies to help them to identify
   the most relevant articles from amongst large sets. in response, google
   scholar orders search matches in approximately decreasing order of
   citation, presumably with the assumption that more highly cited
   articles are more likely to be important or useful. digital libraries
   with citation indexes often offer the same service (e.g., acm, ieee).
   in addition, digital libraries typically offer options to either sort
   search results by date or to confine the results to a specific year.
   presumably, many scholars remain current in their fields and are
   therefore only interested in recent articles. however, given that
   citations need time to accrue, they are not the best indicator of
   important recent work. in response, some publishers have turned to
   altmetrics [59][1], [60][2], which are counts of citations or mentions
   in specific social web services, because they can appear more rapidly
   than citations. for example, it would be reasonable to expect a typical
   article to be most tweeted on its publication day and most blogged
   within a month of publication. hence, social media mentions have become
   a valuable marketing tool for publishers trying to promote current high
   impact articles and there are also a number of altmetric tracking
   websites that offer free and paid services (e.g., altmetric.com,
   impactstory.org, and sciencecard.org).

   the fact that citations take time to accumulate also has an impact on
   research evaluation, as a wait of a few years after publication is
   needed before the impact of papers can be measured (more in some
   disciplines). as a result, many have turned to journal impact factors
   as a proxy for the potential citation value of articles within
   journals; however, due to the skewness of citation distributions
   [61][3], journal measures should not be used as article-level
   indicators [62][4]. additionally, the relationship between citations
   and the impact factor is weakening [63][5]. social media mentions,
   being available immediately after publication   and even before
   publication in the case of preprints   offer a more rapid assessment of
   impact. lastly, citations only assess the impact of scholarly
   literature on those who cite   this neglects many other audiences of
   scholarly literature who may read, but do not cite (see the notion of
      pure    readers [64][6]   [65][8]). in particular, the societal impact of
   research may not be well addressed by citations and a range of
   alternative methods have been developed to assess this [66][9]. since
   the social web is widely used outside of science, it may have the
   potential to inform about societal impact.

   the use of altmetrics in information retrieval and research evaluation
   begs the question: how are altmetric and citation measures related? do
   social media mentions predict or correlate with subsequent citation
   rates for a given article? if a correlation is found, this might
   suggest that altmetrics and citations measure, at least to a certain
   extent, the same phenomenon and that altmetrics are merely early
   indicators of this underlying quality. the absence of such a
   relationship, however, would demonstrate that altmetrics probably
   measure something different. given this scenario, the quality that is
   measured by altmetrics should be examined in order to understand the
   validity of using such metrics in an evaluative manner or for
   information retrieval.

   this paper contributes to this discussion by comparing eleven different
   altmetric sources with citation data for 182 to 135,331 (depending on
   the metric) pubmed documents published between 2010 and 2012.
   specifically, this study seeks to answer the following research
   question: to what extent do the altmetric indicators associate with
   citation counts?

background

   employing non-citation-based metrics in the evaluation of research is
   not novel. previous research has looked for correlations between
   traditional citations and their younger counterparts: online
   presentations [67][10], online syllabi [68][11], google scholar
   citations [69][12]   [70][14], google book citations [71][15], and
   article downloads [72][16]   [73][18]. although webometric and electronic
   readership studies have tried to reflect scholarly impact in a broader
   sense, they have often been restricted by scalability of and access to
   data. as altmetrics focus on social media platforms that often provide
   free access to usage data through web apis, data collection is less
   problematic [74][19].

   several sources have been proposed as alternatives for measuring the
   impact of scholarly publications, such as mentions and citations in
   blogs, wikipedia, twitter or facebook or reader counts on social
   reference managers and bookmarking platforms [75][1],
   [76][19]   [77][22]. evaluations of these sources have focused on single
   genres or sources, such as twitter [78][23]   [79][25], blogs
   [80][26]   [81]27, bookmarks [82][28], and wikipedia [83][29]. some
   research has focused on a variety of indicators for a single source,
   such as analyses of plos article-level metrics (alm), which include
   counts of comments, ratings, social bookmarks and blog citations to
   articles published in the plos journals [84][4],[85][30]. reader counts
   from social bookmarking services and social reference managers such as
   mendeley, citeulike, bibsonomy and connotea have also been analyzed
   [86][28], [87][31]   [88][35].

   a few studies have investigated altmetrics and their relationship with
   traditional citation indicators. mendeley readership counts were found
   to correlate moderately with citations for nature (r   =   0.56) and
   science (r   =   0.54; [89][35]), plos (r   =   0.5; [90][36]), jasist
   (r   =   0.46; [91][31],[92][32]), bibliometrics publications (r   =   0.45;
   [93][33]) and more strongly for articles recommended on f1000
   (r   =   0.69; [94][34]). tweets of arxiv articles (i.e., preprints of
   articles in mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science,
   quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics) associate
   with early citation counts [95][25] and tweets of the journal of the
   american of medical internet association within the same year can
   predict future citation counts [96][24]. although these results suggest
   that there is a positive relationship between tweets and citations,
   these correlation studies have mainly covered individual elite journals
   and those that favour internet research. the exception, for arxiv
   preprints also covers a somewhat special area of scholarship: articles
   from quantitative research areas promoted by their authors through
   self-archiving.

   arguments against the value of altmetrics include the ease with which
   they can be manipulated and their susceptibility to skew in favour of
   comical or sexual titles (e.g., in february 2013 the top plos article
   (from plos neglected tropical diseases) on altmetric.com was entitled:
   "an in-depth analysis of a piece of shit: distribution of schistosoma
   mansoni and hookworm eggs in human stool"). in order to obtain more
   robust evidence, larger scale studies are needed. moreover, the various
   altmetrics have different characteristics when examined diachronically.
   priem, piwowar, and hemminger [97][36] examined the distribution of
   social media events over time for plos articles, noting differences in
   behaviour. for example, citations, page views and wikipedia citations
   tended to increase over time while citeulike, mendeley, delicious
   bookmarks, and f1000 ratings were relatively unaffected by article
   ages. other metrics contained serious flaws as changes in service and
   limitations of data hindered analysis   this highlights concerns over the
   stability of some of these indicators and the use of these indicators
   in longitudinal studies.

   it seems that altmetrics probably capture a broad, or at least a
   different, aspect of research visibility and impact in comparison to
   citation counts. for example, non-publishing so called    pure    readers
   are estimated to constitute one third of the scientific community
   [98][6],[99][7] and these may tweet or blog articles without ever
   citing them. publications also influence the development of new
   technologies, the daily work of professionals, teaching, and also have
   other societal effects [100][37],[101][38], which may also be tweeted
   about or discussed in the social web. kurtz and bollen [102][39]
   classified readers of scholarly publications into four groups:
   researchers, practitioners, undergraduates and the interested public.
   whilst all of these might use the social web, the first group is the
   most likely to publish scholarly papers.

   finally, the database used in this article, pubmed, indexes biomedical
   papers from medline as well as life science journals and online books.
   it is owned by the u.s. national library of medicine. the medline
   journals are selected by a technical advisory committee run by the u.s.
   national institutes of health [103][40].

methods

   the goal of the research design was to devise a fair test of whether
   higher altmetrics values associate with higher citation counts for
   articles. previous altmetric and webometric studies have tended to
   correlate citations with the web metric on the assumption that since
   citation counts are a recognised indicator of academic impact, any
   other measure that correlates positively with them is also likely to
   associate with academic impact. correlation tests are not ideal for
   altmetrics, however, because many are based upon services with a
   rapidly increasing uptake. in consequence, newer articles can expect,
   on average, to receive higher altmetric scores than older articles.
   since citations also take time to accrue the opposite is true for
   citation counts and so without adjusting for these differences a
   correlation test is always biased towards negative correlations.
   adjusting citation and usage windows to eliminate these biases, as done
   with download statistics (e.g., [104][16],[105][17],[106][41]), is
   difficult as reliable usage data is only available for recent documents
   for which the citation window will be too small. to avoid these issues
   a simple sign test was devised. for this test, each article is compared
   only against the two articles published immediately before and after it
   (within the data set used and for the same journal). thus only articles
   of approximately the same age, which are similarly exposed to the same
   citation delay and usage uptake biases, are compared to each other.
   moreover any slight advantage or disadvantage of the article published
   after the one tested should be cancelled out by its averaging with the
   equivalent advantage or disadvantage of the article published before.
   the test gives three possible outcomes:
     * success: the altmetric score is higher than the average altmetric
       score of the two adjacent articles and its citation score is higher
       than the average of the two adjacent articles or the altmetric
       score is lower than the average altmetric score of the two adjacent
       articles and its citation score is lower than the average of the
       two adjacent articles.
     * failure: the altmetric score is higher than the average altmetric
       score of the two adjacent articles and its citation score is lower
       than the average of the two adjacent articles or the altmetric
       score is lower than the average altmetric score of the two adjacent
       articles and its citation score is higher than the average of the
       two adjacent articles.
     * null: all other cases. note that this includes cases where all
       three articles are uncited, which is likely to occur when the
       articles are relatively new.

   to illustrate the above, suppose that articles a, b, and c are ranked
   in publication order and attracted 2, 3, and 6 tweets respectively.
   then comparing the altmetric score of b (3) with the average of the
   other two ((2+6)/2   =   4) results in a prediction that b will have less
   citations than the average of a and c. hence if a, b, and c get 4, 6,
   and 12 citations respectively, then this will count as a success (as 6
   is less than (4+12)/2   =   8). if they get 1, 2, and 1 citations,
   respectively, then this will count as a failure (as 2 is greater than
   (1+1)/2   =   1). if a, b and c get 1 citation each then this would count
   as a null result (as 1 is not greater than or less than (1+1)/2   =   1).
   using the above scores, the more strongly an altmetric associates with
   citations, the higher the ratio of success to failure should be.
   conversely, if an altmetric has no association with citations then the
   number of successes should not be statistically significantly different
   from the number of failures.

   the altmetric data used originates from altmetric.com. this data was
   delivered on january 1, 2013 and includes altmetric scores gathered
   since july 2011. although the system was undergoing development at the
   time and there may be periods of lost data, this should not cause false
   positive results due to the testing method used, as described above.
   the 11 metrics are the following.
     * tweets: tweets from a licensed twitter firehose are checked for
       citations.
     * fbwalls: a licensed facebook firehose is used for wall posts to
       check for citations.
     * rh: research highlights are identified from nature publishing group
       journals.
     * blogs: the blog (feed) citations are from a manually-curated list
       of about 2,200 science blogs, derived from the indexes at
       nature.com blogs, research blogging and scienceseeker.
     * google+: the google+ applications programming interface (api) is
       used to identify google+ posts to check for citations.
     * msm: the mainstream media citation count is based on a manually
       curated list of about 60 newspapers and magazines using links in
       their science coverage.
     * reddits: reddit.com posts from the reddit api are checked for
       citations.
     * forums: two forums are scraped for citations.
     * q&a: the stack exchange api and scraping of older q&a using the
       open source version of stack exchange's code are used to get online
       questions and answers to check for citations.
     * pinners: pinterest.com is scraped for citations.
     * linkedin: linkedin.com posts from the linkedin api are checked for
       citations.

   the altmetric data is not a complete list of all articles with pubmed
   ids. instead it is a list of all articles with a pubmed id and a
   non-zero altmetric.com score in at least one of the altmetrics.
   citations for these articles, if any, were obtained from wos by
   matching the bibliographic characteristics (authors, titles, journals,
   and pages) of pubmed records with wos records. first author
   self-citations were excluded from the results on the basis that authors
   would rarely hear about their work from social media. citations and
   self-citations had a spearman correlation of 0.954 for the data and so
   this made little difference to the results. mentions of articles by
   their authors in the altmetric data were not removed because this is
   impractical (e.g., due to twitter usernames not conforming to
   guidelines); it seems that no previous study and no altmetric web site
   has attempted to remove self-citations. there were 3,676,242 citations
   altogether to the articles in the data set, excluding self-citations.
   although the citation scores for the articles are not reliable due to
   the short citation windows, this should not cause systematic biases in
   the results because publication time is taken into account in the
   method used to compare citations with altmetric scores.

   for each journal and each altmetric, a list was created of all articles
   with a score of at least 1 on the altmetric, discarding articles with a
   zero score. the reason for the discarding policy was that the data set
   did not include a complete list of articles in each journal and it was
   impractical to obtain such a list. moreover, since the authors did not
   have control over the data collection process, altmetric data for
   articles may be missing due to problems in the data collection process
   (e.g., due to the matching processes used). as a consequence of this,
   it is not possible to be sure that articles with zero values for an
   altmetric should not have positive scores (unlike [107][42] for
   example). it is more certain that articles with a positive score on an
   altmetric had their data effectively collected with that altmetric and
   so data for articles with non-zero altmetric scores is the most
   reliable and is the only data used in this article. since the data
   collection process varies between altmetrics, it is not possible to
   assume that a positive score for an article on one altmetric implies
   that it will also have been effectively monitored for all the other
   altmetrics. preliminary testing showed that this was not the case
   (resulting in a preliminary analysis of the data with additional
   implied zeros for articles with a non-zero score on one altmetric but a
   positive score at least one other altmetric being rejected as
   unreliable and not reported here). the discarding policy allowed each
   list to be complete in the sense of including all articles with an
   altmetric score >1. the results, therefore, only relate to articles
   attracting a positive altmetric score.

   to obtain the chronological order needed for the sign test, for each
   journal and altmetric, the document lists were ordered by pubmed id.
   although imperfect, this was the most reliable general source of
   chronological information available. dois sometimes contain
   chronological information, such as a year, but even when a year is
   present it can refer to the submission year, acceptance year or
   publication year. although the publication year and issue number are
   included in the bibliographic metadata, they are not detailed enough
   and in many cases do not reflect the actual date of online
   availability. in contrast, the pubmed id is more fine-grained and
   universal. it seems likely to be reasonably chronologically consistent
   for each individual journal, if not between journals. as a validity
   check for this, pubmed ids were correlated with citation scores,
   providing a value of    0.611. cross-checking doi-extracted years with
   pubmed ids also confirmed that the use of pubmed ids to represent time
   was reasonable. pubmed supplies a range of dates for articles,
   including create date, date completed, date created, date last revised,
   date of electronic publication, date of publication, and date added to
   pubmed and, of these, date of electronic publication would also be a
   logical choice for date ordering. conducting the main analysis for
   journals separately ensures that predominantly articles from the same
   subject area are compared, except in the case of multidisciplinary
   journals. for journals with few articles in the data set any
   comparisons between altmetrics and citations are likely to be not
   statistically significant but it is still possible to test for
   statistical significance on the number of journals for which citations
   for individual articles associate positively with altmetrics more often
   than negatively.

   a simple proportion test was used for each altmetric to see whether the
   proportion of successes was significantly different from the default of
   0.5. null results (i.e., neither success nor failure) were ignored
   because these do not represent the presence of absence of an
   association. the proportion of null results is irrelevant because this
   depends to a great extent on the time since the data was collected. for
   instance, almost all recent data would have zero citations recorded and
   would hence give a null result. the number of null results therefore
   reveals nothing about the long term underlying relationship between an
   altmetric and citations. the test can occur only for journals with at
   least three articles in the data set and the number of tests is 2 less
   than the number of articles in the journal. this accounts for the
   differences between the number of articles and the number of tests in
   [108]table 1. the number of journals differs between [109]tables 1 and
   [110]2 because [111]table 1 only includes journals with at least one
   non-null test. a bonferroni correction for multiple tests was used to
   hold constant the id203 of incorrectly rejecting the null
   hypothesis. for the p   =   0.05 level, this reduces the p value to 0.0046
   and for the p   =   0.01 level, this reduces the p value to 0.0009.

results and discussion

   in all cases except google+ and reddit and those for which under 20
   articles were available to be tested (q&a, pinners, linkedin), the
   success rate of the altmetrics at associating with higher citation
   significantly exceeded the failure rate at the individual article level
   ([128]table 1). the null column of the table includes many cases of new
   articles with only one altmetric and no citations and therefore is
   potentially misleading because the articles may receive citations later
   and so the altmetric scores for the same articles could then become
   successes or failures. overall, there are no cases where the number of
   failures is lower than the number of successes and so this suggests
   that, given sufficient data, all the altmetrics would also show a
   significantly higher success than failure rate. the case that runs most
   counter to the hypothesis that altmetrics associate with citations is
   google+, which launched on june 28, 2011 and has non-significant
   results despite a large number of tagged articles. this may be a
   statistical anomaly since the ratio of successes to failures is only
   slightly above 50% for the metrics with significant scores (except for
   forums).

   the number of journals for which the success rate of articles exceeds
   the failure rate (although not necessarily with a significant
   difference within a journal) is a majority in all cases for which there
   is sufficient data ([129]table 2) and the difference is significant for
   three cases. this result stays the same if the data is restricted to
   journals with at least 10 tested articles. in summary, there is clear
   evidence that three altmetrics (tweets, fbwalls, blogs) tend to
   associate with citations at the level of individual journals. although
   for almost all metrics there are some journals for which the sign test
   produces more failures than successes, these tend to happen for
   journals with few articles tested and hence the majority failure could
   be a statistical artefact (i.e., due to normal random variations in the
   data). for instance, the 25 journals with the most tweeted articles all
   give more successes than failures. for tweets, the journal with the
   most articles and more failures than successes is the 26^th,
   proceedings of the royal society b (biological sciences), with 117
   prediction successes and 118 failures. this difference of 1 is easily
   accounted for by normal random factors in the data. in contrast, the
   most tweeted journal, proceedings of the national academy of sciences
   had 1069 successes and 818 failures (57% and 43%, respectively, of
   articles that were either success or failures), a small but significant
   difference. note that the magnitude of the difference between success
   and failure in [130]table 2 is not helpful to interpret because this is
   primarily dependent upon the proportion of journals with few articles
   represented for which the chance of success or failure is nearly 50%.
   similarly, the magnitude of the differences between the success and
   fail rates in both [131]tables 1 and [132]2 are not significant due to
   the simple tests used, and the magnitude of the correlation in
   [133]table 3 is misleading due to the conflicting (assumed) citation
   association and negative time association and so the results do not
   shed any light on the magnitude of the association between citations
   and altmetric scores in the cases where an association is proven.

   table 3. correlations between metric values and citations (excluding
   self-citations) for all articles with non-zero scores on each
   altmetric.

   [141]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064841.t003

   the problem of non-significant differences between success rates and
   failure rates for individual journals could be avoided in [142]table 2,
   in theory, by replacing the figures in the second and third columns
   with the number of journals for which the difference between the number
   of successes and failures is statistically significant. this is not
   possible, however, because too few journals have enough articles tested
   to give a reasonable chance of a statistically significant result.
   nevertheless, the results are consistent with but do not prove the
   hypothesis that all the altmetrics tested associate with higher
   citations.

   although the results are clear for most metrics, they only cover
   articles with a non-zero altmetric score. it is theoretically possible,
   but does not seem probable, that the same is not true for all articles.
   for the omission of articles with zero altmetric scores to bias the
   results towards sign test failures, articles with zero altmetric scores
   would need to be more cited than average for articles published at the
   same time that had a positive altmetric score. this seems unlikely
   since the results here show that increased altmetric scores tend to
   associate with increased citations. another limitation is that the
   results are only for pubmed articles and so it is not clear whether
   they would also apply outside the biomedical and life sciences. the
   differing sample sizes for the altmetrics is also important because
   altmetric-citations associations may well be significant for most of
   the altmetric but hidden by insufficient data. finally, unlike one
   previous study [143][24], no predictive power can be claimed from the
   results. although it seems likely that most altmetric values precede
   citations - for example, tweets seem to appear shortly after an article
   has been posted online [144][25] - this has not been tested here
   because the data does not include origin dates for the scores. in other
   words, we did not directly test that high altmetric scores today make
   high citations tomorrow more likely.

   related to the issue of predictive power, it is clear from [145]table 1
   that, other than tweets, the other metrics had a high proportion of
   zero scores. for instance there were only 20% as many research
   highlights articles as tweeted articles and only 0.04% as many articles
   in linkedin as tweeted articles. these figures are only estimates
   because there may be missing data and other data collection methods may
   have been able to identify more matches in all cases (including for
   tweets). nevertheless, the disparities in numbers of articles in
   [146]table 1 highlight that the coverage of the altmetrics, and
   particularly those other than twitter, may be low. a low coverage in
   combination with statistically significant results for an altmetric
   suggests that it is not useful to differentiate between average
   articles but may only be useful for identifying either exception
   articles or a sample of above average articles.

   correlation tests were run on the data to test the importance of time
   for identifying significant associations between altmetrics and
   citations. whilst four of the altmetrics significantly and positively
   correlate with citations (with a medium correlation effect size for rh,
   small for blogs, smaller for msm and fbwalls [147][43]), the
   correlation for twitter is significant and negative (with a small
   effect size [148][43], [149]table 3). the reason seems to be that
   twitter use is increasing much faster than the others, so that more
   recent articles are more tweeted but are typically uncited. in other
   words, this reflects the two biases of correlation coefficients,
   described above, that are caused by the level of social media uptake on
   the one hand and that of citation delay on the other. to test this we
   ran another correlation test for twitter based on articles from 2010
   based upon their doi (i.e., a very approximate heuristic since this
   could be the submission date, the acceptance date, the online first
   date or the final publication date), finding a small significantly
   negative correlation of -0.236. a partial correlation to remove the
   influence of time through pubmed ids (again a heuristic, especially
   because of it being used across multiple journals that may have
   different pubmed submission strategies) improved this to an almost zero
   correlation of 0.009, tending to confirm the importance of time. an
   implication of these results for publishers and digital library users,
   is that time from publication should be considered in addition to
   altmetric scores when using altmetrics to rank search results.

   the negative correlation from tweets in [150]table 3 should not be
   interpreted as evidence that high tweet counts do not associate with
   high quality articles. on the contrary, the evidence from [151]tables 1
   and [152]2 is that tweets are useful at indicating more highly cited
   articles; the negative correlation in [153]table 3 is due to tweets for
   uncited articles that, if the trend continues, will tend to become more
   highly cited over time. note that these correlations are not reliable
   because they include articles from multiple journals with different
   citation rates, with different pubmed submission times and strategies,
   and that are associated with fields that presumably have different
   cultures of twitter use.

   the correlations in [154]table 3 also confirm that the magnitude of the
   significant results in [155]tables 1 and [156]2 do not give evidence of
   the likely size of the underlying correlation between the altmetrics
   and citations. for example, there are positive associations for twitter
   in [157]tables 1 and [158]2 and a negative correlation in [159]table 3.
   hence it is not possible to speculate about the degree of accuracy for
   citation estimates made with altmetrics from the data set used here.

conclusions

   the results provide strong evidence that six of the eleven altmetrics
   (tweets, facebook wall posts, research highlights, blog mentions,
   mainstream media mentions and forum posts) associate with citation
   counts, at least in medical and biological sciences and for articles
   with at least one altmetric mention, but the methods used do not shed
   light on the magnitude of any correlation between the altmetrics and
   citations (i.e., the correlation effect size is unknown). nevertheless,
   the coverage of all of the altmetrics, except possibly twitter, is low
   (below 20% in all cases and possibly substantially below 20%) and so
   these altmetrics may only be useful to identify the occasional
   exceptional or above average article rather than as universal sources
   of evidence. the evidence also suggests that google+ posts might
   possibly have little or no association with citations, and too little
   data was available to be confident about whether four of the metrics
   (linkedin, pinners, questions, and reddits) associate with citation
   counts. nevertheless, given the positive results for the majority of
   metrics it would be reasonable to suppose that all may associate with
   citations and that if more data could be collected then this would be
   evident. in this case, a social web service would still need to be
   sufficiently used for citations to give enough data to be worth
   reporting or analysing (e.g., possibly not for linkedin, pinners and
   q&a). these results extend the previously published evidence of a
   relationship between altmetrics and citations for arxiv preprints and a
   few individual journals and two social web altmetrics (mendeley and
   twitter) to tests of up to 1,891 biomedical and life sciences journals
   and 11 altmetrics (6 with positive results). this study also introduced
   a simple method, the sign test, to eliminate biases caused by citation
   delays and the increasing uptake of social media platforms.

   another important finding is that because of the increasing use of the
   social web, and twitter in particular, publishers should consider
   ranking or displaying results in such a way that older articles are
   compensated for lower altmetric scores due to the lower social web use
   when they were published. without this, more recent articles with the
   same eventual impact as older articles will tend to have much higher
   altmetric scores. in practice, this may not be a significant worry,
   however, because those searching the academic literature may prefer to
   find more recent articles.

   although the results above suggest that altmetrics are related to
   citation counts, they might be able to capture the influence of
   scholarly publications on a wider and different section of their
   readership than citation counts, which reflect only the behaviour of
   publishing authors. however, more research     quantitative and
   qualitative     is needed to identify who publishes citations to academic
   articles in social web sites used to generate altmetrics (e.g.,
   students, researchers, the general public), and why they publish them.
   results in terms of user groups, users' motives and level of effort are
   likely to vary between social media platforms, which must be taken into
   consideration when applying different altmetrics in research evaluation
   and information retrieval.
