abstract

background

   the h-index has already been used by major citation databases to
   evaluate the academic performance of individual scientists. although
   effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that
   limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output
   of different researchers. these drawbacks include information loss and
   low resolution: the former refers to the fact that in addition to h^2
   citations for papers in the h-core, excess citations are completely
   ignored, whereas the latter means that it is common for a group of
   researchers to have an identical h-index.

methodology/principal findings

   to solve these problems, i here propose the e-index, where e^2
   represents the ignored excess citations, in addition to the h^2
   citations for h-core papers. citation information can be completely
   depicted by using the h-index together with the e-index, which are
   independent of each other. some other h-type indices, such as a and r,
   are h-dependent, have information redundancy with h, and therefore,
   when used together with h, mask the real differences in excess
   citations of different researchers.

conclusions/significance

   although simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement,
   especially for evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely
   comparing the scientific output of a group of scientists having an
   identical h-index.

introduction

   the h-index, proposed by hirsch [59][1], [60][2], has already been used
   by major citation databases, such as web of science and scopus, to
   evaluate the academic performance of individual scientists. although
   effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that
   limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output
   of different researchers. many of these drawbacks have been pointed out
   in literatures, and consequently some h-type indices were proposed to
   overcome these drawbacks [61][3]   [62][14]. for reviews, refer to
   [63][15]   [64][17].

   here i emphasize that two disadvantages of the h-index have not yet
   been sufficiently overcome. the first disadvantage is the loss of
   citation information, i.e., in addition to the h^2 citations that can
   be inferred from the h-index, excess citations are completely ignored.
   due to this drawback, comparisons based on h-index alone can be
   misleading, because researchers having a lower h-index can in fact have
   much more citations than those having a higher h-index.

   the second drawback of the h-index is the low resolution, resulting
   from its low potential. the h-index, composed of natural numbers, has a
   much lower potential than a set of real numbers. furthermore, the
   h-index has a relatively narrow range. for instance, dr. edward witten
   had the highest h-index, 110, among physicists all over the world
   [65][1]. in fact, in any field, scientists having an h-index larger
   than 100 (at least 10,000 citations) are rare. therefore, due to low
   resolution, it is quite common for a group of scientists to have an
   identical h-index. this paper is devoted to solving the two
   aforementioned problems by introducing the e-index, a real number, to
   complement the h-index for the ignored excess citations.

results and discussion

definitions of the e-index

   in what follows, we study only the citations received by papers in the
   h-core, all of a researcher's papers having at least h citations
   [66][18]. using the h-index, the only citation information that can be
   inferred is [journal.pone.0005429.e001] , i.e., at least h^2 citations
   have been received, and additional citations for papers in the h-core
   are completely ignored. here we define the e-index to complement the
   h-index for the ignored excess citations. the excess citations received
   by all papers in the h-core, denoted by [journal.pone.0005429.e002] ,
   are [journal.pone.0005429.e003] (1)where [journal.pone.0005429.e004]
   are the citations received by the j^th paper and
   [journal.pone.0005429.e005] denotes the excess citations within the
   h-core. letting [journal.pone.0005429.e006] (2)we have
   [journal.pone.0005429.e007] (3)or [journal.pone.0005429.e008] (4)note
   that [journal.pone.0005429.e009] , and [journal.pone.0005429.e010] is a
   real number. accordingly, [journal.pone.0005429.e011] (5)

a geometrical explanation of the e-index

   without losing generality, we assume that [journal.pone.0005429.e012] ,
   [journal.pone.0005429.e013] , can be represented by a smooth function
   [journal.pone.0005429.e014] , [journal.pone.0005429.e015] , where
   [journal.pone.0005429.e016] , and [journal.pone.0005429.e017] ,
   [journal.pone.0005429.e018] . based on the function
   [journal.pone.0005429.e019] , we will give a geometrical explanation
   about the above formulas. [journal.pone.0005429.e020] (6)i.e.,
   [journal.pone.0005429.e021] is equal to the area of the dark gray
   region in [67]figure 1.

   without losing generality, we assume that [journal.pone.0005429.e022] ,

   [journal.pone.0005429.e024] , [journal.pone.0005429.e025] . a typical
   [journal.pone.0005429.e026] curve is shown here, where
   [journal.pone.0005429.e027] is equal to the area of the dark gray
   region.

   [75]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005429.g001

   i emphasize that [journal.pone.0005429.e028] is independent of h, and
   [journal.pone.0005429.e029] represents the net excess citations
   received by all papers in the h-core, in addition to h^2 citations.
   note that the larger the [journal.pone.0005429.e030] , the larger the
   net excess citations, and hence more severe of the loss of citation
   information when using the h-index alone. in other words, when the
   h-index is used to evaluate individual scientists, the smaller the e,
   the more reliable the h-index is. in an extreme case, when
   [journal.pone.0005429.e031] , which is highly unlikely in reality, the
   h-index completely describes the citation information for papers in the
   h-core. otherwise, when [journal.pone.0005429.e032] , the h-index
   always losses citation information, which is complemented by the
   e-index.

numerical relations between the e-index and some other h-type indices

   the relations between the e-index and some other h-type indices,
   including the a-index [76][7] and the r-index [77][14], are presented
   briefly as follows. a plane is spanned by h and e, called the
   [journal.pone.0005429.e033] plane ([78]figure 2). a point
   [journal.pone.0005429.e034] in the [journal.pone.0005429.e035] plane
   represents the overall information of citations received by all papers
   in the h-core. it is interesting to point out that the euclidean
   distance between the origin and the point [journal.pone.0005429.e036]
   is equal to [journal.pone.0005429.e037] (7)where the r-index here is
   given a geometrical meaning ([79]figure 2).

   all the horizontal lines are called isohindex lines, on which all the
   mapping points have identical h-index. one of the isohindex lines is
   shown. the r-index is equal to [journal.pone.0005429.e038] , the
   euclidean distance between the point [journal.pone.0005429.e039] and
   the origin.

   from eq. (3), it is found [journal.pone.0005429.e040] (8)

   the 4 indices being discussed, h, e, a and r, can be divided into two
   types, fundamental ones and derived ones. a fundamental index satisfies
   following conditions (i) it is an independent variable (ii) it can be
   used to derive other indices. here h and e are fundamental indices,
   because they are independent of each other, and they can be used to
   derive a and r. in contrast, a and r are derived indices, because they
   are dependent on h and e, which are not derivable given either a or r.

   let [journal.pone.0005429.e041] (9)where f denotes the fold of excess
   citations over the h^2 citations received for papers in the h-core. the
   total citations received in the h-core are equal to
   [journal.pone.0005429.e042] , as shown in [88]figure 1. therefore, the
   combination ( [journal.pone.0005429.e043] ) provides complete citation
   information in the h-core. in contrast, a and r are derived indices,
   and they therefore have information redundancy with h. when a or r is
   used together with h, the information redundancy masks the f values,
   i.e., the real fold of excess citations over the h^2 citations are less
   than the real ones, which will be exemplified by comparisons of
   citations for some scientists in the following section.

comparison of the academic performance of scientists within an isohindex
group

   the mapping points p(e, h) can only be situated on the horizontal lines
   in the h-e plane with h   =   1, 2,    , h, where h is the largest value of
   the h-index, given a group of scientists. all of the points on the same
   horizontal line have an identical h-index. for convenience, this
   horizontal line is called an isohindex line, where    isohindex    denotes
   an identical h-index. one of such isohindex lines is shown in
   [89]figure 2. we further define the isohindex group as follow: a group
   of scientists having an identical h-index is said to be within an
   isohindex group. to compare the academic performance of scientists
   belonging to the same isohindex group, the h-index is inadequate, and
   the e-index becomes especially necessary.

   the journal chemistry world published a list of chemists with high
   h-indices [90][19]. as an example, we chose from the list two chemists
   both having an h-index of 51 ([91]table 1). although having an
   identical h-index, the second researcher in fact had much more
   citations than the first researcher. the e-indices for the second and
   first researchers are 54.73 and 31.10, respectively, and
   (54.73/31.10)^2   =   3.1, indicating that the citations ignored by the
   h-index for the second researcher are more than 3 times of those of the
   first researcher.

   chemists.^a

   [99]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005429.t001

   the merit of using the e-index is that [journal.pone.0005429.e051] is
   strictly equal to the net excess citations received for all the papers
   in the h-core, whereas a and r are not. both a and r are derived
   indices, and they all include contribution from both h^2 citations and
   the net excess citations ( [journal.pone.0005429.e052] ), and they are
   dependent on h and e, while e is independent of h. consequently, using
   a or r together with the h-index to evaluate the performance of
   scientists within an isohindex group can lead to unrealistic result.

   compared with the first researcher, the second one had a more than
   2-fold increase in net excess citations, however, a and r only
   increased by 0.57- and 0.25-fold, respectively. therefore, a and r
   indices mask the real difference in ignored excess citations, and the
   e-index is more objective and precise, when used together with the
   h-index, in comparing the citation information for researchers within
   an isohindex group.

   the third researcher listed in [100]table 1 is the famous chemist, dr.
   berni alder, who pioneered computer simulation. it is noteworthy that
   the h-index severely underestimates the scientific impact of him.
   although having an h-index of 50, dr. alder's total citations were much
   more than many researchers having an h-index of 50 or even more than
   50. for instance, the total citations of dr. alder were more than 4
   times of those for the first researcher, who had a higher h-index, 51.
   the e-index for dr. alder was 114.0 and f   =   5.2, indicating that the
   ignored excess citations by the h-index were more than 5 times of the
   h^2 citations, highlighting the need for using the e-index.

loss of citation information by the g-index

   the e-index proposed here is aimed at considering the contributions of
   excess citations, which are mainly from highly cited papers. it is
   necessary to mention the g-index, which was proposed as being
      sensitive to the level of the highly cited papers    [101][5]. the
   g-index is defined as    the highest number of g of papers that together
   received g^2 or more citations    [102][5]. although having some
   advantages, the g-index also suffers from the loss of citation
   information in many important cases, especially for distinguished
   scientists (most of whose papers are highly cited). for instance, for
   any [journal.pone.0005429.e053] , if [journal.pone.0005429.e054]
   (10)then the g-index has no definition. in fact, for any n conditions
   in eq. (10), the g-index can have no definition. among the n conditions
   in eq. (10), the strongest condition is [journal.pone.0005429.e055]
   (11)and the weakest condition is [journal.pone.0005429.e056] (12)eq.s
   (10), (11) and (12) are associated with many important cases. for
   example, dr. frederick sanger is an outstanding scientist, who won the
   nobel prize twice. he has published 30 papers (n   =   30), and the
   citation number for one of his paper is 63781, much more than
   30^2   =   900, indicating that the condition in eq. (11) is satisfied.

   noticing this problem, egghe later proposed two options [103][20]:    we
   can define g   =   t [t denotes the total number of papers], or better [   ],
   we can add [   ] fictitious articles with zero citations: we add enough
   of these    articles    so that [   ] we denote by t the new number of
   articles (including the fictitious ones)   .

   by the option 1 the g-index for dr. sanger is 30, where total citations
   [journal.pone.0005429.e057] , and therefore, about 99% of citations are
   ignored by the g-index (30^2/79400). therefore the option 1 could lead
   to the loss of citation information, especially for distinguished
   scientists; and in such cases, the more highly cited, the more of the
   loss of information. by the option 2, the g-index is always equal to [
   [journal.pone.0005429.e058] ], where [ [journal.pone.0005429.e059] ] is
   the integer part of [journal.pone.0005429.e060] . therefore, for dr.
   sanger, g   =   281, suggesting that about 90% of papers (1   30/281) are
   fictitious. if the option 2 is adopted, by the g-index alone, there is
   no way for users to know, for a scientist being evaluated, how many
   papers are real, and how many papers are fictitious; this will confuse
   users, as an old saying goes    fiction in fact, then fact becomes
   fiction   . therefore, both options seem not ideal. here i suggest that
   the use of an e-like index to denote the loss of citations would be
   another way to solve the above problem of the g-index.

a simple mathematical model

   based on the citation curve [journal.pone.0005429.e061] , the h and
   e-indices can be calculated. here we study only a simple mathematical
   model. we assume that [journal.pone.0005429.e062] (13)where
   [journal.pone.0005429.e063] is the maximum citations received by a
   paper in the h-core. first of all, we assume
   [journal.pone.0005429.e064] . according to the definition of the
   h-index, we have [journal.pone.0005429.e065] , leading to the result
   [journal.pone.0005429.e066] (14)

   based on eq. (6), we find [journal.pone.0005429.e067] (15)

   when [journal.pone.0005429.e068] , similarly we have
   [journal.pone.0005429.e069] (16) [journal.pone.0005429.e070] (17)

   the parameters could be estimated from eq. (14), and it was found that
   [journal.pone.0005429.e071] , [journal.pone.0005429.e072] , and
   [journal.pone.0005429.e073] , respectively, for the 3 chemists listed
   in [104]table 1. i emphasize that when [journal.pone.0005429.e074] ,
   [journal.pone.0005429.e075] , and then the h-index becomes unreliable
   in reflecting the academic performance. for example, letting
   [journal.pone.0005429.e076] , and assuming [journal.pone.0005429.e077]
   , we find [journal.pone.0005429.e078] , and [journal.pone.0005429.e079]
   . consequently, [journal.pone.0005429.e080] . this result shows that
   even when [journal.pone.0005429.e081] , the ignored excess citations
   (80000) are much more than the h^2 citations (100).

concluding remarks

   the h-index has already been used by major citation databases to
   evaluate the academic performance of individual scientists. because of
   the loss of citation information, comparisons based on the h-index
   alone can be misleading, as exemplified by dr. alder, whose total
   citations are much more than those of many researchers having higher
   h-indices; the ignored excess citations (e^2) are more than 5 times of
   h^2 citations. therefore, for accurate and fair comparisons, it is
   necessary to use the e-index together with the h-index. some other
   h-type indices, such as a and r, are h-dependent, have information
   redundancy with h, and therefore, when used together with h, mask the
   real differences in excess citations of different researchers. although
   simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement, especially for
   evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely comparing the
   scientific output of a group of scientists having an identical h-index.

materials and methods

   the 3 scientists listed in [105]table 1 were from the h-index ranking
   published by chemistry world [106][19]. the third scientist in
   [107]table 1 was dr. berni alder. the citations for those listed in
   [108]table 1 and for dr. frederick sanger were obtained from web of
   science in march, 2009.
