abstract

background

   although being a simple and effective index that has been widely used
   to evaluate academic output of scientists, the h-index suffers from
   drawbacks. one critical disadvantage is that only h-squared citations
   can be inferred from the h-index, which completely ignores excess and
   h-tail citations, leading to unfair and inaccurate evaluations in many
   cases.

methodology /principal findings

   to solve this problem, i propose the h   -index, in which h-squared,
   excess and h-tail citations are all considered. based on the citation
   data of the 100 most prolific economists, comparing to h-index, the
   h   -index shows better correlation with indices of total-citation number
   and citations per publication, which, although relatively reliable and
   widely used, do not carry the information of the citation distribution.
   in contrast, the h   -index possesses the ability to discriminate the
   shapes of citation distributions, thus leading to more accurate
   evaluation.

conclusions /significance

   the h   -index improves the h-index, as well as indices of total-citation
   number and citations per publication, by possessing the ability to
   discriminate shapes of citation distribution, thus making the h   -index
   a better single-number index for evaluating scientific output in a way
   that is fairer and more reasonable.

introduction

   the h-index, proposed by hirsch [59][1], has received wide attention in
   recent years. for example, as of january 1, 2013, the original paper
   [60][1] putting forward the h-index has been cited for 1,232 times in
   the database of science citation index (sci). due to its importance,
   the h-index study becomes one of the hottest topics in past years
   [61][2]. for recent reviews, refer to [62][3], [63][4], [64][5],
   [65][6], [66][7]. although being a simple and effective index, the
   h-index suffers from drawbacks. to improve or complement the h-index,
   many h-type indices were proposed. we list a few of them, but not all,
   as follows: the g-index [67][8], a-index [68][9], r-index and ar-index
   [69][10], [70][11], h^(2)- index [71][12], e-index [72][13], [73][14],
   etc. for more details about the h-type indices, refer to [74][3],
   [75][4], [76][6]. the relation among the h-index and some h-type
   indices was studied in [77][15]. one of the disadvantages of the
   h-index is the so-called isohindex problem, a phenomenon that many
   scientists share an identical h-index. to overcome the disadvantage,
   the real-value h-index [78][16] and rational (successive) h-index
   [79][17] were proposed. the time dependence of the h-index and h-type
   indices and the relation among them were studied in [80][18], [81][19],
   [82][20], [83][21]. at the same time, the h-index was used in various
   areas. for example, the h-index or the h-type indices were used for
   evaluating physicists [84][22], studying journals [85][23], evaluating
   chemical research groups correlated with peer judgment [86][24] and for
   evaluating the 100 most prolific economists [87][25]. interestingly, it
   is reported recently that references [88][6], [89][8], [90][11],
   [91][22], [92][23] and [93][24] are the most-cited articles in their
   respective journals [94][2]. for example, reference [95][11] is the
   most-cited article ever, published in the chinese science bulletin
   [96][2].

   one important advantage of the h-index is its simplicity. the h-index
   uses only an integer to measure the academic output of a scientist.
   therefore, the web of science provides the h-index for every scientist
   whose papers are indexed by the sci database. as any single-number
   indicator, one of the disadvantages of the h-index is the loss of
   citation information. the area under the citation distribution is
   divided by the h-index into three parts, [journal.pone.0059912.e001] ,
   excess and h-tail citations ([97]fig. 1). the h-index by itself does
   not carry information for excess and h-tail citations, which can play
   an even more dominant role than the h-index in determining the shape of
   citation distribution curve. ignoring the contributions from the excess
   and h-tail citations usually either under-estimates or over-estimates
   the academic output of the scientist under study.

   figure 1. a straight-line model of the citation distribution function.

   the area under the citation distribution curve is divided by the
   h-index into three parts: the h^2, excess citations (
   [journal.pone.0059912.e002] ) and h-tail citations (
   [journal.pone.0059912.e003] ). here the citation distribution curve is
   simplified as a straight line. cases shown in a, b and c all belong to
   an isohindex group, and they represent three types of scientists: a,
   perfectionist-type; b, prolific-type and c, mass producer-type
   [105][29], [106][30], respectively.

   [107]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059912.g001

   the current study aims to solve the above problem by proposing the
   h   -index, a new h-type index that satisfies the following requirements.
   first, we hope to keep the most important advantage of the h-index,
   i.e., to use a single-number to measure the academic output of
   scientists. second, the new index should carry the main information of
   citation distributions. in other words, in addition to
   [journal.pone.0059912.e004] , the new index should reflect the
   information from the excess citations [108][13] and h-tail citations
   [109][26], [110][27]. third, as a single-number evaluation index, the
   total citation number and citations per publication are widely used to
   evaluate the academic performance of scientists nowadays, e.g., the
   latter was used to rank the world   s top 100 materials scientists by
   thomson- reuters in 2011 [111][28]. therefore, we hope that the new
   index should be highly and linearly correlated with these two indices,
   respectively, while overcoming their main disadvantage of having no
   information about citation distribution.

results and discussion

definition of the [journal.pone.0059912.e005] -index

   as pointed out previously, the area under the citation distribution
   function is divided by the h-index into three parts, representing the
   h^2, excess and h-tail citations. however, the shapes of the citation
   distributions are different for different scientists. the shapes may be
   roughly divided into three types, represented by a simple straight line
   model ([112]fig. 1).

   the distribution functions shown in [113]fig. 1a, b and c represent
   three types of scientists.

   scientists are roughly divided into 3 types [114][29], [115][30].
   scientist a is called a perfectionist, who has few publications, which,
   however, are highly cited. scientist b is called a prolific-type
   scientist, who publishes a large number of papers which also tend to be
   highly cited. scientist c is called a mass producer, who publishes a
   large number of papers that are lowly cited. scientist a corresponds to
   [116]fig. 1a, where [journal.pone.0059912.e006] or
   [journal.pone.0059912.e007] , with [journal.pone.0059912.e008] and
   [journal.pone.0059912.e009] corresponding to excess and h-tail
   citations [117][13], [118][26], [119][27]. here the e-index and t-index
   need to be explained. the e-index is the square root of the excess
   citations over [journal.pone.0059912.e010] in the h-core [120][13]. the
   t-index is the square root of the h-tail citations [121][26],
   [122][27]. scientist b corresponds to [123]fig. 1b, where
   [journal.pone.0059912.e011] or [journal.pone.0059912.e012] and
   scientist c corresponds to [124]fig. 1c, where
   [journal.pone.0059912.e013] or [journal.pone.0059912.e014] .

   based on the above analysis, it can be seen that the real number
   [journal.pone.0059912.e015] is an important parameter to characterize
   the shapes of the citation distributions. letting
   [journal.pone.0059912.e016] (1)

   we call r the e   t ratio, or the head-tail ratio. the three cases of
   [journal.pone.0059912.e017] , [journal.pone.0059912.e018] and
   [journal.pone.0059912.e019] correspond to three types of the citation
   distribution functions. the e   t ratio, [journal.pone.0059912.e020] , is
   an important index to capture the overall shapes of citation
   distribution functions. the shapes of citation distribution functions
   for [journal.pone.0059912.e021] are peaked, and for
   [journal.pone.0059912.e022] the shapes of the citation functions are
   flat with a long tail, whereas for [journal.pone.0059912.e023] the
   citation functions are roughly symmetrical with respect to the diagonal
   line of the coordinate system. when [journal.pone.0059912.e024] ,
   especially [journal.pone.0059912.e025] , the h-index under-estimates
   the academic output of the scientist being studied, whereas when
   [journal.pone.0059912.e026] , especially [journal.pone.0059912.e027] ,
   the h-index over-estimates the academic output of the scientist being
   studied. when [journal.pone.0059912.e028] , the h-index properly
   reflects the academic output of the scientist under study. to have a
   fair evaluation of the academic output of scientists, we propose a
   novel h-type index, the [journal.pone.0059912.e029] -index, which is
   defined by [journal.pone.0059912.e030] (2)where e, h and t are the
   e-index, h-index and t-index, respectively.

   the citations received by all papers in the h-core, denoted by
   [journal.pone.0059912.e031] , are [journal.pone.0059912.e032] (3)where
   [journal.pone.0059912.e033] are the citations received by the j^th
   paper. letting [journal.pone.0059912.e034] denote the excess citations
   within the h-core, we find [125][13] [journal.pone.0059912.e035]
   (4)where r is the r-index [126][11]. thus,

   [journal.pone.0059912.e036] (5)meanwhile, the t-index was defined by
   [127][27] [journal.pone.0059912.e037] (6)where
   [journal.pone.0059912.e038] is the number of total citations received
   by all papers published by the scientist under study. finally, we have
   [journal.pone.0059912.e039] (7)

comparisons between the h   -index and h-index

   first, two concrete examples are considered. according to the citation
   information provided by dodson [128][14], [journal.pone.0059912.e040] ,
   [journal.pone.0059912.e041] and [journal.pone.0059912.e042] , we find
   [journal.pone.0059912.e043] and [journal.pone.0059912.e044] .
   therefore, the h-index for dodson is properly applicable. another
   example is for the chemist berni alder, where
   [journal.pone.0059912.e045] , [journal.pone.0059912.e046] and
   [journal.pone.0059912.e047] [129][13], we find
   [journal.pone.0059912.e048] and [journal.pone.0059912.e049] .
   therefore, this example shows that alder   s h-index severely
   under-estimates his academic output, whereas the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e050] -index gives him a relatively fair
   evaluation.

   second, we turn to study the research output of three types of
   scientists a, b and c within the same isohindex group. the three
   scientists are the real applicants applying for the young investigator
   programme, in the program of the european molecular biology
   organization (embo) in heidelberg, germany [130][29]. scientist a, b
   and c belong to the perfectionist-type, prolific-type and mass
   producer-type scientist, respectively [131][29], [132][30].

   the common character of them is that they all have the same h-index,
   [journal.pone.0059912.e051] based on the data provided by [133]fig. 1
   in [134][29], the number of papers, the total number of citations, the
   citations per publication, the e-index, t-index, the e-t ratio r and
   the h   -index are all listed in [135]table 1. as we can see that the
   academic performance of the three types of scientists a, b and c is
   quite different. this example shows that the h-index does not posses
   the ability to discriminate different shapes of the citation
   distributions. in contrast, the citations per publication and the
   h   -index appropriately reflect the academic performance of the three
   types of scientists a, b and c, whereas the h-index does not
   discriminate the three types of scientists correctly.

   same isohindex group with h   =   14^a.

   [143]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059912.t001

   third, in what follows, we compare the h-index and
   [journal.pone.0059912.e052] -index for the 100 most prolific economists
   [144][25]. the correlation between the h-index and total-citation
   number for the 100 economists is shown in [145]fig. 2a, whereas that
   between the [journal.pone.0059912.e053] -index and total- citation
   number is shown in [146]fig. 2b. it is seen that the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e054] -index has a linear correlation with the
   total-citation number better than the h-index. likewise, the linear
   correlation between the h- or h   -index and citations per publication
   for the 100 economists is shown in [147]fig. 3a and b, respectively. we
   can see that the [journal.pone.0059912.e055] -index has a higher linear
   correlation with the citations per publication than the h-index. of
   note, the correlation coefficient between the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e056] -index and the citations per publication is
   as high as 0.969. however, this does not imply that the two are nearly
   equal with each other. in fact, the average value and standard
   deviation of the [journal.pone.0059912.e057] -index and citations per
   publication over the 100 most prolific economists are
   [journal.pone.0059912.e058] and [journal.pone.0059912.e059] ,
   respectively.

   [journal.pone.0059912.e064] -index and the number of total citations,
   based on the data of the 100 most prolific economists. note that the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e065] -index shows better linear correlation with
   the index of citations per publication than the h-index.

   [163]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059912.g003

   theoretically, the [journal.pone.0059912.e066] -index carries more
   citation information than the h-index, because the h-index captures
   only the information of the h^2 citations, whereas the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e067] -index captures not only the h^2 citations,
   but also the excess and h-tail citation information. examples shown in
   [164]fig. 1 and [165]table 1 indicate that the h-index does not possess
   the ability to discriminate the shapes of the citation distribution
   functions. the three cases shown in [166]fig. 1 belong to the same
   isohindex group, i.e., they have an identical h-index. the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e068] -index properly discriminates the three
   cases, with [journal.pone.0059912.e069] , [journal.pone.0059912.e070]
   and [journal.pone.0059912.e071] , respectively, for the cases shown in
   [167]fig. 1a, b and c.

   as mentioned above, the h-index has the isohindex problem. since the
   h   -index is a real number, it provides an alternative solution in
   addition to those suggested in [168][16] and [169][17]. however, in
   some special cases, the h   -index can have the similar problem. for
   instance, if the citation curve in [170]fig. 1a is modified so that it
   is not linear, with the area of upper part decreasing to 0.54 h, while
   the lower part (h-tail) remains the same 0.54 h, then e   =   0.54 h   =   t
   and h      =   h, as in [171]fig. 1b. this example shows that different
   citation distribution may lead to the same h   -index. however, it seems
   that this problem of the h   -index occurs so rarely that it is highly
   unlikely in reality. in addition, it is also possible that different
   h-values can lead to the same h   -values, but it is not yet observed.

   hirsch suggested that the h-index is preferable to single-number
   criteria commonly used to evaluate scientific output of a researcher,
   such as the number of total citations and citations per publication
   [172][1]. here we show that as a single-number evaluation index, the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e079] -index is also superior to the number of
   total citations and citations per publication. first, we compare the
   h   -index with the number of total citations. as a single-number, the
   merit of the number of total citations is to measure the total output
   of the scientist under study using only a simple integer. however, its
   notable disadvantage is that this number cannot discriminate the shapes
   of the citation distributions. refer to [173]fig. 1 a and c, where the
   numbers of total citations are identical, being equal to the total area
   under the citation distribution functions. however, our scientific
   common sense shows that scientist shown in [174]fig. 1a (perfectionist
   with few but influential papers) has a better academic performance than
   that in [175]fig. 1c (mass producer with many low-impact papers). this
   fact is correctly reflected by the [journal.pone.0059912.e080] -index,
   but not by the number of total citations. second, in terms of citations
   per publication, although this widely used index seems better than the
   number of total citations, it also does not possess the ability to
   discriminate the shapes of the citation distribution functions.
   consequently, as correctly pointed out by hirsch [176][1], this index
   (cit/pub) usually rewards low productivity, and penalizes high
   productivity.

ranking of the performance of scientists based on various evaluation indices

   here we show as an example rankings of the academic performance of the
   100 most prolific economists. for convenience, we list only the top ten
   of the rankings ([177]table 2). the rankings are based on the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e081] -index, citations per publication and the
   h-index, respectively. as we can see from [178]table 2 that the top
   three economists based on the [journal.pone.0059912.e082] -index were a
   shleifer, rj barro and rf engle, whereas the top three based on the
   citations per publication were r f engle, r j barro and a shleifer.
   that is to say, except the ranking order is slightly different, the
   names of the top three were identical. however, the top three
   economists based on the h-index were different from those based on the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e083] -index and cit/pub. indeed, except a
   shleifer, the names of the remaining two were different.

   indices.

   [186]https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059912.t002

   among the top ten of the 100 most prolific economists based the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e084] -index, nine were identical with those
   based on the citations per publication, indicating that the two
   rankings were considerably consistent. in contrast, of the top ten
   economists ranked on the [journal.pone.0059912.e085] -index, only seven
   were identical with those based on the h-index. furthermore, dr. rf
   engle, who ranked no. 1 based on cit/pub, and no. 3 based on the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e086] -index, did not appear in the name list of
   the top ten economists based on the h-index. of the evaluation indices
   currently available, it is believed that the index of citations per
   publication is a relatively reliable index for ranking the academic
   performance of scientists. recently, the index of citations per
   publication was used to rank the world   s top 100 materials scientists
   by thomson-reuters [187][28]. in the analysis above, we show that the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e087] -index is preferable to citations per
   publication, because the index of citations per publication does not
   possess the ability to discriminate the shapes of the citation
   distribution functions. as a consequence, the index of citations per
   publication usually rewards low productivity, and penalizes high
   productivity [188][1]. our overall opinion is that the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e088] -index is one of the best single-number
   evaluation indices, which can be used to rank the academic performance
   of scientists in a way that is fairer and more reasonable.

a study based on a power law model

   based on the citation distribution function [journal.pone.0059912.e089]
   , the e   t ratio can be calculated. here we study only a simple power
   law model known as a lotka   s model. we assume that
   [journal.pone.0059912.e090] (8)where [journal.pone.0059912.e091] is the
   maximum citations received by the papers in the h-core. this type of
   function is in fact the zipf-type formulation rather than the lotka
   [189][31]. it was shown that [190][31]

   [journal.pone.0059912.e092] (9)please refer to [191]equations (8) and
   (9) of reference [192][31]. we further assume
   [journal.pone.0059912.e093] . according to the definition of the
   h-index [193][1], we have [journal.pone.0059912.e094] , leading to the
   above result eq. (9) [194][13]. based on eqs. (4) and (9), we find
   [195][13] [journal.pone.0059912.e095] (10)

   the t-index can be calculated by. [journal.pone.0059912.e096] (11)where
   n is the number of all papers published by the scientist under study.
   consequently, we have

   [journal.pone.0059912.e097] (12)it can be seen that the parameter
   [journal.pone.0059912.e098] is an important factor to determine the e-t
   ratio [journal.pone.0059912.e099] . the parameter
   [journal.pone.0059912.e100] cannot be too large. for example, letting
   [journal.pone.0059912.e101] and assuming [journal.pone.0059912.e102] ,
   [journal.pone.0059912.e103] , we find [journal.pone.0059912.e104]
   [journal.pone.0059912.e105] and [journal.pone.0059912.e106] .
   consequently, [journal.pone.0059912.e107] this result shows that even
   when [journal.pone.0059912.e108] the excess citations (
   [journal.pone.0059912.e109] ) and h-tail citations (
   [journal.pone.0059912.e110] ) cannot be ignored. as a result, the
   [journal.pone.0059912.e111] -index ( [journal.pone.0059912.e112] )
   results in a more reasonable evaluation.

   to have an intuitive picture, let us consider some numerical examples
   as follows. taking [journal.pone.0059912.e113] ,
   [journal.pone.0059912.e114] and letting [journal.pone.0059912.e115]
   respectively, we calculate the value of [journal.pone.0059912.e116] for
   each case. using eq. (12), we find the coordinates of 12 points in the
   plane of [journal.pone.0059912.e117] versus [journal.pone.0059912.e118]
   , as shown in [196]fig. 4. this example further shows that the power
   parameter [journal.pone.0059912.e119] is one of the key factors to
   determine the value of the e-t ratio [journal.pone.0059912.e120] .

   [journal.pone.0059912.e121] .

   based on a power law model, the e-t ratio [journal.pone.0059912.e122]
   can be calculated. letting [journal.pone.0059912.e123] ,
   [journal.pone.0059912.e124] and [journal.pone.0059912.e125]
   respectively, we calculate the values of the e-t ratio
   [journal.pone.0059912.e126] for each case. using eq. (12), we find 12
   values of [journal.pone.0059912.e127] , which are shown as a function
   of [journal.pone.0059912.e128] . this example shows that the power
   parameter [journal.pone.0059912.e129] is one of the key factors to
   determine the e   t ratio [journal.pone.0059912.e130] .

concluding remarks

   the three commonly used single-number indices, the h-index,
   total-citation number and citation per publication, all suffer from
   critical drawbacks. (i) because of the loss of the information of
   citation distribution, evaluations based on the h-index alone can be
   misleading, as exemplified by data shown in [205]table 1. (ii) the
   total-citation number does not carry the information of the citation
   distribution, as reflected by the typical examples shown in [206]fig.
   1a and c. although both cases correspond to the same number of total
   citations, the shapes of the citation distribution are quite different.
   (iii) likewise, the index of citations per publication also does not
   possess the ability to discriminate the shapes of the citation
   distribution functions. as a consequence, the index (cit/pub) usually
   rewards low productivity, but penalizes high productivity [207][1].

   the h   -index appears to overcome the above drawbacks by carrying
   additional information derived from citation distribution. in summary,
   the h   -index has the following features. (i) it is highly consistent
   with indices of total-citation number and citations per publication,
   which are relatively reliable and thus widely used in the evaluation of
   the academic output of scientists currently. (ii) compared to the
   total-citation number and citations per publication, the h   -index
   possesses the ability to discriminate the shapes of the citation
   distributions, and thus leading to more reasonable evaluation. (iii)
   compared with the h-index, the [journal.pone.0059912.e131] -index
   appropriately carries the information of the excess and h-tail
   citations. (iv) the [journal.pone.0059912.e132] -index is a real
   number, thus largely solving the problem of isohindex groups of the
   h-index. in conclusion, these features enable the h   -index to be a
   better single-number index for evaluating scientific output in a way
   that is fairer and more reasonable.
