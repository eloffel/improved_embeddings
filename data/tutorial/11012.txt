   i first mentioned the idea of an impact factor in science in
   1955.^[47]1 with support from the national institutes of health, the
   experimental genetics citation index was published, and that led to the
   1961 publication of the science citation index.^[48]2 irving h. sher
   and i created the journal impact factor to help select additional
   source journals. to do this we simply re-sorted the author citation
   index into the journal citation index. from this simple exercise, we
   learned that initially a core group of large and highly cited journals
   needed to be covered in the new science citation index (sci). consider
   that, in 2004, the journal of biological chemistry published 6500
   articles, whereas articles from the proceedings of the national academy
   of sciences were cited more than 300 000 times that year. smaller
   journals might not be selected if we rely solely on publication
   count,^[49]3 so we created the journal impact factor (jif).
