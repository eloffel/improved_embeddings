abstract

   this paper addresses the scope for more integrated general analysis of
   diversity in science, technology and society. it proposes a framework
   recognizing three necessary but individually insufficient properties of
   diversity. based on 10 quality criteria, it suggests a general
   quantitative non-parametric diversity heuristic. this allows the
   systematic exploration of diversity under different perspectives,
   including divergent conceptions of relevant attributes and contrasting
   weightings on different diversity properties. it is shown how this
   heuristic may be used to explore different possible trade-offs between
   diversity and other aspects of interest, including portfolio
   interactions. the resulting approach offers a way to be more systematic
   and transparent in the treatment of scientific and technological
   diversity in a range of fields, including conservation management,
   research governance, energy policy and sustainable innovation.

1. introduction

      diversity    is a concept that features prominently in a variety of
   disparate disciplines. alongside the main focus in ecology ([85]odum
   1953; [86]may 1975; [87]mccann 2000), the term arises repeatedly in the
   physical ([88]shevchenko et al. 1996), life ([89]maynard smith 1989)
   and information sciences ([90]kauffman 1993), as well as in social
   ([91]grabher & stark 1997), economic ([92]geroski 1989) and policy
   ([93]gillett 2003) studies. in particular, diversity is a prominent
   theme in science and technology policy ([94]nowotny et al. 2001).

   that this should be so is not unusual in itself. whether for
   substantive or superficial reasons, technical terms like this are
   constantly being adapted to new applications. what is interesting about
   the concept of diversity is that, across radically different contexts,
   it refers repeatedly to a remarkably similar and particular set of
   properties. despite much pertinent work ([95]hill 1973; [96]peet 1974;
   [97]pielou 1977; [98]may 1981; [99]weitzman 1992a; [100]solow & polasky
   1994a), there is presently relatively little cross-disciplinary
   research on the general characterization of diversity.

   the present paper seeks to address this challenge. it begins by
   identifying the general properties of diversity that are common to the
   many contrasting fields in which it arises. it moves on to explore how
   these properties relate to each other and discuss the issues that
   emerge in trying to articulate them. it then proposes a novel general
   diversity heuristic with which systematically to characterize diversity
   across a variety of fields, and with particular reference to
   conservation management and technology policy. the paper ends by
   illustrating the practical application of this framework in examining
   relationships between diversity and other issues of interest.

2. why is diversity of interest?

   before embarking on this analysis, it is worth asking why we might want
   to address diversity in such general terms at all? there already exists
   a host of specialized approaches in particular disciplines
   ([101]stirling 2006a). the answer here is twofold. first, it will be
   argued that   even in many specialist applications   well-established
   understandings of diversity can sometimes be circumscribed or
   challengeable. in such cases, a more general diversity heuristic may be
   useful as a reference, complement or catalyst. second, there are
   fields   such as science and technology policy   where diversity is
   prominent in discussion, but remains undefined or analytically
   neglected. here, a general heuristic offers value as a means to more
   systematic or robust understandings.

   policy debates in many areas of science and technology yield numerous
   reasons for an interest in diversity. in the history, philosophy and
   sociology of science, interactions among a diversity of disciplinary
   perspectives are held to be important means to enhancing rigour
   ([102]merton 1973) and creativity ([103]kuhn 1970). in research
   strategy, diverse portfolios offer flexibility in the face of uncertain
   future progress ([104]rosenberg 1996) and promote learning across
   programmes ([105]david & rothwell 1996). more broadly, institutional
   and technological diversity are seen as stimuli for innovation
   ([106]rosenberg 1982; [107]landau et al. 1996; [108]grabher & stark
   1997) and productivity ([109]aoki 1996). accordingly, it is repeatedly
   urged (including by nature ([110]gibbons 1999; [111]anon. 2004) and the
   treasury ([112]treasury 2006)) that the governance of science be
      opened up    ([113]stirling 2005) to include more diverse public
   constituencies and interests ([114]wynne 1995). in risk regulation, the
   inclusion of diverse views is likewise cited as a way to inform more
   robust policy decisions ([115]fineberg 1996; [116]hong & page 1998;
   [117]royal commission on environmental pollution 1998).

   similarly, in debates over precaution ([118]stirling 2006b) and
   sustainability ([119]brooks 1986), the pursuit of diverse technology
   strategies is highlighted as a    resource pool    ([120]breznitz 1986)
   providing flexibility ([121]collingridge 1983) and resilience
   ([122]folke et al. 2002) in the face of ignorance ([123]stirling 2006c)
   and surprise ([124]norgaard 1989). this is also true in fields like
   energy policy, where technological and fuel diversity have long been a
   major focus in discussions of supply security ([125]willrich 1975;
   [126]international energy agency 1985; [127]kaijser et al. 1991;
   [128]stirling 1994; [129]grubb et al. 2006). in a world where choice
   among scientific and technological pathways is often a matter of
   intense political contention, then, diversity features both as an input
   and an output   pursuing a mix of strategies informed by a variety of
   perspectives can help accommodate otherwise irreconcilable social
   interests and values ([130]james 1990; [131]grabher & stark 1997).

   looking at innovation more widely, diversity is a key focus of
   attention in economics ([132]gatsios & seabright 1989; [133]geroski
   1989), yielding many varieties of portfolio theory ([134]lumby 1984;
   [135]brealey & myers 1988). less-formalized notions of diversity are
   prominent in strategies for addressing wider challenges, like market
   concentration ([136]finkelstein & friedman 1967), institutional
   momentum ([137]hughes 1983), autonomy ([138]winner 1977), entrapment
   ([139]walker 2000) and lock-in ([140]arthur 1989). diversity is
   consequently a major theme in systems ([141]johnson & longmeyer 1999)
   and organization ([142]grabher & stark 1997) theory, bibliometrics
   ([143]axarloglou & theoharakis 2003), evaluation ([144]rafols & meyer
   2006), engineering ([145]cohen 1985) and regional ([146]dosi 1992),
   development ([147]norgaard 1994) and employment ([148]blackaby et al.
   2002) policy. beyond this, diversity is prominent in crucial efforts to
   promote religious, cultural, racial, and gender equality ([149]atkinson
   1970) and pluralism ([150]us department of agriculture subcommittee on
   extension diversity of the personnel and organization development
   committee 1998). the concept of diversity is truly of pervasive
   interest.

3. potential downsides of diversity

   of course, it must be noted that   in all these areas and despite the
   benefits   appeals to diversity sometimes represent little more than
   rhetoric ([151]matthews & mcgowan 1992). although diversity is an
   irreducible property of a system (rather than of its individual
   elements), it is repeatedly invoked in policy debates as if it were a
   unique quality of a particular system element or    option   
   ([152]stirling 1994)   sometimes one that might actually be favoured for
   rather different reasons ([153]lawson 1992). exploiting the    apple pie   
   connotations of diversity can be useful in advocating otherwise weak or
   marginalized positions.

   even where the benefits are substantive, it is rare indeed that
   diversity offers a    free lunch    ([154]weitzman 1992a). indeed, by
   definition, deliberate diversification involves prioritizing options
   that are otherwise assigned relatively low performance ([155]brooks
   1986; [156]david & rothwell 1996). in addition, there are typically
   trade-offs between diversity and transaction costs ([157]williamson
   1993) and with foregone benefits like accountability ([158]grabher &
   stark 1997), standardization ([159]cowan 1991) and economies of scale
   ([160]matthews & mcgowan 1992). the value of the diversity premium
   ([161]ulph 1988) that is warranted in any context will be a function of
   the relative performance attributed to individual options and the
   contributions that each makes to diversity ([162]stirling 1994). both
   are subjective judgements, offering ample scope for disagreement.

   what is needed, then, is a systematic framework for exploring the
   implications of   and relationships between   different perspectives on the
   implications of diversity ([163]bruno et al. 1991; [164]mercier &
   mcgowan 1996). such a framework should ideally be applicable equally
   across the range of contexts in which diversity is of interest. it is
   to this task that the discussion will now turn.

4. the ubiquity of diversity

   at root, diversity is an attribute of any system whose elements may be
   apportioned into categories ([165]leonard & jones 1989). science
   comprises diverse disciplines ([166]gomez et al. 1996); compounds
   diverse isomers (j. bradshaw 1996, unpublished work); crystals diverse
   structures ([167]shevchenko et al. 2006); amino acids diverse sequences
   ([168]wright et al. 2005); phyla diverse taxa ([169]sneath & sokal
   1973); ecologies diverse species ([170]forey et al. 1994); agronomies
   diverse crops ([171]pimm 2004); technologies diverse forms ([172]anon.
   2003); investments diverse shares ([173]brealey & myers 1988); products
   diverse attributes ([174]lancaster 1979); archaeologies diverse
   assemblages ([175]leonard & jones 1989); cultures diverse communities
   ([176]haughton & mukerjee 1995); literatures diverse perspectives
   ([177]serebnick & quinn 1995); networks diverse actors ([178]callon
   1992); and individuals diverse psychologies ([179]junge 1994). in all
   these areas (and others), we find ostensibly different but convergent
   concepts of diversity.

   in many of these fields, the properties of diversity are most usefully
   addressed in relation to some specific empirically or theoretically
   grounded parameters that are particular to the structures of the
   systems in question ([180]magurran 1988). in finance theory, for
   instance, the parameters of interest are the covariance coefficients
   reflecting past patterns in the movements of stock prices ([181]brealey
   & myers 1988). in characterizing chemical diversity, fundamental
   combinatorial rules play crucial roles (j. bradshaw 1996, unpublished
   work). in palaeontology and conservation biology, the strictly
   bifurcating structure of phylogenetic trees provides a useful framework
   ([182]humphries et al. 1995). the discipline of mathematical ecology is
   an area in which diversity concepts have been particularly thoroughly
   investigated ([183]magurran 1988). here, a family of parametric
   diversity measures derive from the pervasive power-law structures
   displayed by species-abundance distributions within and between real
   ecosystems ([184]southwood 1978).

   yet, even in these fields where diversity is relatively well
   parameterized, non-parametric diversity measures are often still
   applied. examples developed in ecology and applied elsewhere include
   species counting ([185]macarthur 1965) and various mathematical
   functions of the proportional representations of relevant species
   ([186]magurran 1988; [187]table 1). even in some of the most mature
   fields of development, then, parametric measures of diversity are often
   substituted by more generally applicable non-parametric indices
   ([188]may 1981). such approaches are even more relevant in the majority
   of fields discussed previously, where there exists no uniquely
   plausible parametric basis for structuring understandings of diversity.

5. a common framework

   it is when viewed in a non-parametric fashion, simply as a property of
   the apportioning of elements or options in any system, that the
   remarkable similarity and particularity of interdisciplinary
   understandings of diversity becomes clear. in short, diversity concepts
   employed across the full range of sciences mentioned previously display
   some combination of just three basic properties. these i will call
      variety   ,    balance    and    disparity    ([200]stirling 1994). each is a
   necessary but insufficient property of diversity ([201]sokal & sneath
   1970; [202]clarke 1978; [203]stirling 2006d). although addressed in
   different vocabularies, each is applicable across a range of
   disciplines and aggregated in various permutations in quantitative
   indices ([204]hill 1973). despite the multiple disciplines and
   divergent contexts, there seems no other obvious candidate for a fourth
   important general property of diversity beyond these three
   ([205]stirling 2006e).

   variety is the number of categories into which system elements are
   apportioned. it is the answer to the question:    how many types of thing
   do we have?    this aspect of diversity is highlighted (for instance) in
   the use of species-number indices in ecology ([206]mcintosh 1967); the
   simple enumeration of firms or products in economics ([207]cohendet et
   al. 1992; [208]kauffman 1993; [209]llerena & llerena 1993;
   [210]saviotti & mani 1995) or the counting of fuels or technologies in
   energy policy ([211]uk department of energy 1988). all else being
   equal, the greater the variety, the greater the diversity.

   balance is a function of the pattern of apportionment of elements
   across categories. it is the answer to the question:    how much of each
   type of thing do we have?    analogous to statistical variance
   ([212]pielou 1977), this can be represented by a set of positive
   fractions, which sum to unity ([213]laxton 1978a). referred to as
      evenness    in ecology ([214]pielou 1969) and    concentration    in
   economics ([215]finkelstein & friedman 1967), this is captured by the
   [216]shannon   wiener (1962), [217]gini (1912) and [218]simpson (1949)
   indices ([219]table 1). as the herfindahl   hirschman index, the latter
   is used in the us to regulate market share ([220]us department of
   justice and the federal trade commission 1992). all else being equal,
   the more even is the balance, the greater the diversity.

   disparity refers to the manner and degree in which the elements may be
   distinguished ([221]runnegar 1987). it is the answer to the question:
      how different from each other are the types of thing that we have?    it
   is judgements over disparity, which (often implicitly) necessarily
   govern the resolving of categories used to characterize variety and
   balance. this is addressed by an array of taxonomic indices in
   palaeontology ([222]williams & humphries 1994), conservation biology
   ([223]solow et al. 1993) and economics ([224]nguyen et al.
   2005)   usually based on some form of distance measure. all else being
   equal, the more disparate are the represented elements, the greater the
   diversity.

6. some general challenges

   the consequence of this threefold understanding of diversity is a
   recognition that each property constitutes the other two ([225]stirling
   2006g). this in turn highlights difficulties with diversity concepts
   and associated indices   in whatever discipline   that focus exclusively on
   subsets of these properties ([226]eldredge 1992). this is a matter of
   significant, but relatively neglected, scientific importance. the
   relevance is amplified by the tendency for apparently technical
   questions over diversity to acquire high profile policy salience   as in
   fields like ecological conservation ([227]forey et al. 1994), market
   regulation ([228]us department of justice and the federal trade
   commission 1992), energy policy ([229]uk department of trade and
   industry 1995) and research ([230]nowotny et al. 2001) strategies. in
   such areas, as we have seen, ostensibly arcane scientific questions
   over the definition and measurement of diversity are laden with (and
   conditioned by) large-scale institutional, economic and political
   interests ([231]lawson 1992).

   variety and balance, for instance, cannot be characterized without
   first considering disparity. it is on this basis that a taxonomy of
   elements is defined and partitioned ([232]may 1990). an ecological
   community comprising 20 varieties of beetle is less diverse than the
   one comprising less than 20 species drawn from different insect,
   reptile and mammalian taxa ([233]may 1990). likewise, an electricity
   system is less diverse if it comprises equal contributions from
   lignite, brown coal, oil and gas than if it is an equal mix of coal,
   nuclear and renewable energy ([234]stirling 1994). however, a category
   like    renewable energy    might itself be judged highly diverse if it is
   equally apportioned into wind, solar, hydro, tidal, biomass, landfill
   gas, etc. the focus of attention in each case is neither on variety nor
   balance, but on disparity ([235]stirling 1995). taking variety or
   balance as proxies for diversity can thus be highly sensitive to
   subjective construction and partitioning of taxonomies and to arbitrary
   linguistic conventions concerning the implicit bounding of categories.

   conversely, the relevance of disparity to diversity often depends on
   the pattern of apportionment across categories. yet, such apportionment
   may sometimes be neglected. this is necessarily so in palaeontology due
   to limited evidence on species abundance ([236]gould 1991). ecological
   structures and the reproductive potential of germplasm can likewise
   make interest in genetic diversity quite independent from questions of
   abundance ([237]solow et al. 1993). yet, problems can arise if
   disparity is taken as a complete representation of diversity in
   conservation biology. this is because, used on their own, disparity
   measures fail to discriminate between species represented by viable or
   non-viable populations ([238]forey et al. 1994). similarly, an energy
   portfolio comprising a 90% contribution from one of three highly
   disparate resources might reasonably be judged less diverse than a
   portfolio comprising an equal contribution from three less disparate
   options ([239]stirling 2006h). this crucial feature is not addressed by
   understandings of diversity in terms of disparity alone. taking
   disparity as a proxy for diversity ignores the balance with which a
   system is apportioned.

7. aggregation, accommodation and articulation

   it is rare indeed that a concept as pervasive as the notion of
   diversity should display such similar properties across such disparate
   fields. despite the high profile attention, the scientific and policy
   challenges remain relatively underexplored. this is curious, since the
   present threefold non-parametric understanding of diversity is
   relatively tractable. in particular, it is striking that   for given
   categories of elements   all the three properties are quite readily
   amenable to quantification: variety is an integer (enumerating
   categories); balance is a function of a set of fractions summing to
   unity (apportioning elements); and disparity a function of a matrix of
   distances (differentiating elements).

   this said, it is difficult indeed to contemplate any single general
   index of diversity that could aggregate properties of variety, balance
   and disparity in a uniquely robust fashion. even where these properties
   are already integrated in existing indices, there remain serious
   queries over the different weightings to apply in aggregation. this is
   true, for instance, of the families of    dual concept    ([240]junge 1994)
   indices used in ecology and economics to aggregate variety and balance
   ([241]table 1). the logarithm base taken in shannon and the value of
   the exponent taken in simpson   herfindahl ([242]stirling 2006i) can each
   have implications for the relative weightings assigned to variety and
   balance ([243]hill 1973). yet, the consequences for analysis are rarely
   explored in practice ([244]stirling 2006j). in short, even popular
      non-parametric    indices like these are nonetheless parameterized at a
   fundamental (if implicit) conceptual level. these underlying parameter
   values might reasonably be varied, yielding differing pictures of
   diversity ([245]kempton 1979).

   beyond this problem of aggregation, there lies the further challenge of
   accommodating different possible understandings of disparity. here, the
   picture will necessarily depend on whatever are seen as the salient
   dimensions of difference. in some cases, there may exist some
   well-established (or even objectively determined) criteria. this is the
   case, for instance, with taxonomies of genetic distance in evolutionary
   ecology, which can be assumed to display a strict branching form
   ([246]weitzman 1992a). it is also true where differences between
   diverse options can usefully be reduced to a single factor, such as
   historic covariance in financial stock ([247]brealey & myers 1988) or
   fuel ([248]awerbuch et al. 2006) prices. even in these areas, however,
   the assumptions necessary for such parameterization are sometimes
   heroic ([249]myers 1984; [250]malkiel 1989). where categorization and
   variance are more complex, as in junge's ([251]junge 1994) proposed
   application in psychology ([252]table 1), such approaches are lacking
   in applicability and robustness ([253]stirling 2006k).

   generally speaking, notions of difference determining characterizations
   of diversity will depend on perspective and context. for instance,
   understandings of diversity in the field of conservation biology may
   reasonably refer not just to species abundance and genetic distance,
   but also to notions of ecological, agronomic or cultural value
   ([254]norton 1987; [255]solow & polasky 1994a). likewise, notions of
   energy diversity may reflect contrasting criteria, such as the form and
   provenance of fuels or equipment, geographical patterns in extraction
   and transport or key features of associated infrastructures
   ([256]stirling 1994). in general, these kinds of disparities in science
   and technology reflect complex webs of relationships, and so cannot
   readily be reduced to discrete branching taxonomies, as assumed, for
   instance, in weitzman's index ([257]table 1; [258]weitzman 1992a).

   beyond the aggregation of different properties of diversity and the
   accommodation of different perspectives on disparity, there remains a
   third and final challenge of articulating diversity with other
   properties of interest in analysis or evaluation. alongside diversity,
   for instance, the different species or habitats constituting ecosystems
   may also be assessed in terms of their conservation, agronomic,
   socio-cultural or aesthetic landscape qualities and values. likewise,
   an energy portfolio may also be assessed in terms of criteria, such as
   operational efficacy, financial performance, security of supply,
   employment intensity or environmental impacts. these other aspects may
   to some extent be independent from diversity, but will also interlink
   in various ways   reflecting the structure and composition of the system
   and interactions between its elements. in particular, they may define
   many different criteria under which diversification could have positive
   or negative implications, of a kind that should be included in
   appraisal. rather than being isolated as a narrow consideration in its
   own right, then, any useful framework for analysing diversity should
   ideally allow for ready articulation of these kinds of wider aspects.

   these challenges of aggregation, accommodation and articulation
   conspire against aspirations definitively to capture diversity, even
   within a single discipline. they are all the more formidable as
   obstacles to a general framework for understanding diversity, of a kind
   that might be applicable across different empirical fields. however,
   this is not a challenge that is specific to the threefold
   characterization of diversity described here. instead, it is a more
   pervasive problem that is intrinsic to any general notion of
   diversity   irrespective of whether or not this is acknowledged.

8. a systematic response

   to take seriously these problems of aggregation, accommodation and
   articulation does not necessarily lead to a counsel of despair over the
   potential for systematic general characterizations   or even
   quantifications   of diversity. a more positive starting point is the
   observation that the futility of seeking to derive a single definitive
   diversity index need not preclude the possibility of a flexible general
   heuristic. like an index, a heuristic may be quantitative. but rather
   than aiming to measure diversity in some unconditional objective
   fashion, it offers an explicit, systematic basis for exploring
   sensitivities to the assumptions conditioning aggregation,
   accommodation and articulation.

   for any particular perspective on the appropriate weightings for
   variety and balance and the salient dimensions of disparity, such a
   heuristic would behave as an index. it would accommodate different
   views on the salient attributes of disparity, aggregate these with
   consideration of variety and balance and allow systematic articulation
   with important system-level properties other than diversity. for
   applications involving a range of perspectives, this heuristic would
   allow systematic comparisons to be made between the implications of
   contending judgements. in other words, a heuristic characterization of
   diversity aims to combine the rigour, transparency and specificity of
   quantification with the applicability, flexibility and symmetry of
   qualitative approaches. the real challenge lies in achieving this,
   while minimizing the introduction of further complexity and
   contingency.

   no existing diversity index addresses all three properties of variety,
   balance and disparity in an unproblematic way. however   based partly on
   criteria applied to the treatment of these individual diversity
   properties by researchers, such as [259]hill (1973), [260]pielou
   (1977), [261]laxton (1978a), [262]weitzman (1992a) and [263]solow &
   polasky (1994a)   a series of non-trivial requirements are quite readily
   developed. one such set of desirable features of a general diversity
   heuristic (  ) that help explicitly to address challenges of
   aggregation, accommodation and articulation as defined here are as
   follows.
    i. scaling of variety. where variety is equal to 1,    takes a value of
       zero ([264]laxton 1978b).
   ii. monotonicity of variety. where elements are evenly balanced and
       equally disparate,    increases monotonically with variety
       ([265]solow & polasky 1994b).
   iii. monotonicity of balance. for given variety and disparity,   
       increases monotonically with balance (i.e.    is maximal for equal
       representation; [266]laxton 1978c).
   iv. monotonicity of disparity. for given variety and balance,   
       increases monotonically with the aggregate disparity between
       elements ([267]solow & polasky 1994c).
    v. scaling of disparity. where aggregate disparity is 0 (i.e. where
       all elements are effectively identical),    takes a value of zero
       ([268]weitzman 1992a).
   vi. open accommodation.    symmetrically accommodates any perspective on
       salient dimensions of difference under which elements can be
       differentiated ([269]solow & polasky 1994d).
   vii. insensitivity to partitioning. for any given perspective on
       taxonomy,    is insensitive to alternative partitionings of elements
       into categories ([270]weitzman 1992b).
   viii. parsimony of form.    is as uncomplicated in structure and
       parsimonious in form as necessary to fulfil the above conditions.
   ix. explicit aggregation.    permits explicit aggregation of variety,
       balance and disparity, by reflecting divergent contexts or
       perspectives using weightings.
    x. ready articulation.    allows unconstrained articulations of
       diversity with other salient properties of the system as a whole or
       of its individual elements.

9. a general diversity heuristic

   no established diversity index satisfies all these criteria. yet, there
   is one relatively straightforward quantitative heuristic, which is not
   specifically discussed in the literature reviewed thus far ([271]table
   1), but which does offer a starting point. this is the sum of pairwise
   disparities, weighted in proportion to contributions of individual
   system elements (d),
   display formula
   (9.1)
   where p[i] and p[j] are proportional representations of elements i and
   j in the system (balance) and d[ij] is the degree of difference
   (disparity) attributed to elements i and j. the summation is across the
   half-matrix of (n^2   n)/2 non-identical pairs of n elements (i   j). in
   the special case where all d[ij] are equal (scaleable to unity), d
   reduces to half gini ([272]table 1). in the special case where one
   element dominates the system (p[i]   1), d is a member of the family of
   measures introduced by polasky & solow ([273]table 1).

   in the absence of definitive parametric understandings of system
   structure, the simplest way to conceive of disparities between elements
   is as a distance between points in disparity space ([274]solow &
   polasky 1994a). each perspective will yield a unique n-dimensional
   disparity space, representing judgements over the salience of n
   different attributes of system elements. the attributes can be rated in
   cardinal, interval or binary yes/no terms. here, a euclidean n-space
   offers the most parsimonious and generally applicable framework. with
   suitable id172 and weighting, the relative magnitudes of the
   resulting distances can be scaled to reflect divergent notions of
   specific disparities or different geometries in disparity space
   ([275]kruskal 1964). in particular, a euclidean n-space involves less
   restrictive assumptions and greater consistency than the ultrametric
   space required by the weitzman index ([276]table 1; [277]solow &
   polasky 1994a; [278]stirling 2006l).

   it is readily demonstrated that this heuristic, d, complies with
   criteria (i)   (vii). compliance with criterion (viii) remains a matter
   of judgement, but it is difficult to imagine a solution to these
   criteria that is simpler or more parsimonious. as to criterion (ix),
   this raises a final notable feature of d, which can be illustrated by
   introducing just two further terms that are as follows:
   display formula
   (9.2)
   if exponents    and    are allowed to take all possible permutations of
   the values 0 and 1, this yields four variants of the heuristic   . each
   of these usefully captures one of the four properties of interest:
   variety; balance; disparity; and diversity ([279]table 2).

   shifting the value of exponents    yields further variants of   ,
   collectively addressing all the possible relative weightings on balance
   and variety/disparity. of these, the reference case d (  =  =1) does the
   same job as other widely used non-parametric measures like gini,
   shannon and simpson, but with the major additional feature that it also
   captures disparity. unlike the disparity measures proposed by weitzman
   or solow and polasky ([284]table 1),    also addresses variety and
   balance. unlike the measure proposed by junge ([285]junge 1994;
   [286]table 1),    accommodates radically divergent perspectives on
   disparity and is relatively parsimonious in form. an entirely novel
   feature of    is that it systematically addresses alternative possible
   aggregations of these subordinate properties, according to perspective
   and context.

10. articulating diversity with other system properties

   this leaves unaddressed only criterion (x) concerning the articulation
   of diversity with other relevant system-level properties. as already
   mentioned, diversity is rarely a free lunch in decision making. whether
   in fields like conservation management, research strategy or energy
   policy, the total value of any system will be a function not only of
   system diversity but of other properties of the system and its
   individual elements as well. in economics, for instance, diversity may
   provide an effective response to challenges like hedging ignorance,
   fostering innovation, mitigating lock-in and accommodating pluralism.
   but it will often require some compromise on other aspects of
   performance   such as cost, equity, environment or ethics. there will
   typically be constraints on the contributions of individual elements
   and portfolio effects resulting from their interactions ([287]geroski
   1989).

   in conservation management, solow and polasky show how their own
   proposed disparity function ([288]table 1) can be adopted in a
   utilitarian fashion, articulating the value of ecological diversity
   with that attached to other possible evaluative criteria, such as
   possible medical applications that may be discovered in relation to
   individual species ([289]solow & polasky 1994a). other ecological
   system properties might also be included in this way, perhaps to
   address the importance of trophic webs or the value of keystone species
   ([290]may 1975). in this vein, for example, karr's index of biotic
   integrity articulates   with explicit subjectivity   further system-level
   considerations of ecological and biological health ([291]karr 1991).

   in these terms, then, the value assigned under a given perspective to
   any particular system under specific conditions (v{s}) can be expressed
   as the sum of the value due to the aggregate performance of individual
   system elements (v{e}) and an incremental value attached to irreducible
   portfolio-level properties including diversity (v{p}). if the net
   implications of diversity are adverse, then v{p} can be negative,
   display formula
   (10.1)
   long experience in the field of decision analysis ([292]vincke et al.
   1992) shows that   just as divergent notions of difference can be
   represented as coordinates in an n-dimensional euclidean disparity
   space   divergent valuations of individual system elements can hence be
   represented as coordinates in an m-dimensional euclidean performance
   space ([293]stirling 2006m). the dimensions of this space represent any
   set of m performance criteria, each weighted to reflect their
   respective importance ([294]stirling 2006n). as with disparity, the
   selection, characterization and scaling of these criteria will vary
   across context and perspective ([295]stirling 1997). although it is
   difficult to justify any single approach to aggregating performance
   across perspectives, decision analysis has shown that any single
   perspective can be uniquely captured by means of the following
   expression for the overall value attached to the performance of
   individual system elements v{e}:
   display formula
   (10.2)
   where s[ic] is the value attached to the performance of element i under
   criterion c; w[c] is a scalar weighting reflecting the relative
   importance of criterion c (under the perspective and context in
   question) and p[i] is (as in equations [296](9.1) and [297](9.2)) the
   proportional representation of element i in the system. it follows from
   equation [298](9.2) that the corresponding value attached to
   irreducible portfolio-level properties including diversity (v{p}) can
   then be expressed as follows:
   display formula
   (10.3)
   where       represents an augmented form of the diversity heuristic   
   given in equation [299](9.2), which includes an additional term to
   reflect portfolio interactions (  [ij]). this is an array of scalar
   multipliers exploiting the pairwise structure of       to express the
   effect on system value of synergies or tensions between elements i and
   j, respectively, as marginal positive or negative departures from a
   default of unity (  [ij]=1       : for most systems,         1). this serves as a
   means to capture a variety of system-level properties that   like
   diversity   are irreducible to individual elements. the coefficient   
   scales expressions of portfolio value to render them commensurable with
   aggregate values of individual options in equation [300](10.2). for
   positive assessments of portfolio value, 0<  <   . from equations
   [301](10.1)   (10.3), we therefore obtain the following heuristic
   system-level articulation (v{s}) of the value attached to diversity,
   together with that assigned to other portfolio properties (v{p}) and to
   the performance of individual system elements (v{e}),
   display formula
   (10.4)
   it is in v{s} that we have a means to address the final criterion (x)
   developed in   8, in that a diversity heuristic should allow systematic,
   unconstrained articulation of diversity with alternative
   characterizations of other salient properties of the system as a whole.

11. exploring relationships between diversity and system value

   the interest of the heuristic v{s} lies not in any attempt to derive
   some unconditional    optimal    balance between the performance of
   individual elements, system interactions and diversity. instead, with
   sensitivity analysis, v{s} can be used systematically to explore
   different possible perspectives and assumptions concerning the
   contributions of these components to overall system value. for each
   perspective on the performance and interactions of individual elements,
   their disparities, the aggregation of diversity properties and the
   scale of the performance   diversity trade-off, there exists a particular
   apportionment of elements that yields some maximum overall value. by
   varying    between zero and infinity, resolving the set of p[i] that
   give a maximal value for v{s} yields a continuum of all possible
   conditionally optimal systems. these range (respectively) from those
   that maximize value due to aggregate performance of individual elements
   (low   ) to those that maximize value due to portfolio interactions and
   system diversity (high   ).

   for schematic data provided in the electronic supplementary material,
   annex a, figure 1 presents an illustration of this heuristic usage of
   v{s}. these data reflect one hypothetical perspective on the challenges
   associated with finding an appropriate balance between diversity and
   other aspects of landscape value in conservation management
   ([302]southwood 1977). here, the focus of attention is not directly on
   species diversity, but on the contributions that might be made to this
   end by habitat diversity in the landscape ([303]gray 1997). this bears
   in mind that certain individual habitats may be seen to hold greater
   intrinsic conservation value than others and that there exist other
   economic, socio-cultural and aesthetic criteria for informing decisions
   over landscape management ([304]franklin 1993).

   consider, for the sake of illustration, a schematic case in which each
   of a series of habitat types (a, b, c and d) offers viable options
   across a discrete, contiguous landscape for which long-term land-use
   policy commitments are being made subject to a consultative process at
   a particular point in time. under one hypothetical perspective, these
   habitats are mutually distinguishable under a set of four disparity
   attributes: (i) commercially managed mixed woodland, (ii) low-input
   mixed arable farming with wide field margins, (iii) close-grazed
   bryophyte-rich grassland, and (iv) low-intensity grazing of wildflower
   meadows. depending on the perspective, it is these kinds of attribute
   that might constitute the distance metric (d[ij]) in applying the
   heuristic       in equation [305](10.4).

   criteria applied in the evaluation of the individual habitat types
   might include a number of general ecological considerations, values
   attached to particular endangered species endemic to each habitat, the
   internal biodiversity of the habitat itself, as well as economic
   revenues for sustaining local livelihoods, aesthetic and
   cultural   historical issues (of relevance also in indirect tourism
   revenues; [306]norton 1987). these constitute the basis for the
   performance measures (s[ic]) and their respective weightings (w[c]) in
   equation [307](10.4). even if one of the four habitat types is
   evaluated much more positively than others, there may nonetheless be a
   benefit in sustaining habitat diversity as a means to support certain
   species and communities spanning different habitats and to address the
   conservation value of    mosaics    as well as other landscape-scale
   economic and socio-cultural issues ([308]jennings 2000). likewise, some
   system-level aspects of landscape value will derive from the presence
   of particular combinations of habitats   and their interfaces   in the mix
   ([309]ray 1991). these constitute the basis, respectively, for the
   diversity coefficient (  ) and the interaction term (  [ij]) in equation
   [310](10.4). for the purposes of the present illustrative exercise, the
   perspective in question is assumed to favour an aggregation of
   diversity properties in equation [311](10.4), in which both    and   
   take a value of 1 (thus,   =d in equations [312](9.1) and [313](9.2)).

   [314]figure 1 displays the sort of outcome that can readily be derived
   from these kinds of input, as a heuristic articulation of the overall
   value attached to individual habitats with that deriving from their
   interactions and from diversity in the landscape. the shaded areas
   represent the composition of an optimal frontier (obtained using
   iterative optimization procedures provided in the matlab software),
   maximizing v{s} for this dataset at varying values of    (equation
   [315](10.4)). it shows the way in which the proportion of the landscape
   assigned to each of the four schematic habitat types (vertical axis,
   p[i], p[j] in equation [316](10.4)) varies as progressively greater
   weight is attached to maintaining a diversity of habitats (horizontal
   axis,    in equation [317](10.4)). the vertical dotted line shows the
   value of    at which v{e}=v{p} (equation [318](10.1)).

   of course, for the purposes of exposition, the present example is
   highly stylized. it is very simple and omits many important
   features   such as those relating to the geographical structure of the
   landscape in question ([322]mace et al. 1998). however, by repeating
   such an exercise iteratively as a way of exploring the implications of
   different assumptions or interpretations of uncertainty, this heuristic
   framework may therefore be used to assist the formulation of individual
   perspectives or to inform effective deliberation between contending
   disciplinary or stakeholder positions on this kind of decision over
   habitat diversity in the landscape.

   to substantiate the more general applicability of this heuristic
   framework, [323]figure 2 provides one further schematic in the rather
   different, but currently highly topical, field of energy policy
   ([324]uk department of trade and industry 2005). here, the interest
   lies in constructing a mix of generating technologies at the level of
   an electricity system like that of the uk, such as to reconcile
   different possibilities and perspectives in the economic,
   environmental, energy security and wider social performance of the
   supply mix ([325]stirling 1994). disparities here may be conceived in
   terms of the nature and origins of the fuels and technologies
   concerned, as well as salient features of their respective
   institutional, commercial or socio-political contexts ([326]stirling
   1996). positive and negative economic, organizational and operational
   synergies between different technologies inform the modelling of
   interactions. certain options are tightly constrained in terms of the
   available resource, or display reductions (from learning or scale) or
   increases (from depletion) in costs or impacts as the contributions
   rise. for illustrative data on all these aspects provided in the
   electronic supplementary material, annex b, figure 2 shows   for a
   particular hypothetical perspective   how the resulting conditionally
   optimal electricity portfolios vary as greater or lesser priority is
   placed on diversity.

   low values of    in [330]figure 1 may express high confidence in
   performance appraisals of individual technologies, with little concern
   over deep uncertainties to which diversity is a reasonable response.
   likewise, low values of    may imply that priority is attached to
   maximizing this performance, rather than the other benefits of
   diversity (in fostering innovation, mitigating lock-in or accommodating
   pluralism). on the other hand, high values of    reflect a dominant
   interest in these benefits of diversity, with little concern over the
   resulting compromises on performance. again, the value of this kind of
   heuristic framework is as a means more explicitly and systematically to
   inform analysis under individual perspectives, and to provide a basis
   for more effective and transparent deliberation between contending
   positions.

12. conclusion

   the present paper has outlined a framework for interdisciplinary
   analysis of diversity. the discussion began by noting many different
   reasons for an interest in diversity, not least in high profile areas
   of science and technology policy. here, diversity offers a means to
   promote innovation, hedge ignorance, mitigate lock-in and accommodate
   pluralism. it offers one important strategy for achieving qualities of
   precaution, resilience and robustness that are central to
   sustainability.

   to these ends, the paper identifies a general framework for
   understanding diversity in a range of different contexts and
   specialisms. this involves recognition of diversity as a function of
   three necessary but individually insufficient properties: variety;
   balance and disparity. existing non-parametric diversity indices
   address only subsets of these three properties and/or raise questions
   over their underlying assumptions.

   by reference to 10 quality criteria, the paper proposes a novel general
   diversity heuristic, d. a more general formulation (  ) serves not just
   as a heuristic for diversity, but for each of the three subordinate
   properties as well, thus permitting systematic exploration of different
   possible weightings on variety, balance and disparity. as such,    may
   prove applicable in any fields in which diversity is presently
   discussed, irrespective of whether it has been definitively
   parameterized.

   one way of using this heuristic is to systematically explore
   relationships between diversity and other aspects of portfolio
   performance. for instance, the framework might be used to elicit
   perspectives on probable performance and salient differences between
   contending research and development programmes, energy technology
   investments or habitat types in conservation management. by allowing
   exploration of trade-offs between diversity and performance   including
   consideration of system constraints and interactions   this offers a
   means to frame more effective policy deliberation. similar applications
   suggest themselves in other areas, such as ecological analysis,
   research governance, innovation policy, urban planning, agricultural
   strategy and regional development. indeed, the approach seems
   applicable anywhere where there is an interest in analysing system
   diversity   particularly, as a means to promote more inclusive,
   precautionary, resilient and sustainable applications of science and
   technology.

   i am grateful to my colleague ismael rafols who drew my attention after
   acceptance of the present paper for publication to a recent discussion
   ([331]ricotta & szeidl 2006) of an early rigorous derivation of the
   basic concept d in equation (9.1) under somewhat different criteria by
   [332]rao (1982), of which i was previously unaware.

   over the embarrassingly long gestation of this work, i have accumulated
   too many debts to acknowledge individually. more recently, carlota
   perez, ismael rafols, sigrid stagl and ed steinmueller all gave
   particular feedback on the present paper. i am especially grateful for
   the coding skills of david waxman and toby champion, who built the
   matlab optimization tool on which the examples were calculated.
