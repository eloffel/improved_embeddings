abstract

   a critical part of a scientific activity is to discern how a new idea
   is related to what we know and what may become possible. as the number
   of new scientific publications arrives at a rate that rapidly outpaces
   our capacity of reading, analyzing, and synthesizing scientific
   knowledge, we need to augment ourselves with information that can
   effectively guide us through the rapidly growing intellectual space. in
   this article, we address a fundamental issue concerning what kinds of
   information may serve as early signs of potentially valuable ideas. in
   particular, we are interested in information that is routinely
   available and derivable upon the publication of a scientific paper
   without assuming the availability of additional information such as its
   usage and citations. we propose a theoretical and computational model
   that predicts the potential of a scientific publication in terms of the
   degree to which it alters the intellectual structure of the state of
   the art. the structural variation approach focuses on the novel
   boundary   spanning connections introduced by a new article to the
   intellectual space. we validate the role of boundary   spanning in
   predicting future citations using three metrics of structural
   variation   namely, modularity change rate, cluster linkage, and
   centrality divergence   along with more commonly studied predictors of
   citations such as the number of coauthors, the number of cited
   references, and the number of pages. main effects of these factors are
   estimated for five cases using zero   inflated negative binomial
   regression models of citation counts. key findings indicate that (a)
   structural variations measured by cluster linkage are a better
   predictor of citation counts than are the more commonly studied
   variables such as the number of references cited, (b) the number of
   coauthors and the number of references are both good predictors of
   global citation counts to a lesser extent, and (c) the centrality
   divergence metric is potentially valuable for detecting
   boundary   spanning activities at interdisciplinary levels. the
   structural variation approach offers a new way to monitor and discern
   the potential of newly published papers in context. the
   boundary   spanning mechanism offers a conceptually simplified and
   unifying explanation of the roles played by commonly studied extrinsic
   properties of a publication in the study of citation behavior.
