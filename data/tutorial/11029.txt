[33]abstract

background

   graph-based notions are increasingly used in biomedical data mining and
   knowledge discovery tasks. in this paper, we present a
   clique-id91 method to automatically summarize graphs of semantic
   predications produced from pubmed citations (titles and abstracts).

results

   semrep is used to extract semantic predications from the citations
   returned by a pubmed search. cliques were identified from frequently
   occurring predications with highly connected arguments filtered by
   degree centrality. themes contained in the summary were identified with
   a hierarchical id91 algorithm based on common arguments shared
   among cliques. the validity of the clusters in the summaries produced
   was compared to the silhouette-generated baseline for cohesion,
   separation and overall validity. the theme labels were also compared to
   a reference standard produced with major mesh headings.

conclusions

   for 11 topics in the testing data set, the overall validity of clusters
   from the system summary was 10% better than the baseline (43% versus
   33%). while compared to the reference standard from mesh headings, the
   results for recall, precision and f-score were 0.64, 0.65, and 0.65
   respectively.

[35]introduction

   id54 is emerging as a viable information processing
   mechanism to help users effectively access the large amount of textual
   data available online, especially in the biomedical domain. such
   processing distils the most important information from source documents
   to produce an abridged condensate that serves as an informative and
   indicative summary of a given topic [[36]1, [37]2]. summarization is
   often thought of as a natural language processing task due to the need
   for in-depth understanding of text to provide a useful summary. the
   analysis of source text may take various forms. in earlier work this
   was often limited to textual cues that identify salient information,
   while more recent research may involve concepts in a domain ontology
   [[38]3] and semantic id36 [[39]4, [40]5].
   to facilitate access to the biomedical research literature, fiszman et
   al. [[41]6] developed an automatic abstractive summarization method
   based on semantic predications identified in biomedical text by the
   semrep natural language processing system [[42]5, [43]7]. both semantic
   predications and the abstractive summarization method are exploited in
   the semantic medline web application [[44]8], which produces graphical
   summaries by condensing semantic predications found in medline
   citations (titles and abstracts) retrieved with pubmed queries. relying
   on four manually predefined schemas, the user directs semantic medline
   to generate summaries focused on several points of view, either
   treatment of disease, substance interactions, diagnosis, or
   pharmacogenomics. nodes in the summary are concepts from the unified
   medical language system (umls) [[45]9] metathesaurus, and arcs are
   semantic relations from the semantic network. by clicking on an arc, a
   user can obtain the sentence from which the relation was generated
   (figure [46]1).
   [47]figure 1 figure 1
   figure 1

   summary of 500 citations on parkinson disease in semantic medline. this
   figure shows a snapshot of a graphical summary generated by semantic
   medline. by selecting a schema and a summary theme, the user produces a
   graphical summary on a specific topic (parkinson disease).

   although semantic medline shows promise in managing the results of
   pubmed searches [[48]10], it produces graphs that are too large and
   dense when generating summaries from more than a few hundred citations.
   this characteristic does not accommodate the thousands of citations
   that may be returned by a pubmed query (for example, nearly 150,000 for
      breast cancer   ). in earlier work [[49]11], we exploited the graph
   theoretic notion of degree centrality to reduce large graphs by
   retaining only highly connected concepts. the method is effective in
   presenting readable, focused information to the user. however, it
   relies on predefined schemas, which must be devised for each topic
   point of view, and thus limit the applicability of this summarization
   methodology in covering the thematic diversity seen in the biomedical
   research literature.

   in this paper, we explore a graph-based method to make automatic
   summarization more robust when confronted with large numbers of medline
   citations, without using predefined schemas. this multidocument method
   is based on a network representation of the semantic predications
   extracted from citations (titles and abstracts) returned by a pubmed
   query. cliques are first identified in this graph and then clustered
   and labeled to identify several points of view represented in the
   summary. since schemas are not used, the method is applicable to any
   biomedical topic.

   the primary contribution of this paper is the application of graph
   theoretic constructs to semantic predications for automatic
   summarization in the biomedical domain. we also introduce a novel
   semantics-based criterion for determining final clusters, which is
   compared to a silhouette coefficient method. finally, evaluations for
   cluster validity and accuracy, as well as the quality of the summary
   are also provided.

[50]background

semrep semantic interpretation

   the id91 method used for id54 in this study
   depends on cliques identified in a graph of semantic predications
   extracted from pubmed citations with semrep [[51]5, [52]7], a symbolic
   rule-based natural language processing system relying heavily on
   biomedical domain knowledge in the unified medical language system
   (umls) [[53]9]. extraction of predications begins with an
   underspecified syntactic analysis based on the specialist lexicon
   [[54]12] and medpost part-of-speech tagger [[55]13]. metamap [[56]14]
   maps simple noun phrases from this structure to metathesaurus concepts,
   and    indicator rules    map syntactic elements to umls semantic network
   predicates. semrep extracts 30 predicate types, in the domains of
   clinical medicine (e.g. treats, diagnoses), substance interactions
   (e.g. interacts_with, inhibits, stimulates), etiology (e.g. causes,
   predisposes), and pharmacogenomics (e.g. affects, augments,
   disrupts)^.syntactic processing then identifies arguments (noun phrases
   mapped to metathesaurus concepts) for each predicate. as an example,
   the predications (argument-predicate-argument) below were extracted
   from the text, patients with single brain lesion received an extra 3 gy
   x 5 radiotherapy.

   brain - location_of - single lesion

   single lesion - process_of - patients

   radiation therapy - administered_to - patients

id54

   id54 condenses source text into an abbreviated
   version representing salient information. most methods exploit an
   extractive process that selects informative text strings from the
   source and concatenates them into a summary. fewer attempts have been
   made to generate an abstractive summary, which processes the source
   text and represents it using terms not found in the source. both
   summarization techniques depend on identification of salient source
   content, either through informative textual cues, term frequency, or,
   more recently, graph-based metrics.

identifying salient source content

   most frequency-based methods provide extractive summaries composed of
   source sentences containing frequently occurring content units. nenkova
   and vanderwende [[57]15] assessed the contribution of frequency of
   occurrence to summarization, which is considerable. reeve et al.
   [[58]16, [59]17] further exploit domain ontologies to identify salient
   information.

   recently, graph structures have been used to represent source content
   to be summarized. often, terms or sentences are represented as nodes
   and relations between them as arcs; however, abstractive
   representations are also used in graph-based analysis. graph
   theory-based metrics have been proposed to identify salient
   information. two commonly used metrics are degree centrality and
   eigenvector centrality, and both are based on connectedness. degree
   centrality is determined by the connecting arcs a node has, normalized
   for the size of the graph, while eigenvector centrality is computed
   based on the connections a node has along with the connectedness of
   neighboring nodes. several studies (e.g. [[60]18-[61]20]) have shown
   that degree centrality, when compared to other connectedness metrics,
   performs best for most tasks. lexrank [[62]18] and textrank [[63]21]
   have applied connectedness metrics to generate multidocument summaries.
   in lexrank, for example, nodes represent sentences and arcs similarity
   between them. node connectedness is used to identify prominent
   sentences as a summary.

   in addition to text, biomedical data can also be represented as a
   graph, with nodes representing biological entities (e.g. genes or
   proteins) and edges associations between them. for example,
   protein-protein interactions can be successfully modeled by a graph.
   based on the recognition of cohesive subgroups (such as cliques), gene
   or protein complexes can be extracted to help predict protein
   interactions or find gene-disease relations [[64]22, [65]23].

cliques in id207

   in id207, a clique is a subgraph in which every node is
   connected to every other node in that subgraph. the size of a clique is
   defined by the number of nodes in it. for example, a 4-clique contains
   four nodes. figure [66]2 shows five cliques, one 5-clique at the
   center, two 4-cliques on the left, and two 3-cliques on the right. in
   figure [67]2, the four peripheral smaller cliques are included in the
   5-clique, which is a maximal clique not included in any other.
   [68]figure 2 figure 2
   figure 2

   cliques. the clique in the center is the maximal clique. the four
   smaller cliques contained in it are displayed on the periphery.

   identifying cliques can help find cohesive subgroups in a graphical
   network. usually, each node in a clique is, in some way, highly related
   to every other node. this characteristic makes clique identification a
   very important approach to uncover meaningful groups from a network,
   such as protein-complex discovery from protein-protein interaction
   networks [[69]24], collaborating groups from co-authorship networks
   [[70]25], etc. zubcsek et al. [[71]26] clustered cliques to identify
   information communities with ucinet. taking advantage of node overlap
   among cliques, ah-pine and colleagues [[72]27] proposed a clique-based
   id91 method to annotate named entities.

theme identification

   identification of various themes contained in the summary can help
   users locate specific information they are interested in and link to
   relevant source documents. theme identification, also known as topic
   identification or topic discovery, is the process of assigning one or
   more labels to text [[73]28]. to discriminate it from the topic of a
   summary, we refer to this task as    theme identification    in this paper.

   theme identification is particularly important in multi-document
   summarization. to avoid similar information repetitiously appearing in
   the summary, stein et al. [[74]29] grouped their summaries from single
   documents into clusters and selected a representative passage from each
   cluster to construct the final summary. other studies [[75]28]
   clustered documents before performing summarization in order to help
   users select clusters of interest.

   id91 is a very powerful data mining technique for identifying and
   labeling themes in a group of documents, and both id116 and
   hierarchical id91 are used for this task. for each cluster,
   features, such as keywords, terms, or sentence are chosen as the label
   (or theme). id116 id91 [[76]30, [77]31] groups documents into
   predefined n classes. it is often used when the number of classes for
   the documents is known and serves as a reference standard to evaluate
   the final clusters generated. in reality, it may be hard to obtain
   expert-determined classification for thousands of biomedical documents,
   and hierarchical id91 is often used instead.

   hierarchical id91 is an unsupervised method that does not require
   setting a predefined number of clusters for the documents. when using
   hierarchical id91 to group documents and generate labels for the
   clusters, the vector space model is often adopted to produce term or
   keyword vectors, which help indicate similarity among documents
   [[78]30, [79]32, [80]33]. subsequently, documents are clustered into
   several subgroups, and terms or keywords that are salient for a given
   cluster are extracted as the theme (or label) for the cluster.

[81]methods

overview

   our method for id54 includes two major parts: (1)
   applying graphical metrics to help produce a summary and (2) using a
   id91 technique as well as semantics to identify themes contained
   in the summary (work flow shown in figure [82]3). in the first part,
   the citations from a pubmed search are represented as semantic
   predications with semrep. then predications are converted into a graph
   with arguments as nodes and predicates as arcs. degree centrality and
   frequency of occurrence of predications are used to eliminate
   nonsalient predications from the graph, thus identifying relationships
   important for the summary. finally, cliques are identified in the
   summarized graph. in the second part, theme identification, a
   hierarchical id91 algorithm is applied to cliques to group them
   into several clusters, and a semantic theme label is assigned to each
   cluster.
   [83]figure 3 figure 3
   figure 3

   work flow of the summarization processing. the system includes two
   phases in processing. in the first phase, semantic predications
   extracted from medline citations with semrep are represented in a
   graph. then four processing steps (novelty filtering to eliminate
   uninformative predications, node centrality filtering, frequency
   filtering, and clique identification) successively condense the
   predication graph into a graphic summary. in phase two, clique
   id91, an application of the ucinet, is used to partition the
   summary into several clusters representing summary themes. the theme of
   the clusters is labeled with a metapredication.

data sets

   to test the effectiveness of our method for id54,
   several topics, including disorders, substances, and physiological
   processes, were chosen for training and testing. citations were
   retrieved from medline with the topic term or phrase as major mesh
   term, limited to english and with abstracts. to accommodate evaluation,
   we further limited the number of citations to fewer than 20,000, by
   publication date (although the system can process any number of
   citations). the topics and the number of the citations for training and
   testing are shown in table [84]1.

  graphical representation for semantic predications

   semrep predications extracted from medline citations to be summarized
   are first converted to a graph, with nodes representing arguments and
   arcs predicates. the direction of the arcs is from subject to object.
   the width of the arcs indicates the number of citations containing a
   given predications in the entire input set. figure [85]4 shows the
   graph resulting from processing a sample set of 9 distinct predications
   (on the right).
   [86]figure 4 figure 4
   figure 4

   an example of a predication graph. the graph on the left was produced
   from the predications listed on the right, with frequency of occurrence
   given next to them. predications with the same arguments but different
   predicates may occur in a graph, such as    parkinson disease isa
   movement disorders    and    parkinson disease coexists_with movement
   disorders   . such predications are represented as a single arc with
   multiple labels joining the argument nodes. for clarity, arc labels are
   not shown in figure [87]4.

  summarization processing

   besides frequency of occurrence of predications, we used two graphical
   constructs, degree centrality and cliques, to condense the graph into a
   summary of salient predications. both degree centrality and clique
   detection help identify predications with high connectedness, which,
   along with frequently occurring arcs in the graph, convey information
   crucial to the summary. for example, in figure [88]4, the predication
      deep brain stimulation treats parkinson disease    is identified as
   highly salient because the nodes representing its arguments have more
   connections than other nodes, and the frequency of occurrence of the
   arc between them is higher than that of other arcs.

  eliminate uninformative predications

   before graph theoretic techniques are applied to create a summary,
   predications with at least one generic argument are eliminated from the
   graph, which removes uninformative relationships as part of the
   condensing process of summarization [[89]1, [90]2]. as noted earlier,
   arguments are metathesaurus concepts, and generic arguments, (e.g.
      patients   ) are identified as occurring higher than an empirically
   determined cutoff in the umls hierarchy [[91]6]. for example, the
   predication    pharmaceutical preparations treats parkinson disease    is
   eliminated from the graph, while    dopamine agonists treats parkinson
   disease    is kept because    pharmaceutical preparations    in the former is
   high in the hierarchy, while both arguments in the second predication
   are lower.

  identify highly connected nodes

   we assume that central nodes in the predication network are likely to
   represent important contents in the documents being summarized. in our
   previous study [[92]11], we found that degree centrality effectively
   identifies information crucial to summarization for researchers and
   clinicians. in the current study, we used degree centrality to sort the
   concepts in the network, and then, based on training data, defined a
   degree centrality cutoff, which is the mean of the sum of the degree
   centrality scores plus half of the standard deviation. predications in
   which both arguments have a degree centrality score above the cutoff
   are kept, while others are eliminated.

  eliminate predications with lower frequency of occurrence

   since frequency also plays an important role in automatic
   summarization, we calculated frequency of occurrence for the rest of
   the predications. the computation for frequency is based on how many
   citations a predication appears in [[93]34]. (when a predication occurs
   more than once in a single sentence, we count that occurrence as one.)
   a formula similar to that for degree centrality (the mean of the sum of
   the frequency of occurrence, plus half of the standard deviation) was
   adopted and predications with frequency of occurrence below the cutoff
   were eliminated from the graph.

  identify cliques

   after the first three steps, the predications remaining were those with
   high frequency of occurrence and having highly connected arguments; in
   the next step, cliques were identified in the graph of these
   predications. the tool used to identify cliques and cluster them in the
   next step is ucinet 6 [[94]35], a social network analysis package
   particularly useful for extracting cliques and analyzing overlap
   [[95]36]. there is other research of relevance to our work. boyack et
   al. [[96]37] compare the effectiveness of several algorithms for
   id91 large numbers of documents, but they do not address details
   of the semantic content involved. blondel et al. [[97]38] discuss an
   efficient algorithm for identifying communities in large networks, but
   the    content    of these involves only one feature, primary language used
   in mobile phone networks, rather than the rich expressiveness of semrep
   semantic predications. since our main concern is exploiting semantic
   predications for the semantic content of documents, for the purpose of
   id54, rather than development of id91
   algorithms, ucinet is entirely adequate.

   the ucinet algorithm to identify cliques is based on the notion of a
   maximal clique, one that is not contained in any other. cliques are
   allowed to overlap, which means that concepts can be members of more
   than one clique. this feature is important for summarization because it
   permits certain concepts, which have high degree centrality and are the
   core of a network (such as the topic of the summary) to appear in
   several cliques of the graph.

  theme identification

    overview

   a summary of a large number of documents usually includes several
   themes, or points of view. for example, a summary of breast cancer may
   include information on chemotherapies, procedures, genetic etiology,
   etc. in exploiting such a summary, a user may want to focus on any one
   of these themes. the accessibility of a summary is increased if the
   different themes are discriminated from each other and overtly
   represented. although cliques correlate somewhat with themes, this is
   not absolute due to the fact that cliques share nodes.

   our approach to identifying themes in a summary exploits clusters of
   cliques and has two phases. in the first, id91 is based solely on
   nodes in the clique (which represent arguments in the semantic
   predications constituting the cliques). in addition to identifying
   cliques from the predication network, ucinet automatically produces a
   clique co-membership matrix and a hierarchical clique id91, which
   produces several possible solutions, each containing a varying number
   of clusters.

   we then use semantic processing to select the id91 solution that
   best represents the themes of the summary. the goal is to put cliques
   with similar themes in the same cluster, while keeping cliques with
   different themes in separate clusters. the challenge is to determine
   the best id91 solution by grouping cliques in such a way that the
   themes of the summary are optimally represented. generally, the best
   id91 solution is neither too compact (a single cluster containing
   all cliques) nor too dispersed, as is the case if every cluster is a
   singleton having only one clique. when this solution has been selected,
   further processing determines whether some of the clusters should be
   collapsed [[98]39] based on semantic similarity.

    visualizing cluster solutions

   the tool we used to find and cluster cliques is ucinet [[99]35], a
   hierarchical id91 software package originally developed for
   social network analysis. ucinet produces a clique co-membership matrix
   in which the (i,j)th entry of the matrix is the number of shared nodes
   (arguments) in clique i and clique j and the diagonal entries are the
   size of the cliques. based on this matrix, ucinet produces an icicle
   plot composed of solutions to the clique id91. although each
   clique is assigned to a unique cluster, concepts may be in more than
   one cluster [[100]40].

   these solutions can be visualized as an icicle plot [[101]41] such as
   that seen in figure [102]5, in which the numbers on the top of the plot
   are labels for each clique. each row shows a cluster solution with a
   different number of clusters. for example, in the bottom row all
   cliques are included in one cluster, while in the top row there are two
   multiclique clusters: the first contains cliques 7 and 8, while the
   second contains cliques 2 and 1. all other clusters in the top row are
   singletons containing a single clique. we use an icicle plot to guide
   the processing for selecting the id91 solution that best
   represents the themes of a summary our system produces.
   [103]figure 5 figure 5
   figure 5

   an icicle plot of clustered cliques for parkinson disease. an icicle
   plot represents the clustered cliques for parkinson disease produced by
   ucinet. the summary for parkinson disease contains 23 cliques, whose
   numeric labels are displayed on the top of the icicle plot. there are 9
   cluster solutions proposed for parkinson disease; each cluster solution
   is represented with a single row below the clique labels.

    semantic processing for labeling clusters

   in our method, determining the best id91 solution is based on
   semantic similarity of the individual clusters, as represented by theme
   labels. our graphs represent semantic predications, and cliques thus
   contain the arguments of predications (as nodes) along with the
   predicates connecting them. identifying similarity of clusters depends
   on characteristics of the predications contained in the cliques that
   constitute the clusters. other approaches have used terms or sentences
   as theme labels, neither of which provides the greater expressiveness
   of semantic predications.

   metapredications are used to identify and label the theme for each
   cluster. a metapredication, whose form is similar to a semrep
   predication, is defined as    <semantic group   >   <predicate
   group   >   <semantic group>   . the scope of the semantic group and
   predicate group is broader than that of the arguments and predicate of
   a semrep predication, so a metapredication generalizes the meaning of a
   cluster of cliques composed of several predications.

   the predicate group used in a metapredication was defined for this
   project as a group of semrep predicates expressing related content. for
   example, predicate part_of is used with two physical units, in which
   the first is a component (or division) of the second. predicate
   location_of is used to indicate the body location (or region) of an
   entity or the site of a process. since these two predicates both
   express a relationship between physical entities, they were put into
   the predicate group physical. the semrep predicates that were assigned
   to predicate groups are given in table [104]2.

   the arguments of a metapredication are groups of semantic types
   suggested by mccray et al., who aggregated 134 umls semantic types into

   completeness, exclusivity, naturalness and utility) [[105]42]. for
   example, the semantic type    therapeutic or preventive procedure    and
      laboratory procedure    belong to the semantic group procedures, while
      disease or syndrome    and    neoplastic process    are included in
   disorders. the metapredications used for this project are given in

   *** the predicate for this metapredication is measures.

   in theme identification, each semrep predication in a cluster
   identified in the icicle plot is assigned to a metapredication. for
   example, the predications    dopamine agonists treats parkinson disease   
   and    dopamine agonists treats dyskinetic syndrome    are assigned to the
   metapredication    <chemicals & drugs   >   <therapy   >   <disorders>    because
   the predicate treats belongs to the predicate group   <   therapy   >   and the
   semantic type of the subjects and the objects of these two predications
   belongs to the semantic group chemicals & drugs and disorders,
   respectively. metapredications are then counted and sorted in
   descending order of frequency of occurrence; the most frequent
   identifies the theme of the cluster and serves as its label.

   as an example of assigning a metapredication theme label to a cluster
   of cliques, the graphical representation of the first cluster in row 3
   in figure [107]5 (clique 4-5-6-9) is shown on the left side of
   figure [108]6. for this cluster, there are two semantic types,
      therapeutic or preventive procedure    and    disease or syndrome   , which
   belong to two semantic groups, procedures and disorders respectively.
   given that the most frequent predicate in this cluster is treats, the
   most frequent metapredication is    procedure treatment   
   (<procedures   >   <therapy   >   <disorders>), which serves as the theme label
   for this cluster.

   of each node concept in the graph indicates the semantic type of that
   concept, as shown in the box on the right. the two most frequently
   occurring predicates are also given in the box. the visualization was
   performed using pajek.

    selecting the optimal id91 solution

   semantic theme labels form the basis for selecting the best id91
   solution to represent themes for the summary generated by the method.
   as represented in the icicle plot, the several id91 solutions are
   arranged hierarchically, so that the solution containing the most
   clusters is at the top of the plot. in each succeeding row, adjacent
   clusters may be merged (based on shared nodes in the cliques being
   clustered), so that the final, bottom row contains fewer clusters than
   those preceding it. in our method, merging of clusters in succeeding
   rows is augmented with semantic processing to choose the optimal
   id91 solution, one in which there are no clusters that could be
   merged in the succeeding solution (row) based on shared nodes and which
   have the same theme label.

   after theme labels have been computed for clusters in the icicle plot,
   each successive row of the icicle plot is processed, starting with the
   row that is likely to require minimum merging. based on training data,
   this is the first row from the top that has no more than three
   singleton clusters (containing only one clique). the current row is
   compared to the immediately succeeding row, and it is noted whether any
   separate clusters in the current row are merged in the following row,
   and further, whether those clusters have the same metapredication theme
   label. if both conditions are satisfied, the succeeding row is
   considered to be a better solution than the current row, and the former
   succeeding row becomes the current row. when a row is encountered for
   which the succeeding row is not a better solution than the current row,
   the current row is considered the optimal solution.

   for example, in figure [111]7, row 3 is the starting line because it
   has only two singleton clusters. in the succeeding line, row 4,
   clusters 5 and 6 (c5 and c6) are merged, and they have the same theme
   label (body location). thus row 4 is considered a better solution than
   row 3. when row 4 is compared to row 5, it is seen that clusters 4 and
   5-6 have the same theme label (body location) and that they are merged
   in row 5, which is thus considered to be a better solution than row 4.
   when the immediately succeeding row, row 6, is encountered, it is seen
   that clusters 1 and 2 are merged. since they do not have the same label
   theme, the algorithm stops and row 5 is selected as the best id91
   solution for this summary.

   the optimal cluster solution is selected by labeling the clusters
   contained in 3 solutions (row 3 to row 5). the cluster labels are
   displayed below the three solutions. the cluster merging process starts
   at row 3. in the succeeding line, clusters with the same labels are
   merged together.

    evaluation

   in a previous study [[115]11], we evaluated the effectiveness of degree
   centrality as a condensing mechanism for id54 to
   answer disease treatment questions in a semantic predication graph. we
   have also constructed a semantic predication gold standard [[116]43] to
   support further evaluation. in addition, we have assessed the ability
   of semantic medline, a semrep-based summarizer, to identify useful drug
   interventions for evidence-based medical treatment [[117]10]. in this
   paper, we evaluated two aspects of id91 cliques for automatic
   summarization: the validity of the clusters produced and the quality of
   the cluster labeling.

    validity of the clusters

   the validity of the clusters was assessed by measuring cluster cohesion
   and cluster separation. cohesion measures the purity of the objects
   within a cluster, i.e. how closely related the objects in a cluster
   are. separation measures the isolation of the objects in different
   clusters, i.e. how distinct a cluster is from other clusters. for our
   clusters, composed of semantic predications, we evaluated how related
   the semantic predications in a cluster are to its cluster label
   (cohesion) and how well-separated semantic predications with different
   labels are in different clusters.

   for example, for a cluster i labeled as    procedure treatment   
   (procedures   <   therapy   >   disorders), if there are x predications
   included in this metapredication (such as    deep brain stimulation
   treats parkinson disease   ) and y predications not matching (such as
      dyskinetic syndrome coexists_with parkinson disease   ), then the
   cohesion of the cluster i is defined as:
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="italic">coh</mi>
   <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mfenced> <mo>=</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo stretchy="true">/</mo> <mfenced
   open="(" close=")"> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mi>y</mi> </mrow>
   </mfenced> </mrow> </mrow></semantics> :math]

   if in addition to cluster i, there are z predications in other clusters
   that match the label of cluster i, then the separation of cluster i is:
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="italic">sep</mi>
   <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mfenced> <mo>=</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo stretchy="true">/</mo> <mfenced
   open="(" close=")"> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mi>z</mi> </mrow>
   </mfenced> </mrow> </mrow></semantics> :math]

   inspired by calculation of f-score for information retrieval task, we
   defined the overall validity of cluster i as follows:
   [math: <semantics><mrow> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="italic">overall</mi>
   <mi mathvariant="italic">validity</mi> <mspace width="0.5em"></mspace>
   <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mfenced> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2</mn> <mi mathvariant="italic">coh</mi>
   <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
   </mfenced> <mi mathvariant="italic">sep</mi> <mfenced open="("
   close=")"> <msub> <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> </mfenced> <mo
   stretchy="true">/</mo> <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <mrow> <mi
   mathvariant="italic">coh</mi> <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub>
   <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> </mfenced> <mo>+</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="italic">sep</mi> <mfenced open="(" close=")"> <msub>
   <mi>c</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> </mfenced> </mrow> </mfenced> </mrow>
   </mrow></semantics> :math]

   we compared our system output to a baseline whose clique clusters were
   determined by the silhouette coefficient [[118]44], which is often used
   to determine the appropriate number of clusters in id91 data
   mining research. we used a symmetric matrix in which each cell was the
   number of shared nodes by the corresponding pair of cliques to compute
   the distance between cliques. then the average silhouette coefficient
   (asc) (see [[119]45] for details) was calculated for each id91
   solution and the solution with the highest asc served as the baseline.
   cohesion, separation, and overall validity were also calculated for the
   baseline.

    quality of the cluster labeling

   the accuracy of themes annotated by cluster labels is important to the
   final summary. a cluster with a poor label may be ignored by users even
   if it links to a group of documents relevant to their information
   needs. we thus also evaluated the labeling effectiveness of our system.
   since it is almost impossible for domain experts to produce class
   labels for the results of id91 tens of thousands articles, we
   constructed a reference standard for evaluation based on the medical
   subject heading (mesh) descriptors assigned to source citations that
   produce predications in the summary clusters. this evaluation was done
   by comparing arguments extracted from the predications in the cluster
   to mesh indexing terms assigned to the citations from which the
   predications were extracted.

   for each citation in medline, indexers at the national library of
   medicine assign 5 to 15 mesh descriptors as well as qualifiers (if
   necessary) to cover the topics of the article; they also indicate those
   mesh descriptors reflecting the major points of the article as major
   mesh descriptors. since this indexing procedure is performed by human
   experts, it is deemed that the mesh descriptors, especially the major
   ones, accurately represent the contents of the article. for example,
   for a citation entitled    aspirin and antiplatelet agent resistance:
   implications for prevention of secondary stroke    (pmid: 20932071), the
   major mesh descriptors are: aspirin/pharmacology; platelet aggregation
   inhibitors/pharmacology; stroke/prevention & control. in constructing
   the reference standard, we ignored mesh qualifiers. for example, mesh
   descriptors    antipsychotic agents/therapeutic use    and    antipsychotic
   agents/administration & dosage    were counted as one term.

   for each cluster in the summary, major mesh descriptors assigned to
   citations producing predications in the given cluster were extracted
   and sorted in descending order of frequency of occurrence. the
   predication arguments in each cluster were compared to an equal number
   of the ranked mesh descriptors, starting with the most frequent
   descriptor.

   in comparing predication arguments to mesh indexing terms, we exploited
   metathesaurus synonymy to match concepts in the graph to mesh
   descriptors. for example, the concept    diabetes mellitus,
   non-insulin-dependent    was matched to term    diabetes mellitus, type 2   
   because the concept is a synonym of the term in mesh vocabulary.
   finally, recall, precision and f-score were calculated.

[120]results

an example of the final summary

   figure [121]8 illustrates the final graphical summary (produced with
   pajek [[122]46]) for the topic schizophrenia, which appears as the
   central node of the graph. four themes were identified and are
   highlighted in color. notably in this summary, delusions and
   hallucinations are seen as comorbidities of schizophrenia, while
   dopamine, glutamate and neurotransmitters are associated with its
   etiology. drug treatment constitutes the largest cluster; in addition
   to representing major drugs for schizophrenia (linked by blue treats
   arcs), it shows comparison between two drugs (purple arcs,
   compared_with), and some adverse effects resulting from the drugs, such
   as weight gain and tardive dyskinesia (red arcs, causes). it should be
   noted that the characteristics of this graph reflect the condensing
   aspects of a summary, and do not necessarily accommodate other
   information management tasks, such as discovery. for an example of
   processing semantic predications for discovery see [[123]47].

   manually marked in different background colors: etiology (yellow),
   procedure treatment (green), drug treatment (violet), and disease
   comorbidities (gray).

validity of the clusters

   table [125]4 shows cohesion, separation and overall validity of both
   the system summary (ss) clusters and the baseline (bl, silhouette
   clusters) for the testing data. out of 11 topics, one, interleukin-6,
   produced only one cluster, so we did not compute cohesion and
   separation for this topic. results for the other 10 topics appear in
   table [126]4.

[129]discussion

   generally, results showed that our method, based on id207 as
   well as semantic predications, can produce satisfying summaries of
   large numbers of biomedical documents. the validity of clusters
   determined by semantics was better than that determined by the
   silhouette coefficient, and, further, the summary represented the major
   salient content of topics. analysis of the overall validity of clusters
   showed that system output is 10% better than the baseline (43% versus
   33%). although the cohesion of the baseline is slightly higher than
   that of the system summary, the separation of the system summary is
   significantly better than that of the baseline. the number of clusters
   determined by the silhouette coefficient is greater than the number
   determined by semantic information, which results in a relatively
   higher cohesion and lower separation in the baseline.

   we used metapredications to calculate cohesion and separation; such
   predications were constructed from semantic information pertinent to
   the core meaning of the themes. for example, the drug therapy theme
   (<chemicals & drugs   >   <therapy   >   <disorders>) expresses predications
   asserting specific drug therapies (treats) and comparison of such
   therapies (compared_with).

   predications that do not belong to these two metapredications are
   counted as false positives when computing cohesion and separation. a
   problem arose with the predicate causes, which semrep uses to expresses
   both side effect of drug (which would be reasonable to include in the
   drug therapy theme) and etiology of disease (which is not in the scope
   of this theme). we chose not to include causes in this theme, which
   caused some legitimate side-effect predications to be considered false
   positives when evaluating this theme. this decreased cohesion and
   separation, as well as overall validity for clusters containing the
   drug therapy theme.

false negatives

   two issues were encountered in comparing concepts in each cluster to
   mesh descriptors to evaluate the summary, both of which caused
   discrepancy between results and actual quality of the summary in
   expressing the semantic content of input citations. the first issue is
   due to indexing policy. for example, concepts referring to body part
   represented the major contents in disease location clusters. however,
   mesh descriptors in the anatomy category are not normally indexed as
   major topics. for example, lung (location of lung cancer) and pancreas
   (location of insulin), were not indexed as major topics.

   a second problem encountered in matching predications to mesh indexing
   terms involves qualifiers (subheadings). for example, the concept
      toxic effects    in the predication    anti-inflammatory agents,
   non-steroidal causes toxic effects    was often extracted from citations
   that had been indexed with the qualifier    toxicity.    since only mesh
   descriptors were compared in the evaluation, this concept was counted
   as a false negative.

false positives

   false positives were largely caused by infelicitous mapping to
   metathesaurus concepts. for example, statin has two mapping candidates,
      stn gene    and    hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa reductase inhibitors,    in the
   metathesaurus. for most sentences, such as        patients prescribed a
   statin with drugs that may increase the risk of myopathy   ,    stn gene   
   was selected due to incorrect id51.

limitations and future work

   although our system can produce useful summaries for large numbers of
   medline citations and cluster the summary into several groups based on
   the themes, it has limitations. as mentioned in theme identification
   section, ucinet uses a hierarchical id91 algorithm to cluster
   cliques. hierarchical id91 analysis is very practical in
   detecting topics for documents because it does not require human
   intervention to assign the number of the clusters in advance, as
   id116 id91 algorithm does. wartena and colleagues [[130]48]
   used a k-bisecting id91 algorithm, which is based on the k-mean
   algorithm, to cluster frequently occurring keywords in 758 documents
   taken from 8 wikipedia categories. they clustered these into 9
   categories, one for each wikipedia category and one additional cluster.
   while in reality, it is almost impossible to pre-define the number of
   the clusters for varied topics in biomedical domain, lee and colleagues
   [[131]33] compared supervised and unsupervised methods to detect topics
   in biomedical texts and found that the performance of supervised topic
   spotting methods was better. they also found that unsupervised
   hierarchical id91 was robust and more readily applicable in real
   world settings. the id91 algorithm we used is based on the common
   concepts shared by the cliques. in other words, the clique-clique
   proximity matrix used for id91 is constructed on the basis of the
   similarity of predication arguments contained among the cliques. it
   ignores the similarity of predicates, which may also contribute to the
   computation of clique similarity. although the effectiveness of
   id91 algorithms is not the focus of this paper, we will explore
   different id91 algorithms and consider adding predicates to
   enhance results in our future work.
   another limitation is that the final number of clusters is determined
   by a fixed threshold, which is widely used to detect the number of
   clusters in a dendrogram (cluster tree) whose branches are the clusters
   of interest. a fixed height on the dendrogram is chosen to cut the
   cluster tree into several groups. the icicle plot we used provides
   information similar to that in a dendrogram. we used semantic themes
   contained in each cluster to help find the height at which to cut the
   icicle plot. as mentioned in how to select the optimal id91
   solution, when clusters identified in the icicle plot have different
   themes, the algorithm ends at that level and the corresponding row is
   determined to be the optimal id91 solution. but for some topics,
   the fixed threshold cannot achieve satisfactory results. for example,
   figure [132]9 shows the icicle plot for id91 the topic tumor
   necrosis factor.
   [133]figure 9 figure 9
   figure 9

   icicle plot for tumor necrosis factor. the optimal cluster solution
   determined by our system is the row above the fixed threshold (line a).
   the theme label for each cluster for the system-determined solution is
   displayed. a dynamic cutoff b is displayed in blue.

   as shown in figure [134]9, the system uses a fixed threshold (shown as
   line a) to group this topic into eight clusters. by considering the
   semantic information contained in each cluster, we can determine that
   the themes of cluster one and two are the same (substances
   interactions), cluster three and four are both about locations of the
   substances, while clusters five, seven and eight are all about
   chemicals as the cause of disorders; finally, cluster six is about
   chemicals treat disorders. it is obvious that repetitive themes are
   produced.

   instead of the fixed threshold, we will explore the use of a dynamic
   threshold [[135]48] to detect clusters. compared to cutoff based on
   fixed height, a dynamic threshold, which uses different cut heights on
   different branches of the cluster tree, makes determining the number of
   clusters more flexible. for example, [[136]49] and [[137]50] used a
   dynamic tree cut method on the basis of analyzing the shape of the
   branches of the dendrogram. in the future, we will consider both the
   shape of the icicle plot and cluster themes to determine a dynamic
   threshold, such as cutoff b in figure [138]9. by considering the themes
   of clusters 1 to 8 in figure [139]9, the dynamic cutoff b chooses
   different id91 solutions at different cutoff heights, so that
   clusters having the same cluster labels in the fixed threshold cutting
   method (clusters 1 and 2, clusters 3 and 4, and clusters 7 and 8) are
   merged together, and three new clusters (cluster1-2, cluster 3-4 and
   cluster7-8) are produced. with cutoff b, five clusters (marked in blue
   under the cutoff line) are produced for the topic tnf. compared to
   cutoff a, dynamic cutoff b increases separation by 0.21 (0.52 versus
   0.31) and overall validity by 0.14 (0.53 versus 0.39).

[140]conclusion

   we exploited graph theoretical methods to summarize biomedical
   documents; using hierarchical id91, we then grouped the summary
   into several themes for a given topic based on the semantics contained
   in the summary. the system summary was compared to a reference standard
   produced by selecting the same number of the most frequent major mesh
   descriptors as the number of concepts in the summary. the result showed
   that recall, precision and f-score were 0.64, 0.65 and 0.65
   respectively. the validity of the clusters was compared to a baseline
   computed with the silhouette coefficient method for cohesion,
   separation and overall validity. the overall validity of the system
   output clusters was better than that of the silhouette coefficient
   clusters.
