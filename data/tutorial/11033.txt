abstract

   john swales's 1986 article    citation analysis and discourse analysis   
   was written by a discourse analyst to introduce citation research from
   other fields, mainly sociology of science, to his own discipline. here,
   i introduce applied linguists and discourse analysts to citation
   studies from information science, a complementary tradition not
   emphasized by swales. using replicable biblio   metric techniques, i show
   that interdisciplinary ties have grown among citation researchers from
   discourse analysis, sociology of science, and information science in
   the years since swales wrote. key authors, journals, articles, and
   books are presented in tables based on cocitation data from the
   institute for scientific information. while theoretical integration of
   the different strands of research is far from complete, this article
   carries the effort forward by reviewing contributions from the 1970s to
   the present in three major lines of research: citation classification,
   content analysis of citation contexts, and studies of citer
   motivations. i pay particular attention to ideas that bear on teaching
   the art of citing   for example, in courses in english for research
   purposes   and to controversies in citation research of interest to
   discourse analysts.
