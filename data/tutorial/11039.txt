abstract

citations are an important indicator of the
state of a scienti   c    eld, re   ecting how au-
thors frame their work, and in   uencing up-
take by future scholars. however, our under-
standing of citation behavior has been limited
to small-scale manual citation analysis. we
perform the largest behavioral study of cita-
tions to date, analyzing how citations are both
framed and taken up by scholars in one entire
   eld: natural language processing. we intro-
duce a new dataset of nearly 2,000 citations
annotated for function and centrality, and use
it to develop a state-of-the-art classi   er and
label the entire acl reference corpus. we
then study how citations are framed by au-
thors and use both papers and online traces
to track how citations are followed by read-
ers. we demonstrate that authors are sensitive
to discourse structure and publication venue
when citing, that online readers follow tem-
poral links to previous and future work rather
than methodological links, and that how a pa-
per cites related work is predictive of its cita-
tion count. finally, we use changes in citation
roles to show that the    eld of nlp is undergo-
ing a signi   cant increase in consensus.

introduction

1
citations play a key role in scienti   c develop-
ment. the citations from a paper reinforce its argu-
ments and connect it to an intellectual lineage (la-
tour, 1987), while the citations to a paper enable
communities to evaluate its intellectual contribution
and quality (cole and cole, 1971; lindsey, 1980;
hirsch, 2005). at the same time, authors employ

figure 1: examples of citation functionality.

citations in multiple ways (figure 1) so as to build
a strong and multi-faceted argument (latour, 1987).
while research on citation function is longstanding
(swales, 1986; white, 2004; ding et al., 2014), there
is still no    eld-scale dataset for citation function, and
so we still don   t understand the way that a    eld   s
authors frame their citations and how this framing
in   uences uptake by readers and future citers.

we perform the    rst    eld-scale study of cita-
tion usage by developing accurate methods for auto-
matically classifying citation purpose, and applying
these methods to an entire    eld   s literature.

we unify core aspects of prior citation anno-
tation schemes (white, 2004; ding et al., 2014;
hern  andez-alvarez and gomez, 2016) into a highly-
operationalizable coarse-grained classi   cation that
captures the function the citation plays towards fur-
thering an argument as well as whether the citation is
essential for understanding a contribution or serves
rather to position the paper within the scienti   c con-
text. using this scheme, we annotate a corpus of ci-
tations and use it to train a high-accuracy method for
automatically labeling a corpus. we use this method
to label the    eld of nlp, over 134,127 citations in
over 20,000 papers from nearly forty years of work.
we then investigate a number of key questions
concerning how authors frame their citations (how
citations re   ect the discourse structure of a paper,
how they are in   uenced by venue) how readers take

unlike cite, we use the method of cite,which has been used previously for parsing (cite).contrastusebackgroundthem up (which citations do online readers follow,
how does citation framing affect future citations to a
paper), and how these processes re   ect the matura-
tion and growth of the    eld of nlp. as further con-
tributions, we publicly release our dataset and code.

2 a corpus for citation function

citations play a key role in supporting authors    con-
tributions throughout a scienti   c paper.1 multi-
ple schemes have been proposed on how to clas-
sify these different roles, ranging from a handful
of classes (nanba and okumura, 1999; pham and
hoffmann, 2003) to twenty or more (gar   eld, 1979;
garzone and mercer, 2000). while suitable for ex-
pert manual analysis, such schemes don   t    t our goal
of    eld-scale automatic classi   cation. because they
tend to be unidimensional, they can   t label both cen-
trality and function (swales, 1986), they often in-
clude    ne-grained distinctions too rare to reliably
identify and subjective classi   cations that require
detailed    eld or author knowledge (ziman, 1968;
swales, 1990; harwood, 2009). motivated by the
desire to examine large-scale trends in scholarly
behavior, we address these issues by unifying the
common aspects of multiple approaches in a two-
dimensional model.

2.1 classi   cation scheme
our classi   cation builds on two themes for citation
role: (1) citation centrality, which re   ects whether
the citation is used to position the contribution
within a broader context or is essential for under-
standing the contribution itself (moravcsik and mu-
rugesan, 1975; chubin and moitra, 1975; swales,
1986; latour, 1987; valenzuela et al., 2015) and (2)
citation function, which re   ects the particular pur-
pose a citation is serving in the discourse, e.g., pro-
viding background or serving as contrast (oppen-
heim and renn, 1978; spiegel-r  using, 1977; teufel
et al., 2006a; gar   eld, 1979; garzone and mercer,
2000). these themes capture complementary infor-
mation and, as we will see, reveal meaningful pat-
terns in author behavior.2

1for notational clarity, we use the term reference for the
work that is cited and citation for the mention of it in the text.
2a third potential theme is citation sentiment (athar, 2014;
kumar, 2016), but we omit this because researchers have shown
that negative sentiment is rare in practice (chubin and moitra,
1975; vinkler, 1998; case and higgins, 2000) and quite subjec-

centrality
in citing, an author attempts to per-
suade the reader of a paper   s merit (gilbert, 1977)
by incorporating other work to further their own
approach, or by contextualizing their work within
the broader literature. both kinds of citations are
necessary; for example as latour (1987) and oth-
ers have argued, positioning citations secure the in-
ductive gaps between an author   s arguments, and al-
low the author to identify with a lineage of work as
motivation for their own position. the    rst theme
in our classi   cation, citation centrality, thus speci-
   es whether a citation is (a) essential to under-
standing the contributions of the citing paper or (b)
positioning by situating the citing paper within a
broader context.
function citation function re   ects the speci   c pur-
pose a citation plays with respect to the current pa-
per   s contributions. we unify the functional roles
common in several classi   cations, e.g., (spiegel-
r  using, 1977; gar   eld, 1979; peritz, 1983; teufel
et al., 2006a; harwood, 2009; dong and sch  afer,
2011), into the seven classes shown in table 1.

2.2 annotation process and dataset
annotation guidelines were created using a pilot
study of 10 papers sampled from the acl anthol-
ogy reference corpus (arc) (bird et al., 2008).
annotators completed two rounds of pre-annotation
to discuss their process and design guidelines. all
citations were then doubly-annotated by two trained
annotators using the brat tool (stenetorp et al.,
2012) and then fully adjudicated to ensure quality.

the citation scheme was applied to a random sam-
ple of 52 papers drawn from the arc. each paper
was processed using parscit (councill et al., 2008)
to extract citations and their references. as expected
from prior studies (teufel et al., 2006a; dong and
sch  afer, 2011), some citation functions were infre-
quent. we therefore attempted to oversample the
infrequent classes future, continuation, and
motivation, by using keywords biased toward ex-
tracting citing sentences of a particular class (such
as the word    future    for the future class). the
resulting citing sentences were then annotated and
could potentially be assigned to any class. in total,
1436 contexts were annotated for the fully-labeled

tive to classify due to textual mixtures of praise and criticism
(peritz, 1983; swales, 1986; brooks, 1986; teufel, 2000).

52 papers (mean 27.6 citations/paper) and 533 sup-

ing the total number of instances to 1969.

table 2 shows the    nal dataset.

consistent
with prior work,
the majority of citations are
background (moravcsik and murugesan, 1975;
spiegel-r  using, 1977; teufel et al., 2006b). while
some citation functions are strongly associated with
one centrality type, e.g., background as posi-
tioning; citation function does not wholly predict
centrality, highlighting the need for the two comple-
mentary classi   cations.

3 automatically classifying citations

the structure of a scienti   c article provides mul-
tiple cues for a citation   s purpose. our work
draws on multiple approaches (hern  andez-alvarez
and gomez, 2016) to develop a classi   er based on
(1) structural features describing where the citation
is located, (2) lexical and grammatical features for
how the citation is described, (3)    eld features that
take into account venue or other external informa-
tion, and (4) usage features on how the reference is
cited throughout the paper. table 3 shows our fea-

tures, including those drawn from state of the art sys-
tems (teufel, 2000; teufel et al., 2006b; dong and
sch  afer, 2011; wan and liu, 2014; valenzuela et al.,
2015) as well as ten novel feature classes.

3.1 features
following, we describe in detail the three main cat-
egories of novel features.
pattern-based features patterns provide a pow-
erful mechanisms for capturing regularity in citation
usage (dong and sch  afer, 2011). our patterns are a
sequence of cue phrases, parts of speech, or lexical
categories, like positive-sentiment words or speci   c
categories that allow generalizations across phrases
like    we extend    and    we build upon.    we began
with the largest publicly-available list of citation pat-
terns (teufel, 2000), extending it with 132 new pat-
terns and 13 new lexical categories based on a man-
ual analysis of the corpus.

we then used id64 to automatically iden-
tify new patterns. each annotated context was con-
verted into    xed-length patterns using (a) our 42 lex-
ical categories, (b) part of speech wild cards, or (c)
the tokens directly. to avoid semantic drift (riloff
and jones, 1999), a bootstrapped pattern was only
included as a feature if the majority of its occur-
rences were with a single citation function.3 table
4 shows examples of these bootstrapped patterns.

previous patterns primarily use cues from the
same sentence as the citation (teufel, 2000). how-

3for computational ef   ciency, patterns were restricted to
having between 3 and 8 tokens and at most two part of speech
wild cards. due to its high frequency, patterns for back-
ground were required to occur in at least 100 contexts.

table 3: features for classifying citations. novel features
are marked with a    .

ever, authors often use multiple sentences to indicate
a citation   s purpose (abu-jbara and radev, 2012;
ritchie et al., 2008; he et al., 2011; kataria et al.,
2011). for example, authors may    rst introduce a
work positively, only to contrast with it in later sen-
tences (peritz, 1983; brooks, 1986; mercer et al.,
2004). indeed the average text pertaining to a cita-
tion spans 1.6 sentences in the arc (small, 2011).
we therefore induce bootstrapped patterns spe-
ci   c to the citation sentence as well as the preced-
ing and following sentences. ultimately, 805 new
bootstrapped patterns were added for the citing sen-
tence, 669 for the preceding context, and 1159 for
the following, over four times the number of manu-
ally curated patterns.

ics learned from citation contexts.

topic-based features a context   s thematic fram-
ing can point to the purpose of a citation even in
the absence of explicit cues. for example, a con-
text describing system performances and results is
likely to be a compare or contrast, whereas
one describing methodology is more likely to be
uses. we quantify this thematic framing by using
features based on topic models, computed over the
sentence containing the citation and also over an ex-
tended -1/+3 context around the citing sentence. for
each type of context, a topic model is trained with
100 topics over 321,129 respective contexts from the
arc. table 5 shows example topics.
prototypical argument features we also ex-
plored richer grammatical features, drawing on
selectional preferences re   ecting expectations for
predicate arguments. we construct a prototype
for each citation function by identifying the fre-
quent arguments seen in different syntactic posi-
tions. for example, continuation citations occur
frequently as objects of verbs such as    follow    and
   use,    whereas uses citations have techniques or ar-
tifact words as dependents; table 6 shows more ex-
amples. each class   s selectional preferences are rep-
resented using a vector for the argument at each rela-
tion type, constructed by summing the vectors of all
words appearing in it. each function is represented
as a separate feature whose value is the average sim-

3.2 experimental setup
models all models were trained using a random
forest classi   er, which is robust to over   tting even
with large numbers of features (fern  andez-delgado
et al., 2014). after limited grid search, we set the
number of random trees to 500, initialized trees us-
ing a balanced subsample of the data, and required
each leaf to match 7 instances. the classi   er is
implemented using scikit (pedregosa et al., 2011)
and syntactic processing was done using corenlp
(manning et al., 2014). selectional preferences used
pretrained 300-dimensional vectors from the 840b
token common crawl (pennington et al., 2014).
data
annotated data is crucial for developing
high accuracy for rare citation classes.
there-
fore, we integrate portions of the dataset of teufel
(2010), which has    ne-grained citation function la-
beled for acl-related documents using the annota-
tion scheme of teufel et al. (2006b). we map their
12 function classes into six of ours. when com-
bining the two datasets, we omit the data labeled
with their background-equivalent class to reduce
the effects of a large majority class and because in-
stances of the future class are merged into back-
ground according to their scheme. the resulting
citation function dataset contains 3083 instances. as
there is no precise mapping from function to central-
ity (cf. table 2), centrality classi   ers use only our
annotated data.
evaluation evaluation is performed using cross-
validation where each fold leaves out all citations
of a single paper. stratifying by paper instead of

instance is critical:
since multiple citations may
appear in the same sentence, instance-based strat-
i   cation would leak information between training
and test. we report micro- and macro-averaged f1
scores across the seven function classes and for cen-
trality, report precision and recall on the binary clas-
si   cation where essential is the positive class.
comparison systems the proposed citation clas-
si   ers are compared against three systems. for state
of the art, we compare against teufel (2000) which
is the most similar model to ours that is experimen-
tally reproducible; the original implementation used
a custom syntactic tool (for e.g., verb tense), which
we replaced with corenlp. two baselines are used
for comparison: a random baseline that selects la-
bels at chance and a single-class baseline that labels
all instances with the most frequent citation function
background or in the binary centrality classi   ca-
tion, with the positive class essential.

3.3 results and discussion
our methods substantially outperformed the closest
state of the art and both baselines for both classi   -
cation tasks, as shown in table 7. all improvements
over comparison systems are statistically signi   cant
(mcnemar   s, p   0.01).

an ablation test suggests that each of our novel
features contributed to the    nal performance. no-
tably, we observe that selectional preference and
topic features had the largest impact on perfor-
mance. while both we and multiple prior works
have focused on patterns to recognize function, our
results suggest that machine learned features (topics
or word vectors) are superior. indeed, examining the
feature weighting in the id79 shows that
features for structure (e.g., section number), topic,
and selectional preference comprised most of the

to the acl anthology to study what citation roles
can tell us about scienti   c uptake and direction.

as a qualitative demonstration, we    rst exam-
ine the narrative structure of citation function across
section. scienti   c papers commonly follow a struc-
tured narrative according to section: introduction,
methodology, results, and discussion (skelton,
1994; nwogu, 1997).
in the narra-
tive adopts argumentative moves designed to con-
vince the reader of the work   s claims (swales, 1986;
swales, 1990). we expect that this narrative is mir-
rored in how authors use their citations in sections,
with the section serving to frame the meaning of a
citation (goffman, 1974; gumperz, 1982).

each part

to test this hypothesis, the function classi   er was
applied to all 21,474 papers of the latest 2016 release
of the acl anthology. this yielded a dataset of
134,127 citations between papers in the arc. the
resulting distributions of citation function (figure
2), show that authors    citation usage indeed paral-
lels the expected rhetorical framing: (1) establish-
ing framing via background citations in the in-
troduction, motivation, and related work sections
to (2) introducing methodology with uses citations
in the methodology and evaluation sections, (3) a
large increase in comparison or contrast for
related literature in the results and discussions, and
   nally (4) closing comparisons and pointers to fu-
ture directions. these trends also mirror the the-
matic structure identi   ed in full-paper textual analy-
ses (skelton, 1994; nwogu, 1997). by showing that
a section contains citations serving a variety of func-
tions, our    ndings further point to a new direction
for citation placement studies (hu et al., 2013; ding
et al., 2013; bertin et al., 2016), which have largely
treated all citations within a section as equivalent.

5 venues and citation patterns

does the venue in which a paper appears affect the
way it cites? we used the same experimental setup
as the previous section. figure 3 shows citation
function by venue for the 134,127 citations.

we    nd that similar venues have similar citation
functions. journals have the highest percentage of
background citations, suggesting that their extra
space and wider temporal scope lends itself more
to positioning. conference venues devote propor-
tionally more space to contrast and comparison, pre-

section shows a clear narrative trajectory across sections.

100 highest-weighted features (76%).

the use of conjunctive features was critical for
performance, with all other classi   ers we tried
(id166, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and deci-
sion trees) providing signi   cantly worse results.4

the resulting classi   er performance is suf   cient
to apply it to the entire arc dataset for the analyses
in the next four sections. nonetheless, errors remain.
our error analysis revealed that a main challenge is
incorporating information external to the citing sen-
tence. consider the following example:

bildernetle is our new data set of german noun-to-
id163 synset mappings.
id163 is a large-scale
and widely used image database, built on top of id138,
which maps words into groups of images, called synsets
(deng et al., 2009).

here the citing sentence appears much like a
background citation when read in isolation; how-
ever, the preceding sentence reveals that the citing
work   s data is based on the citation, making its func-
tion uses though no explicit cues suggest this in
the citing sentence. automated methods need to
do a better job of inferring (a) which context inside
and outside the citing sentence relates to the citation
and (b) how the cited paper   s content relates to this
context; together these require richer textual under-
standing than is present in most current methods.
4 narrative structure of citation function
in the next four sections, we apply the classi   er
trained on our combined dataset (3083 citation func-
tion instances, 1969 instances for citation centrality)
4indeed, replacing the k-nearest neighbors classi   er used in

paper (mean 97.5). the access logs do not directly
record unique user identi   ers for tracking behavior
over extended periods of time (e.g., as compared to
session cookies); however, each request includes a
string describing the user agent, which reports spe-
ci   c details on the operating system, browser, and
version numbers. because of the high number of
unique combinations of user agent features and rel-
atively low traf   c to the website, these user agent
strings are suf   cient for identifying access patterns
of individual users during short time intervals. ac-
tivity traces are constructed by identifying sequen-
tial requests made by the same user agent string for
two or more papers, with no more than 60 minutes
between requests. the vast majority of traces consist
of requests for two (80%) or three papers (9.6%).5

to compare with the observed human behavior,
we construct a null model over the expected frequen-
cies with which references of each type are visited.6
a positive z-score indicates that the reader accesses
the paper more frequently than expected by chance.
the effects of how a reference is cited is measured
by calculating the z-score in visits with respect to
references by class. we treat a reference as essen-
tial if any of its citations are labeled as such. be-
cause a reference may have multiple functions (e.g.,
both background and uses), we use a fractional
count proportional to the number of functions.
results
centrality was strongly predictive of
whether a reader would subsequently access the ref-
erence, shown in table 8 (top). con   rming the hy-
pothesis of valenzuela et al. (2015), we    nd that es-
sential references are signi   cantly more likely to
be read than at chance (p     0.01), while position-
ing are less likely (p     0.01). however, the effect
of citation function (table 8, bottom) reveals a more
complex story of reader behavior.

5to guard against cases where a user agent string might be
used by multiple individuals in parallel, we remove all traces
with 50 or more requests, though this is rare in practice (0.3%).
6 for each trace beginning with paper pi and continuing to
one of its references pj     r , the null model randomly selects a
reference in r with equal id203. visiting the same initial
papers seen in the observed data controls for differences in the
number of references. the expected frequency distributions for
reading behavior was created by generating visit counts from
500 simulations per trace with the null model and calculating
the number of standard deviations away the observed frequency
was from the expected frequency, i.e., the z-score.

sumably because new nlp work is    rst presented at
conferences, hence requiring demonstrating the pro-
posed technique is better than existing ones. work-
shops, by contrast, have relatively little comparison
and instead use more background; the experi-
mental nature of workshop papers presumably re-
sults in fewer potential prospects for comparison.

6 citation network navigation

the narrative in a scholarly work highlights salient
aspects about cited works for the reader. as a re-
sult, a citation   s framing may motivate or discourage
readers from seeking it out. understanding readers   
citation-following behavior is an important part of
understanding scholars    information gathering goals
and strategies. yet while human navigation on hy-
perlinked networks such as wikipedia have been ex-
plored extensively (e.g. west and leskovec (2012)),
we know very little about how scholars browse ci-
tation networks (rouse et al., 1982; bergstr  om and
whitehead jr, 2006); and no studies have looked at
data from users    real-world behavior. do readers
generally follow links to methodologies? are they
more likely to follow links to essential papers?

the acl anthology offers an opportunity to ex-
amine these questions in detail, since the server logs
from the anthology allow us to estimate when read-
ers follow citation links from one paper to another.
we use this data to understand how the way a refer-
ence is cited is predictive of it being read.
experimental setup
paper requests were gath-
ered from the complete apache logs of the acl an-
thology website from november 2014 to september
2015. after removing requests by bots and web-
spiders, the logs contain roughly 3.6m requests for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    z-score

readers are more likely to follow the temporal
thread of an idea, reading the papers from which
the current work originates (by others extends
or themselves continuation) or how the cur-
rent work could be applied in the future (future).
however, readers are signi   cantly less likely to fol-
low uses citations, despite these nearly always be-
ing essential. we speculate that when authors ex-
tend their work or the work of others, they are more
likely to omit details of the original paper; hence,
a reader must go back to the original paper to ob-
tain a complete picture. and because works within
a research area often share methodologies and data
(uses citations), a reader may be familiar with these
references and not seek them out again.

scholars use to explore research.

by using the browsing patterns of an en-
tire    eld, we have demonstrated the strategies
that
our
   ndings more broadly motivate the need for
scholarly search engines like semantic scholar
(www.semanticscholar.org/)
support
browsing preferences by surfacing temporally-
connected references instead of methodological
citations.

to

7 predicting future impact

the scholarly narrative told through citations pro-
vides the reader with support for its claims and tech-
nical competence (latour, 1987, p. 34). this fram-
ing could affect the perception of the work and, ulti-
mately, how it is received and cited within the com-
munity (shi et al., 2010). does the narrative a paper
constructs through citation roles (the way it com-
pares to related work, or motivates, or points to the

future) affect its reception?
experimental setup to quantify the impact of ci-
tation usage, we test its ability to predict the cumula-
tive number of citations a paper received within the
   rst    ve years after publication, known to be highly
representative of the eventual citation count (wang
et al., 2013; stern, 2014). our baseline model con-
sists of state of the art features for predicting ci-
tation count (yan et al., 2011; yan et al., 2012;
chakraborty et al., 2014; dong et al., 2016); we then
ask whether prediction is improved by adding the
number of citations per function and centrality.

all papers with at least    ve years of publication
history in the anthology were considered, yielding
a set of 10,434 papers. we used negative binomial
models, which are more appropriate than linear re-
gression as citation counts are non-negative discrete
counts, and compared them using akaike informa-
tion criterion (aic).

five types of baseline features were included. to
model the amount of attention received by differ-
ent research areas, each paper is associated with its
distribution over 100 topics, built using lda over
the arc; to capture diversity, we include the en-
tropy of the topic distribution. we model the differ-
ent publication venues via a categorical feature for
the acl venue in which the paper was published.
we include the publication year since the size of
the    eld changes over time. multi-author papers are
known to receive higher citation counts (gazni and
didegah, 2011), partially due to the effects of self-
citation (fowler and aksnes, 2007), and therefore
we include the number of authors on the paper. fi-
nally, we include the number of references.7
results knowledge of how a paper contextualizes
itself indeed helps predict its future impact; citation
function and centrality each improve aic model    t
(likelihood ratio test, p     0.01 for each), and adding
them together improves aic again (p     0.01).

four main insights can been seen through which
types of citations are signi   cantly predictive of
higher impact (p   0.05), shown in table 9. first,
papers that closely integrate more works as essential

7to control for collinearity between citation-related predic-
tors, we regress out the number of citations from the citation
function counts and then in turn, regress out the citation func-
tion counts from citation centrality counts (kutner et al., 2004;
obrien, 2007). the resulting model has a variance in   ation fac-
tor of < 10 for all variables.

to their contribution are cited more than those us-
ing more citations to position their work. this trend
parallels the effects seen with uses citations, which
suggests that papers that leverage existing method-
ologies and data have higher impact. second, cita-
tions to motivating works have the most impact on
future citation. we speculate that such citations pro-
vide the reader with an explicit signal of external
support for a line of research which inspires future
work in the area as a result. third, latour (1987,
p. 54) has suggested that authors may de   ect crit-
icism of their work (improving its perception) by
claiming it as an extension, rather than comparing it
with prior work. however, we    nd that additional
comparison increases impact, while no signi   cant
effect was seen for extends. we speculate that
extends and continuation citations could lead
to the work being perceived as incremental, thereby
reducing its novelty and anticipated impact. fourth,
citations indicating a temporal connection had no
signi   cant effect on citation frequency (p>0.05)   
despite our earlier results showing that these cita-
tions are more likely to be read.

8 the growth of rapid discovery science

as scienti   c    elds evolve, new sub   elds are of-
ten initially based around method technology, which
starts a community discussion of the best way to
use and improve the technology (moody, 2004).
nlp has witnessed the emergence of several such
sub   elds from the early grammar based approaches
in the 1950s-1970s to the statistical revolution
in the 1990s to the recent deep learning models
(sp  arck jones, 2001; anderson et al., 2012). collins
(1994) proposed that a    eld can undergo a particular
shift, to what he calls rapid discovery science, when

the    eld (a) reaches high consensus on research top-
ics and methodologies, and (b) develops genealogies
of method technologies that build upon one another.
as a result of increased consensus, a    eld empha-
sizes moving to new research problems rather than
contesting the results of prior approaches. collins
claims this shift characterizes natural sciences, but
not many social sciences, which are instead more
likely to emphasize this process of contesting.

we propose to measure the two facets of rapid dis-
covery science by quantifying the degrees to which
authors (a) defend their work through positioning
and comparison, with lower rates suggesting more
consensus, and (b) focus on the same works for
methodology and comparison, with increased rates
signaling the development of methodological lin-
eages. we propose that the increased use of shared
evaluations, and the statistical methodology bor-
rowed originally from electrical engineering (hall et
al., 2008) has led nlp to undergo a shift towards
rapid discovery science.
experimental setup
the expected frequencies
of citation functions and centrality were determined
using the fully-classi   ed acl anthology network.
due to variance in the number of papers per year,
we report bootstrapped con   dence intervals in the
expected percentage of each at 68% and 95%.
results the nlp    eld shows a signi   cant increase
in consensus consistent with the rise in rapid discov-
ery science, evidenced through two main trends.

first, nlp authors use a decreasing number of
positioning references (pearson   s r= -0.446, p    
0.01)   figure 4a   with an even sharper decrease
in the number of works used for comparison and
contrast (r= -0.899, p     0.01)   figure 4b. instead
of comparing to others, it seems that authors sim-
ply acknowledge prior work as background. de-
spite an increase in background citations, the to-
tal percentage of comparative and background cita-
tions (the two main positioning functions; see table
2) still declines (r= -0.663, p     0.01), with authors
instead increasingly including more uses citations.
latour (1987, p. 50) argues that positioning ref-
erences are critical to an author   s defense of an idea.
we therefore interpret the observed decrease in po-
sitioning references as signaling a reduced need
for authors to defend aspects of their work. authors
are able to compare against fewer papers due to the

(a) centrality

(b) function

(c) expected number of citations

figure 4: changes in the percentage of citation types (4a) and functions (4b) per paper reveals an increase in the overall
percentage of essential references per paper and decrease in the percentage of comparison or contrast.
however, the average cited paper receives an increasing number of uses and comparison or contrast citations
per year (4c) showing that    eld increasingly builds upon the same set of papers, providing a methodological lineage.

   elds growing consensus on the validity of the prob-
lem and methodological contribution.

note that there is a small but signi   cant increase
in the number of positioning references between
2009 and 2011. this transition corresponds to the
date at which acl venues began allowing unlimited
references (2010 for acl, 2011 for naacl, etc.).
unlimited extra space for citations acted to distort
the framing of citations; given unlimited space, au-
thors chose to include proportionally more posi-
tioning citations.8

in the second trend, authors are more likely to
use and compare against the same papers, as shown
in figure 4c by the rise in expected incoming cita-
tions to those works compared against (r= 0.734, p
    0.01) and used (r=0.889, p     0.01). for exam-
ple, in 1991, authors compared with a diffuse group
of parsing papers, e.g., (shieber, 1988; pereira and
warren, 1983; haas, 1989), with such papers re-
ceiving at most three citations that year; whereas in
2000, most comparisons were to a core set of parsing
papers, e.g., (collins, 2003; buchholz et al., 1999;
collins, 1997), with a much sharper (lower id178)
distribution of citations. these trends show the in-
creased incorporation of prior work to form a lineage
of method technologies as well as show increased
consensus on which works are suf   cient for com-
paring against in order to establish a claim. these
results also empirically con   rm the observation of
sp  arck jones (2001) that a major trend in nlp in

8note that this change acts against the general decrease in
positioning; considering only 1980-2009, the decrease in
positioning is even larger (r= -0.568, p     0.01 ).

the 1990s was an increase in reusable technologies
and evaluations, like the bnc (leech, 1992) and the
id32 (marcus et al., 1993).

more broadly, our work points to the future of
nlp as a quickly moving    eld of high consensus
and suggests that artifacts that facilitate consensus
such as shared tasks and open source research soft-
ware will be necessary to continue this trend.
9 conclusion
not all citations are created equal. using a new
corpus annotated with citation function and central-
ity, we develop a state-of-the-art classi   er, demon-
strating the importance of novel unsupervised fea-
tures related to topic models and argument structure,
and label all the citations for an entire    eld (with
all data and materials released at https://github.
com/anon).

we then show that citation function and central-
ity reveal salient behaviors of writers, readers, and
the    eld as a whole: (1) authors are sensitive to dis-
course structure and venue when citing, (2) read-
ers follow temporal threads of ideas in their brows-
ing of id191, rather than methodologi-
cal threads, (3) the way in which an author relates
their work to the literature is predictive of the num-
ber of citations its receives, with the community fa-
voring well-motivated works that integrate and com-
pare with other works, and (4) the nlp    eld as a
whole has seen increased consensus in what con-
stitutes valid work   with a reduced need for posi-
tioning and excessive comparison   demonstrating
its shift towards rapid discovery science.
