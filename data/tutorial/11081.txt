abstract

two recent approaches have achieved
state-of-the-art results in image caption-
ing. the    rst uses a pipelined process
where a set of candidate words is gen-
erated by a convolutional neural network
(id98) trained on images, and then a max-
imum id178 (me) language model is
used to arrange these words into a coherent
sentence. the second uses the penultimate
activation layer of the id98 as input to a
recurrent neural network (id56) that then
generates the caption sequence. in this pa-
per, we compare the merits of these dif-
ferent id38 approaches for
the    rst time by using the same state-of-
the-art id98 as input. we examine is-
sues in the different approaches, includ-
ing linguistic irregularities, caption repe-
tition, and data set overlap. by combining
key aspects of the me and id56 methods,
we achieve a new record performance over
previously published results on the bench-
mark coco dataset. however, the gains
we see in id7 do not translate to human
judgments.

introduction

recent progress in automatic image captioning
has shown that an image-conditioned language
model can be very effective at generating captions.
two leading approaches have been explored for
this task. the    rst decomposes the problem into
an initial step that uses a convolutional neural net-
work to predict a bag of words that are likely to
be present in a caption; then in a second step, a
maximum id178 language model (me lm) is
used to generate a sentence that covers a mini-
mum number of the detected words (fang et al.,
2015). the second approach uses the activations

from    nal hidden layer of an id164 id98
as the input to a recurrent neural network lan-
guage model (id56 lm). this is referred to as a
multimodal recurrent neural network (mid56)
(karpathy and fei-fei, 2015; mao et al., 2015;
chen and zitnick, 2015). similar in spirit is the
the log-bilinear (lbl) lm of kiros et al. (2014).
in this paper, we study the relative merits of
these approaches. by using an identical state-of-
the-art id98 as the input to id56-based and me-
based models, we are able to empirically com-
pare the strengths and weaknesses of the lan-
guage modeling components. we    nd that the
approach of directly generating the text with an
mid561 outperforms the me lm when measured
by id7 on the coco dataset (lin et al., 2014),2
but this recurrent model tends to reproduce cap-
tions in the training set. in fact, a simple k-nearest
neighbor approach, which is common in earlier re-
lated work (farhadi et al., 2010; mason and char-
niak, 2014), performs similarly to the mid56. in
contrast, the me lm generates the most novel
captions, and does the best at captioning images
for which there is no close match in the training
data. with a deep multimodal similarity model
(dmsm) incorporated,3 the me lm signi   cantly
outperforms other methods according to human
judgments. in sum, the contributions of this pa-
per are as follows:

1. we compare the use of discrete detections
and continuous valued id98 activations as
the conditioning information for language
models trained to generate image captions.

2. we show that a simple k-nearest neighbor re-
trieval method performs at near state-of-the-
art for this task and dataset.

cluding linguistic irregularities, caption repe-
tition, and data set overlap.

2 models

all language models compared here are trained
using output from the same state-of-the-art id98.
the id98 used is the 16-layer variant of vggnet
(simonyan and zisserman, 2014) which was ini-
tially trained for the ilsvrc2014 classi   cation
task (russakovsky et al., 2015), and then    ne-
tuned on the microsoft coco data set (fang et
al., 2015; lin et al., 2014).

2.1 detector conditioned models
we study the effect of leveraging an explicit de-
tection step to    nd key objects/attributes in images
before generation, examining both an me lm ap-
proach as reported in previous work (fang et al.,
2015), and a novel lstm approach introduced
here. both use a id98 trained to output a bag of
words indicating the words that are likely to ap-
pear in a caption, and both use a id125 to
   nd a top-scoring sentence that contains a subset
of the words. this set of words is dynamically ad-
justed to remove words as they are mentioned.

we refer the reader to fang et al. (2015) for a
full description of their me lm approach, whose
500-best outputs we analyze here.4 we also in-
clude the output from their me lm that leverages
scores from a deep multimodal similarity model
(dmsm) during n-best re-ranking. brie   y, the
dmsm is a non-generative neural network model
which projects both the image pixels and caption
text into a comparable vector space, and scores
their similarity.
in the lstm approach, similar to the me lm
approach, we maintain a set of likely words d that

have not yet been mentioned in the caption un-
der construction. this set is initialized to all the
words predicted by the id98 above some thresh-
old   .5 the words already mentioned in the
sentence history h are then removed to produce
a set of conditioning words d \ {h}. we in-
corporate this information within the lstm by
adding an additional input encoded to represent
the remaining visual attributes d \ {h} as a con-
tinuous valued auxiliary feature vector (mikolov
and zweig, 2012). this is encoded as f (sh   1 +
v   d\{h} gv + uqh,d), where sh   1 and gv are
respectively the continuous-space representations
for last word h   1 and detector v     d \ {h}, u is
learned matrix for recurrent histories, and f (  ) is
the sigmoid transformation.

2.2 multimodal recurrent neural network
in this section, we explore a model directly con-
ditioned on the id98 activations rather than a set
of word detections. our implementation is very
similar to captioning models described in karpa-
thy and fei-fei (2015), vinyals et al. (2014), mao
et al. (2015), and donahue et al. (2014). this
joint vision-language id56 is referred to as a mul-
timodal recurrent neural network (mid56).

in this model, we feed each image into our
id98 and retrieve the 4096-dimensional    nal hid-
den layer, denoted as fc7. the fc7 vector is
then fed into a hidden layer h to obtain a 500-
dimensional representation that serves as the ini-
tial hidden state to a gated recurrent neural net-
work (gid56) (cho et al., 2014). the gid56
is trained jointly with h to produce the caption
one word at a time, conditioned on the previous
word and the previous recurrent state. for decod-
ing, we perform a id125 of size 10 to emit
tokens until an end token is produced. we use
a 500-dimensional gid56 hidden layer and 200-
dimensional id27s.

2.3 k-nearest neighbor model
both donahue et al. (2015) and karpathy and fei-
fei (2015) present a 1-nearest neighbor baseline.
as a    rst step, we replicated these results using the
cosine similarity of the fc7 layer between each
test set image t and training image r. we randomly
emit one caption from t   s most similar training im-
age as the caption of t. as reported in previous
results, performance is quite poor, with a id7

4we will refer to this system as d-me.

score of 11.2%.

however, we explore the idea that we may be
able to    nd an optimal k-nearest neighbor consen-
sus caption. we    rst select the k = 90 nearest
training images of a test image t as above. we de-
note the union of training captions in this set as
c = c1, ..., c5k.6 for each caption ci, we com-
pute the id165 overlap f-score between ci and
each other caption in c. we de   ne the consen-
sus caption c    to be caption with the highest mean
id165 overlap with the other captions in c. we
have found it is better to only compute this average
among ci   s m = 125 most similar captions, rather
than all of c. the hyperparameters k and m were
obtained by a grid search on the validation set.

a visual example of the consensus caption is
given in figure 1.
intuitively, we are choosing
a single caption that may describe many different
images that are similar to t, rather than a caption
that describes the single image that is most similar
to t. we believe that this is a reasonable approach
to take for a retrieval-based method for captioning,
as it helps ensure incorrect information is not men-
tioned. further details on retrieval-based methods
are available in, e.g., (ordonez et al., 2011; ho-
dosh et al., 2013).

3 experimental results
3.1 the microsoft coco dataset
we work with the microsoft coco dataset (lin
et al., 2014), with 82,783 training images, and
the validation set split into 20,243 validation im-
ages and 20,244 testval images. most images con-
tain multiple objects and signi   cant contextual in-
formation, and each image comes with 5 human-

6each training image has 5 captions.

annotated captions. the images create a challeng-
ing testbed for image captioning and are widely
used in recent automatic image captioning work.

3.2 metrics
the quality of generated captions is measured au-
tomatically using id7 (papineni et al., 2002)
and meteor (denkowski and lavie, 2014).
id7 roughly measures the fraction of id165s
(up to 4 grams) that are in common between a hy-
pothesis and one or more references, and penalizes
short hypotheses by a brevity penalty term.7 me-
teor (denkowski and lavie, 2014) measures un-
igram precision and recall, extending exact word
matches to include similar words based on word-
net synonyms and stemmed tokens. we also re-
port the perplexity (pplx) of studied detection-
conditioned lms. the pplx is in many ways
the natural measure of a statistical lm, but can be
loosely correlated with id7 (auli et al., 2013).

3.3 model comparison
in table 1, we summarize the generation perfor-
mance of our different models. the discrete de-
tection based models are pre   xed with    d   . some
example generated results are show in table 2.

we see that the detection-conditioned lstm
lm produces much lower pplx than the
detection-conditioned me lm, but
its id7
score is no better. the mid56 has the lowest
pplx, and highest id7 among all lms stud-

7we use the length of the reference that is closest to the

length of the hypothesis to compute the brevity penalty.

yet reported.

ied in our experiments. it signi   cantly improves
id7 by 2.1 absolutely over the d-me lm base-
line. meteor is similar across all three lm-
based methods.

perhaps most surprisingly, the k-nearest neigh-
bor algorithm achieves a higher id7 score than
all other models. however, as we will demonstrate
in section 3.5, the generated captions perform sig-
ni   cantly better than the nearest neighbor captions
in terms of human quality judgements.

3.4 n-best re-ranking
in addition to comparing the me-based and id56-
based lms independently, we explore whether
combining these models results in an additive im-
provement. to this end, we use the 500-best list
from the d-me and add a score for each hypoth-
esis from the mid56.8 we then re-rank the hy-
potheses using mert (och, 2003). as in previous
work (fang et al., 2015), model weights were opti-
mized to maximize id7 score on the validation
set. we further extend this combination approach
to the d-me model with dmsm scores included
during re-ranking (fang et al., 2015).

results are show in table 3. we    nd that com-
bining the d-me, dmsm, and mid56 achieves a
1.6 id7 improvement over the d-me+dmsm.

3.5 human evaluation
because automatic metrics do not always corre-
late with human judgments (callison-burch et al.,
2006; hodosh et al., 2013), we also performed hu-
man evaluations using the same procedure as in
fang et al. (2015). here, human judges were pre-
sented with an image, a system generated caption,
and a human generated caption, and were asked
which caption was    better   .9 for each condition,
5 judgments were obtained for 1000 images from
the testval set.

8the mid56 does not produce a diverse n-best list.
9the captions were randomized and the users were not

informed which was which.

results are shown in table 4.

the d-
me+dmsm outperforms the mid56 by 5 per-
centage points for the    better or equal to hu-
man    judgment, despite both systems achieving
the same id7 score. the k-nearest neighbor
system performs 1.4 percentage points worse than
the mid56, despite achieving a slightly higher
id7 score. finally, the combined model does
not outperform the d-me+dmsm in terms of hu-
man judgments despite a 1.6 id7 improvement.
although we cannot pinpoint the exact reason
for this mismatch between automated scores and
human evaluation, a more detailed analysis of the
difference between systems is performed in sec-
tions 4 and 5.

4 language analysis

examples of common mistakes we observe on the
testval set are shown in table 5. the d-me system
has dif   culty with anaphora, particularly within
the phrase    on top of it   , as shown in examples
(1), (2), and (3). this is likely due to the fact that is
maintains a local context window. in contrast, the
mid56 approach tends to generate such anaphoric
relationships correctly.

however, the d-me lm maintains an explicit
coverage state vector tracking which attributes
have already been emitted. the mid56 implicitly
maintains the full state using its recurrent layer,
which sometimes results in multiple emission mis-
takes, where the same attribute is emitted more
than once. this is particularly evident when coor-
dination (   and   ) is present (examples (4) and (5)).

4.1 repeated captions
all of our models produce a large number of cap-
tions seen in the training and repeated for differ-
ent images in the test set, as shown in table 6
(also observed by vinyals et al. (2014) for their
lstm-based model). there are at least two po-
tential causes for this repetition.

first, the systems often produce generic cap-
tions such as    a close up of a plate of food   , which
may be applied to many publicly available im-
ages. this may suggest a deeper issue in the train-
ing and evaluation of our models, which warrants
more discussion in future work. second, although
the coco dataset and evaluation server10 has en-
couraged rapid progress in image captioning, there
may be a lack of diversity in the data. we also note
that although caption duplication is an issue in all
systems, it is a greater issue in the mid56 than the
d-me+dmsm.

image diversity

the strong performance of the k-nearest neighbor
algorithm and the large number of repeated cap-
tions produced by the systems here suggest a lack
of diversity in the training and test data.11

we believe that one reason to work on image
captioning is to be able to caption compositionally
novel images, where the individual components of
the image may be seen in the training, but the en-
tire composition is often not.

in order to evaluate results for only compo-
sitionally novel images, we bin the test images
based on visual overlap with the training data.
for each test image, we compute the fc7 cosine
similarity with each training image, and the mean
value of the 50 closest images. we then compute
id7 on the 20% least overlapping and 20% most

results are shown in table 7.

the d-
me+dmsm outperforms the k-nearest neighbor
approach by 2.5 id7 on the    20% least    set,
even though performance on the whole set is com-
parable. additionally, the d-me+dmsm out-
performs the mid56 by 2.1 id7 on the    20%
least    set, but performs 2.1 id7 worse on
the    20% most    set. this is evidence that d-
me+dmsm generalizes better on novel images
than the mid56; this is further supported by the
relatively low percentage of captions it gener-
ates seen in the training data (table 6) while still
achieving reasonable captioning performance. we
hypothesize that these are the main reasons for
the strong human evaluation results of the d-
me+dmsm shown in section 3.5.

6 conclusion
we have shown that a gated id56 conditioned di-
rectly on id98 activations (an mid56) achieves
better id7 performance than an me lm or
lstm conditioned on a set of discrete activations;
and a similar id7 performance to an me lm
combined with a dmsm. however, the me lm
+ dmsm method signi   cantly outperforms the
mid56 in terms of human quality judgments. we
hypothesize that this is partially due to the lack of
novelty in the captions produced by the mid56.
in fact, a k-nearest neighbor retrieval algorithm
introduced in this paper performs similarly to the
mid56 in terms of both automatic metrics and hu-
man judgements.

when we use the mid56 system alongside the
dmsm to provide additional scores in mert re-
ranking of the n-best produced by the image-
conditioned me lm, we advance by 1.6 id7
points on the best previously published results on
the coco dataset. unfortunately, this improve-
ment in id7 does not translate to improved hu-
man quality judgments.
