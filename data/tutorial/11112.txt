learning transformations for id91 and classification

   qiang qiu, guillermo sapiro; 16(feb):187   225, 2015.

abstract

   a low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace id91
   and classification is proposed here. many high- dimensional data, such
   as face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of
   low-dimensional subspaces. the corresponding subspace id91
   problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition
   such high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their
   underlying low- dimensional subspaces. low-dimensional intrinsic
   structures are often violated for real-world observations, as they can
   be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models. we propose to
   address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces using
   nuclear norm as the modeling and optimization criteria. the learned
   linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for data from the
   same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a maximally separated
   structure for data from different subspaces. in this way, we reduce
   variations within the subspaces, and increase separation between the
   subspaces for a more robust subspace id91. this proposed learned
   robust subspace id91 framework significantly enhances the
   performance of existing subspace id91 methods. basic theoretical
   results presented here help to further support the underlying
   framework. to exploit the low-rank structures of the transformed
   subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace id91 technique,
   which efficiently combines robust pca with sparse modeling. when class
   labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank
   transformation framework also significantly enhances classification
   performance. extensive experiments using public data sets are
   presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods for subspace id91 and classification.
   the learned low cost transform is also applicable to other
   classification frameworks.
