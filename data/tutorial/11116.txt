abstract

one long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are
applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent
dialogue agent. to measure progress towards that goal, we argue for the use-
fulness of a set of proxy tasks that evaluate reading comprehension via question
answering. our tasks measure understanding in several ways: whether a system is
able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many
more. the tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be
capable of conversing with a human. we believe many existing learning systems
can currently not solve them, and hence our aim is to classify these tasks into
skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their
systems. we also extend and improve the recently introduced memory networks
model, and show it is able to solve some, but not all, of the tasks.

introduction

there is a rich history of the use of synthetic tasks in machine learning, from the xor problem
which helped motivate neural networks (minsky & papert, 1969; rumelhart et al., 1985), to circle
and ring datasets that helped motivate some of the most well-known id91 and semi-supervised
learning algorithms (ng et al., 2002; zhu et al., 2003), mackey glass equations for time series
(m  uller et al., 1997), and so on     in fact some of the well known uci datasets (bache & lichman,
2013) are synthetic as well (e.g., waveform). recent work continues this trend. for example, in the
area of developing learning algorithms with a memory component synthetic datasets were used to
help develop both the id63 of graves et al. (2014) and the memory networks of
weston et al. (2014), the latter of which is relevant to this work.

one of the reasons for the interest in synthetic data is that it can be easier to develop new techniques
using it. it is well known that working with large amounts of real data (   big data   ) tends to lead
researchers to simpler models as    simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models
based on less data    (halevy et al., 2009). for example, n -grams for id38 work well
relative to existing competing methods, but are far from being a model that truly understands text.
as researchers we can become stuck in local minima in algorithm space; development of synthetic
data is one way to try and break out of that.

in this work we propose a framework and a set of synthetic tasks for the goal of helping to develop
learning algorithms for text understanding and reasoning. while it is relatively dif   cult to auto-
matically evaluate the performance of an agent in general dialogue     a long term-goal of ai     it is
relatively easy to evaluate responses to input questions, i.e., the task of id53 (qa).
id53 is incredibly broad: more or less any task one can think of can be cast into this
setup. this enables us to propose a wide ranging set of different tasks, that test different capabilities
of learning algorithms, under a common framework.

our tasks are built with a uni   ed underlying simulation of a physical world, akin to a classic text
adventure game (montfort, 2005) whereby actors move around manipulating objects and interacting

with each other. as the simulation runs, grounded text and question answer pairs are simultaneously
generated. our goal is to categorize different kinds of questions into skill sets, which become our
tasks. our hope is that the analysis of performance on these tasks will help expose weaknesses of
current models and help motivate new algorithm designs that alleviate these weaknesses. we further
envision this as a feedback loop where new tasks can then be designed in response, perhaps in an
adversarial fashion, in order to break the new models.

the tasks we design are detailed in section 3, and the simulation used to generate them in section 4.
in section 5 we give benchmark results of standard methods on our tasks, and analyse their successes
and failures. in order to exemplify the kind of feedback loop between algorithm development and
task development we envision, in section a we propose a set of improvements to the recent memory
network method, which has shown to give promising performance in qa. we show our proposed
approach does indeed give improved performance on some tasks, but is still unable to solve some of
them, which we consider as open problems.

2 related work

several projects targeting language understanding using qa-based strategies have recently emerged.
unlike tasks like dialogue or summarization, qa is easy to evaluate (especially in true/false or
multiple choice scenarios) and hence makes it an appealing research avenue. the dif   culty lies in
the de   nition of questions: they must be unambiguously answerable by adult humans (or children),
but still require some thinking. the allen institute for ai   s    agship project aristo1 is organized
around a collection of qa tasks derived from increasingly dif   cult science exams, at the 4th, 8th, and
12th grade levels. richardson et al. (2013) proposed the mctest2 a set of 660 stories and associated
questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. each question requires the
reader to understand different aspects of the story.

these two initiatives go in a promising direction but interpreting the results on these benchmarks
remain complicated. indeed, no system has yet been able to fully solve the proposed tasks and since
many sub-tasks need to be solved to answer any of their questions (coreference, deduction, use of
common-sense, etc.), it is dif   cult to clearly identify capabilities and limitations of these systems
and hence to propose improvements and modi   cations. as a result, conclusions drawn from these
projects are not much clearer than that coming from more traditional works on qa over large-scale
knowledge bases (berant et al., 2013; fader et al., 2014). besides, the best performing systems are
based on hand-crafted patterns and features, and/or statistics acquired on very large corpora. it is
dif   cult to argue that such systems actually understand language and are not simply light upgrades of
traditional information extraction methods (yao et al., 2014). the system of berant et al. (2014) is
more evolved since it builds a structured representation of a text and of a question to answer. despite
its potential this method remains highly domain speci   c and relies on a lot of prior knowledge.

based on these observations, we chose to conceive a collection of much simpler qa tasks, with
the main objective that failure or success of a system on any of them can unequivocally provide
feedback on its capabilities. in that, we are close to the winograd schema challenge levesque et al.
(2011), which is organized around simple statements followed by a single binary choice question
such as:    joan made sure to thank susan for all the help she had received. who had received the
help? joan or susan?   . in this challenge, and our tasks, it is straightforward to interpret results.
yet, where the winograd challenge is mostly centered around evaluating if systems can acquire
and make use of background knowledge that is not expressed in the words of the statement, our
tasks are self-contained and are more diverse. by self-contained we mean our tasks come with
both training data and evaluation data, rather than just the latter as in the case of aristo and the
winograd challenge. mctest has a train/test split but the training set is likely too small to capture
all the reasoning needed to do well on the test set.
in our setup one can assess the amount of
training examples needed to perform well (which can be increased as desired) and commonsense
knowledge and reasoning required for the test set should be contained in the training set. in terms of
diversity, some of our tasks are related to existing setups but we also propose many additional ones;
tasks 8 and 9 are inspired by previous work on lambda dependency-based id152
(liang et al., 2013; liang, 2013) for instance. for us, each task checks one skill that the system must

have and we postulate that performing well on all of them is a prerequisite for any system aiming at
full text understanding and reasoning.

3 the tasks

principles our main idea is to provide a set of tasks, in a similar way to how software testing
is built in computer science.
ideally each task is a    leaf    test case, as independent from oth-
ers as possible, and tests in the simplest way possible one aspect of intended behavior. subse-
quent (   non-leaf   ) tests can build on these by testing combinations as well. the tasks are pub-
licly available at http://fb.ai/babi. source code to generate the tasks is available at
https://github.com/facebook/babi-tasks.

each task provides a set of training and test data, with the intention that a successful model performs
well on test data. following weston et al. (2014), the supervision in the training set is given by the
true answers to questions, and the set of relevant statements for answering a given question, which
may or may not be used by the learner. we set up the tasks so that correct answers are limited to a
single word (q: where is mark? a: bathroom), or else a list of words (q: what is mark holding?)
as evaluation is then clear-cut, and is measured simply as right or wrong.

all of the tasks are noiseless and a human able to read that language can potentially achieve 100%
accuracy. we tried to choose tasks that are natural to a human: they are based on simple usual situ-
ations and no background in areas such as formal semantics, machine learning, logic or knowledge
representation is required for an adult to solve them.

the data itself is produced using a simple simulation of characters and objects moving around and
interacting in locations, described in section 4. the simulation allows us to generate data in many
different scenarios where the true labels are known by grounding to the simulation. for each task,
we describe it by giving a small sample of the dataset including statements, questions and the true
labels (in red) in tables 1 and 2.

single supporting fact task 1 consists of questions where a previously given single supporting
fact, potentially amongst a set of other irrelevant facts, provides the answer. we    rst test one of the
simplest cases of this, by asking for the location of a person, e.g.    mary travelled to the of   ce. where
is mary?   . this kind of task was already employed in weston et al. (2014). it can be considered the
simplest case of some real world qa datasets such as in fader et al. (2013).

two or three supporting facts a harder task is to answer questions where two supporting state-
ments have to be chained to answer the question, as in task 2, where to answer the question    where
is the football?    one has to combine information from two sentences    john is in the playground   
and    john picked up the football   . again, this kind of task was already used in weston et al. (2014).
similarly, one can make a task with three supporting facts, given in task 3, whereby the    rst three
statements are all required to answer the question    where was the apple before the kitchen?   .

two or three argument relations to answer questions the ability to differentiate and recognize
subjects and objects is crucial. in task 4 we consider the extreme case where sentences feature re-
ordered words, i.e. a bag-of-words will not work. for example, the questions    what is north of
the bedroom?    and    what is the bedroom north of?    have exactly the same words, but a different
order, with different answers. a step further, sometimes one needs to differentiate three separate
arguments. task 5 involves statements like    jeff was given the milk by bill    and then queries who
is the giver, receiver or which object is involved.

yes/no questions task 6 tests, on some of the simplest questions possible (speci   cally, ones with
a single supporting fact), the ability of a model to answer true/false type questions like    is john in
the playground?   .

counting and lists/sets task 7 tests the ability of the qa system to perform simple counting
operations, by asking about the number of objects with a certain property, e.g.    how many objects
is daniel holding?   . similarly, task 8 tests the ability to produce a set of single word answers in the
form of a list, e.g.    what is daniel holding?   . these tasks can be seen as qa tasks related to basic
database search operations.

table 1: sample statements and questions from tasks 1 to 10.

task 1: single supporting fact
mary went to the bathroom.
john moved to the hallway.
mary travelled to the of   ce.
where is mary? a:of   ce

task 2: two supporting facts

fred gave the cake to bill.
jeff was given the milk by bill.
who gave the cake to fred? a: mary
who did fred give the cake to? a: bill

task 6: yes/no questions
john moved to the playground.
daniel went to the bathroom.
john went back to the hallway.
is john in the playground? a:no
is daniel in the bathroom? a:yes

task 7: counting

how many objects is daniel holding? a: two

task 8: lists/sets
daniel picks up the football.
daniel drops the newspaper.
daniel picks up the milk.
john took the apple.
what is daniel holding? milk, football

task 9: simple negation
sandra travelled to the of   ce.
fred is no longer in the of   ce.
is fred in the of   ce? a:no
is sandra in the of   ce? a:yes

task 10: inde   nite knowledge
john is either in the classroom or the playground.
sandra is in the garden.
is john in the classroom? a:maybe
is john in the of   ce? a:no

simple negation and inde   nite knowledge tasks 9 and 10 test slightly more complex natural
language constructs. task 9 tests one of the simplest forms of negation, that of supporting facts that
imply a statement is false e.g.    fred is no longer in the of   ce    rather than    fred travelled to the
of   ce   . (in this case, task 6 (yes/no questions) is a prerequisite to the task.) task 10 tests if we
can model statements that describe possibilities rather than certainties, e.g.    john is either in the
classroom or the playground.   , where in that case the answer is    maybe    to the question    is john
in the classroom?   .

basic coreference, conjunctions and compound coreference task 11 tests the simplest type
of coreference, that of detecting the nearest referent, e.g.    daniel was in the kitchen. then he went
to the studio.   . real-world data typically addresses this as a labeling problem and studies more
sophisticated phenomena (soon et al., 2001), whereas we evaluate it as in all our other tasks as a
id53 problem. task 12 (conjunctions) tests referring to multiple subjects in a single
statement, e.g.    mary and jeff went to the kitchen.   . task 13 tests coreference in the case where
the pronoun can refer to multiple actors, e.g.    daniel and sandra journeyed to the of   ce. then they
went to the garden   .

time reasoning while our tasks so far have included time implicitly in the order of the state-
ments, task 14 tests understanding the use of time expressions within the statements, e.g.    in the
afternoon julie went to the park. yesterday julie was at school.   , followed by questions about the
order of events such as    where was julie before the park?   . real-world datasets address the task of
evaluating time expressions typically as a labeling, rather than a qa task, see e.g. uzzaman et al.
(2012).

basic deduction and induction task 15 tests basic deduction via inheritance of properties, e.g.
   sheep are afraid of wolves. gertrude is a sheep. what is gertrude afraid of?   . task 16 similarly

the bathroom is west of the bedroom.
the den is east of the hallway.
the of   ce is south of the bedroom.
how do you go from den to kitchen? a: west, north

task 20: agent   s motivations
john is hungry.
john goes to the kitchen.
john grabbed the apple there.
daniel is hungry.
where does daniel go? a:kitchen
why did john go to the kitchen? a:hungry

tests basic induction via inheritance of properties. a full analysis of induction and deduction is
clearly beyond the scope of this work, and future tasks should analyse further, deeper aspects.

positional and size reasoning task 17 tests spatial reasoning, one of many components of the
classical shrdlu system (winograd, 1972) by asking questions about the relative positions of
colored blocks. task 18 requires reasoning about the relative size of objects and is inspired by the
commonsense reasoning examples in the winograd schema challenge (levesque et al., 2011).

path finding the goal of task 19 is to    nd the path between locations: given the description
of various locations, it asks: how do you get from one to another? this is related to the work of
chen & mooney (2011) and effectively involves a search problem.

agent   s motivations finally, task 20 questions, in the simplest way possible, why an agent per-
forms an action. it addresses the case of actors being in a given state (hungry, thirsty, tired, . . . ) and
the actions they then take, e.g. it should learn that hungry people might go to the kitchen, and so on.

as already stated, these tasks are meant to foster the development and understanding of machine
learning algorithms. a single model should be evaluated across all the tasks (not tuning per task)
and then the same model should be tested on additional real-world tasks.

in our data release, in addition to providing the above 20 tasks in english, we also provide them
(i) in hindi; and (ii) with shuf   ed english words so they are no longer readable by humans. a
good learning algorithm should perform similarly on all three, which would likely not be the case
for a method using external resources, a setting intended to mimic a learner being    rst presented a
language and having to learn from scratch.

4 simulation

all our tasks are generated with a simulation which behaves like a classic text adventure game.
the idea is that generating text within this simulation allows us to ground the language used into
a coherent and controlled (arti   cial) world. our simulation follows those of bordes et al. (2010);
weston et al. (2014) but is somewhat more complex.

the simulated world is composed of entities of various types (locations, objects, persons. etc.) and
of various actions that operate on these entities. entities have internal states: their location, whether
they carry objects on top or inside them (e.g., tables and boxes), the mental state of actors (e.g.
hungry), as well as properties such as size, color, and edibility. for locations, the nearby places that
are connected (e.g. what lies to the east, or above) are encoded. for actors, a set of pre-speci   ed
rules per actor can also be speci   ed to control their behavior, e.g. if they are hungry they may try to
   nd food. random valid actions can also be executed if no rule is set, e.g. walking around randomly.

the actions an actor can execute in the simulation consist of the following: go <location>, get
<object>, get <object1> from <object2>, put <object1> in/on <object2>, give <object> to
<actor>, drop <object>, set <entitity> <state>, look, inventory and examine <object>. a set
of universal constraints is imposed on those actions to enforce coherence in the simulation. for
example an actor cannot get something that they or someone else already has, they cannot go to a
place that is not connected to the current location, cannot drop something they do not already have,
and so on. using the underlying actions, rules for actors, and their constraints, de   nes how actors
act. for each task we limit the actions needed for that task, e.g. task 1 only needs go whereas task 2
uses go, get and drop. if we write the commands down this gives us a very simple    story    which is
executable by the simulation, e.g., joe go playground; bob go of   ce; joe get football. this example
corresponds to task 2. the system can then ask questions about the state of the simulation e.g.,
where john?, where football? and so on. it is easy to calculate the true answers for these questions
as we have access to the underlying world.

to produce more natural looking text with lexical variety from statements and questions we employ a
simple automated grammar. each verb is assigned a set of synonyms, e.g., the simulation command
get is replaced with either picked up, got, grabbed or took, and drop is replaced with either dropped,
left, discarded or put down. similarly, each object and actor can have a set of replacement synonyms
as well, e.g. replacing daniel with he in task 11. adverbs are crucial for some tasks such as the time
reasoning task 14.

there are a great many aspects of language not yet modeled. for example, all sentences are so far
relatively short and contain little nesting. further, the entities and the vocabulary size is small (150
words, and typically 4 actors, 6 locations and 3 objects used per task). the hope is that de   ning a set
of well de   ned tasks will help evaluate models in a controlled way within the simulated environment,
which is hard to do with real data. that is, these tasks are not a substitute for real data, but should
complement them, especially when developing and analysing algorithms.

5 experiments

we compared the following methods on our tasks (on the english dataset):
(i) an n -
gram classi   er baseline, (ii) lstms (long short term memory recurrent neural networks)
(hochreiter & schmidhuber, 1997), (iii) memory networks (memnns) (weston et al., 2014), (iv)
some extensions of memory networks we will detail; and (v) a structured id166 that incorporates
external labeled data from existing nlp tasks. these models belong to three separate tracks. weakly
supervised models are only given question answer pairs at training time, whereas strong supervision
provides the set of supporting facts at training time (but not testing time) as well. strongly super-
vised ones give accuracy upper bounds for weakly supervised models, i.e. the performance should
be superior given the same model class. methods in the last external resources track can use labeled
data from other sources rather than just the training set provided, e.g. coreference and semantic role
labeling tasks, as well as strong supervision. for each task we use 1000 questions for training, and
1000 for testing, and report the test accuracy. we consider a task successfully passed if     95%
accuracy is obtained3.

3the choice of 95% (and 1000 training examples) is arbitrary.

table 3: test accuracy (%) on our 20 tasks for various methods (1000 training examples each). our proposed
extensions to memnns are in columns 5-9: with adaptive memory (am), id165s (ng), nonlinear matching
function (nl), and combinations thereof. bold numbers indicate tasks where our extensions achieve     95%
accuracy but the original memnn model of weston et al. (2014) did not. the last two columns (10-11) give
extra analysis of the memnn
method. column 10 gives the amount of training data for each task needed to
am + ng + nl
obtain     95% accuracy, or fail if this is not achievable with 1000 training examples. the    nal column gives
the accuracy when training on all data at once, rather than separately.

methods the n -gram classi   er baseline is inspired by the baselines in richardson et al. (2013)
but applied to the case of producing a 1-word answer rather than a multiple choice question: we
construct a bag-of-n -grams for all sentences in the story that share at least one word with the
question, and then learn a linear classi   er to predict the answer using those features4.
lstms are a popular method for sequence prediction (sutskever et al., 2014) and outperform stan-
dard id56s (recurrent neural networks) for tasks similar to ours (weston et al., 2014). they work
by reading the story until the point they reach a question and then have to output an answer. note that
they are weakly supervised by answers only, and are hence at a disadvantage compared to strongly
supervised methods or methods that use external resources.

memnns (weston et al., 2014) are a recently proposed class of models that have been shown to
perform well at qa. they work by a    controller    neural network performing id136 over the
stored memories that consist of the previous statements in the story. the original proposed model
performs 2 hops of id136:    nding the    rst supporting fact with the maximum match score with
the question, and then the second supporting fact with the maximum match score with both the
question and the    rst fact that was found. the matching function consists of mapping the bag-of-
words for the question and facts into an embedding space by summing id27s. the word
embeddings are learnt using strong supervision to optimize the qa task. after    nding supporting
facts, a    nal ranking is performed to rank possible responses (answer words) given those facts. we
also consider some extensions to this model:

    adaptive memories performing a variable number of hops rather than 2, the model is
trained to predict a hop or the special    stop    class. a similar procedure can be applied to
output multiple tokens as well.

4constructing id165s from all sentences rather than using the    ltered set gave worse results.

7

under review as a conference paper at iclr 2016

    id165s we tried using a bag of 3-grams rather than a bag-of-words to represent the text.

in both cases the    rst step of the memnn is to convert these into vectorial embeddings.

    nonlinearity we apply a classical 2-layer neural network with tanh nonlinearity in the

matching function.

more details of these variants is given in sec a of the appendix.

finally, we built a classical cascade nlp system baseline using a structured support vector ma-
chine (id166), which incorporates coreference resolution and id14 (srl) prepro-
cessing steps, which are themselves trained on large amounts of costly labeled data. the stanford
coreference system (raghunathan et al., 2010) and the senna id14 (srl) system
(collobert et al., 2011) are used to build features for the input to the id166, trained with strong super-
vision to    nd the supporting facts, e.g. features based on words, word pairs, and the srl verb and
verb-argument pairs. after    nding the supporting facts, we build a similar structured id166 for the
response stage, with features tuned for that goal as well. more details are in sec. b of the appendix.

learning rates and other hyperparameters for all methods are chosen using the training set. the
summary of our experimental results on the tasks is given in table 3. we give results for each of the
20 tasks separately, as well as mean performance and number of failed tasks in the    nal two rows.

results standard memnns generally outperform the n -gram and lstm baselines, which is con-
sistent with the results in weston et al. (2014). however they still    fail    at a number of tasks; that
is, test accuracy is less than 95%. some of these failures are expected due to insuf   cient modeling
power as described in more detail in sec. a.1, e.g. k = 2 facts, single word answers and bag-of-
words do not succeed on tasks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 18. however, there were also failures on tasks we did
not at    rst expect, for example yes/no questions (6) and inde   nite knowledge (10). given hindsight,
we realize that the linear scoring function of standard memnns cannot model the match between
query, supporting fact and a yes/no answer as this requires three-way interactions.

columns 5-9 of table 3 give the results for our memnn extensions: adaptive memories (am),
n -grams (ng) and nonlinearities (nl), plus combinations thereof. the adaptive approach gives a
straight-forward improvement in tasks 3 and 16 because they both require more than two supporting
facts, and also gives (small) improvements in 8 and 19 because they require multi-word outputs (but
still remain dif   cult). we hence use the am model in combination with all our other extensions in
the subsequent experiments.

memnns with n -gram modeling yield clear improvements when word order matters, e.g.
tasks
4 and 15. however, n -grams do not seem to be a substitute for nonlinearities in the embedding
function as the nl model outperforms n -grams on average, especially in the yes/no (6) and indef-
inite tasks (10), as explained before. on the other hand, the nl method cannot model word order
and so fails e.g., on task 4. the obvious step is thus to combine these complimentary approaches:
indeed am+ng+nl (column 9) gives improved results over both, with a total of 9 tasks that have
been upgraded from failure to success compared to the original memnn model.

the structured id166, despite having access to external resources, does not perform better, still fail-
ing at 9 tasks. it does perform better than vanilla memnns (without extensions) on tasks 6, 9 and
10 where the hand-built feature conjunctions capture the necessary nonlinearities. however, com-
pared to memnn (am+ng+nl) it seems to do signi   cantly worse on tasks requiring three (and
sometimes, two) supporting facts (e.g. tasks 3, 16 and 2) presumably as ranking over so many possi-
bilities introduces more mistakes. however, its non-greedy search does seem to help on other tasks,
such as path    nding (task 19) where search is very important. since it relies on external resources
speci   cally designed for english, it is unsure that it would perform as well on other languages, like
hindi, where such external resources might be of worse quality.

the    nal two columns (10-11) give further analysis of the am+ng+nl memnn method. the
second to last column (10) shows the minimum number of training examples required to achieve    
95% accuracy, or fail if this is not achieved with 1000 examples. this is important as it is not only
desirable to perform well on a task, but also using the fewest number of examples (to generalize
well, quickly). most succeeding tasks require 100-500 examples. task 8 requires 5000 examples
and 7 requires 10000, hence they are labeled as fail. the latter task can presumably be solved by
adding all the times an object is picked up, and subtracting the times it is dropped, which seems

8

under review as a conference paper at iclr 2016

possible for an memnn, but it does not do perfectly. two tasks, positional reasoning 17 and path
   nding 19 cannot be solved even with 10000 examples, it seems those (and indeed more advanced
forms of induction and deduction, which we plan to build) require a general search algorithm to be
built into the id136 procedure, which memnn (and the other approaches tried) are lacking.

the last column shows the performance of am+ng+nl memnns when training on all the tasks
jointly, rather than just on a single one. the performance is generally encouragingly similar, showing
such a model can learn many aspects of text understanding and reasoning simultaneously. the main
issues are that these models still fail on several of the tasks, and use a far stronger form of supervision
(using supporting facts) than is typically realistic.

6 discussion

a prerequisite set we developed a set of tasks that we believe are a prerequisite to full language
understanding and reasoning. while any learner that can solve these tasks is not necessarily close
to full reasoning, if a learner fails on any of our tasks then there are likely real-world tasks that it
will fail on too (i.e., real-world tasks that require the same kind of reasoning). even if the situations
and the language of the tasks are arti   cial, we believe that the mechanisms required to learn how to
solve them are part of the key towards text understanding and reasoning.

a    exible framework this set of tasks is not a de   nitive set. the purpose of a simulation-based
approach is to provide    exibility and control of the tasks    construction. we grounded the tasks into
language because it is then easier to understand the usefulness of the tasks and to interpret their
results. however, our primary goal is to    nd models able to learn to detect and combine patterns
in symbolic sequences. one might even want to decrease the intrinsic dif   culty by removing any
lexical variability and ambiguity and reason only over bare symbols, stripped down from their lin-
guistic meaning. one could also decorrelate the long-term memory from the reasoning capabilities
of systems by, for instance, arranging the supporting facts closer to the questions. in the opposing
view, one could instead want to transform the tasks into more realistic stories using annotators or
more complex grammars. the set of 20 tasks presented here is a subset of what can be achieved
with a simulation. we chose them because they offer a variety of skills that we would like a text
reasoning model to have, but we hope researchers from the community will develop more tasks of
varying complexity in order to develop and analyze models that try to solve them. id21
across tasks is also a very important goal, beyond the scope of this paper. we have thus made the
simulator and code for the tasks publicly available for those purposes.

testing learning methods our tasks are designed as a test-bed for learning methods: we provide
training and test sets because we intend to evaluate the capability of models to discover how to
reason from patterns hidden within them. it could be tempting to hand-code solutions for them or
to use existing large-scale qa systems like cyc (curtis et al., 2005). they might succeed at solving
them, even if our structured id166 results (a cascaded nlp system with hand-built features) show
that this is not straightforward; however this is not the tasks    purpose since those approaches would
not be learning to solve them. our experiments show that some existing machine learning methods
are successful on some of the tasks, in particular memory networks, for which we introduced some
useful extensions (in sec. a). however, those models still fail on several of the tasks, and use a far
stronger form of supervision (using supporting facts) than is typically realistic.

these datasets are not yet solved. future research should aim to minimize the amount of required
supervision, as well as the number of training examples needed to solve a new task, to move closer
to the task transfer capabilities of humans. that is, in the weakly supervised case with only 1000
training examples or less there is no known general (i.e. non-hand engineered) method that solves
the tasks. further, importantly, our hope is that a feedback loop of developing more challenging
tasks, and then algorithms that can solve them, leads us to fruitful research directions.

note that these tasks are not a substitute for real data, but should complement them, especially when
developing and analysing algorithms. there are many complementary real-world datasets, see for
example hermann et al. (2015); bordes et al. (2015); hill et al. (2015). that is, even if a method
works well on our 20 tasks, it should be shown to be useful on real data as well.

impact since being online, the babi tasks have already directly in   uenced the development
of several promising new algorithms, including weakly supervised end-to-end memory networks
(memn2n) of sukhbaatar et al. (2015), dynamic memory networks of kumar et al. (2015), and
the neural reasoner (peng et al., 2015). memn2n has since been shown to perform well on some
real-world tasks (hill et al., 2015).

a extensions to memory networks

memory networks weston et al. (2014) are a promising class of models, shown to perform well at
qa, that we can apply to our tasks. they consist of a memory m (an array of objects indexed by
mi) and four potentially learnable components i, g, o and r that are executed given an input:

i: (input feature map)     convert input sentence x to an internal feature representation i(x).
g: (generalization)     update the current memory state m given the new input: mi =

g(mi, i(x), m),    i.

o: (output feature map)     compute output o given the new input and the memory: o =

o(i(x), m).

r: (response)        nally, decode output features o to give the    nal textual response to the user:

r = r(o).

potentially, component i can make use of standard pre-processing, e.g., parsing and entity resolu-
tion, but the simplest form is to do no processing at all. the simplest form of g is store the new
incoming example in an empty memory slot, and leave the rest of the memory untouched. thus, in
weston et al. (2014) the actual implementation used is exactly this simple form, where the bulk of
the work is in the o and r components. the former is responsible for reading from memory and
performing id136, e.g., calculating what are the relevant memories to answer a question, and the
latter for producing the actual wording of the answer given o.
the o module produces output features by    nding k supporting memories given x. they use k = 2.
for k = 1 the highest scoring supporting memory is retrieved with:

o1 = o1(x, m) = arg max
i=1,...,n

so(x, mi)

(1)

where so is a function that scores the match between the pair of sentences x and mi. for the case
k = 2 they then    nd a second supporting memory given the    rst found in the previous iteration:

o2 = o2(q, m) = arg max
i=1,...,n

so([x, mo1], mi)

(2)

where the candidate supporting memory mi is now scored with respect to both the original input and
the    rst supporting memory, where square brackets denote a list. the    nal output o is [x, mo1, mo2],
which is input to the module r.
finally, r needs to produce a textual response r. while the authors also consider recurrent neural
networks (id56s), their standard setup limits responses to be a single word (out of all the words
seen by the model) by ranking them:

r = r(q, w) = argmaxw   w sr([x, mo1, mo2], w)

where w is the set of all words in the dictionary, and sr is a function that scores the match.
the scoring functions so and sr have the same form, that of an embedding model:

s(x, y) =   x(x)   u    u   y(y).

(3)

(4)

where u is a n    d matrix where d is the number of features and n is the embedding dimension.
the role of   x and   y is to map the original text to the d-dimensional feature space. they choose
a bag of words representation, and d = 3|w | for so, i.e., every word in the dictionary has three
different representations: one for   y(.) and two for   x(.) depending on whether the words of the
input arguments are from the actual input x or from the supporting memories so that they can be
modeled differently.

they consider various extensions of their model, in particular modeling write time and modeling
unseen words. here we only discuss the former which we also use. in order for the model to work
on qa tasks over stories it needs to know which order the sentences were uttered which is not
available in the model directly. they thus add extra write time extra features to so which take on
the value 0 or 1 indicating which sentence is older than another being compared, and compare triples
of pairs of sentences and the question itself. training is carried out by stochastic id119
using supervision from both the question answer pairs and the supporting memories (to select o1
and o2). see weston et al. (2014) for more details.

a.1 shortcomings of the existing memnns

the memory networks models de   ned in (weston et al., 2014) are one possible technique to try on
our tasks, however there are several tasks which they are likely to fail on:

    they model sentences with a bag of words so are likely to fail on tasks such as the 2-

argument (task 4) and 3-argument (task 5) relation problems.

    they perform only two max operations (k = 2) so they cannot handle questions involving

more than two supporting facts such as tasks 3 and 7.

    unless a id56 is employed in the r module, they are unable to provide multiple answers
in the standard setting using eq. (3). this is required for the list (8) and path    nding (19)
tasks.

we therefore propose improvements to their model in the following section.

a.2

improving memory networks

a.2.1 adaptive memories (and responses)

we consider a variable number of supporting facts that is automatically adapted dependent on the
question being asked. to do this we consider scoring a special fact m   . computation of supporting
memories then becomes:

i = 1
oi = o(x, m)
while oi 6= m    do

i     i + 1
oi = o([x, mo1 , . . . , moi   1 ], m)

end while

that is, we keep predicting supporting facts i, conditioning at each step on the previously found
facts, until m    is predicted at which point we stop. m    has its own unique embedding vector, which
is also learned. in practice we still impose a hard maximum number of loops in our experiments to
avoid fail cases where the computation never stops (in our experiments we use a limit of 10).

multiple answers we use a similar trick for the response module as well in order to output multi-
ple words. that is, we add a special word w    to the dictionary and predict word wi on each iteration
i conditional on the previous words, i.e., wi = r([x, mo1 , . . . , m|o|, wi, . . . , wi   1], w), until we
predict w   .

a.2.2 nonlinear sentence modeling

there are several ways of modeling sentences that go beyond a bag-of-words, and we explore three
variants here. the simplest is a bag-of-id165s, we consider n = 1, 2 and 3 in the bag. the main
disadvantage of such a method is that the dictionary grows rapidly with n . we therefore consider
an alternative neural network approach, which we call a multilinear map. each word in a sentence
is binned into one of psz positions with p(i, l) =    (ipsz)/l)    where i is the position of the word in
a sentence of length l, and for each position we employ a n    n matrix pp(i,l). we then model the
matching score with:

s(q, d) = e(q)    e(d); e(x) = tanh( x

pp(i,l)  x(xi)   u )

(5)

i=1,...,l

whereby we apply a linear map for each word dependent on its position, followed by a tanh non-
linearity on the sum of mappings. note that this is related to the model of (yu et al., 2014) who
consider tags rather than positions. while the results of this method are not shown in the main paper
due to space restrictions, it performs similarly well to n -grams to and may be useful in real-world
cases where n -grams cause the dictionary to be too large. comparing to table 3 memnn with
adaptive memories (am) + multilinear obtains a mean performance of 93, the same as memnns
with am+ng+nl (i.e., using id165s instead).

13

under review as a conference paper at iclr 2016

finally, to assess the performance of nonlinear maps that do not model word position at all we also
consider the following nonlinear embedding:

(6)
where w is a n    n matrix. this is similar to a classical two-layer neural network, but applied to
both sides q and d of s(q, d). we also consider the straight-forward combination of bag-of-n -grams
followed by this nonlinearity.

e(x) = tanh(w tanh(  x(x)   u )).

b baseline using external resources

we also built a classical cascade nlp system baseline using a structured id166, which incorpo-
rates coreference resolution and id14 preprocessing steps, which are themselves
trained on large amounts of costly labeled data. we    rst run the stanford coreference system
(raghunathan et al., 2010) on the stories and each mention is then replaced with the    rst mention of
its entity class. second, the senna id14 system (srl) (collobert et al., 2011) is
run, and we collect the set of arguments for each verb. we then de   ne a ranking task for    nding the
supporting facts (trained using strong supervision):

o1, o2, o3 = arg max

o   o

so(x, fo1, fo2, fo3;   )

where given the question x we    nd at most three supporting facts with indices oi from the set
of facts f in the story (we also consider selecting an    empty fact    for the case of less than
three), and so is a linear scoring function with parameters   . computing the argmax requires
doing exhaustive search, unlike e.g.
the memnn method which is greedy. for scalability, we
thus prune the set of possible matches by requiring that facts share one common non-determiner
word with each other match or with x. so is constructed as a set of indicator features. for
simplicity each of the features only looks at pairs of sentences, i.e. so(x, fo1, fo2, fo3;   ) =
       (g(x, fo1 ), g(x, fo2), g(x, fo3 ), g(fo1, fo2), g(fo2, fo3), g(fo1, fo3)). the feature function g is
made up of the following feature types, shown here for g(fo1, fo2): (1) word pairs: one indicator
variable for each pair of words in fo1 and fo2. (2) pair distance: indicator for the distance between
the sentence, i.e. o1     o2. (3) pair order: indicator for the order of the sentence, i.e. o1 > o2. (4)
srl verb pair: indicator variables for each pair of srl verbs in fo1 and fo2. (5) srl verb-arg
pair: indicator variables for each pair of srl arguments in fo1, fo2 and their corresponding verbs.
after    nding the supporting facts, we build a similar structured id166 for the response stage, also
with features tuned for that goal: words     indicator for each word in x, word pairs     indicator for
each pair of words in x and supporting facts, and similar srl verb and srl verb-arg pair features
as before.

results are given in table 3. the structured id166, despite having access to external resources, does
not perform better than memnns overall, still failing at 9 tasks.
it does perform well on tasks
6, 9 and 10where the hand-built feature conjunctions capture the necessary nonlinearities that the
original memnns do not. however, it seems to do signi   cantly worse on tasks requiring three
(and sometimes, two) supporting facts (e.g. tasks 3, 16 and 2) presumably as ranking over so many
possibilities introduces more mistakes. however, its non-greedy search does seem to help on other
tasks, such as path    nding (task 19) where search is very important.
