abstract

   textual id136 is an important component in many applications for
   understanding natural language. classical approaches to textual
   id136 rely on logical representations for meaning, which may be
   regarded as "external" to the natural language itself. however,
   practical applications usually adopt shallower lexical or
   lexical-syntactic representations, which correspond closely to language
   structure. in many cases, such approaches lack a principled meaning
   representation and id136 framework. we describe an id136
   formalism that operates directly on language-based structures,
   particularly syntactic parse trees. new trees are generated by applying
   id136 rules, which provide a unified representation for varying
   types of id136s. we use manual and automatic methods to generate
   these rules, which cover generic linguistic structures as well as
   specific lexical-based id136s. we also present a novel packed
   data-structure and a corresponding id136 algorithm that allows
   efficient implementation of this formalism. we proved the correctness
   of the new algorithm and established its efficiency analytically and
   empirically. the utility of our approach was illustrated on two tasks:
   unsupervised id36 from a large corpus, and the
   recognizing id123 (rte) benchmarks.
