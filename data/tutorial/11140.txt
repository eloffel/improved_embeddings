abstract

   as empirically demonstrated by the id51 (wsd)
   tasks of the last senseval/semeval exercises, assigning the appropriate
   meaning to words in context has resisted all attempts to be
   successfully addressed. many authors argue that one possible reason
   could be the use of inappropriate sets of word meanings. in particular,
   id138 has been used as a de-facto standard repository of word
   meanings in most of these tasks. thus, instead of using the word senses
   defined in id138, some approaches have derived semantic classes
   representing groups of word senses. however, the meanings represented
   by id138 have been only used for wsd at a very fine-grained sense
   level or at a very coarse-grained semantic class level (also called
   supersenses). we suspect that an appropriate level of abstraction could
   be on between both levels. the contributions of this paper are
   manifold. first, we propose a simple method to automatically derive
   semantic classes at intermediate levels of abstraction covering all
   nominal and verbal id138 meanings. second, we empirically demonstrate
   that our automatically derived semantic classes outperform classical
   approaches based on word senses and more coarse-grained sense
   groupings. third, we also demonstrate that our supervised wsd system
   benefits from using these new semantic classes as additional semantic
   features while reducing the amount of training examples. finally, we
   also demonstrate the robustness of our supervised semantic class-based
   wsd system when tested on out of domain corpus.
