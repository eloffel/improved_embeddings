abstract
in the last few years thousands of scienti   c papers have in-
vestigated id31, several startups that measure
opinions on real data have emerged and a number of inno-
vative products related to this theme have been developed.
there are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, inclu-
ding lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods.
despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity
of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for iden-
tifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message.
accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough
apple-to-apple comparison of id31 methods, as
they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated
from different data sources. such a comparison is key for
understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and di-
sadvantages of popular methods. this article aims at    lling
this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-
four popular id31 methods (which we call the
state-of-the-practice methods). our evaluation is based on a
benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages
posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as
well as opinions and comments in news articles. our results
highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of
these methods varies considerably across datasets. aiming at
boosting the development of this research area, we open the
methods    codes and datasets used in this article, deploying
them in a benchmark system, which provides an open api for
accessing and comparing sentence-level id31
methods.

introduction
id31 has become an extremely popular tool, ap-
plied in several analytical domains, especially on the web and
social media. to illustrate the growth of interest in the    eld,
figure 1 shows the steady growth on the number of searches
on the topic, according to google trends1, mainly after the
popularization of online social networks (osns). more than
7,000 articles have been written about id31 and
various startups are developing tools and strategies to extract
sentiments from text [20].
the number of possible applications of such a technique is
also considerable. many of them are focused on monitoring
the reputation or opinion of a company or a brand with the
analysis of reviews of consumer products or services [27].
id31 can also provide analytical perspectives
for    nancial investors who want to discover and respond to
market opinions [46, 8]. another important set of applicati-
ons is in politics, where marketing campaigns are interested
in tracking sentiments expressed by voters associated with
candidates [67].

analysis   .

due to the enormous interest and applicability, there has been
a corresponding increase in the number of proposed sentiment
analysis methods in the last years. the proposed methods rely
on many different techniques from different computer science
   elds. some of them employ machine learning methods that

20analysis

often rely on supervised classi   cation approaches, requiring
labeled data to train classi   ers [48]. others are lexical-based
methods that make use of prede   ned lists of words, in which
each word is associated with a speci   c sentiment. the lexical
methods vary according to the context in which they were
created. for instance, liwc [64] was originally proposed to
analyze sentiment patterns in formally written english texts,
whereas panas-t [25] and poms-ex [9] were proposed as
psychometric scales adapted to the web context.
overall, the above techniques are acceptable by the research
community and it is common to see concurrent important
papers, sometimes published in the same computer science
conference, using completely different methods. for example,
the famous facebook experiment [33] which manipulated
users feeds to study emotional contagion, used liwc [64].
concurrently, reis et al. used sentistrength [65] to measure
the negativeness or positiveness of online news headlines [53,
52], whereas tamersoy [62] explored vader   s lexicon [28]
to study patterns of smoking and drinking abstinence in social
media.
as the state-of-the-art has not been clearly established, resear-
chers tend to accept any popular method as a valid methodo-
logy to measure sentiments. however, little is known about the
relative performance of the several existing id31
methods. in fact, most of the newly proposed methods are
rarely compared with all other pre-existing ones using a large
number of existing datasets. this is a very unusual situation
from a scienti   c perspective, in which benchmark compari-
sons are the rule. in fact, most applications and experiments
reported in the literature make use of previously developed
methods exactly how they were released with no changes and
adaptations and with none or almost none parameter setting.
in other words, the methods have been used as a black-box,
without a deeper investigation on their suitability to a particular
context or application.
to sum up, existing methods have been widely deployed for
developing applications without a deeper understanding regar-
ding their applicability in different contexts or their advanta-
ges, disadvantages, and limitations in comparison with each
another. thus, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough
apple-to-apple comparison of id31 methods, as
they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated
from different data sources.
this state-of-the-practice situation is what we propose to inves-
tigate in this article. we do this by providing a thorough bench-
mark comparison of twenty-four state-of-the-practice methods
using eighteen labeled datasets. in particular, given the recent
popularity of online social networks and of short texts on the
web, many methods are focused in detecting sentiments at
the sentence-level, usually used to measure the sentiment of
small sets of sentences in which the topic is known a priori.
we focus on such context     thus, our datasets cover messa-
ges posted on social networks, movie and product reviews,
and opinions and comments in news articles, ted talks, and
blogs. we survey an extensive literature on id31
to identify existing sentence-level methods covering several
different techniques. we contacted authors asking for their

codes when available or we implemented existing methods
when they were unavailable but could be reproduced based on
their descriptions in the original published paper. we should
emphasize that our work focus on off-the-shelf methods as
they are used in practice. this excludes most of the supervised
methods which require labeled sets for training, as these are
usually not available for practitioners. moreover, most of the
supervised solutions do not share the source code or a trained
model to be used with no supervision.
our experimental results unveil a number of important    n-
dings. first, we show that there is no single method that
always achieves the best prediction performance for all dif-
ferent datasets, a result consistent with the    there is no free
lunch theorem    [74]. we also show that existing methods vary
widely regarding their agreement, even across similar datasets.
this suggests that the same content could be interpreted very
differently depending on the choice of a sentiment method.
we noted that most methods are more accurate in correctly
classifying positive than negative text, suggesting that current
approaches tend to be biased in their analysis towards positi-
vity. finally, we quantify the relative prediction performance
of existing efforts in the    eld across different types of datasets,
identifying those with higher prediction performance across
different datasets.
based on these observations, our    nal contribution consists
on releasing our gold standard dataset and the codes of the
compared methods2. we also created a web system through
which we allow other researchers to easily use our data and
codes to compare results with the existing methods 3. more
importantly, by using our system one could easily test which
method would be the most suitable to a particular dataset
and/or application. we hope that our tool will not only help
researchers and practitioners for accessing and comparing a
wide range of id31 techniques, but can also help
towards the development of this research    eld as a whole.
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in section
2, we brie   y describe related efforts. then, in section 3 we
describe the id31 methods we compare. section
4 presents the gold standard data used for comparison. section
5 summarizes our results and    ndings. finally, section 6
concludes the article and discusses directions for future work.

background and related work
next we discuss important de   nitions and justify the focus of
our benchmark comparison. we also brie   y survey existing
related efforts that compare id31 methods.

focus on sentence-level id31
since id31 can be applied to different tasks, we
restrict our focus on comparing those efforts related to de-
tect the polarity (i.e. positivity or negativity) of a given short
text (i.e. sentence-level). polarity detection is a common
function across all sentiment methods considered in our work,

2except for paid methods

providing valuable information to a number of different appli-
cations, specially those that explore short messages that are
commonly available in social media [20].
sentence-level id31 can be performed with su-
pervision (i.e. requiring labeled training data) or not. an
advantage of supervised methods is their ability to adapt and
create trained models for speci   c purposes and contexts. a
drawback is the need of labeled data, which might be highly
costly, or even prohibitive, for some tasks. on the other hand,
the lexical-based methods make use of a pre-de   ned list of
words, where each word is associated with a speci   c senti-
ment. the lexical methods vary according to the context in
which they were created. for instance, liwc [64] was origi-
nally proposed to analyze sentiment patterns in english texts,
whereas panas-t [25] and poms-ex [9] are psychometric
scales adapted to the web context. although lexical-based
methods do not rely on labeled data, it is hard to create a
unique lexical-based dictionary to be used for all different
contexts.
we focus our effort on evaluating unsupervised efforts as
they can be easily deployed in web services and applicati-
ons without the need of human labeling or any other type of
manual intervention. as described in section 3, some of the
methods we consider have used machine learning to build
lexicon dictionaries or even to build models and tune speci   c
parameters. we incorporate those methods in our study, since
they have been released as black-box tools that can be used in
an unsupervised manner.

existing efforts on comparison of methods
despite the large number of existing methods, only a limited
number of them have performed a comparison among senti-
ment analysis methods, usually with restricted datasets. ove-
rall, lexical methods and machine learning approaches have
been evolving in parallel in the last years, and it comes as no
surprise that studies have started to compare their performance
on speci   c datasets and use one or another strategy as baseline
for comparison. a recent survey summarizes several of these
efforts [66] and conclude that a systematic comparative study
that implements and evaluates all relevant algorithms under
the same framework is still missing in the literature. as new
methods emerge and compare themselves only against one, at
most two other methods, using different evaluation datasets
and experimental methodologies, it is hard to conclude if a
single method triumphs over the remaining ones, or even in
speci   c scenarios. to the best of our knowledge, our effort
is the    rst of kind to create a benchmark that provides such
thorough comparison.
an important effort worth mentioning consists of an annual
workshop     the international workshop on semantic evalu-
ation (semeval). it consists of a series of exercises grouped
in tracks, including id31, text similarity, among
others, that put several together competitors against each other.
some new methods such as umigon [35] have been proposed
after obtaining good results on some of these tracks. although,
semeval has been playing an important role for identifying
relevant methods, it requires authors to register for the chal-
lenge and many popular methods have not been evaluated in

these exercises. additionally, semeval labeled datasets are
usually focused on one speci   c type of data, such as tweets,
and do not represent a wide range of social media data. in our
evaluation effort, we consider one dataset from semeval 2013
and two methods that participated in the competition in that
same year.
ahmadi et al. [1] performed a comparision of twitter-based
id31 tools. they selected twenty tools and tested
them across    ve twitter datasets. this benchmark is the work
that most approximate from ours, but it is different in some
meaningful aspects. firstly, we embraced distinct contexts
such as reviews, comments and social networks aiming at pro-
viding a broader evaluation of the tools. secondly, the methods
they selected included supervised and unsupervised approa-
ches which, in our view, could be unfair for the unsupervised
ones. although the results have been presented separately,
the supervised methods, as mentioned by authors, required
extensive parameter tuning and validation in a training environ-
ment. therefore, supervised approaches tend to adapt to the
context they were applied to. as previously highlighted, our
focus is on off-the-shelf tools as they have been extensively
and recently used. many researchers and practitioners have
also used supervised approaches but this is out of scope of
our work. finally, most of the unsupervised methods selected
in the twitter benchmark are paid tools, except from two of
them, both of which were developed as a result of published
academic research. oppositely we made an extensive biblio-
graphy review to include relevant academic outcomes without
excluding the most used commercial options.
finally, in a previous effort [24], we compared eight sentence-
level id31 methods, based on one public dataset
used to evaluate sentistrength [65]. this article largely ex-
tends our previous work by comparing a much larger set of
methods across many different datasets, providing a much
deeper benchmark evaluation of current popular sentiment
analysis methods. the methods used in this paper were also
incorporated as part of an existing system, namely ifeel [4].

id31 methods
this section provides a brief description of the twenty-four
sentence-level id31 methods investigated in this
article. our effort to identify important sentence-level senti-
ment analysis methods consisted of systematically search for
them in the main conferences in the    eld and then checking for
papers that cited them as well as their own references. some
of the methods are available for download on the web; others
were kindly shared by their authors under request; and a small
part of them were implemented by us based on their descripti-
ons in the original paper. this usually happened when authors
shared only the lexical dictionaries they created, letting the
implementation of the method that use the lexical resource to
ourselves.
table 1 and table 2 present an overview of these methods, pro-
viding a description of each method as well as the techniques
they employ (l for lexicon dictionary and ml for machine
learning), their outputs (e.g. -1,0,1, meaning negative, neutral,
and positive, respectively), the datasets they used to validate,
the baseline methods used for comparison and    nally lexicon

details, as well as the lexicon size column describing the num-
ber of terms contained in the method   s lexicon. the methods
are organized in chronological order to allow a better over-
view of the existing efforts over the years. we can note that
the methods generate different outputs formats. we colored
in blue the positive outputs, in black the neutral ones, and
in red those that are negative. note that we included liwc
and liwc15 entries in table 2, which represents the former
version, launched in 2007, and the latest version, from 2015,
respectively. we considered both versions because the    rst
one was extensively used in the literature. this also allows to
compare the improvements between both versions.

adapting lexicons for the sentence level task
since we are comparing id31 methods on a
sentence-level basis, we need to work with mechanisms that
are able to receive sentences as input and produce polarities
as output. some of the approaches considered in this paper,
shown in table 2, are complex dictionaries built with great
effort. however, a lexicon alone has no natural ability to infer
polarity in sentence level tasks. the purpose of a lexicon goes
beyond the detection of polarity of a sentence [20, 37], but it
can also be used with that purpose [23, 32].
several existing sentence-level id31 methods,
like vader [28] and so-cal [61], combine a lexicon and
the processing of the sentence characteristics to determine a
sentence polarity. these approaches make use of a series of
intensi   ers, punctuation transformation, emoticons, and many
other heuristics.
thus, to evaluate each lexicon dictionaries as the basis for a
sentence-level id31 method, we considered the
vader   s implementation. in other words, we used vader   s
code for determining if a sentence is positive or not conside-
ring different lexicons. the reasons for choosing vader are
twofold: (i) the fact it is an open source tool, allowing easy re-
plication of the procedures we performed in our study; and (ii)
vader   s expressive results observed in previous experiments.
vader   s heuristics were proposed based on qualitative analy-
ses of textual properties and characteristics which affect the
perceived sentiment intensity of the text. vader   s author
identi   ed    ve heuristics based on grammatical and syntactical
cues to convey changes to sentiment intensity that go beyond
the bag-of-words model. the heuristics include treatments
for: 1) punctuation (e.g number of    !   s); 2) capitalization (e.g
   i hate you   is more intense than    i hate you   ); 3) degree
modi   ers (e.g    the service here is extremely good   is more
intense than    the service here is good   ); 4) constructive con-
junction    but   to shift the polarity; 5) tri-gram examination
to identify negation (e.g    the food here isn   t really all that
great.   ). we choose vader as a basis for such heuristics
as it is one of the most recent methods among those we con-
sidered. moreover, it is becoming widely used, being even
implemented as part of the well-known nltk python library4.
we applied such heuristics to the following lexicons:
anew sub, afinn, emolex, emoticonsds, nrc hash-
tag, opinion lexicon, panas-t, sentiment 140 lexicon and
4http://www.nltk.org/ modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html

sentiid138. we notice that those strategies drastically im-
proved most of the results of the lexicons for sentence-level
id31 in comparison with a simple baseline ap-
proach that averages the occurrence of positive and negative
words to classify the polarity of a sentence. the results for
the simplest usage of the above lexicons as plain methods are
available in the last four tables in the additional file 1 of the
electronic version of the manuscript. liwc dictionary was
not included in these adaptations due to its very restrictive
license, which does not allow any derivative work based on
the original application and lexicon. table 2 has also a column
(lexicon size) that describes the number of terms contained in
the the proposed dictionary.

output adaptations
it is worth noticing that the output of each method varies
drastically depending on the goal it was developed for and the
approach it employs. panas-t, for instance, associates each
word with eleven moods as described in table 1 and it was
designed to track any increase or decrease in sentiments over
time. emolex lexicon provides the association of each word
with eight sentiments. the word    unhappy    for example is
related to anger, disgust, and sadness and it is not related to joy,
surprise, etc. sentiid138 links each word with a synset (i.e.
a set of synonyms) characterized by a positive and a negative
score, both of them represented with a value between 0 and 1.
the aforementioned lexicons were used as dictionary input
to vader   s code. we had to adapt the way the words are
processed as follows. for panas-t we assumed that joviality,
assurance, serenity, and surprise are positive affect. fear, sad-
ness, guilt, hostility, shyness, and fatigue are negative affect.
attentiveness was considered neutral. in the case of emolex,
we considered two other entries released by the authors. the
   rst one de   nes the positiviy of a word (0 or 1) and the second
characterizes the negativity (0 or 1). for sentiid138 we cal-
culate an overall score to the word by subtracting the positive
value from negative value de   ned to that word. for example,
the positive value for the word faithful is 0.625 while its nega-
tive score is 0.0. then the overall score score is 0.625. finally,
for anew sub we employed only the valence emotion of
each word. this metric ranges from 1 to 9 and indicates the
level of pleasantness of a speci   c word     we considered the
values one to four as negative,    ve as neutral, and six to nine
as positive.
other lexicons included in our evaluation already provide po-
sitive and negative scores such as sentiid138 or an overall
score ranging from a negative to a positive value. after ap-
plying vader   s heuristics for each one of these lexicons we
get scores in the same way vader   s output (see table 2).
other methods also required some output handling. the availa-
ble implementation of opinionfinder 5, for instance, generates
polarity outputs (-1,0, or 1) for each sentiment clue found in
a sentence so that a single sentence can have more than one
clue. we considered the polarity of a single sentence as the
sum of the polarities of all the clues.

construction of a lexical resource for opinion mining based on id138 [38]. the authors grouped adjectives, nouns,

etc in synonym sets (synsets) and associated three polarity scores (positive, negative and neutral) for each one.
an acronym for linguistic inquiry and word count, liwc is a text analysis paid tool to evaluate emotional,

cognitive, and structural components of a given text. it uses a dictionary with words classi   ed into categories (anxiety,

health, leisure, etc). an updated version was launched in 2015.

sentiment140 (previously known as    twitter sentiment   ) was proposed as an ensemble of three classi   ers (naive
bayes, maximum id178, and id166) built with a huge amount of tweets containing emoticons collected by the

authors. it has been improved and transformed into a paid tool.

uses id84 to infer the polarity of common sense concepts and hence provide a resource for

mining opinions from text at a semantic, rather than just syntactic level.

builds a twitter based sentiment lexicon including internet slangs and obscene words. afinn can be considered as
an expansion of anew [10], a dictionary created to provides emotional ratings for english words. anew dictionary

rates words in terms of pleasure, arousal and dominance.

calculates its strong of associaton with that emotion.

python programming package (toolkit) to deal with nlp, web mining and id31. id31 is

provided through averaging scores from adjectives in the sentence according to a bundle lexicon of adjective.

detects public sentiments on twitter during the 2012 u.s. presidential election. it is based on the statistical model

obtained from the classi   er na    ve bayes on unigram features. it also explores emoticons and exclamations.

detects mood    uctuations of users on twitter. the method consists of an adapted version (panas) positive affect
negative affect scale [70], well-known method in psychology with a large set of words, each of them associated with

one from eleven moods such as surprise, fear, guilt, etc .

builds a general sentiment lexicon id104 supported. each entry lists the association of a token with 8 basic

sentiments: joy, sadness, anger, etc de   ned by [51]. proposed lexicon includes unigrams and bigrams from

macquarie thesaurus and also words from gi and id138.

output in a nearest neighbor (nn) model that provides multimedia recommendations over ted talks.

a lexicon dictionary based on the same dataset used to train the sentiment140 method. the lexicon was built in a
similar way to [39] but authors used the occurrency of emoticons to classify the tweet as positive or negative. then,

the id165 score was calculated based on the frequency of occurrence in each class of tweets.

builds a lexicon dictionary annotated by humans and improved with the use of machine learning.

proposes a model called recursive neural tensor network (rntn) that processes all sentences dealing with their

structures and compute the interactions between them. this approach is interesting since rntn take into account the

order of words in a sentence, which is ignored in most of methods.

another extension of the anew dictionary [10] including the most common words from the subtlexus corpus [11].

subtlexus was an effort to propose a different manner to calculate word frequencies considering    lm and tv

subtitles.

it is a human-validated id31 method developed for twitter and social media contexts. vader was

created from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon.

it is a paid tool that employs multi-level analysis of sentences. basically it has four levels: part of speech, assignment
of previous scores from dictionaries, application of intensi   ers and    nally machine learning techniques to delivery a

   nal weight to the sentence.

puts indicating one of three desired classes while stanford
recursive deep model yields very negative and very positive
which in our experiments are handled as negative and positive,
respectively.

paid softwares
seven out of the twenty-four methods evaluated in this work
are closed paid softwares: liwc (2007 and 2015), semantria,
senticnet 3.0, sentiment140 and sentistrength. although
sentistrength is paid, it has a free of charge academic license.
senticnet   s authors kindly processed all datasets with the com-
mercial version and return the polarities for us. for sentis-
trenght we used the java version from may 2013 in a package
with all features of the commercial version. for liwc we ac-
quired the licenses from 2007 (liwc07) and 2015 (liwc15)
versions. finally, for semantria and sentiment140 we used a
trial account free of charge for a limited number of sentences,
which was suf   cient to run our experiments.

methods not included
despite our effort to include in our comparison most of the
highly cited and important methods we could not include a
few of them for different reasons. pro   le of mood states
(poms-ex) [9] is not available on the web or under request
and could not be re-implemented based on their descriptions
in the original papers. the same situation occurs with the
learning sentiment-speci   c id27 for twitter
sentiment classi   cation [63]. nrc id166 [42] is not available
as well, although the lexical resources used by the authors are
available and were considered in our evaluation resulting in the
methods: nrc hashtag and sentiment140. the authors of the
convolutional neural network for modeling sentences [31]
and of the effective use of word order for text categorization
with convolutional neural networks [30] have made their
source code available but the    rst one lacks the train    les
and the second one requires a gpu to execute. there are a
few other methods for sentiment detection proposed in the
literature and not considered here. most of them consists of
variations of the techniques used by the above methods, such
as id138-affect[68] and happiness index [18].

datasets and comparison among methods
from table 2 we can note that the validation strategy, the
datasets used, and the comparison with baselines performed
by these methods vary greatly, from toy examples to large
labeled datasets. panas-t and emoticons ds used manually
unlabeled twitter data to validate their methods, by presenting
evaluations of events in which some bias towards positivity
and negativity would be expected. panas-t is tested with
unlabeled twitter data related to michael jackson   s death and
the release of a harry potter movie whereas emoticons ds
veri   ed the in   uence of weather and time on the aggregate
sentiment from twitter. lexical dictionaries were validated

in very different ways. afinn[45] compared its lexicon
with other dictionaries. emoticon distance supervised [26]
used pearson correlation between human labeling and the
predicted value. sentiid138 [19] validates the proposed
dictionary with comparisons with other dictionaries, but it also
used human validation of the proposed lexicon. these efforts
attempt to validate the created lexicon, without comparing the
lexicon as a id31 method by itself. vader [28]
compared results with lexical approaches considering labeled
datasets from different social media data. senticnet [13] was
compared with sentistrength [65] with a speci   c dataset re-
lated to patient opinions, which could not be made available.
stanford recursive deep model [56] and sentistrength [65]
were both compared with standard machine learning approa-
ches, with their own datasets.
this scenario, where every new developed solution compares
itself with different solutions using different datasets, happens
because there is no standard benchmark for evaluating new
methods. this problem is exacerbated because many methods
have been proposed in different research communities (e.g.
nlp, information science, information retrieval, machine le-
arning), exploiting different techniques, with low knowledge
about related efforts in other communities. next, we describe
how we created a large gold standard to properly compare all
the considered id31 methods.

gold standard data
a key aspect in evaluating id31 methods consists
of using accurate gold standard labeled datasets. several exis-
ting efforts have generated labeled data produced by experts
or non-experts evaluators. previous studies suggest that both
efforts are valid as non-expert labeling may be as effective
as annotations produced by experts for affect recognition, a
very related task [55]. thus, our effort to build a large and
representative gold standard dataset consists of obtaining labe-
led data from trustful previous efforts that cover a wide range
of sources and kinds of data. we also attempt to assess the
   quality    of our gold standard in terms of the accuracy of the
labeling process.
table 3 summarizes the main characteristics of the eighteen ex-
ploited datasets, such as number of messages and the average
number of words per message in each dataset. it also de   nes
a simpler nomenclature that is used in the remainder of this
paper. the table also presents the methodology employed in
the classi   cation. human labeling was implemented in almost
all datasets, usually done with the use of non-expert reviewers.
reviews i dataset relies on    ve stars rates, in which users
rate and provide a comment about an entity of interest (e.g. a
movie or an establishment).
labeling based on amazon mechanical turk (amt) was used
in seven out of the eighteen datasets, while volunteers and
other strategies that involve non-expert evaluators were used
in ten datasets. usually, an agreement strategy (i.e. majority
voting) is applied to ensure that, in the end, each sentence
has an agreed-upon polarity assigned to it. the number of
annotators used to build the datasets is also shown in table 3.

tweets dbt was the unique dataset built with a combination
of amt labeling with expert validation [16]. they selected
200 random tweets to be classi   ed by experts and compared
with amt results to ensure accurate ratings. we note that
the tweets semeval dataset was provided as a list of twitter
ids, due to the twitter policies related to data sharing. while
crawling the respective tweets, a small part of them could not
be accessed, as they were deleted. we plan to release all gold
standard datasets in a request basis, which is in agreement
with twitter policies.
in order to assess the extent to which these datasets are trustful,
we used a strategy similar to the one used by tweets dbt.
our goal was not to redo all the performed human evaluation,
but simply inspecting a small sample of them to infer the level
of agreement with our own evaluation. we randomly select
1% of all sentences to be evaluated by experts (two of the
authors) as an attempt to assess if these gold standard data are
really trustful. it is important to mention that we did not have
access to the instructions provided by the authors. we also
could not get access to small amount of the raw data in a few
datasets, which was discarded. finally, our manual inspection
unveiled a few sentences in idioms other than english in a few
datasets, such as tweets sta and ted, which were obviously
discarded.
column ck from table 3 exhibits the level of agreement of
each dataset in our evaluation by means of cohen   s kappa,
an extensively used metric to calculate inter-anotator agree-
ment. after a close look in the cases of disagreement with
the evaluations in the gold standard, we realized that other
interpretations could be possible for the given text,    nding
cases of sentences with mixed polarity. some of them are
strongly linked to original context and are very hard to evalu-
ate. some nyt comments, for instance, are directly related to
the news they were inserted to. we can also note that some of
the datasets do not contain neutral messages. this might be
a characteristic of the data or even a result of how annotators
were instructed to label their pieces of text. most of the cases
of disagreement involve neutral messages. thus, we conside-
red these cases, as well as the amount of disagreement we had

with the gold standard data, reasonable and expected, specially
when taking into account that landis and koch [34] suggest
that kappa values between 0.4 and 0.6 indicate moderate agre-
ement and values amid 0.60 and 0.8 correspond to substantial
agreements.

comparison results
next, we present comparison results for the twenty-four
methods considered in this paper based on the eighteen consi-
dered gold standard datasets.

experimental details
at least three distinct approaches have been proposed to deal
with id31 of sentences. the    rst of them, ap-
plied by opinionfinder and pattern.en, for instance, splits this
task into two steps: (i) identifying sentences with no senti-
ment, also named as objective vs. neutral sentences and then
(ii) detecting the polarity (positive or negative), only for the
subjective sentences. another common way to detect sentence
polarity considers three distinct classes (positive, negative and
neutral) in a single task, an approach used by vader, so-
cal, usent and others. finally, some methods like senticnet
and liwc, classify a sentence as positive or negative only,
assuming that only polarized sentences are presented, given
the context of a given application. as an example, reviews of
products are expected to contain only polarized opinion.
aiming at providing a more thorough comparison among these
distinct approaches, we perform two rounds of tests. in the    rst
we consider the performance of methods to identify 3-class
(positive, negative and neutral). the second considers only po-
sitive and negative as output and assumes that a previous step
of removing the neutral messages needs to be executed    rstly.
in the 3-class experiments we used only datasets containing
a considerable number of neutral messages (which excludes
tweets rnd ii, amazon, and reviews ii). despite being 2-
class methods, as highlighted in table 2, we decided to include
liwc, emoticons and senticnet in the 3-class experiments to
present a full set of comparative experiments. liwc, emoti-
cons, and senticnet cannot de   ne, for some sentences, their
positive or negative polarity, considering it as unde   ned. it

occurs due to the absence in the sentence of emoticons (in
the case of emoticons method) or of words belonging to the
methods    sentiment lexicon. as neutral (objective) sentences
do not contain sentiments, we assumed, in the case of these
2-class methods, that sentences with unde   ned polarities are
equivalent to neutral sentences.
the 2-class experiments, on the other hand, were performed
with all datasets described in table 3 excluding the neutral
sentences. we also included all methods in these experiments,
even those that produce neutral outputs. as discussed before,
when 2-class methods cannot detect the polarity (positive or
negative) of a sentences they usually assign it to an unde   ned
polarity. as we know all sentences in the 2-class experiments
are positive or negative, we create the coverage metric to
determine the percentage of sentences a method can in fact
classify as positive or negative. for instance, suppose that
emoticons    method can classify only 10% of the sentences in
a dataset, corresponding to the actual percentage of sentences
with emoticons. it means that the coverage of this method
in this speci   c dataset is 10%. note that, the coverage is
quite an important metric for a more complete evaluation in
the 2-class experiments. even though emoticons presents
high accuracy for the classi   ed phrases, it was not able to
make a prediction for 90% of the sentences. more formally,
coverage is calculated as the number of total sentences minus
the number of unde   ned sentences, all of this divided by the
total of sentences, where the number of unde   ned sentences
includes neutral outputs for 3-class methods.

coverage =

#sentences    #unde f ined

#sentences

comparison metrics
considering the 3-class comparison experiments, we used
the traditional precision, recall, and f1 measures for the
automated classi   cation.

each letter in the above table represents the number of ins-
tances which are actually in class x and predicted as class
y, where x;y     positive; neutral; negative. the recall (r)
of a class x is the ratio of the number of elements correctly
classi   ed as x to the number of known elements in class x.
precision (p) of a class x is the ratio of the number of elements
classi   ed correctly as x to the total predicted as the class x.
for example, the precision of the negative class is computed as:
p(neg) = i/(c + f + i); its recall, as: r(neg) = i/(g + h + i);
and the f1 measure is the harmonic mean between both preci-
sion and recall. in this case, f1(neg) = 2p(neg)  r(neg)
p(neg)+r(neg).
a =

accuracy as:
a+b+c+d+e+ f +g+h+i.
it considers equally important the
correct classi   cation of each sentence, independently of the
class, and basically measures the capability of the method

a+e+i

to predict the correct output. a variation of f1, namely,
macro-f1, is normally reported to evaluate classi   cation
effectiveness on skewed datasets. macro-f1 values are
computed by    rst calculating f1 values for each class
in isolation, as exempli   ed above for negative, and then
averaging over all classes. macro-f1 considers equally
important the effectiveness in each class, independently of
the relative size of the class. thus, accuracy and macro-f1
provide complementary assessments of the classi   cation
effectiveness. macro-f1 is especially important when the
class distribution is very skewed, to verify the capability of
the method to perform well in the smaller classes.
the described metrics can be easily computed for the 2-class
experiments by just removing neutral columns and rows as in
the table below.

predicted

positive negative

positive
actual negative

a
c

d

p(pos)+r(pos)

in this case, the precision of positive class is computed as:
p(pos) = a/(a + c); its recall as: r(pos) = a/(a + b); while
its f1 is f1(pos) = 2p(pos)  r(pos)
as we have a large number of combinations among the base
methods, metrics and datasets, a global analysis of the per-
formance of all these combinations is not an easy task. we
propose a simple but informative measure to assess the overall
performance ranking. the mean ranking is basically the sum
of ranks obtained by a method in each dataset divided by the
total number of datasets, as below:
nd
   
j=1
nd

mr =

ri

where nd is the number of datasets and ri is the rank of the
method for dataset i. it is important to notice that the rank was
calculated based on macro f1.
the last evaluation metric we exploit is the friedman   s test [6].
it allows one to verify whether, in a speci   c experiment, the
observed values are globally similar. we used this test to tell
if the methods present similar performance across different
datasets. more speci   cally, suppose that k expert raters evalu-
ated n item     the question that arises is: are rates provided by
judges consistent with each other or do they follow comple-
tely different patterns? the application in our context is very
similar: the datasets are the judges and the macro-f1 achieved
by a method is the rating from the judges.
the friedman   s test is applied to rankings. then, to proceed
with this statistical test, we sort the methods in decreasing
order of macro-f1 for each dataset. more formally, the fried-
man   s rank test in our experiment is de   ned as:

fr = (

12

rc(c + 1)

c

   

j=1

j )    3r(c + 1)
r2

j = square of the sum of rank positions of method j (j =

where
r2
1,2,..,c)
r = number of datasets
c = number of methods
as the number of datasets increases, the statistical test can be
approximated by using the chi-square distribution with c    1
degrees of freedom [29]. then, if the fr computed value is
larger than the critical value for the chi-square distribution the
null hypothesis is rejected. this null hypothesis states that
ranks obtained per dataset are globally similar. accordingly,
rejecting the null hypothesis means that there are signi   cant
differences in the ranks across datasets. it is important to note
that, in general, the critical value is obtained with signi   cance
level    = 0.05. synthesizing, the null hypothesis should be
rejected if fr > x 2
   is the critical value veri   ed in
the chi-square distribution table with c    1 degrees of freedom
and    equals 0.05.

comparing prediction performance
we start the analysis of our experiments by comparing the
results of all previously discussed metrics for all datasets. ta-
ble 4 and table 5 present accuracy, precision, and macro-f1
for all methods considering four datasets for the 2-class and
3-class experiments, respectively. for simplicity, we choose to
discuss results only for these datasets as they come from diffe-
rent sources and help us to illustrate the main    ndings from
our analysis. results for all the other datasets are presented in
the additional file 1. there are many interesting observations
we can make from these results, summarized next.
methods prediction performance varies considerably
from one dataset to another: first, we note the same so-
cial media text can be interpreted very differently depending
on the choice of a sentiment method. overall, we note that all
the methods yielded with large variations across the different
datasets. by analyzing table 4 we can note that vader works
well for tweets rnd ii, appearing in the    rst place, but it
presents poor performance in tweets stf, comments bbc,
and comments digg, achieving the eleventh, thirteenth and
tenth place respectively. although the    rst two datasets con-
tain tweets, they belong to different contexts, which affects
the performance of some methods like vader. another im-
portant aspect to be analyzed in this table is the coverage.
although sentistrength has presented good macro-f1 values,
its coverage is usually low as this method tends to classify a
high number of instances as neutral. note that some datasets
provided by the sentistrength   s authors, as shown in table 3,
specially the twitter datasets, have more neutral sentences
than positive and negative ones. another expected result is the
good macro-f1 values obtained by emoticons, specially in
the twitter datasets. it is important to highlight that, in spite
of achieving high accuracy and macro-f1, the coverage of
many methods, such as panas, vader, and sentistrength,
is low (e.g. below 30%) as they only infer the polarity of part
of the input sentences.thus, the choice of a id31
is highly dependent on the data and application, suggesting

that researchers and practitioners need to take into account
this tradeoff between prediction performance and coverage.
the same high variability regarding the methods   s prediction
performance can be noted for the 3-class experiments, as pre-
sented in table 5. umigon, the best method in    ve twitter
datasets, felt to the eighteenth place in the comments nyt
dataset. we can also note the lower macro-f1 values for some
methods like emoticons are due to the high number of senten-
ces without emoticons in the datasets. methods like emoticons
ds and panas tend do classify only a small part of instances
as neutral and also presented a poor performance in the 3-class
experiments. methods like senticnet and liwc were not
originally developed for detecting neutral sentences and also
achieved low values of macro-f1. however, they also do not
appear among the best methods in the 2-class experiments,
which is the task they were originally designed for. this ob-
servation about liwc is not valid for the newest version, as
liwc15 appears among the top    ve methods for 2-class and
3-class experiments (see table 6).
finally, table 7 presents the friedman   s test results showing
that there are signi   cant differences in the mean rankings
observed for the methods across all datasets. it statistically
indicates that in terms of accuracy and macro-f1 there is no
single method that always achieves a consistent rank position
for different datasets, which is something similar to the well-
known    no-free lunch theorem    [74]. so, overall, before using
a id31 method in a novel dataset, it is crucial
to test different methods in a sample of data before simply
choose one that is acceptable by the research community.

this last results suggests that, even with the good insights
provided by this work about which methods perform better
in each context, a preliminary investigation needs to be per-
formed when id31 is used in a new dataset in
order to guarantee a reasonable prediction performance. in the
case in which prior tests are not feasible, this benchmark pre-
sents valuable information for researchers and companies that
are planning to develop research and solutions on sentiment
analysis.
existing methods let space for improvements: we can note
that the performance of the evaluated methods are ok, but
there is a lot of space for improvements. for example, if
we look at the macro-f1 values only for the best method on
each dataset (see table 4 and table 5), we can note that the
overall prediction performance of the methods is still low    
i.e. macro-f1 values are around 0.9 only for methods with
low coverage in the 2-class experiments and only 0.6 for the
3-class experiment. considering that we are looking at the
performance of the best methods out of 24 unsupervised tools,
these numbers suggest that current sentence-level sentiment
analysis methods still let a lot of space for improvements.

additionally, we also noted that the best method for each
dataset varies considerably from one dataset to another. this
might indicate that each method complements the others in
different ways.
most methods are better to classify positive than negative
or neutral sentences: figure 2 presents the average f1 score
for the 3-class experiments. it is easier to notice that twelve out
of twenty-four methods are more accurate while classifying
positive than negative or neutral messages, suggesting that
some methods may be more biased towards positivity. neutral
messages showed to be even harder to detect by most methods.
interestingly, recent efforts show that human language have
a universal positivity bias ([21] and [17]). naturally, part
of the bias is observed in sentiment prediction, an intrinsic
property of some methods due to the way they are designed.
for instance, [26] developed a lexicon in which positive and
negative values are associated to words, hashtags, and any sort
of tokens according to the frequency with which these tokens
appear in tweets containing positive and negative emoticons.
this method showed to be biased towards positivity due to the
larger amount of positivity in the data they used to build the
lexicon. the overall poor performance of this speci   c method
is credited to its lack of treatment of neutral messages and the
focus on twitter messages.
some methods are consistently among the best ones:
table 6 presents the mean rank value, detailed before, for 2-
class and 3-class experiments. the elements are sorted by the
overall mean rank each method achieved based on macro-f1
for all datasets. the top nine methods based on macro-f1
for the 2-class experiments are: sentistrength, sentiment140,
semantria, opinionlexicon, liwc15, so-cal, afinn and

vader and umigon. with the exception of sentistrength,
replaced by pattern.en, the other eight methods produce the
best results across several datasets for both, 2 and 3-class tasks.
these methods would be preferable in situations in which any
sort of preliminary evaluation is not possible to be done. the
mean rank for 2-class experiments is accompanied by the cove-
rage metric, which is very important to avoid misinterpretation
of the results. observe that sentistrength and sentiment140
exhibited the best mean ranks for these experiments, however
both present very low coverage, around 30% and 40%, a very
poor result compared with semantria and opinionlexicon
that achieved a worse mean rank (4,61 and 6,62 respectively)
but an expressive better coverage, above 60%. note also that
sentistrength and sentiment140 present poor results in the
3-class experiments which can be explained by their bias to
the neutral class as mentioned before.
another interesting    nding is the fact that vader, the best
method in the 3-class experiments, did not achieve the    rst
position for none of the datasets. it reachs the second place
   ve times, the third place twice, the seventh three times, and
the fourth, sixth and    fth just once. it was a special case of
consistency across all datasets. tables 8 and 8 present the best
method for each dataset in the 2-class and 3-class experiments,
respectively.
methods are often better in the datasets they were origi-
nally evaluated: we also note those methods perform better
in datasets in which they were originally validated, which is
somewhat expected due to    ne tuning procedures. we could
do this comparison only for sentistrength and vader, which
kindly allowed the entire reproducibility of their work, sharing
both methods and datasets. to understand this difference, we
calculated the mean rank for these methods without their    ori-

some cases the rank order changes towards a lower value but it
does not imply in major changes. we also note those methods

observations suggest that initiatives like semeval are key for
the development of the area, as they allow methods to compete
in a contest for a speci   c dataset. more important, it highlight
that a standard id31 benchmark is needed and
it needs to be constantly updated. we also emphasize that is
possible that other methods, such as paid softwares, make use
of some of the datasets used in this benchmark to improve
their performance as most of gold standard used in this work
is available in the web or under request to authors.
some methods showed to be better for speci   c contexts:
in order to better understand the prediction performance of
methods in types of data, we divided all datasets in three
speci   c contexts     social networks, comments, and reviews
    and calculated mean rank of the methods for each of them.
table 10 presents the contexts and the respective datasets.
tables 11, 12 and 13 present the mean rank for each context
separately. in the context of social networks the best method
for 3-class experiments was umigon, followed by liwc15
and vader. in the case of 2-class the winner was sentis-
trength with a coverage around 30% and the third and sixth
place were emoticons and panas-t with about 18% and 6%
of coverage, respectively. this highlights the importance to

analyze the 2-class results together with the coverage. ove-
rall, when there is an emoticon on the text or a word from the
psychometric scale panas, these methods are able to tell the
polarity of the sentences, but they are not able to identify the
polarity of the input text for the large majority of the input
text. recent efforts suggest these properties are useful for
combination of methods [24]. sentiment140, liwc15, se-
mantria, opinionlexicon and umigon showed to be the best
alternatives for detecting only positive and negative polarities
in social network data due to the high coverage and prediction
performance. it is important to highlight that liwc 2007 ap-
pears on the 16th and 21th position for the 3-class and 2-class
mean rank results for the social network datasets and it is a
very popular method in this community. on the other side,
the newest version of liwc (2015) presented a considerable
evolution obtaining the second and the fourth place in the same
datasets.
similar analyses can be performed for the contexts comments
and reviews. sentistregth, vader, semantria, afinn, and
opinion lexicon showed to be the best alternatives for 2-class

and 3-class experiments on datasets of comments whereas
sentiment140, senticnet, semantria and so-cal showed
to be the best for the 2-class experiments for the datasets
containing short reviews. note that for the last one, the 3-
class experiments have no results since datasets containing
reviews have no neutral sentences nor a representative number
of sentences without subjectivity.
we also calculated the friedman   s value for each of these speci-
   c contexts. even after grouping the datasets, we still observe
that there are signi   cant differences in the observed ranks
across the datasets. although the values obtained for each
context were quite smaller than friedman    global value, they
are still above the critical value. table 14 presents the results
of friedman   s test for the individual contexts in both experi-
ments, 2 and 3-class. recall that for the 3-class experiments,
datasets with no neutral sentences or with an unrepresentative
number of neutral sentences were not considered. for this rea-
son, friedman   s results for 3-class experiments in the reviews
context presents no values.

concluding remarks
recent efforts to analyze the moods embedded in web 2.0 con-
tent have adopted various id31 methods, which
were originally developed in linguistics and psychology. seve-
ral of these methods became widely used in their knowledge
   elds and have now been applied as tools to quantify mo-
ods in the context of unstructured short messages in online
social networks. in this article, we present a thorough compa-
rison of twenty-four popular sentence-level id31
methods using gold standard datasets that span different types
of data sources. our effort quanti   es the prediction perfor-
mance of the twenty-four popular id31 methods
across eighteen datasets for two tasks: differentiating two clas-

ses (positive and negative) and three classes (positive, negative,
and neutral).
among many    ndings, we highlight that although our results
identi   ed a few methods able to appear among the best ones for
different datasets, we noted that the overall prediction perfor-
mance still left a lot of space for improvements. more impor-
tant, we show that the prediction performance of methods vary
largely across datasets. for example, liwc 2007, is among
the most popular sentiment methods in the social network
context and obtained a bad rank position in comparison with
other datasets. this suggests that id31 methods
cannot be used as    off-the-shelf    methods, specially for novel
datasets. we show that the same social media text can be inter-
preted very differently depending on the choice of a sentiment

method, suggesting that it is important that researchers and
companies perform experiments with different methods before
applying a method.
as a    nal contribution we open the datasets and codes used in
this paper for the research community. we also incorporated
them in a web service from our research team called ifeel [4]
that allow users to easily compare the results of various senti-
ment analysis methods. we hope our effort can not only help
researchers and practitioners to compare a wide range of senti-
ment analysis techniques, but also help fostering new relevant
research in this area with a rigorous scienti   c approach.
