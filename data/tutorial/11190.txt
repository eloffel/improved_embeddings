abstract

we study temporal networks of characters in literature focusing on alice   s adventures in won-
derland (1865) by lewis carroll and the anonymous la chanson de roland (around 1100). the
former, one of the most in   uential pieces of nonsense literature ever written, describes the adven-
tures of alice in a fantasy world with logic plays interspersed along the narrative. the latter, a song
of heroic deeds, depicts the battle of roncevaux in 778 a.d. during charlemagne   s campaign on the
iberian peninsula. we apply methods recently developed by taylor et al. [26] to    nd time-averaged
eigenvector centralities, freeman indices and vitalities of characters. we show that temporal net-
works are more appropriate than static ones for studying stories, as they capture features that the
time-independent approaches fail to yield.

introduction

this work was motivated by a simple question: is there something in the structure of a narrative or
in the way characters are introduced and related to each other, that is crucial to our ability to follow
and make sense of a story? any approach one may contemplate when trying to    understand    a piece
of good literature is of course contingent on the question being asked. finding an answer     if there
is one     requires much more than a naive analysis that disregards aspects like the underlying theme,
the historical, cultural and sociological contexts at the time of writing and how the readership relates
to these. therefore the purpose of the authors is not to    nd answers to questions which can only be
tackled with an approach that contemplates all these aspects of literary analysis. our main objective

is to explore some aspects of the structure of the network of characters of a novel and see if network
theory can be used as a viable tool in literature. it is known, for instance, that renowned authors
construct a character   s persona as it interacts with other characters and settings [27]. since network
theory is the epitome of a theory of interconnectedness, can it be used to tell us something about how
the connections de   ne one character   s importance? is there a correlation between the mathematical
results it yields and our perception, as readers, of the relevance of this or that character? these are
some of the questions we will try to address in the present work.

even when one con   nes oneself to the exclusive use of networks without resorting to other forms of
literary analysis [11], there remain several questions that need to be tackled. the    rst main challenge is
the question of what exactly constitutes the network in a narrative. should nodes represent characters
or groups of characters, objects or places? what do edges exactly represent? this question has no
simple answer as interactions between characters can be complex and play a fundamental role in the
story, as do objects and locations. in the case of historical texts, narratives depend to a great extent
on the narrator and how he/she interprets historical events [13].
in spite of having a well-de   ned
theoretical framework of    character networks    of woloch and moretti [30, 19, 20], choices still have to
be made and there is always more than one possible network for a given narrative [21].

the second challenge one faces when treating networks of actors in a novel or historical narrative
is that they are not    xed in time. most of the studies on networks have been conducted for systems
frozen on a time scale large enough to allow one to complete disregard any dynamics. all nodes,
irrespective of any time ordering regarding the events they depict, are connected into a single, time-
independent network. following the current terminology, we can call these aggregate networks. this
may be reasonable in some context [22, 12, 15, 3, 29, 16, 28, 7, 8] but networks involving interpersonal
relations and events     either historical or    ctional     are intrinsically dynamic [13, 18, 14]. edges may
come and go, as well as characters. even though one may correctly argue that in a certain sense
they are immutable     history cannot be changed and once a piece of    ction is written, it remains so    
the stories they depict happen over time, which may typically span a period of a few days to several
decades. if id177 is to have any predictive power, the    rst question to come to mind is if
measures which make sense for time-independent networks will still make sense for dynamical ones and
the insights gained from studying the former can still be applied to the latter [14, 25].

the main goal of the present article is the application of temporal networks to literature and to
describe the kinds of questions one can answer with the methods at hand. to do this we combine
the theoretical framework of woloch [30] and moretti [19, 20, 21] for literary studies with techniques
developed by taylor et al. [26] for temporal networks on the mathematical side. to the best of
our knowledge the present paper is the    rst one where these methods are applied to literature. we
chose two texts as study objects: lewis carroll   s alice   s adventures in wonderland [6] of 1865 and
the anonymous la chanson de roland from ca. 1100 ad [2]. carroll   s alice was chosen for several
reasons: it has a story with a well de   ned number of chapters (12), which we took as being our time
sequence. the number of characters is small, which makes it easier to follow an individual character
and see how measures associated with it change over time. it has also another advantage: some of its
characters are by now household names in many of the 174 languages the book has been translated
into. so it is possible to check if some more    popular    characters, like the cheshire cat or the dodo
really stand the test of a mathematical analysis as to their relevance for the plot. we also looked for a
text with a larger set of characters and which would be as far removed in time and genre from alice as
possible: the choice fell on la chanson de roland, a chanson de geste (song of heroic deeds) describing
the slaughtering of roland and his knights. the story is based on the real battle of roncevaux of
778, when the retreating army of charlemagne was ambushed and the rearguard, to which roland
belonged, was decimated. the fact that there is an interval of approximately 8 centuries between the
two texts guarantees that any results we obtain is genre-independent and not in   uenced by the styles
characteristics of their time of composition.

this paper is organized as follows: in the    rst section we brie   y review the theoretical framework

2

of character networks in literature while addressing the    rst question: how to choose a network. this
is followed by an exposition of the method propounded in [26] to deal with time-dependent networks,
thus addressing the second problem: to incorporate the dynamics in the system. we then present the
results for the two books in question, alice   s adventures in wonderland and la chanson de roland.
to better show the di   erences when dynamics is considered, we compare these results with the ones
obtained from aggregate, time-independent networks of all characters of each text. we close the paper
with some conclusions and perspectives on the use of id177 to literary texts.

2 networks and literature: some background

in this section we discuss the theoretical aspects of networks in literature while addressing the problem
of how to construct one. the theory of networks of characters, or character networks as it is called
in the specialized literature was introduced by moretti [19, 20, 21] and woloch [30]. an extensive
discussion of this theory is presented by rochat in [23], who applied their ideas to study jean-jacques
rousseau autobiography les confessions from the viewpoint of networks. the interested reader should
refer to this work for more details. here we concentrate on those aspects which are relevant to the
present article. according to rochat, a character network represents    relations between characters from
a text. the relations are based on text proximity, shared scenes/events, quoted speech, etc.    from a
literary perspective one starts by de   ning the concepts of character-space and character-system [30].
the character-space would be narrative environment of a given character and the character-system the
union of all these spaces. when one picks out one particular network from the character-system, one
ends up with character network, which can be represented as a simple or multiplex, time-dependent
or dynamic network. this implies, of course, making choices as to what relations are important. one
key point in the approach is the realization of the fact that characters in any narrative are de   ned
not by themselves, but as part of a web where each one helps de   ne the others. in this sense a story
really is a complex system. this is a matter-of-course fact in literary studies but here lies the link to
the application of id177 to narratives: taking networks as the natural theoretical framework
for studying the interdependence between agents that act through space and time, the main task one
faces is how to disregard, in a principled way, aspects of narratives which might not render themselves
amenable to a mathematical treatment. then comes the question of how data should be collected,
by actually reading the book or    nding ways of automatically obtaining information via an adequate
software.

automated network extraction in a context-free way is one option [23, 10, 24]: one collects charac-
ters which are mentioned in a page and connect them all into one complete network, even if they do
not interact. the procedure is repeated for the next page and then pages are fused: if edges between
two characters appear in both pages, they are reinforced. new edges are added. this procedure is
repeated for all pages, and at the end of the data collecting one is left with a network which resembles
a complete network (everyone connected to everyone else). this is the approach favoured by [23]. such
context-free method has its obvious limitations, as for instance placing edges where there might be
none. tolstoy   s anna karenina provides us with a good example of the problems one might run into:
the character levin and the philosopher schopenhauer appear repeatedly together, but to the reader
it is clear that levin speaks of schopenhauer but not to schopenhauer. another problem is that this
method, in our opinion, tend to attribute more importance to characters which are peripheral, or keep
characters in a plot which at some point of the narrative disappear. some ways of avoiding these
di   culties or minimizing them have been discussed in [23]. this approach has its merits, for instance
if one is interested in statistics, when questions regarding not one particular character of a book but
literary styles or types of characters are the main focus. as one does not have the time or resources to
read hundreds of books, automated extraction of networks have to be considered a serious alternative.
another approach is that of kenna and mac carron [7, 8]. these authors improved on these ideas
by connecting only those characters who actually meet at some point of the narrative. of course this

3

requires reading the books and consequently the number of works that can be tackled is reduced. the
character networks of their studies were drawn from a corpora of myths and sagas as the irish t  ain
b  o c  uailnge, the icelandic sagas and the greek iliad. moreover, being mainly narratives of con   icts,
links were also given the attributes friendly and hostile. without pretending to be exhaustive, these
authors calculated a series of measures for the complete, friendly and hostile graphs and showed that
some of the networks in these texts bear a striking resemblance to social networks from the real world,
an indication that the stories they depict could have some elements drawn from real events [8]. a more
detailed analysis of the iliad beyond that of [7] can be found in [9]. in all the aforementioned studies
one does not di   erentiate the time in the narrative where the link is made, so there is no dynamics
involved.

the importance of dynamics has been discussed by agarwal et. al [1]. these authors studied alice   s
adventures in wonderland, albeit in an online-accessible, abridged version (10 chapters instead of 12).
the data extraction was automatic, but checked later by hand. their main motivation is in line with
multiplex networks, where di   erent attributes of links changes the relevance of characters according
to what is being observed. this can be accomplished by discriminating between uni/bi-directional
and categories: interaction and observation. one character may observe another character but is not
observed by them, as when alice sees the rabbit but is not seem by it. the way they introduced
dynamics is by looking at some relevant measures chapter by chapter and comparing them. taylor et
al. devised in [26] a way of generalizing eigenvector-based measures usually studied in time-independent
scenarios to temporal networks. these authors look at snapshots of the network at di   erent time layers
and treating inter   layer connections (same time) and intra   layer connections (di   erent times) as being
essentially di   erent. for a system with n nodes and t time steps they construct an n    t block
diagonal supra-centrality matrix m where each n    n diagonal block is the adjacency matrix (or any
given function thereof) at a given time step t = t1, t2, . . . tt . a parameter    controls how strongly time
layers are connected to each other. one may then use all the results from spectral analysis already
known to work for aggregate networks. this ideas were tested with 3 networks: the exchange of phd   s
in mathematics in the united states, the costarring networks of top-billed actors during the golden
age of hollywood and citations of decisions of the american supreme court [26]. the results presented
in [1] represent a valuable approach towards incorporating some sort of dynamics into networks as well
as in the way they attribute values to edges, but we believe that the methods of taylor and coworkers
capture the dynamics in a more consistent and rigorous way. we discuss in more detail the di   erences
between these approaches in the next sections.

since our main goal is to combine character networks with temporal networks, our choices of
network building and time reckoning were the following. as for network extraction, our option follows
closely that of kenna and mac carron. as we are interested in multiplex networks in a temporal sense
and not in a attribute sense, we consider an edge to exist whenever characters meet face to face but
do not givem them any attribute. this allows us to concentrate on the dynamical aspects of the plot
without complicating to much our analysis. our choice of time layers was that of chapters, except in
the case of la chanson de roland, as we explain below. this choice of chapters seem a reasonable one,
as it was made by the author of the narrative and usually contains what one could describe as    scenes   
of a play. for most stories the scene depicted in a chapter happens after the scenes of previous chapters,
particularly in the case of alice. as for la chanson de roland, one should bear in mind that it was
actually recited for an audience and it was thus divided in stanzas or irregular sizes, called laisses 1.
there is a total of 247 to 272 stanzas, depending on the manuscript consulted. as the emphasis of
the story is on the actions rather than on the characters and their introspection, we grouped some
stanzas which described a particular scene     a gathering of charlemagne and his knights or a battle,
for example     into one single chapter. stanzas describing the scenery were not considered. with this
we ended up with 44 chapters, each one describing a scene.

1it is generally believed that this division has to do with the time required for the bard to rest or play some instrument

in between stanzas. for further discussion on the composition of the song, see the introduction to [2].

going back to the question we discussed in the introduction, we are interested in seeing whether
temporal networks can serve as a tool to select characters according to their relevance to the plot.
according to [21, 16] the narrative importance of a character can be evaluated by deleting it from
the network and comparing to the network before deletion. as one character is removed, so are the
links connected to it. the network becomes more sparse and some minor characters might become
completely disconnected from the main narrative. the quantity which measures this di   erence is the
so-called vitality and it will be discussed in the following section.

3 temporal networks: some de   nitions

in the theory of static networks, a number of measures have been developed to account for the impor-
tance of nodes [29, 22]. many of these centrality measures can be expressed in terms of the eigenvector
related to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix [26, 17, 4]. the adjacency matrix a, for a
network with n nodes is simply de   ned as the n    n matrix whose element ij is 1 if node i and
node j are connected or zero otherwise. for a given network, one may simply count all existing edges,
irrespective of when they actually were formed, and de   ne a aggregate adjacency matrix. however, if
this matrix is to more realistically represent some network which evolves in time, so that for instance
a given edge between i and j appears at a latter instant of time when, say, nodes k and l are no longer
extant, one has to    nd ways to represent how the adjacency of a given time changes from time layer
to time layer. one way of doing this is to de   ne a supra-adjacency matrix m that can be constructed
in the following way [26]: let us assume time is discretized in t steps. following [26] we de   ne m as
the (n t    n t )-matrix

m =

where each block diagonal (n    n )-matrix m(t) represents the adjacency matrix a(t) at a given time
layer t (t = 1, 2,          t ). the choice m(t) = a(t) is appropriate for our purposes, but m(t) can be
a written as a more general function of a(t), as for example the hub (aat) and authority (ata)
scores, where t denotes the transpose matrix [26]. the upper (and lower) diagonal identity matrices
are introduced to guarantee that node i at a given time t is identi   ed with itself at the next time step
t+1. the parameter    controls how strongly a given node is coupled to itself between neighbouring time
layers. a value of        0+ implies a strong correlation between time layers, meaning order-preserving
aggregation. a value of            implies the decoupling of layers. as shown in [26], the limits of small
and large values of    are well understood. the centrality trajectories depend on the choices for    and
there is not a clear interpretation for the intermediate regime. however, as pointed out by the authors,
the limit        0+ can still give valuable information. in this paper, only this latter limit has been
explored.

nodes (characters) are connected by an edge if they, at some point in the story, actually meet face
to face. if one character talks about another character or thinks of him/her/it, no edge exists. no
value or classi   cation is given to links. time is measured in chapters. for each chapter (time layer t)
we calculate an adjacency matrix m(t):
if, say, characters i and j were connected in previous times
but do not contact each other at time step t, the corresponding entry mij(t) is set to zero. with these
partial matrices we build the supra-adjacency matrix m from which our analysis follows.

in fact the leading eigenvector of m yields what one calls a joint node-layer centrality, since it
re   ects the centrality of both node (character) i and time layer (chapter) t. since, in general, these
quantities are   -dependent and not easy to interpret, the trajectory of node centrality in time is given
by the conditional node-layer centrality of the corresponding node-layer (i, t). the conditional node-

5

layer centrality is the joint node-layer centrality normalized by the mlc of layer t. here, mlc stands
for marginal layer centrality, obtained by summing the centrality of all nodes i in a given time layer
t.

in the limit of        0+ one expects a slow variation of the conditional node-layer centrality as
function of time. this is what the authors in [26] call time-averaged centrality and it ranks nodes
so that their centralities are constant in time. in all the analyses that follow in this paper, what we
call centrality is exactly this time-averaged centrality. we should brie   y comment on computational
complexity here. the supra-centrality matrix given by eq.(1) whose dominant eigenvector gives the
joint node-layer centralities, has size n t    n t , and that can be problematic for large networks with
many time layers. conversely, taylor et al. have proved the time-averaged node centralities are given
by the solution of an eigenvalue equation of rank n .

we are interested in this paper in the freeman index of the network. suppose an unweighted
network of n nodes, one particular node j having the highest degree centrality cmax amongst nodes.
the degree centrality is the number of edges connected to a given node. the freeman index cf is
de   ned as

cf = pn

i=1(cid:20)cmax     ci(cid:21)

(n     1)(n     2)

(2)

where the sum runs over all nodes with degree centrality ci. the denominador can be explained
as follows: the highest centrality a node j can have is in the so-called star graph, where all nodes
are connected to j and to no other node. if this were indeed the case, the centrality of j would be
cmax = (n     1) while ci = 1 for i 6= j and the sum in the numerator of the expression above would be

n

xi=1

(cid:20)cmax     ci(cid:21) = 0 + (n     1)    (n     1     1)

= (n     1)(n     2)

(3)

in our approach, we replace ci by the eigenvector centrality ci obtained by diagonalizing m in the limit

       0+ and multiply (2) by a factor pn (n     1) which comes from the eigenvector id172.

the values of cf vary between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to a star graph while 0 corresponds to a
complete graph where all nodes have the same number of connections. geometrically one may interpret
the freeman index as an indicator of how close a graph is to a star graph. in a literary context this
means how    centered    a story is on one particular character or more    distributed    amongst characters.
for example, we might expect a biography to have a freeman index closer to 1, as the di   erent persons
would be mentioned mostly in their connection to the person being biographed and not in their relation
to each other. another interesting measure of the relative importance of a given node or its vitality.
the vitality is a concept which measures how some structural properties of a network depend on a
node and can be evaluated by deleting it from the network. in short, by removing a node i, another
node j emerges as more prominent or is completely disconnect from what is left of the network. to the
best of our knowledge, moretti was the    rst to use it in character network analysis. in a case study of
haid113t [21] he demonstrates the cohesive narrative role of a central actor in that play. vitalities can
be de   ned with respect to any real-valued measure g de   ned over a graph g. the vitality of node j
is given by the di   erence between g calculated for the whole set of nodes and g for the set of nodes
without j, namely

v (g) = g(g)     g(g\j)

(4)

by deleting a character we mean that all edges attached to it are removed. in our particular case, we
measure the vitality with respect to the eigenvector centralities of nodes.

recently, fenu and higham [5] have argued that the way the supra-centrality matrix is constructed
in eq. (1) can be problematic when one considers directed graphs. this is particularly true in the
case of centrality measures based on the concept of traversals through a network. in their study they

6

consider an alternative formulation where only the identity matrices of the upper diagonal are present.
since in our case when character a and b meet it is irrelevant who addresses whom, we proceed with
the matrix to be given by (1).

4 the chapter-by-chapter case

in what follows, whenever we refer to the books we are studying we will denote them by italics (alice,
roland) whereas characters will denoted by normal type (alice, roland). before we present our results
for temporal networks it is interesting to ask whether they are really necessary. most studies so far
have combined all characters into one single (time-independent) network but according to [14], this can
lead to innacurate results. one could for instance think of a situation where one particular character,
highly connected, dies at the beginning of the story, a fact that an aggregate network does not show
at all. one option would be to the go to the opposite extreme, by taking snapshots of the network
at di   erent instants of time and considering them as independent from each other (in the language
of [26], this corresponds to the limit of           ). in order to better illustrate this idea we study alice as
being actually 12 networks, one for each chapter. we calculate each character   s eigenvector centrality
at a given chapter, regardless of what happened before or happens after that given chapter. this is
the approach also used by agarwal et al. [1] in their study of alice.

the result can be seen in fig.(1) in the form a temperature map of characters    degrees. in spite of
having calculated di   erent centralities, the graphs of [1] are equivalent to this temperature map. for
each chapter, an adjacency matrix is built and diagonalized. the leading eigenvector of this matrix
carries the centralities of each character. the centralities are normalized chapter by chapter. the result
is easy to interpret, as it is equivalent to the impression one gets from actually reading the book, but
trying to imagine that each chapter is a di   erent story. note that chapter 1 has only three characters:
alice, her sister and the rabbit, alice having the highest degree centrality. in chapter 2 new characters
appear while the rabbit and alice   s sister disappear. the rabbit shows up again in chapter 4, while
alice   s sister reappears only at the end of the book, when alice wakes from her dream. one may clearly
see that chapter 8 has the largest number of characters and correspond to the point when alice arrives
at the queen   s croquet-ground. by looking at this image one could conclude that the rabbit appears
to be more important than, say, the queen, as he appears in more chapters. however one should
keep in mind that each centrality is relative to one particular chapter of the book. this means that
in chapter 1, for instance, the rabbit is being compared to only two other characters, namely alice
and her sister. so its centrality there cannot be compared to that of the queen on chapter 8, which
has many more characters. one should also bear in mind that subjectively one identi   es the rabbit
in chapter 1 with the same rabbit in chapter 8 and it seems natural to de   ne an overall centrality
by some sort of weighted or unweighted average. however, from a mathematical point of view, the
characters appearing in each chapter have nothing to do with previous or posterior    reincarnations    of
their selves: rigorously they are completely di   erent actors. what one needs is to    nd a mathematical
way of identifying characters from chapter to chapter, thus giving the narrative an inner consistency
which does not depend our our subjective identi   cation of characters and respects, at the same time,
causality.

previous studies on character networks [21, 23, 7, 8, 9] have used what we call the aggregate
network, that is all connections made along a plot are considered together, irrespective of whether
they are, at some point of the narrative, no longer extant. for the sake of completeness we show
what the aggregate networks of alice and roland look like in figs. (2) and (7) respectively. all these
studies however emphasize the importance of incorporating the dynamics of the stories in their studies,
something that an aggregate network does not provide since the causal timeline is lost with the sum of
partial results [14]. if one expects to get meaningful results, one must therefore consider the networks
in their full time-dependence and identify a given character with itself as the story evolves. this is
exactly what the method of [26] does, as we show in our case-studies of alice and roland in what

follows.

5 the strong time-coupling limit

we consider now the dynamic case. as mentioned previously the limit of        0+ corresponds to the
strong coupling between time layers.
in this limit the method presented in [26] yields a centrality
which is time-independent. to better see the di   erence in both cases, we plot in figs. (3) and (4) the
freeman index calculated for alice in the (a) aggregate and (b) dynamic case. the red horizontal line
represents the freeman index of the network. the dots above the name of each character (horizontal
axis) represent the new value of this index when that particular character is taken out of the network.
from these two images it is clear that alice, the queen and the king are the characters which most
a   ect the structure of the network.
in the aggregate network, the king and queen   s importance
surpasses that of alice, as the relative change they cause in the freeman index of the network is larger.
not only this changes in the dynamic case (alice becomes more in   uential) but also the direction of
change is di   erent by the removal of alice. to understand these di   erentes we    rst recall that a smaller
freeman index means that the network looks more like a complete graph while a higher freeman index
implies that the network is more star-like. if one compares the aggregate network of fig. (2) with the
result depicted in fig. (3), by removing the node alice the network becomes less star-like, hence the
drop in the freeman index. in the dynamic case, depicted in fig.(4), the change in the index is larger,
when compared to the removal of the node queen or node king. this means that the node associated
with alice is more relevant as her actions are distributed along the text and not concentrated on a
few chapters at the end, as is the case of the queen and king. moreover, for the dynamic case, her
removal makes the average network more star-like as the remaining networks keep shifting from being
more centered on the queen or the king.

another way of seeing these results is depicted in fig. (6), where we plot what the eigenvector
centrality of all characters would be if some (the most central ones) were to be removed from the network
(aggregate and dynamic cases). one can read two things from this graph. on the one hand, it gives
the centrality when everybody is in the story (red bars) and how these change as a certain character is
removed from the story (cyan for a network without alice, blue without the king and yellow without

the bars. dynamical case.

the queen). by removing alice all characters have the largest gain compared to their previous values,
which implies that alice has the highest vitality (in both cases, aggregate and dynamic). however, in
the dynamic case, the queen once again assumes a more prominent role than the king, a fact veri   ed
above when considering the freeman index of the network.

one could argue that alice   s network is too small and changes are not signi   cant.

in order to
validate the method in a larger data set we applied the same ideas to roland. in this case the di   erence
between aggregate and dynamic networks become more pronounced, as depicted in the    gures below.
for the sake of clarity we also plot the whole aggregate network of roland in fig. (7).

figure 7: the aggregate network of roland. only better known characters are indicated in the    gure.

for the aggregate network, if one deletes the node associated with roland the graph becomes more
star-like; one can see in fig. (7) that the action shifts to well-de   ned star structure of charlemagne,
since roland is not as well connected as charlemagne. however, in the dynamic case the opposite is
actually true: for the narrative, the absence of the node roland makes the network more distributed.
roland does not    gure as the center of attention, but subplots become more prominent. the dynamic
network captures the actions and their subplots.

fig. (11) for the eigenvector centrality is more surprising: in comparison to the network of aggre-
gated characters, which shows charlemagne as the most connected character (cf.    g. 7), the dynamic
case reveals that roland has on average a higher eigenvector centrality along the plot. if one thinks in
terms of time-independent network this result is counterintuitive but what it means is that roland, in
spite of having less connections, maintains more of them active during the plot, thus playing a more
prominent role as charlemagne does.

6 conclusion

in this work we applied the methods developed in [26] for    nding eigenvector-based centralities of
temporal networks and from these to determine the vitality and freeman index of characters of two

14

selected literary texts: lewis carroll   s alice adventures in wonderland and the anonymous epic poem
la chanson de roland. these two quantities are calculated using the vector-based centrality of a
character, which is given by eigenvector associated with the highest eigenvalue of a supra-centrality
matrix m de   ned in [26]. it is worth emphasizing that this method can be applied to any centrality
that can be expressed as a function of the adjacency matrix of the network [4].

our results con   rm the utility of this new approach, with results becoming more pronounced as
the network becomes bigger. the application of m o   ers new insights into evolving stories, picking
out the most important characters in a way that static networks do not. as for alice in wonderland,
the di   erences between static and dynamic network are there, but not in such a pronounced way, as
the story is rather short (12 chapters) and the number of characters small (32 in total). for roland,
however, the dynamic method selects roland as the most relevant character, in contrast to the static
case, where charlemagne is the character with highest vitality and freeman index. extrapolating these
ideas and techniques, we are left to wonder what kind of interpretations, answers or even predictions
one would be able to make when applying this approach to model temporal networks in other stories.
any such approach would of course demand knowning what the    right    questions to ask might be.

as for the amount of subjectivity associated with the construction of a network in literary context,
there is no staightforward solution nor the right network. as pointed along the text, there are several
networks which can be constructed from a set of nodes. the connections are contigent on the question
one is trying to answer. this does not make id177 a priori an invalid tool for the analysis
of complex relations between actors in a given setting. on the contrary, comparison between what
id177 predicts and reality should be used as a criterium for the validity of this approach, as
we hoped to have shown in the results we presented.

finally, there exists an enormous amount of texts which could be analyzed.

it is of course an
impossible task to read all of them, but if one is able to devise a way of systematically gathering
information from classics, id177, in particular temporal networks, may provide a kind of
network-theoretical signature to classify authors, genres and epochs.
