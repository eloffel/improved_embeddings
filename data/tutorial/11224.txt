abstract

understanding entailment and contradic-
tion is fundamental to understanding nat-
ural language, and id136 about entail-
ment and contradiction is a valuable test-
ing ground for the development of seman-
tic representations. however, machine
learning research in this area has been dra-
matically limited by the lack of large-scale
resources. to address this, we introduce
the stanford natural language id136
corpus, a new, freely available collection
of labeled sentence pairs, written by hu-
mans doing a novel grounded task based
on image captioning. at 570k pairs, it
is two orders of magnitude larger than
all other resources of its type. this in-
crease in scale allows lexicalized classi-
   ers to outperform some sophisticated ex-
isting entailment models, and it allows a
neural network-based model to perform
competitively on natural language infer-
ence benchmarks for the    rst time.

introduction

the semantic concepts of entailment and contra-
diction are central to all aspects of natural lan-
guage meaning (katz, 1972; van benthem, 2008),
from the lexicon to the content of entire texts.
thus, natural language id136 (nli)     charac-
terizing and using these relations in computational
systems (fyodorov et al., 2000; condoravdi et al.,
2003; bos and markert, 2005; dagan et al., 2006;
maccartney and manning, 2009)     is essential in
tasks ranging from information retrieval to seman-
tic parsing to commonsense reasoning.

nli has been addressed using a variety of tech-
niques, including those based on symbolic logic,
knowledge bases, and neural networks. in recent
years, it has become an important testing ground

for approaches employing distributed word and
phrase representations. distributed representa-
tions excel at capturing relations based in similar-
ity, and have proven effective at modeling simple
dimensions of meaning like evaluative sentiment
(e.g., socher et al. 2013), but it is less clear that
they can be trained to support the full range of
logical and commonsense id136s required for
nli (bowman et al., 2015; weston et al., 2015b;
weston et al., 2015a).
in a semeval 2014 task
aimed at evaluating distributed representations for
nli, the best-performing systems relied heavily
on additional features and reasoning capabilities
(marelli et al., 2014a).

our ultimate objective is to provide an empiri-
cal evaluation of learning-centered approaches to
nli, advancing the case for nli as a tool for
the evaluation of domain-general approaches to
semantic representation. however, in our view,
existing nli corpora do not permit such an as-
sessment. they are generally too small for train-
ing modern data-intensive, wide-coverage models,
many contain sentences that were algorithmically
generated, and they are often beset with indeter-
minacies of event and entity coreference that sig-
ni   cantly impact annotation quality.

to address this, this paper introduces the stan-
ford natural language id136 (snli) corpus,
a collection of sentence pairs labeled for entail-
ment, contradiction, and semantic independence.
at 570,152 sentence pairs, snli is two orders of
magnitude larger than all other resources of its
type. and, in contrast to many such resources,
all of its sentences and labels were written by hu-
mans in a grounded, naturalistic context. in a sepa-
rate validation phase, we collected four additional
judgments for each label for 56,941 of the exam-
ples. of these, 98% of cases emerge with a three-
annotator consensus, and 58% see a unanimous
consensus from all    ve annotators.

in this paper, we use this corpus to evaluate

(in the    rst position) the label used by the initial author of the pair.

a variety of models for natural language infer-
ence, including rule-based systems, simple lin-
ear classi   ers, and neural network-based models.
we    nd that two models achieve comparable per-
formance: a feature-rich classi   er model and a
neural network model centered around a long
short-term memory network (lstm; hochreiter
and schmidhuber 1997). we further evaluate the
lstm model by taking advantage of its ready sup-
port for id21, and show that it can be
adapted to an existing nli challenge task, yielding
the best reported performance by a neural network
model and approaching the overall state of the art.

2 a new corpus for nli
to date, the primary sources of annotated nli cor-
pora have been the recognizing textual entail-
ment (rte) challenge tasks.1 these are generally
high-quality, hand-labeled data sets, and they have
stimulated innovative logical and statistical mod-
els of natural language reasoning, but their small
size (fewer than a thousand examples each) limits
their utility as a testbed for learned distributed rep-
resentations. the data for the semeval 2014 task
called sentences involving compositional knowl-
edge (sick) is a step up in terms of size, but
only to 4,500 training examples, and its partly
automatic construction introduced some spurious
patterns into the data (marelli et al. 2014a,   6).
the denotation graph entailment set (young et
al., 2014) contains millions of examples of en-
tailments between sentences and arti   cially con-
structed short phrases, but it was labeled using
fully automatic methods, and is noisy enough that
it is probably suitable only as a source of sup-

plementary training data. outside the domain of
sentence-level entailment, levy et al. (2014) intro-
duce a large corpus of semi-automatically anno-
tated entailment examples between subject   verb   
object relation triples, and the second release of
the paraphrase database (pavlick et al., 2015) in-
cludes automatically generated entailment anno-
tations over a large corpus of pairs of words and
short phrases.

existing resources suffer from a subtler issue
impacts even projects using only human-
that
provided annotations:
indeterminacies of event
and entity coreference lead to insurmountable in-
determinacy concerning the correct semantic la-
bel (de marneffe et al. 2008   4.3; marelli et al.
2014b). for an example of the pitfalls surround-
ing entity coreference, consider the sentence pair
a boat sank in the paci   c ocean and a boat sank
in the atlantic ocean. the pair could be labeled
as a contradiction if one assumes that the two sen-
tences refer to the same single event, but could
also be reasonably labeled as neutral if that as-
sumption is not made. in order to ensure that our
labeling scheme assigns a single correct label to
every pair, we must select one of these approaches
across the board, but both choices present prob-
lems.
if we opt not to assume that events are
coreferent, then we will only ever    nd contradic-
tions between sentences that make broad univer-
sal assertions, but if we opt to assume coreference,
new counterintuitive predictions emerge. for ex-
ample, ruth bader ginsburg was appointed to the
us supreme court and i had a sandwich for lunch
today would unintuitively be labeled as a contra-
diction, rather than neutral, under this assumption.
entity coreference presents a similar kind of in-
determinacy, as in the pair a tourist visited new

york and a tourist visited the city. assuming
coreference between new york and the city justi-
   es labeling the pair as an entailment, but with-
out that assumption the city could be taken to refer
to a speci   c unknown city, leaving the pair neu-
tral. this kind of indeterminacy of label can be re-
solved only once the questions of coreference are
resolved.

with snli, we sought to address the issues of
size, quality, and indeterminacy. to do this, we
employed a id104 framework with the
following crucial innovations. first, the exam-
ples were grounded in speci   c scenarios, and the
premise and hypothesis sentences in each exam-
ple were constrained to describe that scenario from
the same perspective, which helps greatly in con-
trolling event and entity coreference.2 second, the
prompt gave participants the freedom to produce
entirely novel sentences within the task setting,
which led to richer examples than we see with the
more proscribed string-editing techniques of ear-
lier approaches, without sacri   cing consistency.
third, a subset of the resulting sentences were sent
to a validation task aimed at providing a highly re-
liable set of annotations over the same data, and at
identifying areas of inferential uncertainty.

2.1 data collection
we used amazon mechanical turk for data col-
lection.
in each individual task (each hit), a
worker was presented with premise scene descrip-
tions from a pre-existing corpus, and asked to
supply hypotheses for each of our three labels   
entailment, neutral, and contradiction   forcing
the data to be balanced among these classes.

the instructions that we provided to the work-
ers are shown in figure 1. below the instructions
were three    elds for each of three requested sen-
tences, corresponding to our entailment, neutral,
and contradiction labels, a fourth    eld (marked
optional) for reporting problems, and a link to an
faq page. that faq grew over the course of
data collection. it warned about disallowed tech-
niques (e.g., reusing the same sentence for many
different prompts, which we saw in a few cases),
provided guidance concerning sentence length and

caption    two dogs are running through a    eld.   
you could write    there are animals outdoors.   

    write one alternate caption that might be a true

tion    two dogs are running through a    eld.    you
could write    some puppies are running to catch a
stick.   

    write one alternate caption that is de   nitely a
false description of the photo. example: for the
caption    two dogs are running through a    eld.   
you could write    the pets are sitting on a couch.   
this is different from the maybe correct category
because it   s impossible for the dogs to be both
running and sitting.

complexity (we did not enforce a minimum length,
and we allowed bare nps as well as full sen-
tences), and reviewed logistical issues around pay-
ment timing. about 2,500 workers contributed.

for the premises, we used captions from the
flickr30k corpus (young et al., 2014), a collection
of approximately 160k captions (corresponding to
about 30k images) collected in an earlier crowd-
sourced effort.3 the captions were not authored
by the photographers who took the source images,
and they tend to contain relatively literal scene de-
scriptions that are suited to our approach, rather
than those typically associated with personal pho-
tographs (as in their example: our trip to the
olympic peninsula). in order to ensure that the la-
bel for each sentence pair can be recovered solely
based on the available text, we did not use the im-
ages at all during corpus collection.

table 2 reports some key statistics about the col-
lected corpus, and figure 2 shows the distributions
of sentence lengths for both our source hypotheses
and our newly collected premises. we observed
that while premise sentences varied considerably
in length, hypothesis sentences tended to be as

2 issues of coreference are not completely solved, but
greatly mitigated. for example, with the premise sentence
a dog is lying in the grass, a worker could safely assume that
the dog is the most prominent thing in the photo, and very
likely the only dog, and build contradicting sentences assum-
ing reference to the same dog.

3 we additionally include about 4k sentence pairs from
a pilot study in which the premise sentences were instead
drawn from the visualgenome corpus (under construction;
visualgenome.org). these examples appear only in the
training set, and have pair identi   ers pre   xed with vg in our
corpus.

formation to yield a clear judgment, id91 at
around seven words. we also observed that the
bulk of the sentences from both sources were syn-
tactically complete rather than fragments, and the
frequency with which the parser produces a parse
rooted with an    s    (sentence) node attests to this.

2.2 data validation
in order to measure the quality of our corpus,
and in order to construct maximally useful test-
ing and development sets, we performed an addi-
tional round of validation for about 10% of our
data. this validation phase followed the same
basic form as the mechanical turk labeling task
used to label the sick entailment data: we pre-
sented workers with pairs of sentences in batches
of    ve, and asked them to choose a single label
for each pair. we supplied each pair to four an-
notators, yielding    ve labels per pair including the
label used by the original author. the instructions
were similar to the instructions for initial data col-
lection shown in figure 1, and linked to a similar
faq. though we initially used a very restrictive
quali   cation (based on past approval rate) to se-
lect workers for the validation task, we nonethe-
less discovered (and deleted) some instances of
random guessing in an early batch of work, and
subsequently instituted a fully closed quali   cation
restricted to about 30 trusted workers.

for each pair that we validated, we assigned a
gold label. if any one of the three labels was cho-
sen by at least three of the    ve annotators, it was

figure 2: the distribution of sentence length.

chosen as the gold label. if there was no such con-
sensus, which occurred in about 2% of cases, we
assigned the placeholder label    -   . while these un-
labeled examples are included in the corpus dis-
tribution, they are unlikely to be helpful for the
standard nli classi   cation task, and we do not in-
clude them in either training or evaluation in the
experiments that we discuss in this paper.

the results of this validation process are sum-
marized in table 3. nearly all of the examples
received a majority label, indicating broad con-
sensus about the nature of the data and categories.
the gold-labeled examples are very nearly evenly
distributed across the three labels. the fleiss
   scores (computed over every example with a
full    ve annotations) are likely to be conservative
given our large and unevenly distributed pool of
annotators, but they still provide insights about the
levels of disagreement across the three semantic
classes. this disagreement likely re   ects not just
the limitations of large id104 efforts but
also the uncertainty inherent in naturalistic nli.
regardless, the overall rate of agreement is ex-
tremely high, suggesting that the corpus is suf   -
ciently high quality to pose a challenging but real-
istic machine learning task.

2.3 the distributed corpus
table 1 shows a set of randomly chosen validated
examples from the development set with their la-
bels. qualitatively, we    nd the data that we col-
lected draws fairly extensively on commonsense
knowledge, and that hypothesis and premise sen-
tences often differ structurally in signi   cant ways,
suggesting that there is room for improvement be-
yond super   cial word alignment models. we also

prove the parse quality of the descriptive sentences
and noun phrases found in the descriptions.

ticular, since it is dramatically larger than any ex-
isting corpus of comparable quality, we expect it to
be suitable for training parameter-rich models like
neural networks, which have not previously been
competitive at this task. our ability to evaluate
standard classi   er-base nli models, however, was
limited to those which were designed to scale to
snli   s size without modi   cation, so a more com-
plete comparison of approaches will have to wait
for future work. in this section, we explore the per-
formance of three classes of models which could
scale readily: (i) models from a well-known nli
system, the excitement open platform; (ii) vari-
ants of a strong but simple feature-based classi-
   er model, which makes use of both unlexicalized
and lexicalized features, and (iii) distributed repre-
sentation models, including a baseline model and
neural network sequence models.

3.1 excitement open platform models
the    rst class of models is from the excitement
open platform (eop, pad  o et al. 2014; magnini
et al. 2014)   an open source platform for rte re-
search. eop is a tool for quickly developing nli
systems while sharing components such as com-
mon lexical resources and evaluation sets. we
evaluate on two algorithms included in the dis-
tribution: a simple edit-distance based algorithm
and a classi   er-based algorithm, the latter both in
a bare form and augmented with eop   s full suite
of lexical resources.

our initial goal was to better understand the dif-
   culty of the task of classifying snli corpus in-
ferences, rather than necessarily the performance
of a state-of-the-art rte system. we approached
this by running the same system on several data
sets: our own test set, the sick test data, and the
standard rte-3 test set (giampiccolo et al., 2007).
we report results in table 4. each of the models

was separately trained on the training set of each
corpus. all models are evaluated only on 2-class
entailment. to convert 3-class problems like sick
and snli to this setting, all instances of contradic-
tion and unknown are converted to nonentailment.
this yields a most-frequent-class baseline accu-
racy of 66% on snli, and 71% on sick. this is
intended primarily to demonstrate the dif   culty of
the task, rather than necessarily the performance
of a state-of-the-art rte system. the edit dis-
tance algorithm tunes the weight of the three case-
insensitive id153 operations on the train-
ing set, after removing stop words.
in addition
to the base classi   er-based system distributed with
the platform, we train a variant which includes in-
formation from id138 (miller, 1995) and verb-
ocean (chklovski and pantel, 2004), and makes
use of features based on tree patterns and depen-
dency tree skeletons (wang and neumann, 2007).

3.2 lexicalized classi   er
unlike the rte datasets, snli   s size supports ap-
proaches which make use of rich lexicalized fea-
tures. we evaluate a simple lexicalized classi   er
to explore the ability of non-specialized models to
exploit these features in lieu of more involved lan-
guage understanding. our classi   er implements 6
feature types; 3 unlexicalized and 3 lexicalized:

1. the id7 score of the hypothesis with re-
spect to the premise, using an id165 length
between 1 and 4.

2. the length difference between the hypothesis

and the premise, as a real-valued feature.

3. the overlap between words in the premise
and hypothesis, both as an absolute count and
a percentage of possible overlap, and both
over all words and over just nouns, verbs, ad-
jectives, and adverbs.

4. an indicator for every unigram and bigram in

the hypothesis.

5. cross-unigrams:

for every pair of words
across the premise and hypothesis which
share a pos tag, an indicator feature over the
two words.

6. cross-bigrams:

for every pair of bigrams
across the premise and hypothesis which
share a pos tag on the second word, an in-
dicator feature over the two bigrams.

we report results in table 5, along with abla-
tion studies for removing the cross-bigram fea-
tures (leaving only the cross-unigram feature) and

table 5: 3-class accuracy, training on either our
data or sick, including models lacking cross-
bigram features (feature 6), and lacking all lexical
features (features 4   6). we report results both on
the test set and the training set to judge over   tting.

for removing all lexicalized features. on our large
corpus in particular, there is a substantial jump in
accuracy from using lexicalized features, and an-
other from using the very sparse cross-bigram fea-
tures. the latter result suggests that there is value
in letting the classi   er automatically learn to rec-
ognize structures like explicit negations and adjec-
tive modi   cation. a similar result was shown in
wang and manning (2012) for bigram features in
id31.

it is surprising that the classi   er performs as
well as it does without any notion of alignment
or tree transformations. although we expect that
richer models would perform better, the results
suggest that given enough data, cross bigrams with
the noisy part-of-speech overlap constraint can
produce an effective model.

3.3 sentence embeddings and nli
snli is suitably large and diverse to make it pos-
sible to train neural network models that produce
distributed representations of sentence meaning.
in this section, we compare the performance of
three such models on the corpus. to focus specif-
ically on the strengths of these models at produc-
ing informative sentence representations, we use
sentence embedding as an intermediate step in the
nli classi   cation task: each model must produce
a vector representation of each of the two sen-
tences without using any context from the other
sentence, and the two resulting vectors are then
passed to a neural network classi   er which pre-
dicts the label for the pair. this choice allows us to
focus on existing models for sentence embedding,
and it allows us to evaluate the ability of those
models to learn useful representations of mean-
ing (which may be independently useful for sub-
sequent tasks), at the cost of excluding from con-

shown here.

sideration possible strong neural models for nli
that directly compare the two inputs at the word or
phrase level.

our neural network classi   er, depicted in fig-
ure 3 (and based on a one-layer model in bow-
man et al. 2015), is simply a stack of three 200d
tanh layers, with the bottom layer taking the con-
catenated sentence representations as input and the
top layer feeding a softmax classi   er, all trained
jointly with the sentence embedding model itself.
we test three sentence embedding models, each
set to use 100d phrase and sentence embeddings.
our baseline sentence embedding model simply
sums the embeddings of the words in each sen-
tence. in addition, we experiment with two simple
sequence embedding models: a plain id56 and an
lstm id56 (hochreiter and schmidhuber, 1997).
the id27s for all of the models are
initialized with the 300d reference glove vectors
(840b token version, pennington et al. 2014) and
   ne-tuned as part of training.
in addition, all
of the models use an additional tanh neural net-
work layer to map these 300d embeddings into
the lower-dimensional phrase and sentence em-
bedding space. all of the models are randomly
initialized using standard techniques and trained
using adadelta (zeiler, 2012) minibatch sgd un-
til performance on the development set stops im-
proving. we applied l2 id173 to all mod-
els, manually tuning the strength coef   cient    for
each, and additionally applied dropout (srivastava
et al., 2014) to the inputs and outputs of the sen-

connections) with a    xed dropout rate. all mod-
els were implemented in a common framework for
this paper, and the implementations will be made
available at publication time.

the results are shown in table 6. the sum
of words model performed slightly worse than
the fundamentally similar lexicalized classi   er   
while the sum of words model can use pretrained
id27s to better handle rare words, it
lacks even the rudimentary sensitivity to word or-
der that the lexicalized model   s bigram features
provide. of the two id56 models, the lstm   s
more robust ability to learn long-term dependen-
cies serves it well, giving it a substantial advan-
tage over the plain id56, and resulting in perfor-
mance that is essentially equivalent to the lexical-
ized classi   er on the test set (lstm performance
near the stopping iteration varies by up to 0.5%
between evaluation steps). while the lexicalized
model    ts the training set almost perfectly, the gap
between train and test set accuracy is relatively
small for all three neural network models, suggest-
ing that research into signi   cantly higher capacity
versions of these models would be productive.

3.4 analysis and discussion
figure 4 shows a learning curve for the lstm and
the lexicalized and unlexicalized feature-based
models. it shows that the large size of the corpus
is crucial to both the lstm and the lexicalized
model, and suggests that additional data would
yield still better performance for both.
in addi-
tion, though the lstm and the lexicalized model
show similar performance when trained on the cur-
rent full corpus, the somewhat steeper slope for
the lstm hints that its ability to learn arbitrar-
ily structured representations of sentence mean-
ing may give it an advantage over the more con-
strained lexicalized model on still larger datasets.
we were struck by the speed with which the
lexicalized classi   er outperforms its unlexicalized

this kind of id136 through lexical cues can lead
them astray. some of these examples have quali-
ties reminiscent of winograd schemas (winograd,
1972; levesque, 2013). for example, all the mod-
els wrongly predict entailment for a young girl
throws sand toward the ocean/a girl can   t stand
the ocean, presumably because of distributional
associations between throws and can   t stand.

analysis of the models    predictions also yields
insights into the extent to which they grapple with
event and entity coreference. for the most part, the
original image prompts contained a focal element
that the caption writer identi   ed with a syntac-
tic subject, following information structuring con-
ventions associating subjects and topics in english
(ward and birner, 2004). our annotators generally
followed suit, writing sentences that, while struc-
turally diverse, share topic/focus (theme/rheme)
structure with their premises. this promotes a
coherent, situation-speci   c construal of each sen-
tence pair. this is information that our models
can easily take advantage of, but it can lead them
astray. for instance, all of them stumble with the
amusingly simple case a woman prepares ingre-
dients for a bowl of soup/a soup bowl prepares a
woman, in which prior expectations about paral-
lelism are not met. another headline example of
this type is a man wearing padded arm protec-
tion is being bitten by a german shepherd dog/a
man bit a dog, which all the models wrongly di-
agnose as entailment, though the sentences report
two very different stories. a model with access
to explicit information about syntactic or semantic
structure should perform better on cases like these.

4 id21 with sick

to the extent that successfully training a neural
network model like our lstm on snli forces that
model to encode broadly accurate representations
of english scene descriptions and to build an en-
tailment classi   er over those relations, we should
expect it to be readily possible to adapt the trained
model for use on other nli tasks. in this section,
we evaluate on the sick entailment task using a
simple id21 method (pratt et al., 1991)
and achieve competitive results.

to perform transfer, we take the parameters of
the lstm id56 model trained on snli and use
them to initialize a new model, which is trained
from that point only on the training portion of
sick. the only newly initialized parameters are

figure 4:
a learning curve showing how the
baseline classi   ers and the lstm perform when
trained to convergence on varied amounts of train-
ing data. the y-axis starts near a random-chance
accuracy of 33%. the minibatch size of 64 that
we used to tune the lstm sets a lower bound on
data for that model.

counterpart. with only 100 training examples, the
cross-bigram classi   er is already performing bet-
ter. empirically, we    nd that the top weighted
features for the classi   er trained on 100 examples
tend to be high precision entailments; e.g., playing
    outside (most scenes are outdoors), a banana
    person eating. if relatively few spurious entail-
ments get high weight   as it appears is the case   
then it makes sense that, when these do    re, they
boost accuracy in identifying entailments.

there are revealing patterns in the errors com-
mon to all the models considered here. despite
the large size of the training corpus and the distri-
butional information captured by glove initializa-
tion, many lexical relationships are still misana-
lyzed, leading to incorrect predictions of indepen-
dent, even for pairs that are common in the train-
ing corpus like beach/surf and sprinter/runner.
semantic mistakes at the phrasal level (e.g., pre-
dicting contradiction for a male is placing an
order in a deli/a man buying a sandwich at a
deli) indicate that additional attention to composi-
tional semantics would pay off. however, many of
the persistent problems run deeper, to id136s
that depend on world knowledge and context-
speci   c id136s, as in the entailment pair a race
car driver leaps from a burning car/a race car
driver escaping danger, for which both the lex-
icalized classi   er and the lstm predict neutral.
in other cases, the models    attempts to shortcut

softmax layer parameters and the embeddings for
words that appear in sick, but not in snli (which
are populated with glove embeddings as above).
we use the same model hyperparameters that were
used to train the original model, with the excep-
tion of the l2 id173 strength, which is
re-tuned. we additionally transfer the accumula-
tors that are used by adadelta to set the learn-
ing rates. this lowers the starting learning rates,
and is intended to ensure that the model does not
learn too quickly in its    rst few epochs after trans-
fer and destroy the knowledge accumulated in the
pre-transfer phase of training.

the results are shown in table 7. training
on sick alone yields poor performance, and the
model trained on snli fails when tested on sick
data, labeling more neutral examples as contradic-
tions than correctly, possibly as a result of subtle
differences in how the labeling task was presented.
in contrast, transferring snli representations to
sick yields the best performance yet reported for
an unaugmented neural network model, surpasses
the available eop models, and approaches both
the overall state of the art at 84.6% (lai and hock-
enmaier, 2014) and the 84% level of interannota-
tor agreement, which likely represents an approx-
imate performance ceiling. this suggests that the
introduction of a large high-quality corpus makes
it possible to train representation-learning models
for sentence meaning that are competitive with the
best hand-engineered models on id136 tasks.

we attempted to apply this same transfer evalu-
ation technique to the rte-3 challenge, but found
that the small training set (800 examples) did not
allow the model to adapt to the unfamiliar genre of
text used in that corpus, such that no training con-
   guration yielded competitive performance. fur-
ther research on effective id21 on
small data sets with neural models might facilitate
improvements here.

5 conclusion

natural languages are powerful vehicles for rea-
soning, and nearly all questions about meaning-
fulness in language can be reduced to questions of
entailment and contradiction in context. this sug-
gests that nli is an ideal testing ground for the-
ories of semantic representation, and that training
for nli tasks can provide rich domain-general se-
mantic representations. to date, however, it has
not been possible to fully realize this potential due
to the limited nature of existing nli resources.
this paper sought to remedy this with a new, large-
scale, naturalistic corpus of sentence pairs labeled
for entailment, contradiction, and independence.
we used this corpus to evaluate a range of models,
and found that both simple lexicalized models and
neural network models perform well, and that the
representations learned by a neural network model
on our corpus can be used to dramatically improve
performance on a standard challenge dataset. we
hope that snli presents valuable training data and
a challenging testbed for the continued application
of machine learning to semantic representation.
