abstract

open domain id36 systems iden-
tify relation and argument phrases in a sen-
tence without
relying on any underlying
schema. however, current state-of-the-art re-
lation extraction systems are available only
for english because of their heavy reliance
on linguistic tools such as part-of-speech tag-
gers and dependency parsers. we present a
cross-lingual annotation projection method for
language independent id36. we
evaluate our method on a manually annotated
test set and present results on three typolog-
ically different languages. we release these
manual annotations and extracted relations in
61 languages from wikipedia.

introduction

1
id36 (re) is the task of assigning a
semantic relationship between a pair of arguments.
the two major types of re are closed domain and
open domain re. while closed-domain re systems
(bunescu and mooney, 2005; bunescu, 2007; mintz
et al., 2009; yao and van durme, 2014; berant
and liang, 2014) consider only a closed set of re-
lationships between two arguments, open domain
systems (yates et al., 2007; carlson et al., 2010;
fader et al., 2011; mausam et al., 2012) use an ar-
bitrary phrase to specify a relationship. in this pa-
per, we focus on open-domain re for multiple lan-
guages. although there are advantages to closed
domain re (banko and etzioni, 2008), it is expen-
sive to construct a closed set of relation types which
would be meaningful across multiple languages.

open re systems extract patterns from sentences
in a given language to identify relations. for learn-

ing these patterns, the sentences are analyzed using a
part of speech tagger, a dependency parser and pos-
sibly a named-entity recognizer. in languages other
than english, these tools are either unavailable or not
accurate enough to be used. in comparison, it is eas-
ier to obtain parallel bilingual corpora which can be
used to build machine translation systems (resnik
and smith, 2003; smith et al., 2013).

in this paper, we present a system that performs
re on a sentence in a source language by    rst trans-
lating the sentence to english, performing re in en-
glish, and    nally projecting the relation phrase back
to the source language sentence. our system as-
sumes the availability of a machine translation sys-
tem from a source language to english and an open
re system in english but no any other analysis tool
in the source language. the main contributions of
this work are:

    a pipeline to develop id36 sys-

tem for any source language.

    extracted open relations in 61 languages based

on wikipedia corpus.

    manual judgements for the projected relations

in three languages.

we    rst describe our methodology for language
independent cross-lingual projection of extracted re-
lations (  2) followed by the relation annotation pro-
cedure and the results (  3). the manually anno-
tated relations in 3 languages and the automati-
cally extracted relations in 61 languages are avail-
able at: http://cs.cmu.edu/  mfaruqui/

tracted relation (godse; killed; gandhi) can be ex-
pressed by the dependency pattern: arg1     nsubj

malizes the relation phrase for some of the phrases,

2.2 cross-lingual relation projection
we next describe an algorithm to project the ex-
tracted relation tuples in english back to the source
language sentence. given a source sentence, the
google translate api provides us its transla-
tion along with the word-to-word alignments rela-
tive to the source. if s = sn

the source and its english translation, then the align-
ment a = {aij : 1     i     n ; 1     j     m} where,

4example borrowed from mausam et al. (2012)
5for sentences where the veracity of a relation depends on
a clause, ollie also outputs the clause. for example, in early
astronomers believed that earth is the center of the universe,
the relation (earth; be center of; universe) is supplemented by
an (attributedto: believe; early astronomers) clause. we ignore
this clausal information.

lingual id36 pipeline.

2 multilingual id36
our method of re for a sentence s = (cid:104)s1, s2, . . . sn(cid:105)
in a non-english language consists of three steps: (1)
translation of s into english, that generates a sen-
tence t = (cid:104)t1, t2, . . . tm(cid:105) with word alignments a
relative to s, (2) open re on t, and (3) relation pro-
jection from t to s. figure 1 shows an example of re
in spanish using our proposed pipeline.1 we employ
ollie2 (mausam et al., 2012) for re in english and
google translate3 api for translation from the
source language to english, although in principle,
we could use any translation system to translate the
language to english. we next describe each of these
components.

2.1 id36 in english
suppose t = (cid:104)t1, t2, . . . , tm(cid:105) is a tokenized english
sentence. open id36 computes triples
of non-overlapping phrases (arg1; rel; arg2) from
the sentence t. the two arguments arg1 and arg2
are connected by the relation phrase rel.

we utilized ollie (mausam et al., 2012) to ex-
tract the relation tuples for every english sentence.
we chose ollie because it has been shown to
give a higher yield at comparable precision rela-
tive to other open re systems such as reverb
and woeparse (mausam et al., 2012). ollie was
trained by extracting dependency path patterns on
annotated training data. this training data was boot-
strapped from a set of high precision seed tuples ex-
tracted from a simpler re system reverb (fader

naive word-alignment based projection would map
every word from a phrase extracted in english to the
source sentence. this algorithm has two drawbacks:
   rst, since the word alignments are many-to-many,
each english word can be possibly mapped to more
than one source word which leads to ambiguity in its
projection; second, a word level mapping can pro-
duce non-contiguous phrases in the source sentence,
which are hard to interpret semantically.

to tackle these problems, we introduce a novel
algorithm that incorporates a id7 score (papineni
et al., 2002) based phrase similarity metric to per-
form cross-lingual projection of relations. given
a source sentence, its translation, and the word-
to-word alignment, we    rst extract phrase-pairs p
using the phrase-extract algorithm (och and ney,
2004). in each extracted phrase pair (phrs, phrt)    
p , phrs and phrt are contiguous word sequences in
s and t respectively. we next determine the trans-
lations of arg1, rel and arg2 from the extracted
phrase-pairs.
for each english phrase p     {arg1, rel, arg2}, we
   rst obtain the phrase-pair (phrs, phrt)     p such
that phrt has the highest id7 score relative to
p subject to the condition that p     phrt
(cid:54)=     i.e,
there is at least one word overlap between the two
phrases. this condition is necessary since we use
id7 score with smoothing and may obtain a non-
zero id7 score even with zero word overlap. if
there are multiple phrase-pairs in p that correspond
to the same target phrase phrt, we select the shortest
source phrase (phrs). however, if there is no word
overlap between the target phrase p and any of the
target phrases in p , we project the phrase using the
word-alignment based projection. the cross-lingual
projection method is presented in algorithm 1.

3 experiments

evaluation for open relations is a dif   cult task with
no standard evaluation datasets. we    rst describe the
construction of our multilingual id36
dataset and then present the experiments.

annotation. the current approach to evaluation
for open relations (fader et al., 2011; mausam et
al., 2012) is to extract relations from a sentence
and manually annotate each relation as either valid

for exam-
(1) or invalid (0) for the sentence.
in the sentence:    michelle obama, wife of
ple,
barack obama was born in chicago   , the follow-
ing are possible annotations: a) (michelle obama;
born in; chicago): 1, b) (barack obama; born in;
chicago): 0. such binary annotations are not avail-
able for languages apart from english. further-
more, a binary 1/0 label is a coarse annotation that
could unfairly penalize an extracted relation which
has the correct semantics but is slightly ungrammat-
ical. this could occur either when prepositions are
dropped from the relation phrase or when there is an
ambiguity in the boundary of the relation phrase.

therefore to evaluate our multilingual relation ex-
traction framework, we obtained annotations from
professional linguists for three typologically differ-
ent languages: french, hindi, and russian. the an-
notation task is as follows: given a sentence and
a pair of arguments (extracted automatically from
the sentence), the annotator identi   es the most rel-
evant contiguous relation phrase from the sentence
that establishes a plausible connection between the
two arguments. if there is no meaningful contigu-
ous relation phrase between the two arguments, the
arguments are considered invalid and hence, the ex-
tracted relation tuple from the sentence is considered
incorrect.

given the human annotated relation phrase and
the automatically extracted relation phrase, we can
measure the similarity between the two, thus alle-
viating the problem of coarse annotation in binary
judgments. for evaluation, we    rst report the per-
centage of valid arguments. then for sentences with
valid arguments, we use smoothed sentence-level
id7 score (max id165 order = 3) to measure the
similarity of the automatically extracted relation rel-
ative to the human annotated relation.6

results. we extracted relations from the entire
wikipedia7 corpus in russian, french and hindi
from all sentences whose lengths are in the range
of 10     30 words. we randomly selected 1, 000
relations for each of these languages and annotated
them. the results are shown in table 1. the percent-
6we obtained two annotations for     300 russian sentences.
between the two annotations, the perfect agreement rate was
74.5% and the average id7 score was 0.85.

age of valid extractions is highest in french (81.6%)
followed by hindi and russian (64.0%). surpris-
ingly, russian obtains the lowest percentage of valid
relations but has the highest id7 score between
the automatic and the human extracted relations.
this could be attributed to the fact that the average
relation length (in number of words) is the shortest
for russian. from table 1, we observe that the length
of the relation phrase is inversely correlated with the
id7 score.

of extracted relations across bins of similar id7
scores.

cross-lingual projection has been used for transfer
of syntactic (yarowsky and ngai, 2001; hwa et al.,
2005) and semantic information (riloff et al., 2002;

ing interest in re for languages other than english.

5 conclusion

we have presented a language independent open do-
main id36 pipeline and have evalu-
ated its performance on three typologically differ-
ent languages: french, hindi and russian. our
cross-lingual projection method utilizes ollie and
google translate to extract relations in the
language of interest. our approach does not rely
on the availability of linguistic resources such as
pos-taggers or dependency parsers in the target lan-
guage and can thus be extended to multiple lan-
guages supported by a machine translation system.
we are releasing the manually annotated judgements
for open relations in the three languages and the
open relations extracted over the entire wikipedia
corpus in 61 languages. the resources are avail-
able at: http://cs.cmu.edu/  mfaruqui/
