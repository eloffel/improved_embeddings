abstract

verbs play a critical role in the meaning of
sentences, but these ubiquitous words have re-
ceived little attention in recent distributional se-
mantics research. we introduce simverb-3500,
an evaluation resource that provides human
ratings for the similarity of 3,500 verb pairs.
simverb-3500 covers all normed verb types
from the usf free-association database, pro-
viding at least three examples for every verb-
net class. this broad coverage facilitates de-
tailed analyses of how syntactic and seman-
tic phenomena together in   uence human un-
derstanding of verb meaning. further, with
signi   cantly larger development and test sets
than existing benchmarks, simverb-3500 en-
ables more robust evaluation of representation
learning architectures and promotes the devel-
opment of methods tailored to verbs. we hope
that simverb-3500 will enable a richer under-
standing of the diversity and complexity of
verb semantics and guide the development of
systems that can effectively represent and in-
terpret this meaning.

introduction

1
verbs are famously both complex and variable. they
express the semantics of an event as well the rela-
tional information among participants in that event,
and they display a rich range of syntactic and seman-
tic behaviour (jackendoff, 1972; gruber, 1976; levin,
1993). verbs play a key role at almost every level of
linguistic analysis. information related to their predi-
cate argument structure can bene   t many nlp tasks
(e.g. parsing, semantic role labelling, information ex-
traction) and applications (e.g. machine translation,

id111) as well as research on human language
acquisition and processing (korhonen, 2010). precise
methods for representing and understanding verb se-
mantics will undoubtedly be necessary for machines
to interpret the meaning of sentences with similar
accuracy to humans.

numerous algorithms for acquiring word represen-
tations from text and/or more structured knowledge
bases have been developed in recent years (mikolov
et al., 2013a; pennington et al., 2014; faruqui et al.,
2015). these representations (or embeddings) typ-
ically contain powerful features that are applicable
to many language applications (collobert and we-
ston, 2008; turian et al., 2010). nevertheless, the
predominant approaches to distributed representation
learning apply a single learning algorithm and repre-
sentational form for all words in a vocabulary. this
is despite evidence that applying different learning
algorithms to word types such as nouns, adjectives
and verbs can signi   cantly increase the ultimate use-
fulness of representations (schwartz et al., 2015).

one factor behind the lack of more nuanced word
representation learning methods is the scarcity of sat-
isfactory ways to evaluate or analyse representations
of particular word types. resources such as men
(bruni et al., 2014), rare words (luong et al., 2013)
and siid113x-999 (hill et al., 2015) focus either on
words from a single class or small samples of differ-
ent word types, with automatic approaches already
reaching or surpassing the inter-annotator agreement
ceiling. consequently, for word classes such as verbs,
whose semantics is critical for language understand-
ing, it is practically impossible to achieve statistically
robust analyses and comparisons between different

representation learning architectures.

to overcome this barrier to verb semantics re-
search, we introduce simverb-3500     an extensive
intrinsic evaluation resource that is unprecedented
in both size and coverage. simverb-3500 includes
827 verb types from the university of south florida
free association norms (usf) (nelson et al., 2004),
and at least 3 member verbs from each of the 101
top-level verbnet classes (kipper et al., 2008). this
coverage enables researchers to better understand
the complex diversity of syntactic-semantic verb be-
haviours, and provides direct links to other estab-
lished semantic resources such as id138 (miller,
1995) and propbank (palmer et al., 2005). more-
over, the large standardised development and test sets
in simverb-3500 allow for principled tuning of hy-
perparameters, a critical aspect of achieving strong
performance with the latest representation learning
architectures.

in    2, we discuss previous evaluation resources
targeting verb similarity. we present
the new
simverb-3500 data set along with our design choices
and the pair selection process in    3, while the anno-
tation process is detailed in    4. in    5 we report the
performance of a diverse range of popular representa-
tion learning architectures, together with benchmark
performance on existing evaluation sets. in    6, we
show how simverb-3500 enables a variety of new
linguistic analyses, which were previously impossi-
ble due to the lack of coverage and scale in existing
resources.

2 related work

a natural way to evaluate representation quality is by
judging the similarity of representations assigned to
similar words. the most popular evaluation sets at
present consist of word pairs with similarity ratings
produced by human annotators.1 nevertheless, we
   nd that all available datasets of this kind are insuf-
   cient for judging verb similarity due to their small
size or narrow coverage of verbs.

in particular, a number of word pair evaluation
sets are prominent in the id65

1in some existing evaluation sets pairs are scored for relat-
edness which has some overlap with similarity. simverb-3500
focuses on similarity as this is a more focused semantic rela-
tion that seems to yield a higher agreement between human
annotators. for a broader discussion see (hill et al., 2015).

literature.

representative examples include rg-65 (ruben-
stein and goodenough, 1965) and wordsim-353
(finkelstein et al., 2002; agirre et al., 2009) which
are small (65 and 353 word pairs, respectively).
larger evaluation sets such as the rare words evalu-
ation set (luong et al., 2013) (2034 word pairs) and
the evaluations sets from silberer and lapata (2014)
are dominated by noun pairs and the former also fo-
cuses on low-frequency phenomena. therefore, these
datasets do not provide a representative sample of
verbs (hill et al., 2015).

two datasets that do focus on verb pairs to some
extent are the data set of baker et al. (2014) and
siid113x-999 (hill et al., 2015). these datasets, how-
ever, still contain a limited number of verb pairs (134
and 222, respectively), making them unrepresentative
of the rich variety of verb semantic phenomena.

in this paper we provide a remedy for this problem
by presenting a more comprehensive and representa-
tive verb pair evaluation resource.

3 the simverb-3500 data set

in this section, we discuss the design principles be-
hind simverb-3500. we    rst demonstrate that a new
evaluation resource for verb similarity is a necessity.
we then describe how the    nal verb pairs were se-
lected with the goal to be representative, that is, to
guarantee a wide coverage of two standard semantic
resources: usf and verbnet.

3.1 design motivation
hill et al. (2015) argue that comprehensive high-
quality evaluation resources have to satisfy the fol-
lowing three criteria: (c1) representative (the re-
source covers the full range of concepts occurring
in natural language); (c2) clearly de   ned (it clearly
de   nes the annotated relation, e.g., similarity); (c3)
consistent and reliable (untrained native speakers
must be able to quantify the target relation consis-
tently relying on simple instructions).

building on the same annotation guidelines as
siid113x-999 that explicitly targets similarity, we en-
sure that criteria c2 and c3 are satis   ed. however,
even siid113x, as the most extensive evaluation re-
source for verb similarity available at present, is still
of limited size, spanning only 222 verb pairs and 170

distinct verb lemmas in total. given that 39 out of the
101 top-level verbnet classes are not represented at
all in siid113x, while 20 classes have only one mem-
ber verb,2 one may conclude that the criterion c1 is
not at all satis   ed with current resources.

there is another fundamental limitation of all
current verb similarity evaluation resources: auto-
matic approaches have reached or surpassed the inter-
annotator agreement ceiling. for instance, while the
average pairwise correlation between annotators on
sl-222 is spearman   s    correlation of 0.717, the
best performing automatic system reaches    = 0.727
(mrk  i  c et al., 2016). simverb-3500 does not inherit
this anomaly (see tab. 2) and demonstrates that there
still exists an evident gap between the human and
system performance.

in order to satisfy c1-c3, the new simverb-3500
evaluation set contains similarity ratings for 3,500
verb pairs, containing 827 verb types in total and
3 member verbs for each top-level verbnet class.
the rating scale goes from 0 (not similar at all) to
10 (synonymous). we employed the siid113x-999
annotation guidelines. in particular, we instructed
annotators to give low ratings to antonyms, and to
distinguish between similarity and relatedness. pairs
that are related but not similar (e.g., to snore / to
snooze, to walk / to crawl) thus have a fairly low
rating. several example pairs are provided in tab. 1.

3.2 choice of verb pairs and coverage
to ensure a wide coverage of a variety of syntactico-
semantic phenomena (c1), the choice of verb pairs is
steered by two standard semantic resources available
online: (1) the usf norms data set3 (nelson et al.,
2004), and (2) the verbnet verb lexicon4 (kipper et
al., 2004; kipper et al., 2008).

the usf norms data set (further usf) is the
largest database of free association collected for en-
glish. it was generated by presenting human subjects
with one of 5, 000 cue concepts and asking them to
write the    rst word coming to mind that is associated
with that concept. each cue concept c was normed in

2note that verbs in verbnet are soft clustered, and one verb
type may be associated with more than one class. when comput-
ing coverage, we assume that such verbs attribute to counts of
all their associated classes.

this way by over 10 participants, resulting in a set of
associates a for each cue, for a total of over 72, 000
(c, a) pairs. for each such pair, the proportion of par-
ticipants who produced associate a when presented
with cue c can be used as a proxy for the strength of
association between the two words.

the norming process guarantees that two words in
a pair have a degree of semantic association which
correlates well with semantic relatedness and simi-
larity. sampling from the usf set ensures that both
related but non-similar pairs (e.g., to run / to sweat)
as well as similar pairs (e.g., to reply / to respond)
are represented in the    nal list of pairs. further, the
rich annotations of the output usf data (e.g., con-
creteness scores, association strength) can be directly
combined with the simverb-3500 similarity scores
to yield additional analyses and insight.

verbnet (vn) is the largest online verb lexicon
currently available for english.
it is hierarchical,
domain-independent, and broad-coverage. vn is or-
ganised into verb classes extending the classes from
levin (1993) through further re   nement to achieve
syntactic and semantic coherence among class mem-
bers. according to the of   cial verbnet guidelines,5
   verb classes are numbered according to shared se-
mantics and syntax, and classes which share a top-
level number (9-109) have corresponding semantic
relationships.    for instance, all verbs from the top-
level class 9 are labelled    verbs of putting   , all verbs
from class 30 are labelled    verbs of perception   ,
while class 39 contains    verbs of ingesting   .

among others, three basic types of information
are covered in vn: (1) verb subcategorization frames
(scfs), which describe the syntactic realization of
the predicate-argument structure (e.g. the window
broke), (2) selectional preferences (sps), which cap-
ture the semantic preferences verbs have for their

5http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/verbnet_guidelines.pdf

arguments (e.g. a breakable physical object broke)
and (3) lexical-semantic verb classes (vcs) which
provide a shared level of abstraction for verbs similar
in their (morpho-)syntactic and semantic properties
(e.g. break verbs, sharing the vn class 45.1, and
the top-level vn class 45).6 the basic overview of
the verbnet structure already suggests that measur-
ing verb similarity is far from trivial as it revolves
around a complex interplay between various semantic
and syntactic properties.

the wide coverage of vn in simverb-3500
the wide coverage of distinct verb

groups/classes and their related linguistic phenom-
ena. finally, verbnet enables further connections of
simverb-3500 to other important lexical resources
such as framenet (baker et al., 1998), id138
(miller, 1995), and propbank (palmer et al., 2005)
through the sets of mappings created by the semlink
project initiative (loper et al., 2007).7

sampling procedure we next sketch the complete
sampling procedure which resulted in the    nal set of
3500 distinct verb pairs    nally annotated in a crowd-
sourcing study (   4).
(step 1) we extracted all possible verb pairs from
usf based on the associated pos tags available as
part of usf annotations. to ensure that semantic
association between verbs in a pair is not accidental,
we then discarded all such usf pairs that had been
associated by 2 or less participants in usf.
(step 2) we then manually cleaned and simpli   ed
the list of pairs by removing all pairs with multi-word
verbs (e.g., quit / give up), all pairs that contained
the non-in   nitive form of a verb (e.g., accomplished /
   nished, hidden /    nd), removing all pairs containing
at least one auxiliary verb (e.g., must / to see, must / to
be). the    rst two steps resulted in 3,072 usf-based
verb pairs.
(step 3) after this stage, we noticed that several top-
level vn classes are not part of the extracted set.
for instance, 5 vn classes did not have any member
verbs included, 22 vn classes had only 1 verb, and 6
vn classes had 2 verbs included in the current set.

we resolved the verbnet coverage issue by sam-
pling from such    under-represented    vn classes di-
rectly. note that this step is not related to usf at

6https://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/vn/break-45.1.php
7https://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/

all. for each such class we sampled additional verb
types until the class was represented by 3 or 4 mem-
ber verbs (chosen randomly).8 following that, we
sampled at least 2 verb pairs for each previously
   under-represented    vn class by pairing 2 member
verbs from each such class. this procedure resulted
in 81 additional pairs, now 3,153 in total.
(step 4) finally, to complement this set with a sam-
ple of entirely unassociated pairs, we followed the
siid113x-999 setup. we paired up the verbs from the
3,153 associated pairs at random. from these ran-
dom parings, we excluded those that coincidentally
occurred elsewhere in usf (and therefore had a de-
gree of association). we sampled the remaining 347
pairs from this resulting set of unassociated pairs.
(output) the    nal simverb-3500 data set contains
3,500 verb pairs in total, covering all associated verb
pairs from usf, and (almost) all top-level verbnet
classes. all pairs were manually checked post-hoc
by the authors plus 2 additional native english speak-
ers to verify that the    nal data set does not contain
unknown or invalid verb types.

frequency statistics the 3,500 pairs consist of
827 distinct verbs. 29 top-level vn classes are rep-
resented by 3 member verbs, while the three most
represented classes cover 79, 85, and 93 member
verbs. 40 verbs are not members of any vn class.

we performed an initial frequency analysis of
simverb-3500 relying on the bnc counts available
online (kilgarriff, 1997).9 after ranking all bnc
verbs according to their frequency, we divided the
list into quartiles: q1 (most frequent verbs in bnc)
- q4 (least frequent verbs in bnc). out of the 827
simverb-3500 verb types, 677 are contained in q1,
122 in q2, 18 in q3, 4 in q4 (to enroll, to hitchhike,
to implode, to whelp), while 6 verbs are not covered
in the bnc list. 2,818 verb pairs contain q1 verbs,
while there are 43 verb pairs with both verbs not in
q1. further empirical analyses are provided in    6.10

8the following three vn classes are exceptions: (1) class
56, consisting of words that are dominantly tagged as nouns,
but can be used as verbs exceptionally (e.g., holiday, summer,
honeymoon); (2) class 91, consisting of 2 verbs (count, matter);
(3) class 93, consisting of 2 single word verbs (adopt, assume).

4 word pair scoring
we employ the proli   c academic (pa) crowdsourc-
ing platform,11 an online marketplace very similar to
amazon mechanical turk and to crowdflower.

4.1 survey structure
following the siid113x-999 annotation guidelines, we
had each of the 3500 verb pairs rated by at least 10
annotators. to distribute the workload, we divided
the 3500 pairs into 70 tranches, with 79 pairs each.
out of the 79 pairs, 50 are unique to one tranche,
while 20 manually chosen pairs are in all tranches to
ensure consistency. the remaining 9 are duplicate
pairs displayed to the same participant multiple times
to detect inconsistent annotations.

participants see 7-8 pairs per page. pairs are rated
on a scale of 0-6 by moving a slider. the    rst page
shows 7 pairs, 5 unique ones and 2 from the con-
sistency set. the following pages are structured the
same but display one extra pair from the previous
page. participants are explicitly asked to give these
duplicate pairs the same rating. we use them as
quality control so that we can identify and exclude
participants giving several inconsistent answers.
checkpoint questions the survey contains three
control questions in which participants are asked to
select the most similar pair out of three choices. for
instance, the    rst checkpoint is: which of these pairs
of words is the *most* similar? 1. to run / to jog 2. to
run / to walk 3. to jog / to sweat. one checkpoint oc-
curs right after the instructions and the other two later
in the survey. the purpose is to check that annotators
have understood the guidelines and to have another
quality control measure for ensuring that they are
paying attention throughout the survey. if just one
of the checkpoint questions is answered incorrectly,
the survey ends immediately and all scores from the
annotator in question are discarded.
participants 843 raters participated in the study,
producing over 65,000 ratings. unlike other crowd-
sourcing platforms, pa collects and stores detailed
demographic information from the participants up-
front. this information was used to carefully select
the pool of eligible participants. we restricted the
pool to native english speakers with a 90% approval

rate (maximum rate on pa), of age 18-50, born and
currently residing in the us (45% out of 843 raters),
uk (53%), or ireland (2%). 54% of the raters were
female and 46% male, with the average age of 30.
participants took 8 minutes on average to complete
the survey containing 79 questions.

4.2 post-processing
we excluded ratings of annotators who (a) answered
one of the checkpoint questions incorrectly (75% of
exclusions); (b) did not give equal ratings to dupli-
cate pairs; (c) showed suspicious rating patterns (e.g.,
randomly alternating between two ratings or using
one single rating throughout). the    nal acceptance
rate was 84%. we then calculated the average of all
ratings from the accepted raters (     10 ) for each pair.
the score was    nally scaled linearly from the 0-6 to
the 0-10 interval as in (hill et al., 2015).

5 analysis
inter-annotator agreement we employ two
measures. iaa-1 (pairwise) computes the average
pairwise spearman   s    correlation between any two
raters     a common choice in previous data collec-
tion in id65 (pad   et al., 2007;
reisinger and mooney, 2010a; silberer and lapata,
2014; hill et al., 2015).

a complementary measure would smooth individ-
ual annotator effects. for this aim, our iaa-2 (mean)
measure compares the average correlation of a hu-
man rater with the average of all the other raters.
simverb-3500 obtains    = 0.84 (iaa-1) and    = 0.86
(iaa-2), a very good agreement compared to other
benchmarks (see tab. 2).

vector space models we compare the perfor-
mance of prominent representation models on
simverb-3500. we include: (1) unsupervised mod-
els that learn from distributional information in text,
including the skip-gram negative-sampling model
(sgns) with various contexts (bow = bag of words;
deps = dependency contexts) as in levy and gold-
berg (2014), the symmetric-pattern based vectors
by schwartz et al. (2015), and count-based pmi-
weighted vectors (baroni et al., 2014); (2) mod-
els that rely on linguistic hand-crafted resources or
curated knowledge bases. here, we use sparse bi-
nary vectors built from linguistic resources (non-

descriptions of these models are in the supplemen-
tary material.

comparison to siid113x-999 (sl-222) 170 pairs
from sl-222 also appear in simverb-3500. the cor-
relation between the two data sets calculated on the
shared pairs is    = 0.91. this proves, as expected,
that the ratings are consistent across the two data sets.
tab. 3 shows a comparison of models    perfor-
mance on simverb-3500 against sl-222. since the
number of evaluation pairs may in   uence the results,
we ideally want to compare sets of equal size for a fair
comparison. picking one random subset of 222 pairs
would bias the results towards the selected pairs, and
even using 10-fold cross-validation we found varia-
tions up to 0.05 depending on which subsets were
used. therefore, we employ a 2-level 10-fold cross-
validation where new random subsets are picked in
each iteration of each model. the numbers reported
as cv-222 are averages of these ten 10-fold cross-
validation runs. the reported results come very close
to the correlation on the full data set for all models.
most models perform much better on sl-222, es-
pecially those employing additional databases or lin-
guistic resources. the performance of the best scor-
ing paragram+cf model is even on par with the
iaa-1 of 0.72. the same model obtains the high-
est score on sv-3500 (   = 0.628), with a clear gap
to iaa-1 of 0.84. we attribute these differences in

performance largely to simverb-3500 being a more
extensive and diverse resource in terms of verb pairs.

development set a common problem in scored
word pair datasets is the lack of a standard split to
development and test sets. previous works often
optimise models on the entire dataset, which leads to
over   tting (faruqui et al., 2016) or use custom splits,
e.g., 10-fold cross-validation (schwartz et al., 2015),
which make results incomparable with others. the
lack of standard splits stems mostly from small size
and poor coverage     issues which we have solved
with simverb-3500.

our development set contains 500 pairs, selected
to ensure a broad coverage in terms of similarity
ranges (i.e., non-similar and highly similar pairs, as
well as pairs of medium similarity are represented)
and top-level vn classes (each class is represented
by at least 1 member verb). the test set includes
the remaining 3,000 verb pairs. the performances of
representation learning architectures on the dev and
test sets are reported in tab. 3. the ranking of models
is identical on the test and the full sv-3500 set, with
slight differences in ranking on the development set.

6 evaluating subsets

the large coverage and scale of simverb-3500 en-
ables model evaluation based on selected criteria. in
this section, we showcase a few example analyses.

frequency in the    rst analysis, we select pairs
based on their lemma frequency in the bnc corpus
and form three groups, with 390-490 pairs in each
group (fig. 1). the results from fig. 1 suggest that
the performance of all models improves as the fre-
quency of the verbs in the pair increases, with much
steeper curves for the purely distributional models
(e.g., sgns and sympat). the non-distributional
non data-driven model of faruqui and dyer (2015) is
only slightly affected by frequency.

id138 synsets
intuitively, representations for
verbs with more diverse usage patterns are more dif-
   cult to learn with statistical models. to examine
this hypothesis, we resort to id138 (miller, 1995),
where different semantic usages of words are listed
as so-called synsets. fig. 2 shows a clear downward
trend for all models, con   rming that polysemous

table 3: evaluation of state-of-the representation learning models on the full simverb-3500 set (sv-3500), the siid113x-999
verb subset containing 222 pairs (sl-222), cross-validated subsets of 222 pairs from sv-3500 (cv-222), and the simverb-3500
development (dev-500) and test set (test-3000).

figure 1: subset-based evaluation, where subsets are created
based on the frequency of verb lemmas in the bnc corpus. each
of the three frequency groups contains 390-490 verb pairs. to
be included in each group it is required that both verbs in a pair
are contained in the same frequency interval (x axis).

verbs are more dif   cult for current verb representa-
tion models. nevertheless, approaches which use
additional information beyond corpus co-occurrence
are again more robust. their performance only drops
substantially for verbs with more than 10 synsets,
while the performance of other models deteriorates al-
ready when tackling verbs with more than 5 synsets.

verbnet classes another analysis enabled by
simverb-3500 is investigating the connection be-
tween verbnet classes and human similarity judg-
ments. we    nd that verbs in the same top-level verb-
net class are often not assigned high similarity score.
out of 1378 pairs where verbs share the top-level
verbnet class, 603 have a score lower than 5. tab. 4
reports scores per verbnet class. when a verb be-

included in each subset it is required that both verbs in a pair
have the number of synsets in the same interval.

longs to multiple classes, we count it for each class
(see footnote 2). we run the analysis on the    ve
largest vn classes, each with more than 100 pairs
with paired verbs belonging to the same class.

the results indicate clear differences between
classes (e.g., class 31 vs class 51), and suggest that
further developments in verb representation learning
should also focus on constructing specialised repre-
sentations at the    ner-grained level of vn classes.

lexical relations simverb-3500 contains rela-
tion annotations (e.g., antonyms, synonyms, hyper-
/hyponyms, no relation) for all pairs extracted au-
tomatically from id138. evaluating per-relation
subsets, we observe that some models draw their
strength from good performance across different re-

table 5: spearman   s    correlation between human judgments
and model   s cosine similarity based on pair relation type. re-
lations are based on id138, and included in the dataset. the
classes are of different size, 373 pairs with no relation (nr),
306 synonym (syn) pairs, and 800 hyper/hyponym (hyp) pairs.
frequencies of member verbs are distributed in a similar way.

lations. others have low performance on these pairs,
but do very well on synonyms and hyper-/hyponyms.
selected results of this analysis are in tab. 5.12
human agreement motivated by the varying per-
formance of computational models regarding fre-
quency and ambiguous words with many synsets,
we analyse what disagreement effects may be cap-
tured in human ratings. we therefore compute the
average standard deviation of ratings per subset:
p   s   (rp), where s is one subset
avgstdd(s) = 1
n
of pairs, n is the number of pairs in this subset, p is
one pair, and rp are all human ratings for this pair.

(cid:80)

12 evaluation based on spearman   s    may be problematic
with certain categories, e.g., with antonyms. it evaluates pairs
according to their ranking; for antonyms the ranking is arbitrary -
every antonym pair should have a very low rating, hence they are
not included in tab. 5. a similar effect occurs with highly ranked
synonyms, but to a much lesser degree than with antonyms.

while the standard deviation of ratings is diverse
for individual pairs, overall the average standard de-
viations per subset are almost identical. for both
the frequency and the id138 synset analyses it is
around    1.3 across all subsets, and with only little
difference for the subsets based on verbnet. the only
subsets where we found signi   cant variations is the
grouping by relations, where ratings tend to be more
similar especially on antonyms (0.86) and pairs with
no relation (0.92), much less similar on synonyms
(1.34) and all other relations (   1.4). these    ndings
suggest that humans are much less in   uenced by fre-
quency or polysemy in their understanding of verb
semantics compared to computational models.

7 conclusions

simverb-3500 is a verb similarity resource for analy-
sis and evaluation that will be of use to researchers
involved in understanding how humans or machines
represent the meaning of verbs, and, by extension,
scenes, events and full sentences. the size and cover-
age of syntactico-semantic phenomena in simverb-
3500 makes it possible to compare the strengths and
weaknesses of various representation models via sta-
tistically robust analyses on speci   c word classes.

to demonstrate the utility of simverb-3500, we
conducted a selection of analyses with existing
representation-learning models. one clear conclu-
sion is that distributional models trained on raw text
(e.g. sgns) perform very poorly on low frequency
and highly polysemous verbs. this degradation in
performance can be partially mitigated by focusing
models on more principled distributional contexts,
such as those de   ned by symmetric patterns. more
generally, the    nding suggests that, in order to model
the diverse spectrum of verb semantics, we may re-
quire algorithms that are better suited to fast learning
from few examples (lake et al., 2011), and have
some    exibility with respect to sense-level distinc-
tions (reisinger and mooney, 2010b; vilnis and mc-
callum, 2015). in future work we aim to apply such
methods to the task of verb acquisition.

beyond the preliminary conclusions from these ini-
tial analyses, the bene   t of siid113x-3500 will become
clear as researchers use it to probe the relationship
between architectures, algorithms and representation
quality for a wide range of verb classes. better under-

standing of how to represent the full diversity of verbs
should in turn yield improved methods for encoding
and interpreting the facts, propositions, relations and
events that constitute much of the important informa-
tion in language.

vector space models
unsupervised text-based models
these models mainly learn from co-occurrence statis-
tics in large corpora, therefore to facilitate the gener-
ality of our results, we evaluate them on two different
corpora. with 8b we refer to the corpus produced
by the id97 script, consisting of 8 billion to-
kens from various sources (mikolov et al., 2013a).13
with pw we refer to the english polyglot wikipedia
corpus (al-rfou et al., 2013).14 d denotes the em-
bedding dimensionality, and ws is the window size
in case of bag-of-word contexts. the models we
consider are as follows:
sgns-bow (pw, 8b) skip-gram with negative
sampling (sgns) (mikolov et al., 2013a; mikolov
et al., 2013b) trained with bag-of-words (bow) con-
texts; d = 500, ws = 2 on 8b as in prior work (mela-
mud et al., 2016; schwartz et al., 2016). d = 300,
ws = 2 on pw as in prior work (levy and goldberg,
2014; vuli  c and korhonen, 2016).
sgns-udep (pw) sgns trained with universal
dependency15 (ud) contexts following the setup of
(levy and goldberg, 2014; vuli  c and korhonen,
2016). the pw data were pos-tagged with universal
pos (upos) tags (petrov et al., 2012) using turbo-
tagger (martins et al., 2013)16, trained using default
settings without any further parameter    ne-tuning
(id166 mira with 20 iterations) on the train+dev
portion of the ud treebank annotated with upos
tags. the data were then parsed using the graph-
based mate parser v3.61 (bohnet, 2010).17 d = 300
as in (vuli  c and korhonen, 2016)
sgns-dep (8b) another variant of a dependency-
based sgns model is taken from the recent work of
schwartz et al. (2016), based on levy and goldberg
(2014). the 8b corpus is parsed with labeled stan-
ford dependencies (de marneffe and manning, 2008),
the stanford pos tagger (toutanova et al., 2003)

and the stack version of the malt parser (goldberg
and nivre, 2012) are used; d = 500 as in prior work
(schwartz et al., 2016).

all other parameters of all sgns models are set
to the standard settings: the models are trained with
stochastic id119, global learning rate of
0.025, subsampling rate 1e     4, 15 epochs.
sympat (8b) a template-based approach to vec-
tor space modeling introduced by schwartz et al.
(2015). vectors are trained based on co-occurrence
of words in symmetric patterns (davidov and rap-
poport, 2006), and an antonym detection mechanism
is plugged in the representations. we use pre-trained
dense vectors (d = 300 and d = 500) with the
antonym detector enabled, available online.18

count-svd traditional count-based vectors using
pmi weighting and svd id84
(ws = 2; d = 500). this is the best performing re-
duced count-based model from baroni et al. (2014),
vectors were obtained online.19

models relying on external resources
non-distributional sparse binary vectors built
from a wide variety of hand-crafted linguistic re-
sources, e.g., id138, supersenses, framenet,
emotion and sentiment lexicons, connotation lexi-
con, among others (faruqui and dyer, 2015).20

paragram wieting et al. (2015) use the paraphrase
database (ppdb) (ganitkevitch et al., 2013) word
pairs to learn word vectors which emphasise para-
phrasability. they do this by    ne-tuning, also known
as retro-   tting (faruqui et al., 2015), id97
vectors using a sgns inspired objective function
designed to incorporate the ppdb semantic similar-
ity constraints. two variants are available online:
d = 25 and d = 300.21

paragram+cf mrk  i  c et al. (2016) suggest an-
other variant of the retro-   tting procedure called

counter-   tting (cf) which further improves the para-
gram vectors by injecting antonymy constraints from
ppdb v2.0 (pavlick et al., 2015) into the    nal vector
space. d = 300.22
