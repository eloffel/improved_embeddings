introduction 

    over the last few years, 

there has been a growing 
public and enterprise 
interest in social media 

 

    interests: the ability for 

users to create and share 
content via a variety of 
social media platforms 
 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 
   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

    the unprecedented volume and variety of 
user-generated content as well as the user 
interaction network  

    new opportunities for understanding social 

behavior and building socially-aware systems.

what is a social network 

    a social structure made up of  

    a set of actors (such as individuals or organizations) & 
    the relationships/interactions between these actors  

 

    social network perspective: to model the structure of a 

social group 
    how this structure influences other variables 
    how structures change over time

a social networking website allows the user to build a web 
page and connect with a friend or other acquaintance in 
order to share user-generated content. 

myspace, facebook, 
linkedin,  meetup, google plus+ 

blog and blog 
comments 

a blog is an online journal where the blogger can create the 
content and display it in reverse chronological order. blogs 
are generally maintained by a person or a community. 
blog comments are posts by users attached to blogs or 
online newspaper posts.

    social media data is the collection of open source 

information that can be obtained publicly 

    key properties: 

    social, real-time, geo-spatially coded, emotion, 

neologisms, credibility/rumors 

    non-structured text in many formats 
    written by different people in many languages and 

styles

     general nlp toolkits 

   

stanford corenlp (java) includes id121, id52, named entity 
recognition, parsing, and co-reference. http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/ 

    open nlp (java) includes id121, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech 

   

tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and co-reference resolution.   
http://opennlp.apache.org/ 
freeling includes tools for english and several other languages: text id121, 
sentence splitting, morphological analysis, phonetic encoding, named entity 
recognition, id52, chart-based id66, rule-based dependency 
parsing, nominal co-reference resolution, etc. http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/ 

    nltk is a suite of text processing libraries in python for classification, 

id121, id30, id52, parsing, and semantic reasoning. 
http://nltk.org/ 

    gate includes components such parsers, morphology, id52, and 

information retrieval and extraction components for various languages. the 
information extraction system (annie) includes a named entity detector. 
http://gate.ac.uk/ 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

     nlp tools for social media 

   

some components of these toolkits were re-trained for social media texts, such 
as the stanford pos tagger by derczynski et al. (2013), and the opennlp 
chunker by ritter et al. (2011).  

    gate was fully adapted to social media text. a new module or plugin called 

twitie https://gate.ac.uk/wiki/twitie.html is available (derczynski et al., 2013)  
for id121 of twitter texts, plus id52, name entities recognition, 
etc. 

two new toolkits were built especially for social media texts: 
   

tweetnlp is a java-based tokenizer and pos tagger for twitter text (owoputi et 
al., 2013). it includes training data of manually labeled pos annotated tweets 
(that we noted above), a web-based annotation tool, and hierarchical word 
clusters from unlabeled tweets. http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/tweetnlp/. it also 
includes the tweeboparser mentioned above. 
the uw twitter nlp tools (ritter et al., 2011) contain the pos tagger and the 
annotated twitter data. https://github.com/aritter/twitter_nlp

applications of social media (ch 4) 

    health care applications  
    financial applications 
    predicting voting intentions 
    security and defence applications 
    disaster response applications  
    nlp-based user modelling 
    nlp-based information visualisation for sm

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

health care applications  

    many online platforms where people discuss their health: 

    specialized forums, for various topics. the language is often 

informal and medical terms can be found, but most of the 
language is lay. various kinds of information can be 
extracted automatically from such postings and discussions.  

    opinions and arguments pro and cons topics such as: 

vaccinations, mammographies, new born genetic screening. 

    need privacy protection: detection of personal health 

information (phi) such as names, dates of birth, addresses, 
health insurance numbers.  

 
 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

financial applications 

    behavioral economics studies the correlation between  

public mood and economic indicators, and between 
financial news / rumors and stock exchange fluctuations.   
    recent studies show that  using social media (twitter, sina 

weibo, seeking alpha) data to automatically measure public 
mood (rather than using expensive traditional polls) can be 
useful in financial applications.  
    experiments were run on predicting stock market fluctuations 
for nasdaq,  new york stock exchange, dow jones, s&p 500, 
shanghai stock exchange, turkish stock exchange, etc. 

 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

predicting voting intentions 

    need to detect  messages about the desired topic or political 
entities of interest (using keyword search or text classification 
methods). 

    then use opinion detection / id31 techniques. 
    experiments: 

    automatic opinion polling given a comments written after 

voting, on the sodahead social polling website. 

    tjong kim sang and bos (2012) used twitter data to predict the 

2011 dutch senate election results.  

    bermingham and smeaton (2011) used social media for 

prediction of the 2011 irish general election. 

    several studies on us elections using congress debates,  
    political blogs and their comments, twitter data, etc. 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

security and defence applications 

    humans can read only a small part of the user-generated content in 

social media in order to detect possible threats to security and public 
safety (mentions of terrorist activities or extremist/radical texts). 
automatic methods can detect messages that should be flagged as 
possible threats and forwarded to a human for further analysis. 

    forensic data mining for intrusion detection (mohay et al., 2003) 
    military image classification based on text captions and tags. 
   

information extraction from text. key phrase search or classification 
of a text as being about a terrorism-related topic or not. 

    situation awareness. crf classifiers on large amounts of textual 
maritime incident reports, to extract: vessel type, risk type, risk 
associates, a maritime general location, a maritime absolute    
location (latitude/longitude), date and time (razavi et al., 2014). 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

security and defence applications (cont.) 

    topic detection in social media texts, friendsfeed data, using 

multi-level lda features (razavi et al., 2013). 

    location detection from social media texts: twitter user 

location (li and inkpen , 2015)  

    emotion detection from social media texts. anger and 

sadness detection are of particular interest. emotion 
classifiers (including anger and sadness) were tested on blog 
data (ghazi et al., 2010), on livejournal data (keshtkar and 
inkpen, 2012) and other kinds of social media postings. 
messages that express anger at high intensity levels could be 
flagged as possible terrorist threats.  

    combine the three aspects!

disaster response applications  

    a sudden change in the topics discussed in social media in a region 
can indicate a possible emergency situation, for example a natural 
disaster such as an earthquake, fire, tsunami, or flooding.  

    social media messages can be used for spreading information 

about the evolution of the situation.  

    new id37 or information about existing events. 
    experiments on tweets:  

    extracted info about disaster response actions (imran et al., 2013) 
    developed an earthquake detector for australia and new zealand 

(robinson et al., 2013) 

    detected reported fires (power et al., 2013)

nlp-based user modelling 

    learn user profiles based on their social media behaviour (all 

the postings of a user).

nlp-based information visualisation 

   

information visualisation for social media analysis has become 
important to explore the potential of social media data.  
    challenges with the growing availability of big social data. 
     data analytics and visualization tools are needed to represent the 
extracted topics and draw relationships between these elements.  
    applying nlp techniques on social media data give us the 

power of transforming the noisy data to structured 
information  
    but it is still difficult to discern meaning by extracting information 

piece by piece.  

    the link id136 and visualizing content would make the 

analysed information more apparent and meaningful to 
present to users and decision makers.  

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

visualisation     ex. geo-location detection  

 

    geo-location detection from 

social content, such as blog posts 
or tweets, is possible thanks to 
nlp methods. 

    but the location itself is 

irrelevant. but the projection of 
location on the map, tracking the 
events on specific timeline and 
connecting with other name 
entity and id31 
bring other dimension as    big 
picture    visualization.  

    however, visualization provides 

an intuitive way to summarize the 
information in order to make it 
easier to understand and 
interaction. 
 
 

mediaq is an online media 
management framework that includes 
functions to collect, organize, share, 
search, and trade user-generated 
mobile images and videos using 
automatically tagged geo-spatial 
metadata.  (kim et al. 2014) 
 

   2015 atefeh farzindar & diana inkpen 

visualisation     big picture 

    kotval and burns (2013) studied the visualization of 

entities within social media by analysing user needs.  

    to understand user needs and preferences, authors 
developed fourteen social media data visualization 
concepts and conducted a user evaluation of these 
concepts by measuring the usefulness of the 
underlying data relationships and the usability of each 
data visualization concept.  

    however, they reported a divergence and preferences 

for    big picture    visualization among users.

applications for entertainment 

    media and entertainment industry has a big challenge 

facing social media 

    social media are changing users    expectations and their 

behaviour 

    new approaches toward content creation, distribution, 

operations, technology, and user interaction 
    by online video, social media and mobile media to bring 

the information to the user and interact with them 

    serious issue: since advertisers spend less on 

traditional paid media and require more resources for 
digital social media and e-marketing.

entertainment - id31 

    id31 of major events such as the oscars 
    sentiment related to the movies premium  
    sinha et al. (2014) studied the id31 of 

wimbledon tweets by analysing a set of tweets of the 
roger federer and novak    nole    djokovic semifinals 
match at wimbledon 2012.  
    in the absence of textual metadata for annotating videos, 
they assumed that the live video coverage of an event and 
the time correlated textual microblog streams about the 
same event can act as an important source for such 
annotation.  

    the intensity of sentiment is used to detect peaks of 
sentiments towards players as well, and can tag best 
moments in the game.

entertainment - movie and tv prog ranking  

    the trusted measurement 

of movie and tv programming ranking is one of the 
important indicator regarding the popularity of a program 
or a movie in the entertainment industry.  

 
 
 

 
 
 

for example, netflix, uses the popularity of a  
movie on facebook as a proposed feature for  
consumers.  

    predicting tv audience ratings (hsieh et al., 2013) , using 
the back-propagation network and the number of posts, 
likes, comments and shares on the fan pages of various tv 
dramas to try to find their relationships to ratings.  

    their result showed that using facebook fan page data to 

perform ratings forecasts for non-broadcast programs 
should be feasible.

privacy in social media (ch5) 

    social media plays an important role in 

interactive relationships between 
individuals, organizations and societies.  
    content shared in social media has an impact on 

privacy for end-users.  

    published information can also present 

some difficulties when circumstances 
change. 

    discussions and concerns about privacy 

regarding user misunderstandings, the bugs 
on development of social media platforms 
allowing unauthorized access, or lack of 
ethics in marketing.  
    some privacy research focuses on concerns about data 

protection by establishing metrics, such as privacy scales, for 
evaluating those concerns (wang et al., 2013).  

    however, there is little guidance or research study on how to 

protect information (ex. privacy in healthcare)

democracy in social media (ch5) 

   

   

   

   

social media revolutionize liberal democracies and human rights.  
    political community and express democratic values for liberals, progressives, 

moderates and independents. 

in 2009, the washington times[1]named iran   s twitter revolution to protest against 
the rigged election in iran and required permissions and news coverage. the iranian 
election protests was a series of protests following the 2009 iranian presidential 
election against the disputed victory of iranian president mahmoud 
ahmadinejad and in support of opposition candidates mir-hossein 
mousavi and mehdi karroubi. #iranelection.  
    after resident ahmadinejad   s victory, in many different cities around the world, iranian 

protested against the    stolen election.    although many supporters including iranian-
americans were not even eligible to vote, changed their facebook profile picture to 
   where is my vote?    

in view of recent mobilizations, social media has played a key role in the arab spring 
(2010-2012), which referred to the large-scale conflicts in middle east and north 
africa 
in canada printemps   rable (maple spring) 2012, which was a series of protest and 
widespread student strikes against the provincial government in quebec. many 
researchers study the long-term evolution of us and european political systems via 
social media networks.

    an event is generally characterized by: 5w1h 

    who? when? where? what? why? how? 

    an    event of interest    is domain dependent  

    terrorist activities, sport tournaments, 

conference, trade show, natural disaster, etc.

event gathering 

    objective is    id37    - discover new 

or previously unidentified events: 

1. retrospective: detection of previously 

unidentified events from accumulated data  

    id91 techniques based on similarity measures 
    new events are distant from previous clusters 
2. online: discovery of new events from 

continuous stream(s) in (near) real-time 
    statistical: frequency, id165s, id48, wavelets,     
    new events: bursty deviation from normal behavior

    can be also categorized into unspecified or 

specified detection approaches: 

1. unspecified id37 

    no available information about the event 

    general military surveillance, first-story in news,    

    requires monitoring the data stream (of multiple 
sources) for trending or bursty features, grouping 
features with identical trend into event, and 
ultimately classifying the event into type or topic

id37 (cont.) 

2. specified id37 

    specific information/features are known about 

the event: 
    venue, time, type, description, etc.  

    marketing activities of a specific competitor/brand 
    specific military operation (with known target) 

    these features can be exploited using information 

retrieval/extraction techniques:

    a benchmark dataset was created for a shared task at semeval 2013  

   

   

http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task2/ 
8000 tweets annotated with the labels: positive, negative, neutral and objective 
(no opinion).  
task a: given a message that contains a marked instance of a word or phrase, the 
goal of task a was to determine whether that instance is positive, negative or 
neutral in that context.  
task b was to classify the whole message as pos/neg/neutral  

   
 
example:

1. token level f and span level f are similar: most location names 

contain one word. 

2. using all features produces the best results (except for one 

case). 

3. using merely bow features always produces the worst results. 
4. for the    city    label, bow features and gaz features result in 
statistically significant improvements, pos features never do. 
5. differences are most obvious for the    city    label: much larger 

search space. 

6. no pair of feature combinations yields statistically significant 

difference for the    sp    label.

    liu et al. [2012a] leveraged social network features to adapt 

a graph-based summarization approach to the task of 
summarizing tweets.

opinion summarization 

    can help better understand opinion mining and 

id31 

    may target a general assessment of sentiment 

polarity regarding a particular product or service, 
     which can be invaluable for marketing or reputation 

management  

    e.g., "do customers feel positive or negative regarding 

a particular brand or product?").  

    may also target specific query-based information,  

    such as "which particular features do customers like 

best about a given product?"

event summarization 

    event summarization seeks to extract social 

media text representative of some real-world 
event.  

    here, an event can be broadly defined as any 

occurrence unfolding over some spatial and 
temporal scope (farzindar and khreich, 2013).

    each publication is assigned a sentiment value of 

   positive   ,    neutral    or    negative   : 
    objective publications (reviews many points of view 

eg. news report) are always neutral 

    subjective publications  (one person's opinion) are 

rated as being positive or negative based on the words 
and expressions used in the text 

    sentiment averages are visualized on a timeline 

that represents the evolution of the sentiment on 
the topic, and in a global pie chart.
