introduction 

    arabic diglossia 

    diglossia is where two forms of the language exist 

side by side 

    msa is the formal public language 
    perceived as    language of the mind    

    dialectal arabic is the informal private language  

    perceived as    language of the heart    

    general arab perception: dialects are a 

deteriorated form of classical arabic

why study arabic dialects? 

    almost no native speakers of arabic sustain continuous 

spontaneous production of msa 

    ubiquity of dialect 

    dialects are the primary form of arabic used in all unscripted 

spoken genres: conversational, talk shows, interviews, etc. 

    dialects are increasingly in use in new written media 

(newsgroups, weblogs, etc.) 

    dialects have a direct impact on msa phonology, syntax, 

semantics and pragmatics 

    dialects lexically permeate msa speech and text 

    substantial dialect-msa differences impede direct 

application of msa nlp tools

    common ligatures 
    used to write many languages besides arabic:

phonology and spelling 

    arabic spelling can be ambiguous  

    optional diacritics and dual use of letter 

    but how ambiguous? really? 
    classic example 

ths s wht n rbc txt lks lk wth n vwls 
this is what an arabic text looks like with no vowels 

    not exactly true 

    long vowels are always written 
    initial vowels are represented by an          alef    
    some final short vowels are deterministically inferable 
 
ths is wht an arbc txt lks lik wth no vwls 

 

will revisit ambiguity in more detail again under morphology discussion

    objectives 

    coda  covers  all  das,  minimizing  differences  in 

choices 

    coda is easy to learn and produce consistently 
    coda is intuitive to readers unfamiliar with it 
    coda uses arabic script 

    inspired by previous efforts from the ldc and

morphological analyzer 

    calima-arz  (arz = egyptian arabic) 

    extends  the  egyptian  colloquial  arabic  lexicon  (ecal) 
(kilany  et  al.,  2002)  and  standard  arabic  morphological 
analyzer (sama) (graff et al., 2009). 

    follows  the  part-of-speech  (pos)  guidelines  used  by  the 

ldc for egyptian arabic (maamouri et al., 2012b). 

    accepts  multiple  orthographic  variants  and  normalizes 

them to coda (habash et al., 2012). 

    incorporates annotations by the ldc for egyptian arabic.

morphological features  

for arabic parsing 

marton et al. (2013)  

    parsing with rich morphology 

    rich morphology helps morpho-syntactic modeling  

    e.g., agreement and case assignment 

    but: rich morphology increases data sparseness 

    a challenge to statistical parsers 

    but: rich pos tagset can be hard to predict 

    e.g. arabic case (or state) is usually not explicitly written 

    also: mapping from form to function is not 1:1 

    e.g. so-called broken plurals, or fem. ending to masc. noun

various arabic (msa) morphological features and 
tagsets to syntactic id33

dialect-msa dictionary 

    problem: lack of dialect-msa resources 

    no dialect-msa parallel text 
    no paper dictionaries for dialect-msa 

    dictionary is required for many nlp applications 

exploiting msa resources 
    mt and clir 
    parsing with the lack of da parsers, one would need to 
translate dialect sentences to msa before parsing them 
with an msa parser 

    dialect identification especially with the problem of 

linguistic code switching and pervasive presence of faux

oov reduction techniques 
    two strategies for online handling of oovs by 

phrase table extension 
    recycle phrases 

    expand the phrase table online with recycled phrases  

    relate oov word to inv (in-vocabulary) word  
    copy inv phrases and replace inv word with oov word 
    example: add misspelled variant of a word in phrase table 

                  knab     book 

    using unigram and bigram phrases was optimal for id7 

    novel phrases 

    expand the phrase table online with new phrases  

    example:                      bastwr is oov

msa-pivoting for da to english mt 

[salloum & habash, 2011, 2012, 2013] 

    challenge: there is almost no msa-da parallel corpora 

to train a da-to-msa smt 

    solution: use a rule-based approach to  

    produce msa paraphrases of da words 
    create a lattice for each sentence  
    pass the lattice to an msa-english smt system 

    the rule-based approach needs: 
    a dialectal morphological analyzer 
    rules to transfer from da analyses to msa analyses
