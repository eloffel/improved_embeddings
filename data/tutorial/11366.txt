abstract

natural language processing techniques are
increasingly applied to identify social trends
and predict behavior based on large text col-
lections. existing methods typically rely on
surface lexical and syntactic information. yet,
research in psychology shows that patterns of
human conceptualisation, such as metaphor-
ical framing, are reliable predictors of hu-
man expectations and decisions.
in this pa-
per, we present a method to learn patterns of
metaphorical framing from large text collec-
tions, using statistical techniques. we apply
the method to data in three different languages
and evaluate the identi   ed patterns, demon-
strating their psychological validity.

introduction

1
with the rise of blogging and social media, apply-
ing id111 techniques to aid political and so-
cial science has become an active area of research
in natural language processing (nlp) (grimmer and
stewart, 2013). nlp techniques have been success-
fully used for tasks such as estimating the in   uence
of politicians (fader et al., 2007), predicting voting
patterns (gerrish and blei, 2011) and political af-
   liation (pennacchiotti and popescu, 2011). such
methods typically rely on surface lexical and syn-
tactic cues, rather than analysing patterns of concep-
tualisation and framing of social and political issues.
framing is, however, widely studied in political sci-
ence, linguistics and cognitive psychology (lakoff,
1991; tannen, 1993; entman, 2003) as a way of
reasoning about an issue by selecting and empha-
sizing its facets that reinforce a particular point of

view. metaphor is a particularly apt framing de-
vice, as it exposes the desired aspects of the issue,
while seaid113ssly concealing the less desired ones
(lakoff, 1991; beigman klebanov and beigman,
2010; lakoff and wehling, 2012). for instance, dis-
cussing war as a competitive game emphasizes the
victory vs. defeat aspect of war, while neglecting its
human cost. sports metaphors have thus been of-
ten used by politicians seeking to arouse a pro-war
sentiment in the public (lakoff, 1991).

psychologists thibodeau and boroditsky (2011)
investigated how metaphors affect our decision-
making. in their experiment, two groups of subjects
were primed by two different metaphors for crime:
crime is a virus vs. crime is a beast and then asked
how crime should be tackled. they found that the
   rst group tended to opt for preventive measures and
the second group for punishment-oriented ones. ac-
cording to the authors, their results demonstrate the
in   uence that metaphors have on how we conceptu-
alize and act with respect to societal issues. this in
turn suggests that the metaphors we use can serve as
a predictor of our social, political and economic de-
cisions. therefore, a id111 system aiming to
gain an understanding of social trends across pop-
ulations or their change over time, needs to iden-
tify subtle but systematic linguistic differences, ex-
pressed both literally and metaphorically.

in this paper, we propose a method for large-scale
identi   cation of metaphorical framing patterns in
text corpora. metaphorical expressions arise in the
presence of systematic metaphorical associations, or
conceptual metaphors, mapping one concept or do-
main to another (lakoff and johnson, 1980). for

instance, when we talk about    curing juvenile delin-
quency    or    diagnosing corruption   , we view crime
(the target concept) as a virus or a disease (the
source concept). our method uses id91 tech-
niques to generalise such metaphorical associations
based on the metaphorical use of language in a large
text corpus. speci   cally, we use a hierarchical soft
id91 method     hierarchical graph factorization
id91 (hgfc) (yu et al., 2006)     to learn a graph
of concepts from the data and to identify patterns of
inter-conceptual association in this graph. to obtain
the graph, we cluster frequent nouns in the corpus
using the verbs they co-occur with as features. our
expectation is that the verbs that systematically oc-
cur with both the source domain nouns (e.g.    cure
disease   ) and the target domain nouns (e.g.    cure
crime   ) would allow the system to establish a con-
nection between the two domains, providing evi-
dence of metaphorical framing.

the method is fully unsupervised and relies on
uncovering the patterns of systematic use of meta-
phor in linguistic data.
it can thus be applied to
any text corpus, domain or language, without any
need for manual annotation. we apply the method to
large corpora in three languages     english, russian
and spanish. the method identi   es interesting dif-
ferences in metaphorical framing in these corpora.
we validated these differences in a behavioural ex-
periment and established that the system accurately
predicts behavioural data on human judgements of
economic change. besides providing a new set of
techniques for id111 applications, this method
can also inform and scale-up research in experimen-
tal psychology, based on data-driven evidence rather
than introspection.

2 related work

nlp techniques have been successfully used for a
number of tasks in political science, including au-
tomatically estimating the in   uence of particular
politicians in the us senate (fader et al., 2007),
identifying lexical features that differentiate polit-
ical rhetoric of opposing parties (monroe et al.,
2008), predicting voting patterns of politicians based
on their use of language (gerrish and blei, 2011),
and predicting political af   liation of twitter users
(pennacchiotti and popescu, 2011). other ap-

proaches (paul and girju, 2009; ahmed and xing,
2010; fang et al., 2012; qiu and jiang, 2013; got-
tipati et al., 2013) detected the contrasting perspec-
tives on a set of topics attested in distinct corpora
using lda topic modelling. some works focused
on subjectivity detection, identifying opinion, eval-
uation, and speculation in text (wiebe et al., ) and
attributing it to speci   c people (awadallah et al.,
2011; abu-jbara et al., 2012). while successful in
their tasks, these methods rely on surface linguis-
tic cues, rather than generalising patterns of human
association and conceptualisation, which limits the
information they discover to that explicitly stated.

in the meantime, much work on framing in polit-
ical science and linguistics has shown that system-
atic variations in the use of metaphor across com-
munities is a rich source of information about the
differences in world views (lakoff and wehling,
2012; shaikh et al., 2014; diaz-vera and caballero,
2013; k  ovecses, 2004; deignan and potter, 2004;
stefanowitsch, 2004; musolff, 2000). for instance,
lakoff (2002) discuss how two con   icting instan-
tiations of the nation is a family metaphor, us-
ing nurturing-parent vs. strict-father family mod-
els, explain the liberal-conservative divide in the
us politics. lakoff and wehling (2012) show that
the two models are consistent with both the par-
ties    rhetoric and their policies, and are a reliable
predictor of liberal vs. conservative values. some
works (charteris-black and ennis, 2001; barcelona,
2001; matsuki, 1995; taylor and mbense, 1998)
studied metaphor cross-linguistically and invariably
found distinct patterns of metaphorical use across
languages.

the majority of computational approaches to
metaphor focused on automatic identi   cation of
metaphorical expressions in text. they used tech-
niques such as supervised classi   cation (mohler et
al., 2013; tsvetkov et al., 2013; hovy et al., 2013),
id91 (shutova et al., 2010; shutova and sun,
2013), vector space models (shutova et al., 2012;
mohler et al., 2014), lexical resources (krishnaku-
maran and zhu, 2007; wilks et al., 2013) and
web search with lexico-syntactic patterns (veale and
hao, 2008; li et al., 2013; bollegala and shutova,
2013). two approaches looked explicitly at con-
ceptual metaphor. mason (2004) automatically ac-
quired domain-speci   c selectional preferences of

verbs, and then, by mapping their common nominal
arguments in different domains, arrived at the corre-
sponding metaphorical mappings. shutova and sun
(2013) have previously applied hgfc to acquire a
set of metaphorical associations in order to identify
metaphorical language in english text. their intu-
ition was that since metaphorical uses of words con-
stitute a large portion of contexts of abstract nouns
in a text corpus, noun id91 techniques are well
positioned to identify patterns of metaphorical asso-
ciation. in this paper, we apply hgfc to three differ-
ent languages (english, russian and spanish) and
investigate its ability to identify cross-corpus and
cross-cultural differences in metaphorical framing.
we then also investigate the psychological validity
of the identi   ed metaphors and differences by con-
ducting their behavioral evaluation.

3 experimental data
english data the english noun dataset used for
id91 contains the 2000 most frequent nouns in
the british national corpus (bnc) (burnard, 2007),
which is balanced with respect to topic and genre.
the features for id91 were extracted from the
english gigaword corpus (graff et al., 2003) due
to its large size. the corpus was parsed using the
rasp parser (briscoe et al., 2006) and verb   subject,
verb   direct object and verb   indirect object relations
were then extracted from the parser output. the fea-
tures used for noun id91 consisted of the verb
lemmas occurring in these relations with the nouns
in our dataset, indexed by relation type. the feature
values were the relative frequencies of the features.
spanish data the spanish data was extracted
from the spanish gigaword corpus (mendonca et
al., 2011). the noun dataset used for id91 con-
sisted of the 2000 most frequent nouns in this cor-
pus. the corpus was parsed using the spanish malt
parser (nivre et al., 2007; ballesteros et al., 2010).
verb   subject, verb   direct object and verb   indirect
object relations were then extracted from the out-
put of the parser and the feature vectors were con-
structed as in the english system.
russian data the russian data was extracted
from the ru-wac corpus (sharoff, 2006), a two
billion-word representative collection of text form
the russian web. the corpus was parsed using the

russian malt parser (sharoff and nivre, 2011), and
verb   subject, verb   direct object and verb   indirect
object relations were extracted to create the feature
vectors. the 2000 most frequent nouns in the ru-
wac constituted the dataset used for id91.

4 method

we    rst cluster nouns using hgfc to create a graph
of concepts with different levels of generality. the
weights on the edges of the graph indicate the
level of association between concepts (represented
as clusters). hgfc allows us to model multiple rela-
tions between concepts simultaneously via soft clus-
tering. this makes it well suited to detect the struc-
ture of metaphorical associations, where each con-
cept can be associated with several others.

4.1 hgfc id91

the algorithm successively derives probabilistic bi-
partite graphs for every level in the hierarchy. given
a set of nouns, v = {vn}n
n=1, we    rst construct
their similarity matrix w using jensen-shannon di-
vergence as a measure. the matrix w encodes an
undirected similarity graph g, where the nouns are
mapped to vertices and their similarities represent
the weights wij on the edges between vertices i and
j (see fig. 1(a)). the id91 problem can now
be formulated as partitioning of g.

the graph g and the cluster structure can be rep-
resented by a bipartite graph k(v, u ), where v are
the vertices on g and u = {up}m
p=1 represent m hid-
den clusters. for example, v on g can be grouped
into three clusters u1, u2 and u3 (fig. 1(b)). the ma-
trix b denotes the n    m adjacency matrix, with bip
being the connection weight between the vertex vi
and the cluster up. thus, b represents the connec-
tions between clusters at an upper and lower level
of id91. in order to derive the id91 struc-
ture, we    rst need to compute b from the original
similarity matrix. the similarities wij in w can be
interpreted as the probabilities of direct transition
between vi and vj: wij = p(vi, vj). the bipartite
graph k also induces a similarity (w (cid:48)) between vi
and vj, with all the paths from vi to vj going through
vertices in u. this means that the similarities w(cid:48)
ij
are to be computed via the weights bip = p(vi, up).

we optimized    by alternately updating h and   .

a    at id91 algorithm can be induced by
computing b and assigning a lower level node to the
parent node that has the largest connection weight.
the number of clusters at any level can be deter-
mined by counting the number of non-empty nodes.

to create a hierarchical graph we need to repeat the
above process to successively add levels of clusters
to the graph. to create a bipartite graph for the next
level, we    rst need to compute a new similarity ma-
trix for the clusters u. similarity between clusters
p(up, uq) can be induced from b:

p(up, uq) = p(up)p(up|uq) = (bt d   1b)pq

where d = diag(d1, ..., dn); di = (cid:80)m

p=1 bip. we
can then construct a new graph g1 (fig. 1(d)) with
the clusters u as vertices, and the cluster similarities
p(up, uq) as the connection weights. the id91
algorithm can now be applied again (fig. 1(e)). this
process can go on iteratively, leading to a hierarchi-
cal graph.

(6)

the number of levels (l) and the number of
clusters (m(cid:96)) are detected automatically, using the
method of sun and korhonen (2011). id91
starts with an initial setting of the number of clus-
ters m1 for the    rst level. in our experiments, we
set the value of m1 to 800. for the subsequent lev-
els, m(cid:96) is set to the number of non-empty clusters
on the parent level     1. the matrix b is initialized
randomly and its rows are then normalized.

for a word vi, the id203 of assigning it to

cluster x((cid:96))
p |vi) =

p(x((cid:96))

p     x(cid:96) at level (cid:96) is given by:

(cid:88)
(cid:88)
x(1)   x1
2 b2...d   1
1 b1d   1

p(x((cid:96))

= (d(   1)

x(cid:96)   1

...

p |x((cid:96)   1))...p(x(1)|vi)

(cid:96) b(cid:96))ip

(7)

sun and korhonen (2011) have shown that m(cid:96) is
non-increasing for higher levels. the algorithm can
thus terminate when all nouns are assigned to one
cluster. we run 1000 iterations of updates of h and

v1v6v2v4v3v5v7v8v9v1v7v6v9v8v2v3v4v5u1u2u3u2u1u3v1v6v2v4v3v5v7v8v9u1u2u3v1v7v6v9v8v2v3v4v5u1u2u3q1q2   (eq. 4 and 5) for each two adjacent levels. the
algorithm can be summarized as follows:

require: n nouns v , initial number of clusters m1.
compute the similarity matrix w0 from v .
build the graph g0 from w0, (cid:96)     1.
while m(cid:96) > 1 do

factorize g(cid:96)   1 to obtain bipartite graph k(cid:96) with

(cid:96) b(cid:96) according to equation 6.

adjacency matrix b(cid:96) (eqs. 4, 5).
build a graph g(cid:96) with similarity matrix w(cid:96) =
(cid:96) d   1
bt
(cid:96)     (cid:96) + 1 ; m(cid:96)     no. non-empty clusters    1.
end while
return b(cid:96), b(cid:96)   1...b1

the resulting graph is composed of a set of bipar-
tite graphs de   ned by b(cid:96), b(cid:96)   1, ..., b1. for a given
noun, we can rank the clusters at any level according
to the soft assignment id203 (eq. 7). the clus-
ters that have no member noun were hidden from
the ranking since they do not explicitly represent any
concept. however, these clusters are still part of the
organisation of the conceptual space and contribute
to the id203 for the clusters at upper levels (eq.
7). we call the view of the hierarchical graph where
these empty clusters are hidden an explicit graph.

identifying metaphorical associations

4.2
once we obtained the explicit graph of concepts, we
can identify metaphorical associations based on the
weights on the edges of the graph. taking a single
noun (e.g.    re) as input, the system computes the
id203 of its cluster membership for each clus-
ter at each level, using these weights (eq. 7). we ex-
pect the cluster membership probabilities to indicate
the level of association of the input noun with the
clusters. the system then ranks the clusters at each
level based on these probabilities. we chose level 3
as the optimal level of generality based on our qual-
itative analysis of the graph. the system selects 6
top-ranked clusters from this level and excludes the
literal cluster containing the input concept (e.g.       re
   ame blaze   ). the remaining clusters represent tar-
get concepts associated with the input concept.

example output for the input concepts of    re and
disease in english is shown in fig. 2. one can
see that each noun-to-cluster mapping represents a
new conceptual metaphor, e.g. emotion is fire,
violence is fire, crime is a disease. these

figure 3: metaphors identi   ed in the spanish data

mappings are exempli   ed in language by numerous
metaphorical expressions (e.g.    his anger blazed   ,
   violence    ared   ). figs. 3 and 4 show metaphori-
cal associations identi   ed in the spanish and rus-
sian data for the same source concepts. one can
see that feelings are associated with fire in all
three languages. however, many of the identi   ed
metaphors differ across languages: e.g., victory,
success and looks are viewed as fire in russian,
while immigrants and prisoners are associated
with fire in english and spanish. all of the lan-
guages exhibit crime is a disease metaphor, with
russian and spanish generalising it to violence is
a disease. while we do not claim that this out-
put is exhaustively representative of all conceptual
metaphors present in a particular culture, we believe
that these examples showcase some interesting dif-
ferences in the use of metaphor across datasets that
can be discovered by our method.

table 1: hgfc and baseline performance

the judges were presented with a set of mappings
identi   ed by the system and the baseline, random-
ized. they were asked to annotate the mappings
they considered valid as correct. a mapping was to
be considered valid if it could be exempli   ed by a
metaphorical expression.

two judges per language, who were native speak-
ers of english, russian and spanish participated in
this experiment. all of them held at least a bachelor
degree. their agreement was measured at    = 0.60
for english,    = 0.59 for spanish, and    = 0.55
for russian. the main differences in the annotators   
judgements stem from the fact that some metaphor-
ical associations are less obvious and common than
others, and thus need more context (or imaginative
effort) to establish. such examples of disagreement
included the metaphorical mappings intensity is
speed, goal is a child, collection is a sys-
tem, illness is a breakdown.

the system performance was then evaluated
against these judgements in terms of precision (p ),
i.e.
the proportion of the valid metaphorical map-
pings among those identi   ed. we calculated system
precision as an average over both annotations in a
given language. the results are presented in table 1.
setting 2 (recall-oriented): to measure recall, r, of
the systems we asked two annotators per language
(native speakers with a background in metaphor, dif-
ferent from set. 1) to write down up to 5 target con-
cepts they strongly associated with each of the 10
source concepts. their annotations were then aggre-
gated into a single metaphor association gold stan-
dard. the gold standard consisted of 63 mappings
for english, 70 mappings for spanish and 68 map-
pings for russian. the recall of the systems, as mea-
sured against this gold standard, is shown in table 1.
discussion and error analysis hgfc outperforms
the agg baseline in all evaluation settings and iden-
ti   es valid metaphorical associations for a range of
source concepts. agg, although less suitable for the
task, still identi   ed a number of interesting map-

figure 4: metaphors identi   ed in the russian data

5 evaluation within languages

we    rst evaluated the quality of metaphor identi-
   cation in individual languages. as there is no
comprehensive gold standard of metaphorical map-
pings available, we evaluated the identi   ed map-
pings against human judgements.
baseline we compared the system performance to
that of an agglomerative id91 baseline (agg).
we constructed agg using scipy implementation
(oliphant, 2007) of ward   s linkage method (ward,
1963). the output tree was cut according to the
number of levels and clusters in the explicit hgfc
graph. we converted this tree into a graph by adding
connections from each cluster to all the clusters one
level above. we computed the connection weights
as cluster distances measured using jensen-shannon
divergence between the cluster centroids. this
graph was then used in place of the hgfc graph.
evaluation setup and results
to create our
dataset, we extracted 10 common source concepts
that map to multiple targets from the master meta-
phor list (lakoff et al., 1991) and linguistic analy-
ses of metaphor (shutova and teufel, 2010). these
included fire, child, speed, war, disease,
breakdown, construction, vehicle, sys-
tem, business. we then translated them into
spanish and russian. each of the systems identi-
   ed 50 mappings for the given source domains. this
resulted in a set of 100 conceptual metaphors for
each language. each of them represents a number of
submappings since the target concepts are clusters
of nouns. these were then evaluated against human

language is a system, corruption is a vehi-
cle) and a number of mappings in common with
hgfc (e.g. debate is a war, destruction is a
disease). the fact that both hgfc and agg iden-
ti   ed valid metaphorical mappings across languages
con   rms our hypothesis that id91 techniques
are well suited to detect metaphorical patterns in a
distributional word space in principle.

the most frequent type of error of hgfc across
the three languages is the presence of target clusters
similar or closely related to the source noun. for
instance, the source noun child tends to be linked
to other    human    clusters across languages, e.g. the
parent cluster in english, the student, resident and
worker clusters in spanish and the crowd, journalist
and emperor clusters in russian.

the performance of the russian and the spanish
systems is slightly lower than that of the english sys-
tem. this may be due to errors from the data prepro-
cessing step, i.e. parsing. parsing quality in english
is likely to be higher than in russian or spanish, for
which fewer parsers exist. another important differ-
ence lies in the corpora used. while the english and
spanish systems were applied to the gigaword cor-
pora (containing data from news sources), the rus-
sian system was applied to the web data containing
noisier text (including misspellings, slang etc.)

6 cross-linguistic analysis

we then investigated the differences in metaphori-
cal framing, as identi   ed by our systems across lan-
guages. we ran the systems with a larger set of
source domains taken from the literature on meta-
phor and conducted a qualitative analysis of the re-
sulting metaphorical mappings. as one might ex-
pect, the majority of the identi   ed mappings are
present across languages. for instance, debate or
argument are associated with war in all three
languages; crime is universally associated with
disease and money with liquid etc.

importantly, our methods were also able to cap-
ture differences in metaphorical framing in the three
languages. for instance, they exposed some inter-
esting differences in the domains of business and
   nance. the spanish data manifested rather neg-
ative metaphors about business, market and com-

merce: business was typically associated with
bomb, fire, war, disease and enemy. while
it is the case that business is typically discussed in
terms of a war or a race in english and russian,
the other four spanish metaphors are uncommon.
russian, in fact, has rather positive metaphors for
the related concepts of money and wealth, which
are strongly associated with sun, light, star and
food, possibly indicating that money is viewed pri-
marily as a way to improve one   s life.
in con-
trast, in english, money is frequently discussed as
a weapon     a means to achieve a goal or win a
struggle (related to business is a war metaphor).
at the same time, the english data exhibits positive
metaphors for power and influence, which are
viewed as light, sun or wing. in russian, on the
contrary, power is associated with bomb and bul-
let, perhaps linking it to the concepts of physical
strength and domination. yet, the concepts of free-
dom and independence were also associated with
a wing, weapon and strength in the russian
data. english data exhibited more negative meta-
phors for immigration than russian or spanish, with
immigrants viewed as fire or enemies, possibly
indicating danger.

while the above differences may be a direct result
of the contemporary socio-economic context and po-
litical rhetoric, and are likely to change over time,
other conceptual differences have a deeper ground-
ing in our culture and the way of life. for instance,
the concept of birth tends to be strongly associated
with light in spanish and battle in russian, each
metaphor highlighting a different aspect of birth.
another interesting difference concerned the fram-
ing of the concept of economy in english and span-
ish. in english data, economy is viewed predomi-
nantly as a vehicle1, that can be driven forward or
slowed down. in spanish, on the contrary, the econ-
omy is thought of in terms of its size and growth,
but not motion. research in cognitive psychol-
ogy (casasanto and boroditsky, 2008; fuhrman et
al., 2011) suggests that such cross-linguistic differ-
ences in conventionalised metaphors have signi   -
cance beyond language and can be associated with
contrastive behavioural patterns across the differ-

1although other metaphors for the economy exist in english,

the system identi   es the statistically dominant ones.

ent linguistic communities. in the next section, we
present a behavioural study aimed at assessing the
psychological validity of a subset of cross-linguistic
differences identi   ed by our model.

7 behavioural evaluation

we focused on the difference in the metaphors used
by english vs. spanish speakers when discussing
changes in the economy. the observed difference
may be a property of language or it could also re-
   ect entrenched conceptual differences. in order to
investigate this, we test whether patterns of behav-
ior consistent with this difference in metaphorical
framing arise cross-linguistically in response to non-
linguistic stimuli.

7.1 experimental setup
we recruited 60 participants from one english-
speaking country (usa) and 60 participants from
three spanish-speaking countries (chile, mexico,
spain) using the crowdflower platform. partici-
pants    rst read a brief description of the task, which
introduced them to a    ctional country in which
economists are devising a graphic for represent-
ing changes in the economy. they then completed
a demographic questionnaire including information
about their native language. results from 9 us and
3 non-us participants were discarded for failure to
meet the language requirement.

participants navigated to a new page to complete
the experimental task. stimuli were presented in a
1200    700-pixel frame. the center of the frame
contained a sphere with a 64-pixel diameter. for
each trial, participants clicked on a button to activate
an animation of the sphere which involved (1) a pos-
itive displacement (in rightward pixels) of 10% or
20%, or a negative displacement (in leftward pixels)
of 10% or 20%; and, (2) an expansion (in increased
pixel diameter) of 10% or 20%, or a contraction (in
decreased pixel diameter) of 10% or 20%.2 they
were then asked to judge whether the economy has
   improved    or    worsened    based on the graphic.

participants saw each of the resulting conditions
3 times. the displacement and size conditions were

cal, but for a direct translation of the guidelines.

drawn from a random permutation of 16 condi-
tions using a fisher-yates shuf   e (fisher and yates,
1963). crucially, half of the stimuli contained con-
   icts of information with respect to the size and dis-
placement metaphors for economic change (e.g. the
sphere could both grow and move to the left). over-
all we expected the spanish speakers    responses to
be more closely associated with changes in diameter
(due to the salience of the size metaphor) and the en-
glish speakers    responses with displacement (due to
the salience of the vehicle metaphor). we expected
these differences to be most prominent in the con-
   icting trials, which force the participants to choose
between the two metaphors. we focus on these con-
   icting trials in our analysis.

7.2 results

in trials where stimuli moving rightward were
simultaneously contracting, english and spanish
speakers responded that the economy improved 66%
and 43% of the time respectively.
in trials where
stimuli moving leftward were simultaneously ex-
panding, english and spanish speakers judged the
economy to have improved 34% and 55% of the
time respectively. these results indicate that en-
glish speakers judgments were more biased towards
changes in the sphere   s displacement, while span-
ish speakers judgments towards changes in diame-
ter. these results support our expectation on the rel-
evance of different metaphors when reasoning about
the economy by the english and spanish speakers.
to examine the signi   cance of these effects, we    t
a binary logit mixed effects model (fox and weis-
berg, 2011) to the data. the full analysis modeled
judgment with native language, displacement, and
size as fully crossed    xed effects and participant as
a random effect. this analysis con   rmed that na-
tive language was associated with participants    judg-
ments about economic change.
it indicated that
changes in size affected english and spanish speak-
ers    judgments differently (p < 0.001), with an in-
crease in size increasing the odds (e   = 2.5) of a
judgment of improved by spanish speakers and de-
creasing the odds (e   = 0.44) of a judgment of im-
proved by english speakers. a type ii wald test re-
vealed the interaction between language and size to
be highly statistically signi   cant (  2(1) < 0.001).

8 conclusion

we presented a method that identi   es patterns of
metaphorical framing in a large text corpus. de-
spite being fully unsupervised, it operates with an
ecouraging precision. it is portable across datasets
and languages, and discovers interesting cross-
linguistic differences in metaphorical framing. we
have shown that the method predicts patterns con-
sistent with behavioural data. while much territory
remains to be investigated with respect to delimit-
ing the nature of this relationship, these results rep-
resent a    rst step toward establishing an associa-
tion between information mined from large textual
data collections and information observed through
behavioural responses on a human scale.
