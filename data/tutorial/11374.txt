abstract

words shift in meaning for many reasons,
including cultural factors like new technolo-
gies and regular linguistic processes like sub-
jecti   cation. understanding the evolution of
language and culture requires disentangling
these underlying causes. here we show how
two different distributional measures can be
used to detect two different types of seman-
tic change. the    rst measure, which has been
used in many previous works, analyzes global
shifts in a word   s id65; it
is sensitive to changes due to regular pro-
cesses of linguistic drift, such as the semantic
generalization of promise (   i promise.         it
promised to be exciting.   ). the second mea-
sure, which we develop here, focuses on local
changes to a word   s nearest semantic neigh-
bors; it is more sensitive to cultural shifts, such
as the change in the meaning of cell (   prison
cell           cell phone   ). comparing measure-
ments made by these two methods allows re-
searchers to determine whether changes are
more cultural or linguistic in nature, a distinc-
tion that is essential for work in the digital hu-
manities and historical linguistics.

introduction

distributional methods of embedding words in vec-
tor spaces according to their co-occurrence statis-
tics are a promising new tool for diachronic seman-
tics (gulordava and baroni, 2011; jatowt and duh,
2014; kulkarni et al., 2014; xu and kemp, 2015;
hamilton et al., 2016). previous work, however,
does not consider the underlying causes of seman-

tic change or how to distentangle different types of
change.

we show how two computational measures can
be used to distinguish between semantic changes
caused by cultural shifts (e.g.,
technological ad-
vancements) and those caused by more regular pro-
cesses of semantic change (e.g., grammaticalization
or subjecti   cation). this distinction is essential for
research on linguistic and cultural evolution. detect-
ing cultural shifts in language use is crucial to com-
putational studies of history and other digital hu-
manities projects. by contrast, for advancing histor-
ical linguistics, cultural shifts amount to noise and
only the more regular shifts matter.

our work builds on two intuitions:

that dis-
tributional models can highlight syntagmatic ver-
sus paradigmatic relations with neighboring words
(schutze and pedersen, 1993) and that nouns are
more likely to undergo changes due to irregular cul-
tural shifts while verbs more readily participate in
regular processes of semantic change (gentner and
france, 1988; traugott and dasher, 2001). we use
this noun vs. verb mapping as a proxy to compare
our two measures    sensitivities to cultural vs. lin-
guistic shifts. sensitivity to nominal shifts indi-
cates a propensity to capture irregular cultural shifts
in language, such as those due to technological ad-
vancements (traugott and dasher, 2001). sensitiv-
ity to shifts in verbs (and other predicates) indicates
a propensity to capture regular processes of linguis-
tic drift (gentner and france, 1988; kintsch, 2000;
traugott and dasher, 2001).

the    rst measure we analyze is based upon
changes to a word   s local semantic neighborhood;

figure 1: two different measures of semantic change. with the global measure of change, we measure how far a word has
moved in semantic space between two time-periods. this measure is sensitive to subtle shifts in usage and also global effects due
to the entire semantic space shifting. for example, this captures how actually underwent subjecti   cation during the 20th century,
shifting from uses in objective statements about the world (   actually did try   ) to subjective statements of attitude (   i actually agree   ;
see traugott and dasher, 2001 for details). in contrast, with the local neighborhood measure of change, we measure changes in a
word   s nearest neighbors, which captures drastic shifts in core meaning, such as gay   s shift in meaning over the 20th century.

we show that it is more sensitive to changes in the
nominal domain and captures changes due to unpre-
dictable cultural shifts. our second measure relies
on a more traditional global notion of change; we
show that it better captures changes, like those in
verbs, that are the result of regular linguistic drift.

our analysis relies on a large-scale statistical
study of six historical corpora in multiple lan-
guages, along with case-studies that illustrate the
   ne-grained differences between the two measures.

2 methods

we use the diachronic id97 embeddings con-
structed in our previous work (hamilton et al., 2016)
to measure how word meanings change between
consecutive decades.1 in these representations each
word wi has a vector representation w(t) (turney
and pantel, 2010) at each time point, which captures
its co-occurrence statistics for that time period. the
vectors are constructed using the skip-gram with
negative sampling (sgns) algorithm (mikolov et
al., 2013) and post-processed to align the semantic
spaces between years. measuring the distance be-
tween word vectors for consecutive decades allows
us to compute the rate at which the different words

change in meaning (gulordava and baroni, 2011).

we analyzed the decades from 1800 to 1990 using
vectors derived from the google id165 datasets
(lin et al., 2012) that have large amounts of his-
torical text (english, french, german, and english
fiction). we also used vectors derived from the cor-
pus of historical american english (coha), which
is smaller than google id165s but was carefully
constructed to be genre balanced and contains word
lemmas as well as surface forms (davies, 2010). we
examined all decades from 1850 through 2000 using
the coha dataset and used the part-of-speech tags
provided with the corpora.

2.1 measuring semantic change
we examine two different ways to measure semantic
change (figure 1).

global measure

the    rst measure analyzes global shifts in a
word   s vector semantics and is identical to the mea-
sure used in most previous works (gulordava and
baroni, 2011; jatowt and duh, 2014; kim et al.,
2014; hamilton et al., 2016). we simply take
a word   s vectors for two consecutive decades and
measure the cosine distance between them, i.e.

dg(w(t)

i

, w(t+1)

i

) = cos-dist(w(t)
i

, w(t+1)

i

).

sensitive to noun changes. examining how much nouns change relative to verbs (using coef   cients from mixed-model regressions)
reveals that the two measures are sensitive to different types of semantic change. across all languages, the local neighborhood
measure always assigns relatively higher rates of change to nouns (i.e., the right/green bars are lower than the left/blue bars for all
pairs), though the results vary by language (e.g., french has high noun change-rates overall). 95% con   dence intervals are shown.

local neighborhood measure

the second measure is based on the intuition that
only a word   s nearest semantic neighbors are rele-
vant. for this measure, we    rst    nd word wi   s set of
k nearest-neighbors (according to cosine-similarity)
within each decade, which we denote by the ordered
set nk(w(t)
i ). next, to measure the change between
decades t and t + 1, we compute a    second-order   
similarity vector for w(t)
from these neighbor sets
with entries de   ned as

i

s(t)(j) = cos-sim(w(t)
i

, w(t)
j )
i )     nk(w(t+1)
   wj     nk(w(t)

i

),

(2)

i

and we compute an analogous vector for w(t+1)
.
the second-order vector, s(t)
, contains the cosine
i
similarity of wi and the vectors of all wi   s near-
est semantic neighbors in the the time-periods t and
t + 1. working with variants of these second-order
vectors has been a popular approach in many recent
works, though most of these works de   ne these vec-
tors against the full vocabulary and not just a word   s
nearest neighbors (del prado martin and brendel,
2016; eger and mehler, 2016; rodda et al., 2016).

finally, we compute the local neighborhood

change as

i

, w(t+1)

dl(w(t)

) = cos-dist(s(t)
i

this measures the extent to which wi   s similarity
with its nearest neighbors has changed.

used k = 25 in all experiments (though we found
the results to be consistent for k     [10, 50]).

2.2 statistical methodology
to test whether nouns or verbs change more accord-
ing to our two measures of change, we build on
our previous work and used a linear mixed model
approach (hamilton et al., 2016). this approach
amounts to a id75 where the model also
includes    random    effects to account for the fact that
the measurements for individual words will be cor-
related across time (mcculloch and neuhaus, 2001).
we ran two regressions per datatset: one with the
global dg values as the dependent variables (dvs)
and one with the local neighborhood dl values. in
both cases we examined the change between all con-
secutive decades and normalized the dvs to zero-
mean and unit variance. we examined nouns/verbs
within the top-10000 words by frequency rank and
removed all words that occurred <500 times in
the smaller coha dataset. the independent vari-
ables are word frequency, the decade of the change
(represented categorically), and variable indicating

shifts. examining the semantic distance between the 1850s and 1990s shows that the global measure is more sensitive to regular
shifts (and vice-versa for the local measure). the plot shows the difference between the measurements made by the two methods.

whether a word is a noun or a verb (proper nouns
are excluded, as in hamilton et al., 2016).2

3 results

our results show that the two seemingly related
measures actually result in drastically different no-
tions of semantic change.

3.1 nouns vs. verbs
the local neighborhood measure assigns far higher
rates of semantic change to nouns across all lan-
guages and datasets while the opposite is true for
the global distance measure, which tends to assign
higher rates of change to verbs (figure 2).

we focused on verbs vs. nouns since they are
the two major parts-of-speech and previous research
has shown that verbs are more semantically mutable
than nouns and thus more likely to undergo linguis-
tic drift (gentner and france, 1988), while nouns
are far more likely to change due to cultural shifts
like new technologies (traugott and dasher, 2001).
however, some well-known regular linguistic shifts
include rarer parts of speech like adverbs (included
in our case studies below). thus we also con   rmed

ence the distributional measures (hamilton et al., 2016).

that the differences shown in figure 2 also hold
when adverbs and adjectives are included along with
the verbs. this modi   ed analysis showed analogous
signi   cant trends, which    ts with previous research
arguing that adverbial and adjectival modi   ers are
also often the target of regular linguistic changes
(traugott and dasher, 2001).

the results of this large-scale regression analy-
sis show that the local measure is more sensitive to
changes in the nominal domain, a domain in which
change is known to be driven by cultural factors.
in contrast, the global measure is more sensitive to
changes in verbs, along with adjectives and adverbs,
which are known to be the targets of many regular
processes of linguistic change (traugott and dasher,
2001; hopper and traugott, 2003)

3.2 case studies

we examined six case-study words grouped into two
sets. these case studies show that three examples of
well-attested regular linguistic shifts (set a) changed
more according to the global measure, while three
well-known examples of cultural changes (set b)
change more according to the local neighborhood
measure. table 2 lists these words with some rep-
resentative historical contexts (davies, 2010).

actuallymustpromisegayviruscell   0.3   0.10.10.3global-localchangeregularlinguisticshiftsirregularculturalshiftsset a contains three words that underwent at-
tested regular linguistic shifts detailed in traugott
and dasher (2001): actually, must, and promise.
these three words represent three different types of
regular linguistic shifts: actually is a case of subjec-
ti   cation (detailed in figure 1); must shifted from
a deontic/obligation usage (   you must do x   ) to a
epistemic one (   x must be the case   ), exemplifying
a regular pattern of change common to many modal
verbs; and promise represents the class of shift-
ing    performative speech acts    that undergo rich
changes due to their pragmatic uses and subjecti   -
cation (traugott and dasher, 2001). the contexts
listed in table 2 exemplify these shifts.

set b contains three words that were selected
because they underwent well-known cultural shifts
gay, virus, and cell.
over the last 150 years:
these words gained new meanings due to uses in
community-speci   c vernacular (gay) or technolog-
ical advances (virus, cell). the cultural shifts un-
derlying these changes in usage     e.g., the devel-
opment of the mobile    cell phone        were unpre-
dictable in the sense that they were not the result of
regularities in human linguistic systems.

figure 3 shows how much the meaning of these
word changed from the 1850s to the 1990s according
to the two different measures on the english google
data. we see that the words in set a changed more
when measurements were made using the global
measure, while the opposite holds for set b.

4 discussion

our results show that our novel local neighborhood
measure of semantic change is more sensitive to
changes in nouns, while the global measure is more
sensitive to changes in verbs. this mapping aligns
with the traditional distinction between irregular cul-
tural shifts in nominals and more regular cases of
linguistic drift (traugott and dasher, 2001) and is
further reinforced by our six case studies.

this    nding emphasizes that researchers must de-
velop and use measures of semantic change that
are tuned to speci   c tasks. for example, a cul-
tural change-point detection framework would be
more successful using our local neighborhood mea-
sure, while an empirical study of grammaticalization
would be better off using the traditional global dis-

tance approach. comparing measurements made by
these two approaches also allows researchers to as-
sess the extent to which semantic changes are lin-
guistic or cultural in nature.
