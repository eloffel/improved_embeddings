your thoughts: 

which emotional 
tone is conveyed? 

i now have my foot in the door of  the custom cake 
decorating business. i start in customer service as a 
cashier/barista, work my way through frosting, and then 
either into wedding, birthday, or sculpted cakes! i have 
been unemployed for 3 months now and this is huge. it 
means i can start saving money again, paying my bills 
and loans, and all the while doing something i love!

i create these goals for myself, such as working out or    nishing projects and until i    nish the 
goals that i have set out for myself, i can't    nish anything else. i can't go out, i can't do 
anything because all i'm thinking about are the un   nished goals.


it seems like i invested too much in it to drop it and i get trapped in this mental prison. 

but when i try to work on my projects i just sit there lethargically doing nothing. [   ]

relationships with people, such as a signi   cant other, tend to be one of  the most interesting 
things humans do. there is a lot of  variability when dealing with people, so there's a lot 
more that tends to keep our interests. perhaps    nding a signi   cant other isn't something that 
you should quit on just yet?


unfortunately, it's an unrealistic expectation to believe that different milestones will 

automatically lead to a better life. you can only expect to get enjoyment from life when you 
make enjoyment a priority. you can't passively wander through life and hope things will pick 
up, you have to seek out what you want from life and strive for it.

affect-related topics have evolved into a priority in cl 

language serves social and interpersonal functions. affective meaning is 
key for human interaction and a prominent characteristic of language use.   
 
this extends beyond opinions vs. factual or polarity distinctions into multiple 
phenomena: emotion, mood, personality, attitude, certainty, credibility, 
volition, veracity, friendliness, etc.  
 
besides recognition, characterization, or generation of affect states, this 
involves analysis of affect-related conditions, experiences, and activities. 
consider for instance: 

       communication-oriented conditions (asd) 
       job stress/satisfaction and attention 
       creative expression in literature and music 
       risk/protective factors in mental and cognitive health 
       reasoning dimensions such as decision style and confidence 
       emotive topics such as domestic violence

       steadily growing interest in affective computational semantics

challenges to automatic affect detection, 

characterization, and generation 

       emotional gist of an utterance is not simply the sum of 

emotional associations of its component words.  
 

       negation and modals impact affect of the text, without 

themselves having strong sentiment associations. 
 

       emotions are often not explicitly stated.

 conveys a sense of frustration without overt markers.  

       prosodic information often absent in text.

a few summarizing observations 

       affective meaning goes beyond sentiment and polarity 
       affect is linked to naturalness, with implications for hcc 
       useful applications and several challenges makes this an 

interesting research area to engage with 

       distinctions among affect concepts and attributes  
       affect involves acceptable categories, not right vs. wrong 

       intersubjective agreement tends to be relaxed 
       a methodological challenge to the    ground truth    concept 

-    what makes sense in a particular context?  

instructors: affect-related tasks thus represent a pedagogical opportunity to 

explore tasks without right/wrong answers and clear solutions, and help emerging 
investigators develop skills to express and model such complex semantic problems.

a few summarizing observations 

       linguistic affective signals are heterogeneous, pervasive, unobtrusive and 
inexpensive to capture. they are rich in meaning, can be layered, and 
offer a window into affect and human cognition. both what and how may 
involve affect expression. 
  

       linguistic affect data are informative     either in isolation or in combination 

with other sensing modalities.  

       many linguistic cues potentially encode affect     but they tend to also wear 
other hats. variation can be expected. sequencing/trajectory may matter.  

       their prevalence is another factor to consider; while some features may 
aid useful analysis on data subsets where they are present, they may not 
be as useful for automated prediction/detection more broadly. 

       attributes of language users (sociolinguistic variables) may play a role.

how to manually create sentiment 

lexicons with intensity values? 

       humans are not good at giving real-valued scores 

       difficult to be consistent across multiple annotations 
       challenging to maintain consistency across annotators 

       0.8 for annotator may be 0.7 for another 

 

       humans are much better at comparisons (cohen, 2003) 

       questions such as:  

is one word more positive than another? 

       large number of annotations needed. 

 

need a method that preserves the comparison aspect, 
without greatly increasing the number of annotations 
needed.

maximum difference scaling (maxdiff) 

       the annotator is presented with four words (say, a, b, c, 

and d) and asked:  
       which word is the most positive 
       which is the least positive  
 

       by answering just these two questions, five out of the six 

inequalities are known, e.g.: 
       if a is most positive  
       and d is least positive, then we know: 
             a > b, a > c, a > d, b > d, c > d

       a real-valued score for all the terms (orme, 2009)  

 

      

if two words have very different degrees of association,  
for example, if a >> d: 
       a will be chosen as most positive much more often than d 
       d will be chosen as least positive much more often than a  
 
leading to a ranked list such that: 
       a and d are significantly farther apart

based on user responses both to determine correctness of 
responses and the user   s emotional state (dogan, 2012; li et al.,

this classical reading represents an early example of work on synthesizing 
emotional speech. it describes the affect editor, a tool for generating 
expressive speech, including a diverse set of speech parameters used for 
modeling, and it discusses the implementation and results of human-based 
evaluation. the work suggested that recognizable emotions could be 
synthesized. some of the findings included that sad stimuli were particularly 
well identified, that lexical contents of sentences might influence perception, 
and that category mix-up might occur between more affectively similar 
concepts such as angry and disgusted. the paper also briefly reported on 
observing individual preferences. affective expressiveness continues to be a 
research topic in speech science and technology communities.

common internal representations from data. even though affect-related tasks 
are not directly addressed in this paper, several deep learning papers on 
valence classification draw inspiration from this work.

one   s work fits theoretically and how theoretical views are merging, including 
how that may aid the appreciation of assumptions involved or influence

this paper describes the creation of a large word   affect association lexicon 
by id104. several techniques are employed for quality control, most 
notably with the use of a separate word-choice question that ascertains 
whether the annotator knows the meaning of the target word. the question 
also guides the annotator to the desired sense of the word for which 
annotations are needed. the resulting lexicon, the nrc emotion lexicon, has 
entries for over 14,000 words and about 25,000 word senses. each instance 
is marked for associations with eight emotions, as well as positive and 
negative sentiment. the lexicon is widely used by researchers and system 
builders for various affect-related tasks.

emotion word hashtags act as good labels of emotions in the rest of the 
tweet. thus the data can be used for training machine learning systems for 
emotion classification. the success of this approach also means that one can 
now quickly compile training data for any emotion which is used as a hashtag 
in tweets. experiments are performed in an extrinsic task for personality trait 
classification, where it is shown that emotion-based features from hundreds 
of emotion categories are more useful than using features from a handful of 
affect categories (such as positive and negative sentiment, or the big six 
emotion categories).

even though a majority of current approaches in nlp are statistical, rule-
based systems are more interpretable, for example, for understanding why a 
sentence was classified as having a certain emotion by the system. this 
paper presents a rule-based system for detecting emotions at sentence level. 
it employs a number of manually created lexicons for attitude, affect 
modifiers, and even a lexicon that captures the confidence signified by modal 
verbs. at the heart of the system is a method to combine affect-related 
information from different pieces of the text using rules. developing 
compositional models statistically is a major area of research these days, and 
this work can be a source of ideas in developing composition models that 
capture affect appropriately.

several authors have proposed mutually conflicting theories about emotions, 
and till date many key aspects of emotions are hotly debated. this book by 
ortony, clore, and collins presents one such theoretical framework that 
argues that emotions are valence reactions. the valence reaction is broken 
down into several sub-categories and these subcategories are broken down 
into further sub-categories, based on whether the valence reaction was to 
the consequences of events, aspects of objects, whether the person approves 
or disapproves it, etc. ideas on the theoretical underpinnings of emotions 
and different kinds of valence reaction can be helpful for developing 
instructions for affect annotations, as well as for developing features that can 
be useful in automatic affect classification.

this work studies the nature of meaning. one of its most influential

several dimensions such as fair   unfair, strong   weak, safe   dangerous, etc. 
factor analysis of the responses is used to show that the three dimensions

negative valence. no training data was provided, and so only unsupervised 
systems were able to participate. nonetheless, the testset created as part of 
this shared task has subsequently been used by supervised systems by 
splitting it into new train   test partitions. one of the key distinctions of this 
work compared to the shared tasks proposed in the last few years is that this 
is one of the few datasets that has fine-grained annotation for the degree of

applied to unsupervised classification of reviews. proceedings of the 40th 
annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics, philadelphia, 
pa, 417-424. empirical (system). 
this paper presents a way to classify customer reviews as positive 
(recommended) or negative (not recommended). at the heart of the method 
is a way to determine the degree of positiveness (or negativeness) of a word 
by calculating the mutual information score between it and sets of positive 
and negative seed terms. this fundamental approach is still used (possibly 
with minor modification) for creating sentiment and emotion association 
lexicons.

subjective language. computational linguistics, 30(3), 277   308. 
seminal/classical. 
this article presents early, comprehensive efforts to automatically detect 
subjective language. supervised classification is performed on a number of 
datasets using various features, including low-frequency words, collocations, 
and words that are distributionally similar to pre-chosen seed words. the 
paper is also an excellent resource for understanding the principles 
underpinning subjective language.
