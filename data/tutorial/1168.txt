the meaning and coherence of a discourse 

results partly from how its constituents relate to 
each other. 

       reference relations 
       discourse relations 

      informational 
      intentional 

informational discourse relations convey 

relations that hold in the subject matter.  
intentional discourse relations specify how 

intended discourse effects relate to each other.

discourse relations provide a level of description that is  

       theoretically interesting, linking sentences (clauses) 

and discourse 

       identifiable more or less reliably on a sufficiently 

large scale 

       capable of supporting a level of id136 potentially 

relevant to many nlp applications.

lexical elements and structure 
       lexically-triggered discourse relations can relate 

the abstract object interpretations of non-adjacent 
as well as adjacent components. discourse 
connectives serve as the lexical triggers 

       discourse relations can be triggered by structure 

underlying adjacency, i.e., between adjacent 
components unrelated by lexical elements. 

11 

sources of discourse meaning resemble the 
sources of sentence meaning, for example, 
       structure: e.g., verbs and their arguments conveying pred-
       adjacency: e.g., noun-noun modifiers conveying relations 
       anaphora: e.g., modifiers like other and next, conveying 

arg relations; 

implicitly;  

relations anaphorically.

       subordinating conjunctions and subordinators

explicit connectives are the lexical items that trigger discourse 

relations. 

       subordinating conjunctions (e.g., when, because, although, etc.) 
       the federal government suspended sales of u.s. savings 

bonds because congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on 
government debt.  

       coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, or, so, nor, etc.) 
and viewers will be given a 900 number to call. 

       the subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows, 

       discourse adverbials (e.g., then, however, as a result, etc.) 

        in the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly 

limited the size of     industrial concerns to conserve resources 
and restrict the profits businessmen could make. as a result, 
industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient 
industrial units.  

15 

primary criterion for filtering: arguments must denote abstract 

objects. 

the following are rejected because the ao criterion is not met 

       dr. talcott led a team of researchers from the national cancer 

institute and the medical schools of harvard university and 
boston university.  

       equitable of iowa cos., des moines, had been seeking a buyer 
for the 36-store younkers chain since june, when it announced 
its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business. 

16 

connectives can be modified by adverbs and focus 

particles: 
       that power can sometimes be abused, (particularly) since 
jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the 
restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas.  

       you can do all this (even) if you're not a reporter or a researcher 

or a scholar or a member of congress.  

initially identified connective (since, if) is extended to include 
modifiers. 

      
       each annotation token includes both head and modifier (e.g., even 
       each token has its head as a feature (e.g., if) 

if). 

17 

paired connectives take the same arguments: 

       on the one hand, mr. front says, it would be misguided to 

sell into "a classic panic." on the other hand, it's not 
necessarily a good time to jump in and buy. 

       either sign new long-term commitments to buy future 

episodes or risk losing "cosby" to a competitor. 

       treated as complex connectives     annotated 

discontinuously 

       listed as distinct types (no head-modifier relation) 

18 

multiple relations can sometimes be expressed as a 

conjunction of connectives:  

       when and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems 

increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its manville stock to 
cash. 

       hoylake dropped its initial #13.35 billion ($20.71 billion) takeover 

bid after it received the extension, but said it would launch a 
new bid if and when the proposed sale of farmers to axa 
receives regulatory approval.  

       treated as complex connectives 
       listed as distinct types (no head-modifier relation) 

19 

       arg2 is the sentence/clause with which connective is syntactically 

associated. arg1 is the other argument. 

       no constraints on relative order. discontinuous annotation is allowed. 

       linear: 

       the federal government suspended sales of u.s. savings bonds 
because congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt.  

      

interposed: 
      most oil companies, when they set exploration and production 
budgets for this year, forecast revenue of $15 for each barrel of 
crude produced. 

      the chief culprits, he says, are big companies and business groups 
that buy huge amounts of land "not for their corporate use, but for 
resale at huge profit."     the ministry of finance, as a result, has 
proposed a series of measures that would restrict business 
investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed 
at individuals.  

20 

       same sentence as arg2: 

       the federal government suspended sales of u.s. savings bonds 
because congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt.  

       sentence immediately previous to arg2: 

       why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic 

cycles? because real-estate purchases and leases are such 
major long-term commitments that most companies and 
individuals make these decisions only when confident of future 
economic stability and growth.  

       previous sentence non-contiguous to arg2 : 

       mr. robinson     said plant genetic's success in creating 

genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean 
it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops. that's because 
pollination, while easy in corn because the carrier is wind, is more complex 
and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton. "it's one thing to say 
you can sterilize, and another to then successfully pollinate the plant," he said. 
nevertheless, he said, he is negotiating with plant genetic to 
acquire the technology to try breeding hybrid cotton.  

21 

       simplest syntactic realization of an abstract object argument is: 

       a clause, tensed or non-tensed, or ellipsed. 
 the clause can be a matrix, complement, coordinate, or subordinate 
clause. 

       a chemical spokeswoman said the second-quarter charge was "not 

material" and that no personnel changes were made as a result. 

       in washington, house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the 

collar, which banned program trades through the big board's 
computer when the dow jones industrial average moved 50 
points, didn't work well. 

       knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one, the 

executives gave the chefs a standing ovation.  

       syntactically implicit elements for non-finite and extracted clauses 

are assumed to be available. 
       players for the tokyo giants, for example, must always wear 

ties when on the road. 

22 

       any number of clauses can be selected as arguments: 

       here in this new center for japanese assembly plants just 

across the border from san diego, turnover is dizzying, 
infrastructure shoddy, bureaucracy intense. even after-hours 
drag; "karaoke" bars, where japanese revelers sing over 
recorded music, are prohibited by mexico's powerful musicians 
union. still, 20 japanese companies, including giants such as 
sanyo industries corp., matsushita electronics components 
corp. and sony corp. have set up shop in the state of northern 
baja california. 

but, the selection is constrained by a minimality principle: 

       only as many clauses and/or sentences should be included as 
are minimally required for interpreting the relation. any other 
span of text that is perceived to be relevant (but not necessary) 
should be annotated as supplementary information: 
       sup1 for material supplementary to arg1 
       sup2 for material supplementary to arg2 

23 

       discontinuous annotation is allowed when 
including non-clausal modifiers and heads: 

       they found students in an advanced class a year earlier 
who said she gave them similar help, although because 
the case wasn't tried in court, this evidence was never 
presented publicly. 

       he says that when dan dorfman, a financial columnist 

with usa today, hasn't returned his phone calls, he 
leaves messages with mr. dorfman's office saying that 
he has an important story on donald trump, meshulam 
riklis or marvin davis.

when there is no explicit connective present to relate adjacent 

sentences, it may be possible to infer a discourse relation between 
them due to adjacency. 
       some have raised their cash positions to record levels. 

implicit=? high cash positions help buffer a fund when the 
market falls. 

       the projects already under construction will increase las 
vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 
75,500. implicit=?) by a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each 
new hotel room, clark county will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.  

such implicit connectives are annotated by inserting a connective 

that    best    captures the relation. 

       sentence delimiters are: period, semi-colon, colon 
       left character offset of arg2 is    placeholder    for these implicit 

connectives.

intra-sententially, e.g., between main clause and free adjunct: 
       (consequence: so/thereby) second, they channel monthly 

mortgage payments into semiannual payments, reducing the 
administrative burden on investors.  

       (continuation: then) mr. cathcart says he has had "a lot of fun" 

at kidder, adding the crack about his being a "tool-and-die 
man" never bothered him. 

implicit connectives in addition to explicit connectives: if at least 
one connective appears explicitly, any additional ones are not 
annotated: 
       (consequence: so) on a level site you can provide a cross pitch 
to the entire slab by raising one side of the form, but for a 20-
foot-wide drive this results in an awkward 5-inch slant. instead, 
make the drive higher at the center. 

28 

decision point 4: 

       like the arguments of explicit connectives, arguments 

of implicit connectives can be sentential, sub-sentential, 
multi-clausal or multi-sentential: 
       legal controversies in america have a way of assuming a 
symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the 
particular case. they speak volumes about the state of our 
society at a given moment. it has always been so. implicit=for 
example (exemplification) in the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, 
john t. scopes, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case 
sponsored by the american civil liberties union to challenge a 
ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the tennessee 
legislature. the result was a world-famous trial exposing 
profound cultural conflicts in american life between the "smart 
set," whose spokesman was h.l. mencken, and the religious 
fundamentalists, whom mencken derided as benighted 
primitives. few now recall the actual outcome: scopes was 
convicted and fined $100, and his conviction was reversed on 
appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law. 

29 

there are three types of cases where implicit connectives 

cannot be inserted between adjacent sentences. 

       altlex: a discourse relation is inferred, but insertion of 
an implicit connective leads to redundancy because the 
relation is alternatively lexicalized by some non-
connective expression: 

       ms. bartlett's previous work, which earned her an international 
reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens 
as its nominal subject. altlex = (consequence) mayhap this 
metaphorical connection made the bpc fine arts committee 
think she had a literal green thumb.  

30 

       entrel: the coherence is due to an entity-based relation. 
       hale milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at elecktra 
entertainment inc., was named president of capitol records inc., a unit 
of this entertainment concern. entrel mr. milgrim succeeds david 
berman, who resigned last month.  
       norel: neither discourse nor entity-based relation is 

inferred. 
       jacobs is an international engineering and construction 

concern. norel total capital investment at the site could be as 
much as $400 million, according to intel. 

    since entrel and norel do not express discourse 
relations, no semantic classification is provided for 
them. 

31 

       about 18,000 tokens 

       implicit connectives: about 14,000 tokens 

       altlex: about 200 tokens 
       entrel: about 3200 tokens 

       norel: about 350 tokens 

32 

       attribution features are annotated for  

       explicit connectives 
      
implicit connectives 
       altlex 

    34% of discourse relations are attributed to 

an agent other than the writer.

       mismatches occur with other relations as well, such as 

causal relations: 

      credit analysts said investors are nervous about the 
issue because they say the company's ability to meet 
debt payments is dependent on too many variables, 
including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage 
property to retire some existing debt.

37 

       attribution cannot always be excluded by default 

      advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an 
hour by april 1991, is too small for the working poor, 
while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt 
small business and cost many thousands of jobs.  

38 

attribution is annotated on relations and arguments, with 

four features 
       source: encodes the different agents to whom proposition is 

attributed 
       wr: writer agent 
       ot:  other non-writer agent
