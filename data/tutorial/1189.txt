abstract

   this monograph provides an overview of general deep learning
   methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information
   processing tasks. the application areas are chosen with the following
   three criteria in mind: (1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; (2)
   the application areas that have already been transformed by the
   successful use of deep learning technology, such as id103
   and id161; and (3) the application areas that have the
   potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have
   been experiencing research growth, including natural language and text
   processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information
   processing empowered by multi-task deep learning.

deep learning

   deep learning: methods and applications provides an overview of general
   deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal
   and information processing tasks. the application areas are chosen with
   the following three criteria in mind: (1) expertise or knowledge of the
   authors; (2) the application areas that have already been transformed
   by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech
   recognition and id161; and (3) the application areas that
   have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and
   that have been benefitting from recent research efforts, including
   natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and
   multimodal information processing empowered by multitask deep learning.

   deep learning: methods and applications is a timely and important book
   for researchers and students with an interest in deep learning
   methodology and its applications in signal and information processing.

   "this book provides an overview of a sweeping range of up-to-date deep
   learning methodologies and their application to a variety of signal and
   information processing tasks, including not only automatic speech
   recognition (asr), but also id161, id38, text
   processing, multimodal learning, and information retrieval. this is the
   first and the most valuable book for "deep and wide learning" of deep
   learning, not to be missed by anyone who wants to know the breathtaking
   impact of deep learning on many facets of information processing,
   especially asr, all of vital importance to our modern technological
   society."     sadaoki furui, president of toyota technological institute
   at chicago, and professor at the tokyo institute of technology
