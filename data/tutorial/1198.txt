(cid:73) learning algorithms assume exact search
(cid:73) pruning, id125 and other approximations break this

introduction

parsing general graphs

(cid:73) tree constraint often just a computational convenience
(cid:73) conceptually, dependency graphs don   t need to be trees
(cid:73) directed arcs between words can encode:

(cid:73) raising and control structures
(cid:73) more direct co-ordination structures
(cid:73) traces and wh-movement
(cid:73) . . .

(cid:73) such structures are more semantic in nature
(cid:73) mcdonald and pereira [2006] parse dags with approximate

graph-based id136

(cid:73) sagae and tsujii [2008] extend transition-based system to

parse dags

(cid:73) many other solutions in conll 2008 and 2009 shared tasks

[surdeanu et al. 2008, haji  c et al. 2009]

introduction

using phrase-structure parsers

(cid:73) lexicalized phrase-structure parsers produce dependencies

[collins 1999, charniak 2000]

(cid:73) phrase-structure parsers can also produce dependencies via

post-processing [cer et al. 2010]

(cid:73) latter is more accurate [mcdonald et al. 2005]
(cid:73) bias in post-processing [petrov and mcdonald 2012]

(cid:73) dependency to phrase-structure treebank conversion

[collins et al. 1999]

(cid:73) coppola and steedman [2013]: cube-pruned phrase-structure

parser with dependency features

(cid:73) highest reported en scores for both phrase-structure and

dependency evalualtions

(cid:73) caveat: conversion heuristics to generate dependencies
(cid:73) can combine with cube-pruned dependency parsers

improved evaluations

introduction

(cid:73) las/uas evaluations are useful, but

(cid:73) treat all errors as equal
(cid:73) don   t say anything about downstream performance
(cid:73) only allow comparisons on single annotation scheme

(cid:73) targeted dependency evaluations

(cid:73) long-distance and/or implicit dependencies

[rimell et al. 2009, nivre et al. 2010]

(cid:73) downstream task evals [miyao et al. 2008]

(cid:73) training to optimize task speci   c evals [hall et al. 2011]

(cid:73) annotation-scheme independent evaluations [tsarfaty et al. 2011]

where do we stand?

(cid:73) 2008

(cid:73) graph-based and transition-based have near identical

accuracies [buchholz and marsi 2006]

(cid:73) but very di   erent errors [mcdonald and nivre 2007]
(cid:73) and errors can be correlated with model properties

(cid:73) 2014

(cid:73) 2008+: attempts to address model short-comings
(cid:73) models have converged (id170, rich features,

heuristic id136)

(cid:73) accuracies again nearly identical [zhang et al. 2013]

do graph-based and transition-based parsers still make di   erent

kinds of errors?
