seekaywhy

   a probabilistic cky parser for pid18s.
     * accepts arbitrary binary grammars, in the same format as used by
       bitpar.
     * input and output is also similar to bitpar: input is one word per
       line, sentences separated by a blank line.
     * produces exact k-best lists for arbitrary k, on the basis of an
       exhaustive chart
     * coarse-to-fine parsing: parse first with a coarse grammar with
       symbols of the form a, then parse with fine grammar with symbols of
       the form a@x (wip).
     * reranking with dop reductions: compute the exact dop parse
       id203 of the derivations from a coarse grammar.

   nb: all of these features are now incorporated in disco-dop; cf.
   [78]https://github.com/andreasvc/disco-dop

requirements:

     * python 2.6+ [79]http://www.python.org (need headers, e.g.
       python-dev package)
     * cython 0.15+ [80]http://www.cython.org
     * gcc [81]http://gcc.gnu.org/
     * nltk [82]http://www.nltk.org
     * numpy [83]http://numpy.scipy.org/

   for example, to install these dependencies and compile the code on
   ubuntu (tested on 12.04), run the following sequence of commands:
sudo apt-get install cython python-dev python-nltk python-numpy build-essential
git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/andreasvc/seekaywhy.git
cd seekaywhy
make

   alternatively cython, nltk, and numpy can all be installed with pip
   install cython nltk numpy, which does not require root rights and may
   be more up-to-date.

example invocation:

$ python parser.py t.rules t.lexicon t.test
...
parsing: 0 john sees the boy with the telescope 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
(top (s (np (pn john)) (vp (vp (v sees) (np (dt the) (nn boy))) (pp (in with) (n
p (dt the) (nn telescope))))))
...

   an example of coarse-to-fine with a pid18 reduction of dop as the fine
   grammar:
$ python parser.py t.rules t.lexicon tdop.rules tdop.lexicon t.test
...
pruning ... sentprob=0.00617284   16 of 16 nonzero coarse items left
copied chart.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
(top (s (np (pn john)) (vp (vp (v sees) (np (dt the) (nn boy))) (pp (in with) (n
p (dt the) (nn telescope))))))

   reranking pid18 parses using a dop reduction as the fine grammar:
$ python parser.py --rerank 3 t.rules t.lexicon tdop.rules tdop.lexicon t.test
...

(top (s (np (pn john)) (vp (vp (v sees) (np (dt the) (nn boy))) (pp (in with) (n
p (dt the) (nn telescope))))))
