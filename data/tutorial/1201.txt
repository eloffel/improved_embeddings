phrase-based translation p

morgen  fliege  ich   nach kanada  zur konferenz

tomorrow  i  will fly   to the conference  in canada

(cid:15) foreign input is segmented in phrases
(cid:15) each phrase is translated into english
(cid:15) phrases are reordered

    any sequence of words, not necessarily linguistically motivated

    top systems in darpa/nist evaluation are phrase-based

limits on reordering p

(cid:15) reordering may be limited
    only phrase movements of at most  words
(cid:15) reordering limits speed up search
(cid:15) current reordering models are weak, so limits improve
