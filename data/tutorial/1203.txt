evaluation of translation qualityesslli 2005chris callison-burchevaluating mt quality   why do we want to do it?   - want to rank systems   - want to evaluate incremental changes   how not to do it   - ``back translation''   - the vodka is not goodevaluating human translation quality   why?   - quality control   - decide whether to re-hire freelance      translators   - career promotion ways to evaluate   task-based evaluation   - reading comprehension   - assemble something   - navigate a map      assign a value using a quality scale   - us military categorization system   - fluency / adequacy dlpt-crt   defense language pro   ciency test/constructed response test   read texts of varying dif   culty, take test   structure of test   - limited responses for questions   - not multiple choice, not completely open   - test progresses in dif   culty   - designed to assign level at which      examinee fails to sustain pro   ciencydlpt-crt   level 1: contains short, discrete, simple sentences.  newspaper announcements.   level 2:  states facts with purpose of conveying information.  newswire stories.   level 3: has denser syntax, convey opinions with implications. editorial articles / opinion.   level 4: often has highly specialized terminology.  professional journal articles.human evaluation of machine translation   one group has tried applying dlpt-crt to machine translation   -

statistical parsing requires treebanks   - wsd requires text labeled w/ word senses   - ner requires text w/named entities   - smt requires parallel corporacost of creating  training data   creating this training data is usually time consuming and expensive   as a result the amount of training data is often limited   smt is different   - parallel corpora are created by other      human industry    - for some language pairs huge data sets      are availableexploiting parallel corpora   can we use this abundant resource for tasks other than machine translation?   can we use it to alleviate the cost of creating training data?    can we use it to port resources to other languages?three applications of parallel corpora   automatic generation of paraphrases   creating training data for wsd   "projecting" annotations through parallel corpora so that they can be applied to new languagesid141 with bilingual parallel corporaid141   paraphrases are alternative ways of conveying the same information    useful in nlp application such as:  - generation: more varied and    uent text  - multidocument summarization: allows    repeated information to be condensed   - id53: paraphrases of same    answer provide evidence of correctnessprevious approaches   used monolingual parallel corpora    multiple translations of the same thing   - multiple translations of classic french     novels into english    - evaluation data for id7 mt eval metric   people have also used comparable corpora (encyclopedia articles on the same topic) id141 with monolingual parallel data   methodology:    - align sentences across translations    - identify similar contexts in aligned sentences    - phrases that appear in similar contexts may        be paraphrases emma burst into tears and he tried to comfort her, saying things to make her smile.emma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his words with puns. burst into tears = cried,   console = comfortproblems   monolingual parallel corpora are very uncommon   this fact might limit what paraphrases we are able to generateid141 with bilingual parallel data   our methodology:    - use mt techniques to align english-     german parallel text   - get german phrase aligned with the     english phrase we want to paraphrase   - find other english phrases that german      phrases align with    - treat those english phrases as      paraphrases, and rank them examplewhatismore,therelevantcostdynamiciscompletelyundercontrolim  brigen istdiediesbez  gliche kostenentwicklung v  llig unter kontrolleweoweittothetaxpayerstokeepincheckthecostswirsind esdensteuerzahlern die kostenzuhabenschuldig  unter kontrolleextracted paraphrases   military force ! armed forces, defence, force, forces, peace-keeping personnel, military forces   sooner or later ! at some point, eventually   great care ! a careful approach, greater emphasis, particular attention, speci   c attention, special attention, very careful   at work ! at the workplace, employment, held, holding, in the work sphere, organised, operate, taken place, took place, working id51 with parallel corporaid51   de   ne a set of senses for words, or draw them from a dictionary   plant1=foliage, plant2= factory, plant3= to put something in the ground    develop an algorithm to assign a sense to a word in contextdata for wsd   statistical approaches to wsd generally use a large set of labeled training data, where each of the words to be disambiguated has been labeled with its sense   the senseval competitions create such data, for training and for evaluation   generally label 1,000s of instances of around 30 vocabulary itemsproblem   data is costly to create   consequently only a few vocabulary items get labeled   there is a bottleneck in the process of creating statistical wsd systemsbreaking the bottleneck   rather than doing wsd with explicitly labeled data we could do it with parallel corpora   treat words as polysemous when they translate to more than one foreign worddrugs1regards classification as medicinal products or  drugs  ,en particulier par rapport aux  m  dicaments  et autres produits pharmaceutiques , drugs2in my country we have 2 million people on illegal  drugs  ,dans mon pays , 2 millions de personnes consomment des  drogues  illicites ,just say no to hard drugs!senseless violence   two options:- either use the foreign words as the senses- or keep using the senses as given    dictionary and use the foreign words as a    way of acquiring more labeled data   when a particular dictionary sense only occurs with one of the foreign word then use sentence pairs which have that contain that word as additional data points annotation projection for parsingstatistical parsing   statistical parsers are trained on treebanks containing sentences annotated with parse trees   developing treebanks requires linguistics expertise and is a time consuming, expesive process   treebanks exist only for a limited number of languages, and are often constrained in sizedevelopment time for treebankslanguagetreebankdev timesize of corpus parser performanceenglishid325 years1m words40k sentences90%chinesechinese treebank v22 years100k words4k sentences75%chinesechinese treebank v24 years400k words15k sentences~80%others (farsi, hindi)????exploit resources for new languages   use high accuracy english parsers to parse english section of a parallel corpus   align the parallel corpus   project the trees onto the other language   use that to train a foreign language parsercreate an english dependency parseproject the dependency parseautomatically create a foreign treebank   continue repeating those steps for all of the sentences in the parallel corpus   use the project trees to train a chinese parserpotential problems   low quality word alignments may cause problems   mis-matches between the syntax of languages complicate things   differences between text that english parser was trained on (newswire) and parallel corpus (gov't) may exacerbate thingsresults   with manually created alignments, a 67% accuracy was achieved   with automatic alignments, a 57% accuracy was achieved   equivalent to manually creating a treebank containing 3000 sentencesconclusions   parallel data can be exploited to supplement data for a number of statistical nlp tasks   many different tasks can be treated using annotation projection    increases the feasibility of developing nlp technologies for other languages   as quality of word alignment algorithms improve, these techniques will become more viable
