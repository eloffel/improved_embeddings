processing levels of natural language texts 

words 

lexical entries (words) are the units of meaning and the  
basic building blocks of language.  

a word is made up of a root and possibly other morphemes  
(prefixes or suffixes); for example, 'phosphorylates    consists  
of the root 'phosphorylate' plus the third person singular  
present tense morpheme '-s'.  

morphemes can also modify the meaning or change part of  
speech; for example, the suffix '-tion' changes the verb  
('phosphorylate') into the related noun ('phosphorylation'),  
and the prefix 'de-' can negate the meaning, as in 'deactivation'. 

the syntax or grammar of a language controls how words are grouped into  
meaningful phrases and eventually into sentences.  

syntax 

word order is used to convey grammatical relations such as  
subject-verb-object.  

in the sentence 'vrk1 phosphorylates c-jun', the noun 'vrk-1' is the subject  
(and actor) for the verb 'phosphorylate    whereas 'c-jun' is the object (recipient  
of the action).  

words can be associated with part-of-speech (pos) tags, to distinguish nouns,  
verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions,..  

pos taggers are computer programs that automatically assign each word its  
corresponding pos label, generally based on ml. 

the biomedical literature shows a slightly different pos distribution as  
compared to general english newswire texts -> specialized taggers optimized  
for the biomedical domain, such as the medpost [29] tagger or dtagger [30].  
pos information can be useful to detect textual patterns expressing protein  
interactions [31] or to locate gene and protein mentions [32]. 

semantic relations capture meaning.  

semantics 

'c-jun is activated by vrk1' can be represented as an operator (the verb 'activate)  
operating on two arguments - 'activate (vrk1, c-jun)' - in the same way that a logical  
operator operates on its arguments.  

the semantic representation abstracts away from the details of the underlying syntax  
(and specific words), to capture regularities.  

thus, in this example, the semantics capture the fact that vrk1 does the activation, 
 and c-jun is activated. 

pragmatics 

pragmatic or discourse relations capture the larger context and its contribution to  
meaning.  

text-mining tools often rely on sentences as the basic processing unit for extracting  
associations between biological entities.  

however, descriptions of these relations go beyond sentence boundaries and make  
use of referring expressions, as is the case in the following two sentences: 

(a) 'dictyostelium lis1 (ddlis1) is a microtubule-associated protein exhibiting 53%  
identity to human lis1.'  

(b) 'it colocalizes with dynein at isolated, microtubule-free centrosomes, suggesting  
that both are integral centrosomal components.'

   features of well-structured language 
       the statistical analysis of these features in large text collections  
   is generally the basic approach used by nlp techniques.

basic characteristics: biomedical literature 

       heavy use of domain specific terminology (12%        biochemistry related 
technical terms*), examples: 
chemoattractant, fibroblasts, angiogenesis    
       polysemic words (id51), examples: apc: (1) argon 
plasma coagulation (2) activated protein c; or teashirt: (1) a type of cloth (2) 
a gene name (tsh). 
       heavy use of acronyms, examples: activated protein c (apc) , or vascular 
endothelial growth factor (vegf)  
      typographical variants (e.g. in writing gene names), example: tnf-alpha  
and tnf alpha (without hyphen)  
       most words with low frequency (data sparseness)

1.5 biomedical literature repositories 

electronically accessible to the public through the worldwide web  

1. centralized institutional (for example, pubmed) or academic (for instance, 
highwire press and hollis) repositories of peer-reviewed articles or article 
abstracts. 

2. article collection repositories hosted by publishers (for example, biomed 
central and embase). 

3. online access to indexed scholar articles retrieved through web spiders and 
crawlers (for example, google scholar and scirus). 

referrals from search engines to web sites of 900 journals hosted by highwire 
(steinbrook, n engl j med 2006): google 33.0%, other search engines (includes 
pmc) 25.1%, pubmed 24.7%, google scholar 8.8%. yahoo 5.8%, highwire 
1.8%, msn 0.7%. 

falagas et al (2007) provides and overview of world literature databases for the 
biomedical field. 

pubmed database 

        citation entries of scientific articles of all biomedical sciences, nursing, 
biochemistry, engineering, chemistry, environmental sciences, 
psychology, etc,... 

       developed at the ncbi (nih).  
       digital library contains more than 18 million citations  
       from over 4,800 biomedical journals 
       most articles (over 12 million) articles in english.  
       each entry is characterized by a unique identifier, the pubmed 
identifier: pmid.  

       more than half of them (over 7,000,000) have abstracts 
       often links to the full text articles are displayed.

id121: identifying words & sentences 

segmentation of the string of characters into words. 

normally, word boundaries: by white space, and a sentence boundary is 
indicated by '.' (period or full stop).  

complications in scientific literature: use of '.' in decimals ('1.09'), use of '/' 
to link multiple gene names ('waf/cip-1'), variable use of white space in 
gene names, such as 'brca 2' versus 'brca-2   ,...  

id121 -> typographical processing at character level, handle special 
characters and white space, upper case and lower case, superscripts and 
subscripts, and equivalence of roman, greek, and numerical suffixes. 

id121 of life science articles: julie lab provides tools that can be 
used for detecting token and sentence boundaries; the biomedical 
tokenizer and stemmer by arrowsmith group or the pennbioie tokenizer.

information retrieval (ir) and search engines 

    

       ir: recovery of documents from collection that satisfy a given     
  information demand. 
       information demand often posed in form of a search query.  
       example: retrieval of web-pages using search engines, e.g.  
  google, entrez (pubmed), hubmed, highwire press, semedico . 
       important steps for indexing document collection:   

1- id121 (split into words) 
2- case folding (upper case - lower case) 
3- id30 (word root, inflexions, affixes) 
4- stop word removal (uninformative words, e.g. prepositions,..) 
       efficient indexing to reduce vocabulary of terms and query  
   formulations (inverted file index). 
       example: 'glycogenin and  binding' and 'glycogenin and   
   bind'.  
       query types: boolean query and vector space model based    
  query.  
42 

zipf  s law 

       a small number of words occur very often 
       those high frequency words are often function

boolean query 

       based on combination of terms using boolean operators. 
       basic boolean operators: and, or and not.  
       queries matched against the terms in the inverted index file. 
       entrez     boolean search in pubmed. 
       fast, easy to implement. 
       search engines: often stop word removal and case folding. 
       stop word removal : space saving speed improvement. 
       return a unranked list. 
       return large list of documents, many not relevant.  
       terms have different information content ->  
   better weighted query.

selective dissemination of information (sdi) 
       service provided by a library or data repository institution    
   which periodically alerts users of new publications.  
       new publications can be associated to certain subjects or  
   information demands  
       often based on automated iterative/periodical ir queries. 
       advantages: new publications are automatically announced   
   (e.g. using e-mail alerts) 
       disadvantages: implicit to ir based on boolean queries, often  
   not-relevant articles.

       similarity of documents instead of similarity of sequences, expression profiles or 
   structures 
       cluster documents into topics or sub-topics. 
       choose first documents representative of the middle of each clusters  
  (candidate centers of the clusters).  
       then compare all the documents to these initial representatives.  
       each documents is assigned to the cluster it is most similar to.  
       similarity based on words the documents have in common and their weights  
      the topical terms of the clusters are chosen from words that represent the center  
  of the cluster. 
       best id91: average difference of the documents to their cluster centers smallest

text categorization 

      common problem in information science.  
      assignment of document to one or more categories, based on its contents 
(words).  
      can be divided into two sorts: supervised document classification where some  
external mechanism (such as human feedback) provides information on the 
correct classification for documents, and unsupervised document classification. 
      semi-supervised learning, generally only one class with labels. 
       document classification techniques include: 
    * naive bayes classifier 
    * tf-idf  
    * id45 (lsi) 
    * support vector machines (id166s) 
    * id158 
    * knn 
    * id90, such as   
    * concept mining,    . (and others) 

       classification techniques have been applied to spam filtering 
       cane use the weka, matlab, bow toolkit, id166light, libid166 etc,..

detection of compound mentions 

oscar3 (open source chemistry analysis routines) is software for 
the semantic annotation of chemistry papers. 

oscar3 is a tool for shallow, chemistry-specific parsing of chemical 
documents. it identifies (or attempts to identify): 

    * chemical names: singular nouns, plurals, verbs etc., also 
formulae and acronyms, some enzymes and reaction names. 

          - ontology terms: if you can do it by string-matching, you can 
get oscar to do it. 

          - chemical data: spectra, melting/boiling point, yield etc. in 
experimental sections.

ihop system: confidence 

the synomnym ambiguity limitation 
many gene or protein synonyms are ambiguous, thus one and the same synonym is often used for different genes.  
even human experts can have difficulties to resolve such ambiguities and automatic systems, like ihop,  
will therefore always exhibit certain errors.  

the ihop confidence value 
although no definite solution for the problem of synonym ambiguity is in sight, it is possible to put an automatically 
derived confidence value to specific gene references.  
this ihop confidence value is illustrated through the colour intensity of a star 

the absence of a star does not mean that a certain term could not be a gene, 

 but simply that supporting evidence is not available.

       critical assessment of information extraction systems in biology 
      community challenge evaluation a community-wide effort for evaluating id111 
 and information extraction systems applied to the biological domain. 
      increasing nr. of groups working in the area of id111, new systems, publications. 
      need of common standards or shared evaluation criteria to enable comparison  
      avoid the limitations of using private data sets: one system = one evaluation data set  
      promote development of systems which scale to real applications 
      community assessment of scientific progress: monitor improvements 
      involve domain experts (end users) and biological database curators and domain experts 
      extraction of biologically relevant and useful information from the literature.  

128 

       tasks: gene mention tagging, gene mention id172 (human, mouse, fly, yeast),     
   go annotation for human gene products , ppi (triage/article, pairs, methods,  
   evidence passages). 
      increased performance of the composite system (weighting contributions of all  
   participating systems) 
       importance of collaboration with biological databases (domain experts) 
       avoid bias based on journal composition in test or training data 
       need to go beyond abstracts: importance of full text articles 
       avoid potential performance effect due to article preprocessing (e.g. pdf  
    conversions, html parsing). 
       need of real applications derived from participating systems rather than    
    method descriptions 

129 

       online availability of working tools that can be applied on the fly on user      
    provided texts 
       define a common format and annotation exchange to allow direct comparison  
    across multiple systems 
       importance of real world tasks in terms of protein id172 and species 
   disambiguation, return ranked lists! confidence scores 
       further modularize the tasks: specific interactor protein id172 
       importance of assistance of id111 tools rather than on the purely     
  predictive power
