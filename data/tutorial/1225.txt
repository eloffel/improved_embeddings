what about the effect of language choice?

one aspect of phrasing: framing

the framing of an arguments emphasizes certain principles or perspectives.  

   one of the most important concepts in the study of public opinion    [james 
druckman, 2001]

past research: phrasing may not matter

daniel hopkins, ssrn 2013:    ...there is no evidence that groups 
targeted by specific frames [such as    death panels    in the health care 
debates] respond accordingly.     

  

justin grimmer, solomon messing, sean westwood, the impression of 
influence, 2014: total number of messages mattered more than amount of 
money the messages described. 
!

either sasa petrovic, miles osborne, or victor lavrenko, slashdot 2014: 
   ...a famous person can write anything and it will be retweeted.              
an unknown person can write the same tweet and it will be ignored.
