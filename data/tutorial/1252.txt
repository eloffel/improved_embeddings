id29: the first ten years

    the term    id29    refers to two distinct programs:

1

    parsing directly

coupled with compositional assembly of meaning

representation or    logical form   ;

    more recently, the induction of such parsers from data consisting of string-

meaning pairs.

    i   ll distinguish the latter as    semantic parser induction   .
    i   m going to argue that there is still life in the older enterprise.

i: supervised semantic parser induction

    thompson and mooney (2003); zettlemoyer and collins (2005, 2007); wong
and mooney (2007); lu et al. (2008); kwiatkowski et al. (2010, 2011);
b  orschinger et al. (2011) generalize the problem of inducing parsers from
language-speci   c treebanks like wsj to that of inducing parsers from paired
sentences and unaligned language-independent logical forms.

    the sentences can be in any language.
    the logical forms might be database queries, dependency graphs,   -terms,

robot action primitives and pddl state descriptions, etc.

    this is the way the child learns language, pace montague 1970 (kwiatkowski

et al. 2012)

    however, the approach su   ers from an acute shortage of suitable datasets.

id29 with freebase without qa pairs
    reddy (2014):

    rather than inducing a parser from questions and answers. . .
    take a parser that already builds logical forms and learn the relation between

those logical forms and the id13,

    speci   cally:

    first turn the logical forms into graphs of the same type as the knowledge

graph

    then learn the mapping between the elements of the semantic and

knowledge-base graphs.

zlearning from denotations

11

    learning proceeds by creating question-like logical forms by replacing named
entities in logical forms mined from web text with a variable to produce
property-denoting graphs, such as the one corresponding to:
  x.directed.arg1(e,cameron)    directed.arg2(f,x)    directed.in(g,1997)

    the learner then    nds the denotation of this property from other similar
sentences in the mined logical forms   in this case, other    lms directed by
cameron.

    it then tries to    nd the subgraph of the id13 with the the most
similar denotation   in this case, the subgraph composed of relations m and n.
    the mapping of terms from logical forms to freebase is determined by such

pairings.

choosing a knowledge base subgraph

    a number of heuristics exploit similarities between the two graphs (cf.

kwiatkowski et al. 2013).

    learning is by averaged id88 (collins, 2002).
    features classes are:

    subsumption relations between semantic graph and knowledge base

subgraph;

    lexical similarity of edge labels in semantic graph and knowledge base

subgraph;

    multiple knowledge base edge labels with the same stem;
    multiple knowledge base edges with the same mediating fact label;

    there are also a number of heuristic constraints on the answer term, such as

de   niteness/uniqueness.

iii: another solution

20

    treat the id13s as a case for machine translation.
    find the part of the id13 that looks like the best translation of

the question graph into id13ics.

    to do this we need logical forms for nl that are less tied to the form of
speci   c sentences in speci   c languages, embodying notions of paraphrase and
entailment as a founding principle, rather than as an add-on.

learning the hidden language of logical form

    the problem is that there are too many ways of asking and answering questions,

and we have no idea of the semantics that relates them.

    did google buy youtube?
1. google purchased youtube.
2. google   s purchase of youtube
3. google acquired every company.
4. youtube may be sold to google.
5. google will buy youtube or microsoft.
6. google didn   t take over youtube.

22

    id53 with traditional

forms and theorem proving
augmented with resources like id138, gazeteers, etc. has precision around
75%   but recall is around 4% (bos and markert 2005).
this is worse than    nite-state string matching

logical

    instead, lewis and steedman 2013a parse text errorfully to mine clusters
of paraphrases for relations between named entities like    shakespeare    and
   macbeth   ,    google    and    youtube    (cf. riedel et al. 2013).

    typing the relation clusters probabilistically eliminates ambiguity of the born

in hawai   i/born in 1961 kind.

    logical operators such as negation and modality are handled by a (more or

less) traditional montagovian semantics (steedman 2012)

directional entailments (lewis, 2014)

    the above approach engenders overinclusive paraphrase clusters.
    xperson elected to yof   ce entails xperson ran for yof   ce but not vice versa.

the paraphrase relation depends on more global properties of the named entity
relation graph.

    lewis (2014); lewis and steedman (2014) apply the entailment graphs of

berant et al. (2012) to generate more articulated entailment structures.

zlocal entailment probabilities

28

    the typed named-entity technique is applied to estimate local probabilites of

entailments:
a. p(conquer xy     invadexy) = 0.9
b. p(invadexy     attack xy) = 0.8
c. p(conquer xy     attack xy) = 0.4
d. p(bombxy     attack xy) = 0.7

(etc.)

steedman

26 june 2014

local entailment probabilities

29

    these are used to construct an entailment graph using integer

linear
programming with    weights around p = 0.5 with the global constraint that
the graph must be closed under transitivity.

    thus, (c) will be included despite low observed frequency.
    cliques within the entailment graphs are collapsed to a single cluster relation

identi   er, as in the previous approach.

conclusion: lexical semantics as entailment

    the typed named entity-based technique allows us to construct the logical

34

forms for content words as conjunctions of entailments.

    under more traditional semantic theories employing eliminative de   nitions
these entailments would have been thought of as belonging to the domain of
id136 rather than semantics, either as meaning postulates relating logical
forms or as    encyclop  dic    general knowledge.

    these conjunctive terms of this logical language are very close to the language-

speci   c grammar, and support fast id136 of entailment.

steedman

26 june 2014

conclusion: lexical semantics as entailment

    we can think of the cliques or clusters in the graph as related to the hidden

35

primitives of the language of mind.

    however, very few terms in the adult logical form correspond directly to
(red and maybe attack might be

primitives of the language of mind.
exceptions.)

    even those terms that are cognitively primitive like color terms will not be

unambiguously lexicalized in all languages

    perhaps this can be developed cross-linguistically into a full hidden interlingua

for mt.
