automatic text summarization

  an information access technology that 

given a document or sets of related 
documents, extracts the most important 
content from the source(s) taking into 
account the user or task at hand, and 
presents this content in a well formed 
and concise text

public libraries can make in enhancing 
the availability of consumer

an examination of the work of consumer 
advice centres and of the information 
sources and support activities that public 
libraries can  offer. cacs have dealt with 
pre-shopping advice, education on 
consumers    rights and complaints about 
goods and services, advising the client 
and often obtaining expert assessment. 
they have drawn on a wide range of 
information sources including case 
records, trade literature, contact files 
and external links. the recent closure of 
many cacs has seriously affected the 
availability of consumer information and 
advice. libraries can cooperate closely 
with advice agencies through local 
coordinating committed, shared 
premises, join publicity referral and the 
sharing of professional experitise.

abstract

there were significant positive 
associations between the 
concentration of the substance 
administered and mortality in rats 
and mice of both sexes.

there was no convincing evidence 
to indicate that endrin ingestion 
induced any of the different types 
of tumors which were found in 
the treated animals.

mortality in rats and mice of both 
sexes was dose related.

no treatment related tumors were 
found in any of the animals.

what document positions a word in the summary 
comes from?

  a word in a summary sentence may come from 

different positions, not all of them are equally likely

  given words i1    in (in a summary sentence) the 

following id203 table is needed: 
p(ik+1=<s2,w2>| ik=<s1,w1>)

  they associate probabilities by hand following a 

number of heuristics

  given a sentence summary, the alignment is 

computed using the viterbi algorithm

documents in gate

  a document is created from a file located somewhere

  a gate document contains the    text    of your file and 

sets of annotations

  when the document is created and if a format 

analyser for your type is available    parsing    (format) 
will be applied and annotations will be created

  question can be stated in a    context-free

     who was aaron copland?

qa challenge

  how to locate the information given the question 

keywords
  there is a gap between the wording of the question and the 

answer in the document collection

  because qa is open domain it is unlikely that a 

system will have all necessary resources pre-
computed to locate answers
  should we have encyclopaedic knowledge in the system? all 

bird names, all capital cities, all drug names   

  current systems exploit web redundancy in order to find 

answers, so vocabulary variation is not an issue   because of 
redundancy it is possible that one of the variations will exist 
on the web   but what occurs in domains where information 
is unique

qa challenge

  sometimes the task requires some 

deduction  or extra linguistic knowledge:
  what was the most powerful earthquake to hit 

turkey?
find all earthquakes in turkey
find intensity for each of those

1.

2.

3. pick up the one with higher intensity
(some text-based qa systems will find the answer 
because it is explicitly expressed in text:    the 
most powerful earthquake in the history of 
turkey   .

how to attack the problem?

  given a question, we could go document by 
document verifying if it contains the answer

  however, a more practical approach is to have the 

collection pre-indexed (so we know what terms 
belong to which document) and use a query to find a 
set of documents matching the question terms

  this set of matching documents is (depending on the 

system) further ranked to produce a list where the 
top document is the most likely to match the 
question terms

  the document ranking is generally used to inform 

answer extraction components

  rank all remaining based on type (first) and similarity 

(second) add to s until maximum allowance reached or

the english goalkeeper)

  use a filter (classifier) to weed out noise

  a number of features are used for the classifier including 
the pattern used; the semantic type of the head noun in 
the pattern; the morphology of the headnoun (e.g.
