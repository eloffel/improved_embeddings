       tensor and id105 methods have attracted a lot of
       attention recently thanks to their successful applications to
       information extraction, knowledge base population, lexical
       semantics and id33. in the first part, we will first
       cover the basics of matrix and tensor factorization theory and
       optimization, and then proceed to more advanced topics involving
       convex surrogates and alternative losses. in the second part we
       will discuss recent nlp applications of these methods and show the
       connections with other popular methods such as transductive
       learning, topic models and neural networks. the aim of this
       tutorial is to present in detail applied factorization methods, as
       well as to introduce more recently proposed methods that are likely
       to be useful to nlp applications.
       outline:
       part i: matrix/tensor factorization basics (90 minutes)
       - id105 basics (40 min): bilinear forms, spectral
       representations, low rank approximations theorems, optimization
       with stochastic id119, losses
       - tensor factorization basics (20 minutes):
       representations,notation decompositions (tucker etc.)
       - advanced topics (30 minutes): convex surrogates, l1
       id173, alternative losses (ranking loss, logistic loss)
       break (15 minutes)
       part ii: applications in nlp (75 minutes)
       - information extraction, knowledge base population with
       connections to transductive learning and multitask learning (35
       minutes)
       - lexical semantics with connections to neural networks, latent
       semantic analysis and topic models (30 minutes)
       - id170 (10 minutes)
       presenters:
       guillaume bouchard is a senior researcher in statistics and machine
       learning at xerox, focusing on statistical learning using low-rank
       model for large id208. his research includes text
       understanding, user modeling, and social media analytics. the
       theoretical part of his work is related to the efficient algorithms
       to compute high dimensional integrals, essential to deal with
       uncertainty (missing and noisy data, latent variable models,
       bayesian id136). the main application areas of his work
       includes the design of virtual conversational agents, link
       prediction (predictive algorithms for relational data), social
       media monitoring and transportation analytics. his web page is
       available at [4]www.xrce.xerox.com/people/bouchard.
       jason naradowsky is a postdoc at the machine reading group at ucl.
       having previously obtained a phd at umass amherst under the
       supervision of david smith and mark johnson, his current research
       aims to improve natural language understanding by performing
       task-specific training of word representations and parsing models.
       he is also interested in semi-supervised learning, joint id136,
       and id29. his web page is available at
       [5]http://narad.github.io/.
       sebastian riedel is a senior lecturer at university college london
       and an allen distinguished investigator, leading the machine
       reading lab. before, he was a postdoc and research scientist with
       andrew mccallum at umass amherst, a researcher at tokyo university
       and dbcls with tsujii junichi, and a phd student with ewan klein at
       the university of edinburgh.
       he is interested in teaching machines how to read and works at the
       intersection of natural language processing (nlp) and machine
       learning, investigating various stages of the nlp pipeline, in
       particular those that require id170, as well as
       fully probabilistic architectures of end-to-end reading and
       reasoning systems. recently he became interested in new ways to
       represent textual knowledge using low-rank embeddings and how to
       reason with such representations. his web page is available at
       [6]http://www.riedelcastro.org/.
       tim rocktaschel is a phd student in sebastian riedel's machine
       reading group at university college london. before that he worked
       as research assistant in the knowledge management in bioinformatics
       group at humboldt-universit{\"a}t zu berlin, where he also obtained
       his diploma in computer science. he is broadly interested in
       representation learning (e.g. matrix/tensor factorization, deep
       learning) for nlp and automated knowledge base completion, and how
       these methods can take advantage of symbolic background knowledge.
       his webpage is available at [7]http://rockt.github.io/.
       andreas vlachos is postdoc at the machine reading group at ucl
       working with sebastian riedel on automated fact-checking using
       low-rank factorization methods.
       before that he was a postdoc at the natural language and
       information processing group at the university of cambridge and at
       the university of wisconsin-madison. he is broadly interested in
       natural language understanding (e.g. information extraction,
       id29) and in machine learning approaches that would
       help us towards this goal. he has also worked on active learning,
       id91 and biomedical id111. his web page is available at
