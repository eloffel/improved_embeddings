   people make sense of a text by identifying the semantic relations which
   connect the entities or concepts described by that text. a system which
   aspires to human-like performance must also be equipped to identify,
   and learn from, semantic relations in the texts it processes.
   understanding even a simple sentence such as "opportunity and curiosity
   find similar rocks on mars" requires recognizing relations (rocks are
   located on mars, signalled by the word on) and drawing on already known
   relations (opportunity and curiosity are instances of the class of mars
   rovers). a language-understanding system should be able to find such
   relations in documents and progressively build a knowledge base or even
   an ontology. resources of this kind assist continuous learning and
   other advanced language-processing tasks such as text summarization,
   id53 and machine translation.

   the book discusses the recognition in text of semantic relations which
   capture interactions between base noun phrases. after a brief
   historical background, we introduce a range of relation inventories of
   varying granularity, which have been proposed by computational
   linguists. there is also variation in the scale at which systems
   operate, from snippets all the way to the whole web, and in the
   techniques of recognizing relations in texts, from full supervision
   through weak or distant supervision to self-supervised or completely
   unsupervised methods. a discussion of supervised learning covers
   available datasets, feature sets which describe relation instances, and
   successful algorithms. an overview of weakly supervised and
   unsupervised learning zooms in on the acquisition of relations from
   large corpora with hardly any annotated data. we show how id64
   from seed examples or patterns scales up to very large text collections
   on the web. we also present machine learning techniques in which data
   redundancy and variability lead to fast and reliable relation
   extraction.
