   it has been estimated that over a billion people are using or learning
   english as a second or foreign language, and the numbers are growing
   not only for english but for other languages as well. these language
   learners provide a burgeoning market for tools that help identify and
   correct learners' writing errors. unfortunately, the errors targeted by
   typical commercial proofreading tools do not include those aspects of a
   second language that are hardest to learn. this volume describes the
   types of constructions english language learners find most difficult:
   constructions containing prepositions, articles, and collocations. it
   provides an overview of the automated approaches that have been
   developed to identify and correct these and other classes of learner
   errors in a number of languages.

   error annotation and system evaluation are particularly important
   topics in grammatical error detection because there are no commonly
   accepted standards. chapters in the book describe the options available
   to researchers, recommend best practices for reporting results, and
   present annotation and evaluation schemes.

   the final chapters explore recent innovative work that opens new
   directions for research. it is the authors' hope that this volume will
   continue to contribute to the growing interest in grammatical error
   detection by encouraging researchers to take a closer look at the field
   and its many challenging problems.
