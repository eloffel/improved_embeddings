   learning to rank refers to machine learning techniques for training a
   model in a ranking task. learning to rank is useful for many
   applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and
   data mining. intensive studies have been conducted on its problems
   recently, and significant progress has been made. this lecture gives an
   introduction to the area including the fundamental problems, major
   approaches, theories, applications, and future work.

   the author begins by showing that various ranking problems in
   information retrieval and natural language processing can be formalized
   as two basic ranking tasks, namely ranking creation (or simply ranking)
   and ranking aggregation. in ranking creation, given a request, one
   wants to generate a ranking list of offerings based on the features
   derived from the request and the offerings. in ranking aggregation,
   given a request, as well as a number of ranking lists of offerings, one
   wants to generate a new ranking list of the offerings.

   ranking creation (or ranking) is the major problem in learning to rank.
   it is usually formalized as a supervised learning task. the author
   gives detailed explanations on learning for ranking creation and
   ranking aggregation, including training and testing, evaluation,
   feature creation, and major approaches. many methods have been proposed
   for ranking creation. the methods can be categorized as the pointwise,
   pairwise, and listwise approaches according to the id168s they
   employ. they can also be categorized according to the techniques they
   employ, such as the id166 based, boosting based, and neural network based
   approaches.

   the author also introduces some popular learning to rank methods in
   details. these include: prank, oc id166, mcrank, ranking id166, ir id166,
   gbrank, ranknet, listnet & listid113, adarank, id166 map, softrank,
   lambdarank, lambdamart, borda count, markov chain, and cranking.

   the author explains several example applications of learning to rank
   including web search, id185, definition search,
   keyphrase extraction, query dependent summarization, and re-ranking in
   machine translation.

   a formulation of learning for ranking creation is given in the
   statistical learning framework. ongoing and future research directions
   for learning to rank are also discussed.
