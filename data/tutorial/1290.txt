   citation analysis   the exploration of reference patterns in the
   scholarly and scientific literature   has long been applied in a number
   of social sciences to study research impact, knowledge flows, and
   knowledge networks. it has important information science applications
   as well, particularly in id99 and in information
   retrieval.

   recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in citation analysis to
   help address research, management, or information service issues such
   as university rankings, research evaluation, or knowledge domain
   visualization. this renewed and growing interest stems from significant
   improvements in the availability and accessibility of digital
   bibliographic data (both citation and full text) and of relevant
   computer technologies. the former provides large amounts of data and
   the latter the necessary tools for researchers to conduct new types of
   large-scale citation analysis, even without special access to special
   data collections. exciting new developments are emerging this way in
   many aspects of citation analysis.

   this book critically examines both theory and practical techniques of
   citation network analysis and visualization, one of the two main types
   of citation analysis (the other being evaluative citation analysis). to
   set the context for its main theme, the book begins with a discussion
   of the foundations of citation analysis in general, including an
   overview of what can and what cannot be done with citation analysis
   (chapter 1). an in-depth examination of the generally accepted steps
   and procedures for citation network analysis follows, including the
   concepts and techniques that are associated with each step (chapter 2).
   individual issues that are particularly important in citation network
   analysis are then scrutinized, namely: field delineation and data
   sources for citation analysis (chapter 3); disambiguation of names and
   references (chapter 4); and visualization of id191 (chapter
   5). sufficient technical detail is provided in each chapter so the book
   can serve as a practical how-to guide to conducting citation network
   analysis and visualization studies.

   while the discussion of most of the topics in this book applies to all
   types of citation analysis, the structure of the text and the details
   of procedures, examples, and tools covered here are geared to citation
   network analysis rather than evaluative citation analysis. this
   conscious choice was based on the authors    observation that, compared
   to evaluative citation analysis, citation network analysis has not been
   covered nearly as well by dedicated books, despite the fact that it has
   not been subject to nearly as much severe criticism and has been
   substantially enriched in recent years with new theory and techniques
   from research areas such as network science, social network analysis,
   or information visualization.
