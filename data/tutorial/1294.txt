   abstract

   in recent years, online social networking has revolutionized
   interpersonal communication. the newer research on language analysis in
   social media has been increasingly focusing on the latter's impact on
   our daily lives, both on a personal and a professional level. natural
   language processing (nlp) is one of the most promising avenues for
   social media data processing. it is a scientific challenge to develop
   powerful methods and algorithms which extract relevant information from
   a large volume of data coming from multiple sources and languages in
   various formats or in free form. we discuss the challenges in analyzing
   social media texts in contrast with traditional documents.

   research methods in information extraction, automatic categorization
   and id91, id54 and indexing, and statistical
   machine translation need to be adapted to a new kind of data. this book
   reviews the current research on nlp tools and methods for processing
   the non-traditional information from social media data that is
   available in large amounts (big data), and shows how innovative nlp
   approaches can integrate appropriate linguistic information in various
   fields such as social media monitoring, healthcare, business
   intelligence, industry, marketing, and security and defence.

   we review the existing id74 for nlp and social media
   applications, and the new efforts in evaluation campaigns or shared
   tasks on new datasets collected from social media. such tasks are
   organized by the association for computational linguistics (such as
   semeval tasks) or by the national institute of standards and technology
   via the text retrieval conference (trec) and the text analysis
   conference (tac). in the concluding chapter, we discuss the importance
   of this dynamic discipline and its great potential for nlp in the
   coming decade, in the context of changes in mobile technology, cloud
   computing, virtual reality, and social networking.

   in this second edition, we have added information about recent progress
   in the tasks and applications presented in the first edition. we
   discuss new methods and their results. the number of research projects
   and publications that use social media data is constantly increasing
   due to continuously growing amounts of social media data and the need
   to automatically process them. we have added 85 new references to the
   more than 300 references from the first edition. besides updating each
   section, we have added a new application (digital marketing) to the
   section on media monitoring and we have augmented the section on
   healthcare applications with an extended discussion of recent research
   on detecting signs of mental illness from social media.

   table of contents: preface to the second edition / acknowledgments /
