   to current and future readers of grokking deep learning,

   after nearly three years of effort, i   ve delivered the final chapters
   of grokking deep learning. it's been a monumental challenge, and i'm
   very grateful for your patience. i like to tell you about why i think
   this is fantastic book. first, though, let me tell you why it took so
   long to write it.

   grokking deep learning is just over 300 pages long. to get to those 300
   pages, though, i wrote at least twice that number. half-a-dozen
   chapters were re-written from scratch three or four times times before
   they were ready to publish, and along the way we added some important
   chapters that weren   t in the original table of contents.

   more significantly, we arrived at two expensive decisions early on that
   make grokking deep learning uniquely valuable: this book requires no
   math background beyond basic arithmetic, and it doesn   t rely on a
   high-level library that might hide what   s going on. in other words,
   anyone can read this book, and understand how deep learning really
   works. to accomplish this, we had to invent new ways to describe and
   teach the core ideas and techniques without falling back on advanced
   mathematics or sophisticated code that someone else wrote.

   my goal in writing grokking deep learning was to create the lowest
   possible barrier to entry to the practice of deep learning. you won   t
   just read the theory, you   ll discover it yourself. to help you get
   there, i had to write a lot of code, and the book had to explain it all
   in the right order so that the code snippets required for the working
   demos all made sense.

   now, let me tell you about three changes we   re especially proud of:

    1. we originally included a chapter on id53. however
       very few products actually need qa technology, and the topic
       doesn   t get to the timeless fundamentals we want to cover in the
       book. in the place of the qa chapter, i doubled the page count on
       recurrent neural networks. you get one chapter on id56s and another
       on the incredibly important topic of lstms. recurrent neural
       networks are the state-of-the-art approach in nearly every
       sequence-modeling field i can think of, and they're also one of the
       most popular tools you will be using in industry. this was an easy
       choice.
    2. also, i've added a chapter focusing on privacy. deep learning is
       fundamentally constrained by the availability of training data,
       which been centralized within large organizations. it   s my personal
       view that the availability of training data will drastically change
       in the coming decade, and it's going to transform how deep learning
       advances. this chapter introduces a few basic privacy concepts
       including federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and concepts
       related to differential privacy and secure multi-party computation.
    3. finally, the book originally included a chapter on policy gradients
       aka    id23.    this is an important and popular
       topic, but it   s a field of its own to which deep learning has been
       applied. we decided that covering rl lightly wouldn   t add much
       value and made the tough choice to remove that chapter.

   instead, i wound up creating possibly the most valuable piece i've ever
   done on the subject of deep learning, and easily the most valuable
   chapter in the whole book-- building a deep learning framework from
   scratch.

   in the real world, you will spend 5% of your time coming up with a
   "cool new idea" to tackle a problem and 95% of your time wrestling with
   a framework (pytorch, keras, tensorflow, etc.), trying to bring your
   idea to life. it is my great hope that the new chapter 13 will
   fast-track you to becoming a power-user of deep learning frameworks by
   having a mental model of what actually happens within them.

   this knowledge, combined with all the theory, code, and examples you
   explore in this book, will make you much faster at iterating through
   experiments. you'll have quick successes, better job opportunities, and
   you   ll even learn about more advanced deep learning concepts more
   rapidly.

   i sincerely hope you enjoy grokking deep learning!
