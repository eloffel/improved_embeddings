(k) kings, queens, and counts (1/6) 

suppose your computer asks you,    what is the meaning of life?    not being much of a philosopher, you de-
cide to interpret the question as    what is the definition of the word life?    because that question is much 
more straightforward than    what is the purpose of existing?    
 
even though you   ve simplified the problem, it   s still not very easy. language users have so much background 
knowledge wrapped up in their mental definitions of words that it is tough to teach a computer all the shades 
of meaning encompassed by each word. 
 
one of the most effective ways of defining words for computers is also one of the simplest: get a sample of 
text and define each word by counting how often it occurs near each other word. using this method, life 
might be defined as    the word that occurs 657 times near the, 423 times near a, 11 times near bug   s, 0 times 
near gumption, 0 times near ellipsis, 8 times near preserver,        and the list would continue for every word in 
the sample of text. the following questions deal with this method of representing word meaning. 
 
k1. for question k1, the following poem will be the sample text used to obtain word counts: 

 

whether the weather is good, or whether the weather is not, 
whether the weather is cold, or whether the weather is hot, 

we   ll weather the weather   whatever the weather    

whether we like it or not. 

 
the representations of some words from this poem are shown below as obtained by counting how often 
each other word occurs in a certain window around the word in question. your task: shade in the provided 
graph on the next page to give the representation of the word is.
