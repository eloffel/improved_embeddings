(e) use the force (1/2) 

yoda, the lovable green jedi from the star wars franchise, speaks the same language as most of the other 
characters in the series (a language that seems a whole lot like english). however, his sentences don't sound 
completely normal to our ears because he inverts (swaps the order of) pairs of phrases before speaking. for 
example, if yoda were to say "believe you i don't" we know a non-yoda speaker saying the same thing would 
say "i don't believe you." we can mark yoda's sentences to recover the original sequence with the following 
hierarchical annotation: 
 
< [ believe you ] [ i don't ] > 
 
the "[ ]" means preserve the relative order of the phrases inside the brackets (of which there must be exact-
ly two) and the "< >" means invert the order. so in this case the annotation means "you" comes after 
"believe" and "don't" comes after "i", but "i don't" comes before "believe you". here's another example: 
 
< patience [ < must you > have ] >   
 
this method of forming yoda-isms is an example of an unlabeled inversion transduction grammar, a powerful 
formalism used in machine translation. 
 
answer these questions in the answer sheets. 
 
e1. for each of these annotated yoda-isms, write down the original sentence 

you must have patience 

becomes 

 

a.  < go [ you must ] >

e2.  for each of these yoda-isms of the sentence "use the force luke" write the annotation that recovers 
the original. if no such annotation is possible write "not possible". if more than one annotation that re-
covers the original sentence is possible, choose any legal annotation but write "more possible" next to the 
answer.

e3. if yoda were not bound by the rules of this puzzle and could reorder the four words of the sentence 
"use the force luke" in any way he likes, how many ways could he do this? 
 
 
 
e4. since yoda is bound by the rules of this puzzle, how many ways can he actually reorder "use the force 
luke"? 
 
 
 
e5. for each of the following sentences, write down the number of unique permutations of the sentence and 
the number of unique yoda-isms that can be formed from the sentence. note the original sentence does 
count as one of the permutations.
