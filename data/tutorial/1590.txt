[ [ fruit flies ] [ like [ a banana ] ] ]

fruit flies (noun) like (verb) a banana.    

time flies (verb) like (preposition) an arrow. 

ambiguity in sentences can be a source of humor. for example, "flies" can be a noun or a verb and "like" can 
be a verb or a preposition, resulting in the amusing juxtaposition of  
 
 
 
for this puzzle, we will be concerned with ambiguity in parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, prepo-
sition) as well as ambiguity in the structure of a sentence. the sentences below are bracketed to show the 
structure of the sentences. 
 
 
 
local ambiguity arises when there is not enough information midway through a sentence to decide on the 
parts of speech or the structure. for example, when you hear or see the words "the old man"  you don't 
know whether the sentence will continue with "man" being a verb as in "the old man the boats"  or as a 
noun as in "the old man is wise." the structure of these two sentences is shown below. notice that in addi-
tion to changing its part of speech, the word "man" participates differently in the structure of the sentence.    
in "the old man the boats", "man" is grouped with "the boats" to make a verb phrase "man the boats", but in 
"the old man is wise", "man" is grouped with "the old" to make a noun phrase "the old man".   
 
 
 
p1. each of the following sentences contains a local ambiguity. for each sentence, provide an alternate con-
tinuation which shows what the other interpretation is. for example, if you were given the sentence "the old 
man is wise" your answer could be "the old man the boats". 
 
your answers should always start with at least the first three words of the sentences provided. in some cas-
es, more words should be shared. your answers should differ from the original sentence in at least one word 
changing its part of speech or in at least one word being grouped with different words in the structure.
