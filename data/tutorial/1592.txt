one way for computers to understand language is by forming a structure that represents the relationships 
between words using a technique called combinatorial categorial grammar (id35). computer scientists and 
linguists can use id35 to parse sentences (that is, try to figure out their structure) and then extract meaning 
from the structure.  
 
as the name suggests, combinatorial categorial grammar parses sentences by combining categories.  each 
word in a sentence is assigned a particular category; note that / and \ are two different symbols: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these categories are then combined in systematic ways.  we will not explain how, but we will give you two 
successful parses    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
...and four unsuccessful parses    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
if a parse is successful, the sentence is declared    grammatical   ; if not, the sentence is declared 
   ungrammatical   .

o1. using the above examples as evidence, figure out how id35 parses sentences, and describe it briefly 
here: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o2. in the sentence    i enjoy long books   , list all of the categories that, if assigned to    long   , make the sen-
tence have a successful parse. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o3. not every grammatical sentence of english will be declared    grammatical    by the process above.  using 
only the words    i   ,    books   ,    sleep   , and    enjoy   , form a grammatically correct english sentence that will fail 
to parse given the categories above. you don   t have to use all four of the words.
