(c) levenshtein   s fine signs (1/2) [15 points] 

levenshtein   s fine signs, a commercial signage company, is a favorite of new business owners for its ability to 
cheaply adjust a location   s existing signage to reflect the new business name. instead of replacing the entire 
sign, mr. levenshtein replaces signs letter-by-letter whenever possible. since mr. levenshtein offers    by-the-
letter    pricing, he can offer very low prices when the name of the new business is very similar to the name of 
the old business. 

here, for example, are two recent jobs that mr. levenshtein completed:

ular kinds of changes or offers additional kinds of changes beyond just addition and deletion. here are 
the may, june, and july prices for particular changes.
