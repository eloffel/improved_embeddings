compiling a lexicon (a catalog of words) can be time-consuming and difficult because each individual word 
has so many potential forms. suppose that you are dealing with the following words: 
 
 
 
 
 
writing all of these forms is tedious; even though you generate a list, you will probably feel listless. there-
fore, instead of using this brute force method, you can condense the list with the format shown below: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this setup generates a list of all words that consist of one component of verbprefix followed by one 
component of verbstem followed by one component of verbsuffix (the    stands for an empty spot, 
so a word could have no letters in the verbprefix or verbsuffix slot). the list generated is identical 
to the brute force list but is much less tedious to create.  
 
there is one major problem, however. the way that this format strings together word components (called 
morphemes) does not account for spelling changes that may occur along the way. for example, many legiti-
mate words are generated, such as watch, review, and rewaves, but some misspelled words also result, such 
as watchs and waveing. in order to fix this, you also need to write a set of spelling change rules to describe 
these changes. the applicable rules in this case are: 
 
 
 
 
these rules mean    ch turns into che if ch is followed by s    and    e turns into nothing if e is followed by ed or 
ing.     
 
there are many different ways that this type of rule can be written. here are a few more examples of such 
rules and their meanings: 
 
u -> w || * vowel  
np -> mp   
 
t -> c || consonant * kf   
[l | f | r] -> z || w * [c | p] 
 

(u turns into w if u is followed by a vowel) 
(np always turns into mp) 
(t turns into c if it is between a consonant and kf) 
(each letter l, f, or r will turn into z if it falls between w 
 and either c or p) 

ch -> che || * s 
e ->    || * [ed | ing]

j2. the following lexicon and incomplete set of spelling change rules was designed to output a list of adjectival 
forms of country names, as shown in the table on the next page. it works almost exactly as intended: the 
output of the setup is identical to the    desired adjective    column (on the next page) except that it pro-
duces the wildly incorrect word    ottruese    in place of    australian.
