spoken language is one-dimensional     the words of a sentence are pronounced in some order. standard 
writing systems merely record that order. but spoken language is often ambiguous. written language might 
be clearer if we used twodee, a two-dimensional writing system that places words on the cells of a rectangu-
lar grid. here are all the ways to write    frogs eat flies    in twodee: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
why so many layout options? if a sentence or other phrase consists of two sub-phrases a and b, where a is 
spoken first, then twodee lets you write a either to the left of b (as in ordinary writing) or above b. if a or b 
has multiple words, then it will have sub-phrases of its own. the diagrams below reveal how the four 
twodee sentences above were put together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clear writers of twodee usually try to choose layout options that will help their readers identify the sub-
phrases a and b. make sure you align the top edges as shown when placing the a and b rectangles side-by-
side, or align the left edges as shown when stacking the a and b rectangles top-to-bottom. no extra space 
(blank columns or rows) is allowed between the two rectangles.  
 
to write twodee, you do need to know how to divide the phrase you   re writing into sub-phrases. that is 
mostly a matter of common sense, based on the intended meaning of the phrase. there are also some con-
ventions, such as the traditional division of a sentence into subject (   frogs   ) and predicate (   eat flies,    which 
describes what frogs do). 
 
while twodee is intended as a better writing system, it can still be ambiguous.  for example, the meaning of 
 
 
 
 
is not clear because the sentence could have been constructed in at least two plausible ways:

   zooey deschanel left her husband death cab for cutie frontman ben gibbard.    

h2. in april 2012, an entertainment reporter wrote:  
 
 
 
the former husband, ben gibbard, was the frontman for a band called    death cab for cutie.    however, an 
editor for abc news incorrectly clarified the sentence and published the following:  
 
 
 
 
(the editor went on to add that    deschanel and cab were married for a little more than three years.   ) 
 
by using twodee, how could the reporter have written the original sentence to avoid this confusion?  place 
the words of the original sentence in 12 different cells of this two-dimensional grid (starting with    zooey    at 
the top left). 

   deschanel filed for divorce from husband death cab, throwing him over for cutie frontman ben
gibbard.
