- relevance (r) what ggg says should be relevant to the player   s needs (winning at the card 
  game); it should give the minimum number of facts necessary for the player to make the best play 
  possible (telepathic communication isn   t cheap!) 
- manner (m) in addition to giving the minimum number of facts necessary, those facts should be ex
  pressed as simply as possible 
- quantity (n) ggg should give all needed information, i.e. it should not leave anything out 
- quality (l) ggg shouldn   t say things that are wrong (otherwise, what   s the point of cheating) 

you are employed by a company that makes grice   s grifter gader (ggg), a small flying robot that helps you 
cheat at card games. the robot flies above your opponent   s shoulder, looks at their cards, and then telepathi-
cally sends a message into your brain. (it   s not the most ethical job in the world, but you took it because, hey, 
you get to work with flying telepathic robots     nobody could say no to that.) 
 
these gadgets have to abide by the following maxims: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linguists believe that humans follow similar rules1.  for example, when you ask a friend what the weather is 
like, he would violate the maxim of quantity if he recited the hourly barometric pressure over the previous 
three days.  because the ggg communicates through telepathic natural language, it should also obey these 
maxims. 
 
here   s the game ggg is trying to help a player win. before each round, the dealer shuffles a deck with forty 
cards, where each card has one of four suits (club    , heart    , spade    , diamond    ) and a number from 1 to 
10. the player and her opponent each get three cards. the player picks one of her three cards and gives it to 
the opponent. the opponent gets points equal to the product of the two highest numbers in the same suit (if 
there are no cards of the same suit, the hand is worth one point). for example: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the ggg can't see the player's cards (it hovers above the opponent's shoulder), so it needs to give the play-
er enough information for her to play the best card no matter what cards she has.  for example, if the ggg 
sees that the opponent has a 4    3    2   , it can't just say "play a heart", because the player might not have that 
in her hand. 
 
1 language is ambiguous. in addition to the ambiguity of syntax and semantics, there are often social conventions that both speak-
ers and listeners assume in a conversation. this was described by the linguist h. paul grice in the early 1960s. he proposed that 
speakers and listeners assume the maxims described in this problem. 
because of these maxims, conversation participants are able to make gricean implicatures. these allow us to extrapolate from 
incomplete information. for example, if a asks b 'where's lisa?' and b replies 'lisa got the flu,' the maxim of relevance allows a to 
assume that lisa is staying at home because she is sick, even though this was never explicitly stated. identifying and constructing 
these logical leaps in this restricted environment is the goal of this problem.

q1. what   s wrong with my ggg? 
you have to debug some defective units. given an opponent   s hand and the output of a ggg, give the max-
ims violated (use r, n, l, or m). each example will violate one maxim.

he has a four of hearts, a three of hearts, and a two of hearts.  _____________ 

he has hearts, diamonds, and spades. 

_____________ 

he has a six of hearts, a seven of spades, a three of diamonds, 
and the sky is blue. 

 
_____________ 

he has an even prime number of spades, and the smallest odd 
prime number of clubs.

q2. correcting the ggg 
given an opponent   s hand, a maxim violated, and the output of a ggg, replace the underlined portion of the 
output with text that would fix the violation of the maxim (without violating any others!).
