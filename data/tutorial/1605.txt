k. a fox among the h (1/3) 

dr. dumutche is compiling an online biology reference, and he is currently working on the information re-
trieval system, so that people can type in things like    what do walruses eat?    or    how much do bees 
weigh?    and get relevant answers. 
 
part of this task involves a process called id30     taking text and figuring out what the    stem    of each 
word is.  (the    stem    is the form of the word without any prefixes or suffixes, so dance is the stem of danc-
ing, happy is the sum of unhappiness, etc.)  the system needs this so that it can determine that a request 
about    walruses    needs data from the article walrus, and that one about    fungi    needs data from the article 
fungus. 
 
so dumutche writes a series of rules for determining the singular form of plural nouns.   he writes a rule 
   remove final s    to handle cats   cat, a rule    replace final i with us    to handle fungi   fungus, a 
rule    remove final e    to handle algae   alga, etc.    
 
he ends up with the following rules: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

replace final ice with ouse 

replace final a with um 

replace final  ies with y 

replace final i with us 

remove final en 

remove final e 

remove final s

k-2 what went wrong with the program? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
k-3 what can you determine about the order in which dumutche   s program applied the rules? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
k-4 could putting the rules in a different order cause the program to work? what order would produce the 
intended results? (or why isn   t there one?)
