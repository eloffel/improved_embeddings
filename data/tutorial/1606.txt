professor monotone   s    astounding linguistic knowledge engine for making id136s    (alkemi), when giv-
en a list of true statements, can deduce further true statements from it. for example, if it knows that 
   professor monotone can read russian   , it can deduce that    professor monotone can read   . we represent 
this as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this means that whenever the first statement is true, the second has to be true, too; there   s no way for the 
first to be true while the second is false. we call this a legitimate id136. 
 
the professor   s machine can go through statements and, by making particular sorts of changes, generate fur-
ther statements that follow from them. however, it   s not as easy as replacing    can read russian    with    can 
read    anywhere you find it. for example, funny things happen when the statement contains one of a set of 
words called    quantifiers   , including every, some, no, a, few, many, three, and so on. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the id136 is not legitimate; even if no student reads russian, it   s entirely possible that they read japanese, 
english or spanish.  
 
each quantifier allows a different pattern of legitimate id136s, so the professor   s machine keeps a special 
table of patterns and uses it to derive new statements from given ones. we   ve reproduced it on the next 
page. it may look mysterious, but given the information in this table and a list of id136s produced by the 
machine, you can work out what each part means and how the machine works.

unfortunately, however, there is one error in the table above that is causing the professor   s machine to draw 
some illegitimate id136s!

o. the little engine that could    read (3/3)  

o-1 which table row (a-f) contains a mistake and caused the machine to draw one or more illegitimate in-
ferences? 
 
 
 
 
 
o-2 the list of id136s isn   t complete. monotone   s machine could draw additional id136s as well. us-
ing only words that appear in the table above, generate another legitimate id136 that the machine could 
have drawn from    every teacher can read english   . 
 
 
 
 
 
o-3 monotone   s machine doesn   t yet understand every quantifier. help it learn the quantifiers at least three, 
at most three, and not all by putting    upward    or    downward    in the appropriate cells.
