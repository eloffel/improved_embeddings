r. one, two, tree (1/4) 

english has the wonderful feature that it lets you stick two nouns together into a compound noun, whose 
meaning derives in some idiosyncratic way from the meanings of its parts: 
 

     water fountain: a fountain that supplies water 
     water ballet: a ballet that takes place in water 
     water meter: a device (called meter) that measures water 
     water barometer: a barometer that uses water instead of mercury (to measure air pressure) 
     water biscuit: a biscuit that is made with water 
     water glass: a glass that is meant to hold water 

 
even more fun is that one of the two nouns in the compound noun could itself be a compound noun, as in 
the case of ice cream soda. but what's the recipe for that beverage? it depends. you make [[ice cream] soda] 
by dropping ice cream into soda, but you make [ice [cream soda]] by dropping ice into cream soda. 
 
 
 
 
r-1 the paragraph above used [square brackets] to distinguish two possible meanings of ice cream soda, 
one of them being the conventional meaning. add brackets to each compound below to indicate whether the 
most likely meaning corresponds to [[x y] z] or [x [y z]]. 
 
 

a.        ice      cream      soda 
 
b.        science       fiction      writer 
 
c.        customer      service      representative 
 
d.        state      chess      tournament 
 
e.        mars      rover      landing 
 
f.        plastic      water      cooler 
 
g.        typeface      design      report

r-2 choose the most likely bracketing for the 4-word compound noun country song platinum album. 
 
a. [country [song [platinum album]]] 
b. [country [[song platinum] album]] 
c. [[country song] [platinum album]] 
d. [[country [song platinum]] album] 
e. [[[country song] platinum] album] 
 
r-3 give a plausible definition of [[space mission] [[control freak] show]]. (if you must use compound nouns in 
your definition, define them too.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
r-4 show the most likely bracketing for the 8-noun sequence below. as in the examples above, your brack-
eting must have the form [x y], where each of x and y is either a single-word noun or a compound noun 
(which must also be written as a bracketing [x y] and so on.) 
 
            family        board        game        togetherness        effect         government       study         author  
 
r-5 a computer program knows less about the world than you do, so it may have more trouble interpreting 
these sequences of nouns. how many bracketings must it choose among? complete the following table by 
inserting the correct numbers for f(5), f(6), and f(7).

hint: a very slow way to solve this problem would be to systematically list all the bracketings for each n. r-2 
shows a systematic list for n=4.  could this pattern be extended to n=5? 
 
hint: suppose you were computing f(8) by laboriously listing all the bracketings for r-4. some of your brack-
etings (not necessarily the correct one) would combine the noun family board game with the noun together-
ness effect government study author. of course, these would consider both of the possible bracketings for fami-
ly board game    and how many bracketings for togetherness effect government study author? 
 
r-6     so far we   ve been using the rule    noun + noun = noun.    english also allows    adjective + noun = noun    
where an adjective is a word such as smelly. phrases that include adjectives may still have multiple interpre-
tations: [smelly [skin lotion]] versus [[smelly skin] lotion]. 
 
 
but a sequence of nouns and adjectives does behave differently from a sequence of nouns. big fluffy 
pancake can only be interpreted as [big [fluffy pancake]], and samurai short sword can only be interpreted as 
[samurai [short sword]]. the other interpretations are impossible or at least highly unlikely.  for purposes of 
this problem, we will assume that the other interpretations are impossible, and explain this by saying that 
certain rules are    missing    from english. what are the "missing" rules? 
 
 
 
 
r-7    for each phrase below, list all possible bracketings. the definition of    bracketing    is the same as in r-4, 
except that now x is also allowed to be a single-word adjective. 
 
a. roasted red potato pancake 
 
 
 
 
b. crazy monkey cheap cider house
