(i) dogs and cats on trees (1/5) 

linguists use diagrams called trees to represent the grouping of words within sentences. here is a simple ex-
ample from english: 

s 

np-agent 

vp 

d 

n 

v 

np-patient 

these 

dogs 

chased 

np-patient 

s-mod 

d 

n 

np-agent 

v 

those 

cats 

d 

n 

saw 

the 

rabbit 

the tree diagram shows that in the sentence    these dogs chased those cats the rabbit saw   , these is most 
closely related to dogs, those most closely related to cats etc. 
 
the abbreviations s, np-agent, vp, etc. stand for different types of words or groups of words. these abbre-
viations and a few others we will use in this problem are spelled out here: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

s: sentence 
s-mod: sentence which functions as a modifier 
np-agent: noun phrase denoting the agent (initiator) of an action 
np-patient: noun phrase denoting the patient (undergoer) of an action 
np-location: noun phrase denoting the location of an action 
n-agent: noun denoting the agent of an action 
n-patient: noun denoting the patient of an action 
n-location: noun denoting the location of an action 
v: verb 
v-mod: verb in a sentence which functions as modifier 
vp: verb phrase

(i) dogs and cats on trees (2/5) 

these labels give information about the part of speech of a word or group of words (e.g., noun, verb etc) as 
well as the role that that word or group of words plays in the meaning of the sentence. 
 
when working with trees, linguists write systems of rules (called    grammars   ) which describe sets of trees. 
each rule in the system is a building block. any tree which can be constructed out of those building blocks is 
in the set of trees described by the grammar. for example, the tree given above for these dogs chased those 
cats the rabbits saw. requires the following building blocks or rules: 

s 

s-mod 

vp 

np-agent

(i) dogs and cats on trees (3/5) 

for any sentence that is not an actual malayalam sentence, you should not provide a translation.   
write 'not a malayalam sentence' instead. 

there is one twist, however. some of these sentences are not actual malayalam sentences. use the 
grammar to figure out which ones they are. 

spoken by about 37 million people, primarily in india. there are two sources of information provided 
to you: a list of translations of the malayalam words and a small grammar (set of rules) in the style 
above for malayalam. note that the set of abbreviations used in the malayalam grammar is not the 
same as the set used in the english grammar. this is due to grammatical differences between the  
languages. 

i1 (3 points). your first task is to translate the following sentences from malayalam, a dravidian language

i2 (1 point). draw the tree for any sentence that uses the v-mod rule. (you may use the english 
 

translations in place of the malayalam words at the bottom of the tree.) 

i3 (1 point). explain what is wrong with the examples that are not actual sentences of malayalam.
