lected as a summary by a computer, based on a number of criteria. the criteria are the 
same for each story. within each story, some scores may depend on other sentences.

either write the appropriate new score if it's different from the old one, or leave it 
blank if it would be unchanged. for instance, a correctly formatted (but 
wrong) possible answer for the first sentence is:

mexico's interior minister has died in a plane crash, after the 
small aircraft he was travelling in plummeted into rush hour traf-
fic in the nation's capital. 

he was one of the architects of conservative felipe calder  n's 
2006 election victory. 

calder  n described mouri  o as "a compatriot who worked for 
the service of his county." 

jose luis santiago vasconcelos, the deputy attorney-general until 
recently and a key player for years in the war on drug cartels, 
also died in the crash. 

communications minister luis tellez said everything pointed to 
the crash being an accident but jorge lara, vice-president of a 
national civil aviation rescue committee, told reuters "it could 
have been anything, from mechanical failure to sabotage." 

a colleague of lara at the scene said it appeared something hap-
pened to the plane in the air and it nosedived into the ground. 

surrounding buildings were not damaged. 
 

newspaper el universal reported an air traffic controller as say-
ing the aircraft had been coming in to land at mexico city   s air-
port when it hit the ground between tall office buildings. 

tellez said there was no contact with the plane, which had been 
returning from a trip to the central city of san luis potos  , in the 
moments before the crash.
