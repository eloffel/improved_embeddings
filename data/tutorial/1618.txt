in  english,  we  can  combine  two  nouns  to  get  a  compound  noun,  such  as  in     mailbox     or 
   sandcastle   .  we can do this in japanese as well, but just sticking the two words together isn   t 
enough.  instead, the words themselves undergo predictable changes: 

ikebana 

   flower arranging    

asagiri 

   morning fog    

hoshizora 

   starry sky    

 
  
ike 

   arrange    

 

  

hana 

   flower    

 

asa 

   morning    

  

kiri 

   fog    

 

hoshi 

   star    

  

sora 

   sky    

compound  words  can  then  be  compounded  again,  creating  compounds  with  three  or  more 
members.  study the diagrams below carefully.  you   ll notice that the order in which the com-
pound is built affects both the meaning and the final form of the word.
