(h) thorny stems (1/3) 

wouldn't it be nice if your computer could understand english?  in this problem, you will write 
down a small set of rules encoding one piece of your knowledge about english. 
 
the problem you will approach is called    id30.     you know that    work   ,    working   , 
   works   , and    worked    are all forms of the same verb:      work   .  similarly,    guesses    and 
   guess    are both forms of the same noun:    guess   .  below you will find a list of pairs of a 
word and its stem, both nouns and verbs. your goal is to write down a list of rules which is as 
short as possible, but covers all of the example pairs.  you must also list exactly one exception 
for every rule which has one. 
 
example 
 

rule 1: if a word ends in  ss , then replace  ss  with  ss  to form the stem. 
rule 2: if a word ends in  s , then replace  s  with     to form the stem. 
rule 3: otherwise the word is its own stem. 

 
let's look at how these rules will apply to a few examples.  we always use only the first num-
bered rule that applies. for the word    work   , rules 1-2 do not apply, so we are left with rule 
3,    work    is its own stem.  for the word    works   ,  rule 1 does not apply, but rule 2 does, so 
the stem of    works    is formed by replacing the final    s    with nothing - i.e. deleting it, to form 
   work   . finally, for the word    grass   ,  rule 1 does apply, and so we replace    ss    with    ss   , i.e. 
the word is unchanged and then we stop. 
 
your goal is to write one list of rules which will apply to both the nouns and the verbs listed on 
the next page. 
 
exceptions 
 
the rules you write will not always work.  any word for which your rules give the wrong stem 
is called an    exception   .  you will write down exceptions for your rules - an exception is writ-
ten next to the first rule whose    if    part applies to it.  for example,    guess    is not an exception 
to the rules above, since even though rule 2 does not handle it, rule 1 (which comes first) 
does.  however,    cries    is an exception (these rules gives its stem as    crie    instead of    cry   ), 
and it should be written next to rule 2 as follows: 
 

if a word ends in  ss , then replace  ss  with  ss  to form the stem. exception: -none- 
if a word ends in  s , then replace  s  with     to form the stem. exception: cries
