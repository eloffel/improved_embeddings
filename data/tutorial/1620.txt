finite-state automata (fsa) are a type of abstract    machine    with many possible uses.  one 
possible use is to guess what language a document (such as a webpage) is in.  if we make an 
automaton that can distinguish between possible english words and impossible ones, and then 
give it a webpage with a bunch of words that are impossible in english (like    aioaepa    or 
   ragaiiare   ), we can be pretty sure that the webpage isn   t written in english.  (or, at least, isn   t 
entirely written in english.)  

here is a finite state automaton that can distin-
guish between possible and impossible words 
in rotokas, a language spoken on the island of 
bougainville off the coast of new guinea.  
rotokas has a very simple system of sounds 
and allows us to create a very small fsa.  

a,e,i,o,u 

a,e,i, 
o,u 

 

p,t,k,v,r,g 

 

a,e,i, 
o,u 

p,t,k, 
v,r,g 

start 

an fsa works like a board game.  choose a word, and place your pencil on the space marked 
   start   .  going through the letters of the word one at a time, move your pencil along the path 
marked with that letter.  if the word ends and you   re at a space marked with a thicker circle, 
the word succeeds: it   s a possible rotokas word!  if the word ends and you   re not at a thicker 
circle, or you   re midway through the word and there   s no path corresponding to the next letter, 
the word fails: it   s not a possible rotokas word! 
 
try it out with these possible and impossible words; the automaton should accept all the possi-
ble words and reject the impossible ones.

i1. now, using the automaton above, put a check mark next to each possible rotokas word: 

___ iu 
___ idau 
___ oire 

___ uente 
___ urioo 
___ raorao 

___ voav 
___ uaia 
___ oratreopaveiepa

i2. actually, the system that people on bougainville use to write rotokas is a little more com-
plicated than the one we   ve presented here.  in addition to the eleven letters above, the real ro-
tokas alphabet has a twelfth letter, s.  this letter represents the sound    s    or    ts   , which in ro-
tokas only occurs in very specific situations. 
 
below is a skeleton of an fsa for rotokas with all the path labels removed and set to one side.

i3.  why do t and s get their own paths?  what is special about these letters?
