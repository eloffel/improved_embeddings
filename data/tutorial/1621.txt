background 
the sounds of human speech (and indeed all sounds) travel through the air in waves, some of 
which your ear detects as sounds. these waves can be analyzed (by a mathematical technique 
called    fourier analysis   ) into combinations of basic (   sinusoidal   ) waves whose most impor-
tant properties are    frequency    and    amplitude.    one sound may comprise many such basic 
waves, and a basic wave of the same frequency or amplitude may appear in many sounds. lin-
guists sometimes display this analysis on a diagram called a spectrogram: the resulting sine 
waves' frequencies are plotted vertically (with greater amplitude indicated by darker points) 
and the time horizontally. 

data 
a sequence of spectrograms produced using the computer software    praat    is shown in the fol-
lowing pages. the first 12 are each labeled with an english word, which is shown in the spec-
trogram. the following words are given: 
 
sash, lamb, knee, sheesh, soup, pang, loose, (the letter) e, mice, ice, coo, shine 
 
 
the last four spectrograms each show one of the following eight words: 
 
louse, lass, lease, lice, pass, ash, sheep, lack 

problems 

l1. what words are shown in the last four spectrograms? you may give up to two answers on 
each; if you give two, you will be given half credit if either of them is correct. 
 
(13) ______________ (14) ______________ (15) ______________ (16) ______________ 
 
l2. for each of the three most significant sounds in ``sash,'' mark an interval corresponding to 
the duration of that sound. you should mark each interval by a horizontal line drawn above the 
spectrogram over all parts of the spectrogram affected by that sound. if you make other mark-
ings on the spectrogram, clearly indicate where each of the three requested intervals starts and 
ends. 
 
l3. do the same for ``lamb.''

l4. explain your reasoning for g1. 

l5. discuss the correspondence between the english spellings of the given 12 words and their 
spectrograms. in particular, some letters' sounds affect longer intervals in the spectrograms 
than others do. which letters and sounds affect the longest intervals? do adjacent sounds' af-
fected intervals overlap, and if so, how? are there any letters that correspond to no interval at 
all, and which letters? conversely, are there any distinct sounds on the spectrograms that corre-
spond to no english letters, and where are those sounds?
