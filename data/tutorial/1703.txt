overall introduction

id31

11 december 2016

3

id31 is   

4

    studying opinions, sentiments, subjectivities, 
affects, emotions, views, etc. in text such as 
news, blogs, reviews, comments, dialogs, or 
other kind of documents.

    an important research question:

    sentiment information is global and powerful.
    sentiment information is valuable for companies, 

customers and personal communication.

opinion definition

5

    from triple to quintuple

    triple:

( ej, soij, hi )

    quintuple: (bin liu, nlp handbook, 2010)

( ej, ajk, soijkl, hi, tl )

ej: target entity j
hi: holder i
ajk: aspect k (or sometimes called feature) of target 
entity j
tl: time l
so: sentiment value of the opinion

sentiment representation

    categorical

    sentiment, non-sentiment
    positive, neutral, negative
    stars
    emotions categories like joy, angry, sadness    

    dimensional

    valence arousal

sentiment data construction

    sentiment labels are subjective: more 

annotators could make them more reliable.

    manual gold data

    annotated by at least 3 annotators
    id104

    user generated data (automatically generated)

    user review scores (stars)
    user generated text with emoticons (noisy)
    labels available from social platform

11 december 2016

7

annotation consideration

8

    granularity : word, sentence, passage, document?

    sentences are natural units but their labels are rarely 

found.

    detecting emotions from sentences is the most difficult 

(some are of complex semantic but very few words).

    data management

    explicit answer vs. majority answer 
    w/ context vs. w/o context
    data segmentation

11 december 2016

annotation quality

    agreement

    raw agreement
    kappa value, weighted kappa value

chinese language

    has no space between words
    the finest granularity of most sentiment tools 

is word : need id40

    id52 and syntactic 

information (parse tree) are nice to have.

    two major chinese writing forms: simplified 

chinese and traditional chinese

chinese language processing tools
    the most widely used tool for chinese is 
stanford corenlp1 (simplified chinese)

    other popular ones:

    ltp cloud (simplified chinese)
    ckip parser2  (traditional chinese)
    jieba (segmentation, both simplified/traditional 

chinese)

chinese opinion treebank

chinese treebank 5.1 by sentence ids.

    align opinion trios to chinese treebank 5.1 

by node ids.

    can be used  to do opinion cause analysis.

copeopi

    a statistical id31 tool
    can be used without any training
    users can update character weights or add any 

sentiment words

    it runs fast.

11 december 2016

38

the first idea

    chinese characters are mostly morphemes and they 

bear sentiment, too.

    simple example: some characters are preferred for 

naming, but some are not.

    for example,    (ethic)    (win)    (high) good for 
names;    (stupid)    (sorrow)    (terrible) are not 
good choices for names.

    with some exceptions, but still quite reliable if the 

sentiment of character is acquired statistically from a 
large naming corpus (or just sentiment dictionaries.) 
exceptions like          .

conclusion

    we have proposed utid98 incorporating user, topic, content 
and comment information for stance classification on social 
media texts.

    utid98 learns user embeddings for all users with minimum 

active degree. 

    topic information obtained from the topic model or the pre-

defined labels further improves the utid98 model. 

    comment information provides additional clues for stance 

classification.

    we have shown that utid98 achieves promising and 

balanced results.
