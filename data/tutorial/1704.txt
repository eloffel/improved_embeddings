what it   s all about 

scientific literature is growing at an unprecedented rate 

automated approaches to extract, enrich, aggregate and summarize 
information from scientific publications are essential to enable any 

careful and comprehensive assessment of scientific literature 

natural language processing and id111 play a fundamental rule  

since they are key technologies to analyze scientific publications 

this tutorial provides an overview of the core content analysis challenges 

and opportunities of scientific literature mining 

showing how we can characterize and take advantage of implicit and explicit 

traits of scientific publications to better organize and provide access to 

scientific literature

how researchers search and read publications? 

more reading, less time dedicated to each paper 

average number of articles read by year: about 270  
(with several variations, depending on discipline - more in medicine  
and science, fewer in humanities and social sciences, 
increased from 188 in mid-1990s) 
 
reading times of an article: about 30 minutes 
(went down from 45-50 minutes in the mid-1990s) 

clear growing importance of online literature search engines 

    about 60% of article referrals of major publishers 
comes form one search engine, google scholar  
 
    publisher sites are accessed at article level 
(reduced importance of publisher site browsing)

 tenopir (2007) what does usage data tell us about our users? 

scientific literature overload 

how researchers search and read publications? 

online search and access to scientific literature 

   the forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to 

anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship. 

searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in 

touch with prevailing opinion, but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the 

range of findings and ideas built upon.    

 

pros: 
    more comprehensive searches 
    more information to more extended audience 
cons: 
    the articles cited tend to be more recent 
    there are fewer citations 
    most citations are to fewer journals and articles 
    weakening ability to explore scientific literature laterally finding in other 
studies and disciplines information potentially relevant to our current research

    improving and enriching their online offer and user experience (new tools:

    switching to exclusive online publishing: 

    currently all stm (international association of scientific, technical, and medical 
publishers) journals can be accessible on-line     in 2003: 83%, in 2008: 96% 
    the number of established research journals dropping their print editions looks 
likely to accelerate over the coming few years 

 
    offering enhanced article-level access and easing the integration of their 
contents  into third-party platforms by: 

    providing enriched and linked versions of publications 
    exposing open apis

academic social networks 

more than 11 million users 

(150.000 members in august 2008, 700.000 in december 2010, one 

more than 44 million registered users  
(16,205,767 papers added and 1,953,015 research interests

specified) academia.edu attracts over 36 million unique visitors a 

month 

about 4 million users 

(part of elsevier from 2013)     470 million documents 

why academic social networks are used? 
    connecting with other researchers 
    make own research more visible and follow the updates of other researchers 
    like an    online business card

social media in academic communication 

social media are experimenting an increasing adoption  

as complementary channel to promote and discuss scientific publications and events 

but there is still a long way to go to achieve broad social media adoption    
    growing impact but still limited when compared to conventional channels (in several surveys the 
percentage of researchers that actively use social media ranges from 3% to 32%) 
    used mainly as complementary channels to make more visible the research than as means 
to interact, discuss with other users or to keep updated with new findings 
    proliferation of too many potentially useful platforms to consider 
main obstacles to the use of social media: 
    lack of clearly compelling benefits with respect to the time needed to publishing material 
and manage interactions 
    quality and trust issues 

 

a wider adoption of altmetrics can foster the use of social media in scholarly communication

document formats: dealing with pdf 

pdf is a layout based data format for professional document rendering 

    each  pdf  document  is  characterized  by  a 
body  made  of  a  set  of  objects  that  are 
usually  grouped 
into  pages:  numbers, 
strings, streams, arrays, dictionaries, etc. 

 

    each  object  in  the  stream  is  assigned  a 
special  location  inside  a  page  viewport  (as 
well as a special size and style if applicable) 

 

    objects  are  declared  in  the  body  of  the 
pdf files, often non sequentially 

 

    a  cross-reference  table  (xref)  lists  all  the 
objects  providing  the  file  offset  of  each  of 
them  (optimized  for  reading,  no  need  to 
explore the contents of the whole pdf file)

    pdf analysis is rule-based, relying on both layout features and contents 
    output: jats compliant xml files 

two steps pdf analysis: 

step 1: a geometrical model of the textual contents and the layout of the information 
contained in the pdf is build: 

    each word described is by orientation, position, font, etc. 
    global document stats: most frequent font size and style, average line spacing 
and font spacing, etc. 
    neighbor words sharing similar text features are merged into blocks 

 

 
step 2: based on the layout features previously 
spotted, a set of rules is exploited to merge blocks  
into regions and iteratively identify 18 elements 
inside the document (also on the basis o the 
surrounding elements)

how header metadata are extracted from a pdf document? 

initial approach: 
pdf to text by means of pdfnet software 
(commercial) then apply iterative multi-step id166 
classifier (rbf kernel) as in: 
 
 

han, h., giles, c. l., manavoglu, e., zha, h., zhang, z., & fox, e. a. (2003) 
 automatic document metadata extraction using support vector machines. 

 in digital libraries proceedings. 2003 joint conference  ieee. 

  
 

 

1) id166 that indipendently classifies each header line with respect to textual features: position, 
number of words, number of capitalized words, % of words in specific dictionares, % of words occurring 
in a specific class of traning data 

 

2) contextual iterative classification by id166 where each header line is described by the feature set at 
step 1 and the class assigned to the previous l and next n header lines     stop condition: label 
assignments to header lines changes less than a predefined threshold with respect to previous iteration 

 

3) proper heuristics to segment lines with multiple authors

how header metadata are extracted from a pdf document? 

later approach: 
 

 

    trained on a large set of papers  
    fields: title, authors, doi, publication, 
volume, issue, year, page, ranges 

evaluation:  
    dataset: 26,000 pdfs with perfect metadata record in 
mendeley catalogue 

    2,4% couldn   t be converted to xml by pdftoxml 
    83,9% can be processed extracting perfect metadata 
records: authors, title, year, and publication venue (e.g. 
journal, conference, magazine) 

   if you drop 10 pdfs into your mendeley library then, on 
average, you   ll get perfect, citable metadata for 8-9 of them.

document structure analysis 

conclusions 

 

    a precise extraction of structured textual contents from the pdf of 
scientific publications is essential to enable any further text processing 
of their contents 

 

    several pdf-to-text conversion tools are available, both general 
purpose and customized to scientific publications 

 

    such tools usually rely on both layout and textual features of scientific 
publications and are rule-based or rely on supervised machine learning 
approaches 

 

    a rich set of annotated corpora is freely available for further 
experimentation

conclusions 

 

    the characterization of scientific discourse provides valuable 
information to enhance several scientific id111 tasks like text 
quality assessment, information extraction, content retrieval and 
summarization 

 

    zone analysis is the most widespread approach to characterize 
scientific discourse, often at sentence level 

 

    annotation schemas often offers complementary views by modeling 
different aspects of scientific discourse 

 

    even if minimal, often annotation schemas need to be adapted to the 
specific domain of the scientific textual contents to characterize 

 

    supervised approaches are widely explored: classifiers (na  ve bayes, 
id28, id166) or sequence labeling approaches (crf) 

 

    a rich set of annotated corpora is freely available for further 
experimentation

    attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to 
the correct sources 
    allow the reader to determine independently 
whether the referenced material supports the 
author's argument in the claimed way

2  cited source is mentioned in the introduction or discussion as part of the history and state of the art of the 

research question under investigation. 

3  cited  source  contains  the  data  (pertaining  to  the  discipline  of  the  citing  article)which  are  used  for

8  cited source is the specific point of departure for the research question investigated. 

9  results of citing article disprove, put into question the data as interpretation of cited source 

10  cited source is negatively evaluated 

11  results of citing article prove, verify, substantiate the data or interpretation of cited source.

6 classes for citation characterization 

criticism  criticism  can  be  positive  or  negative.  a  citing  sentence  is  classified  as     criticizing     when  it 
mentions the weakness/strengths of the cited approach, negatively/positively criticizes the cited 
approach, negatively/positively evaluates the cited source.  

comparison  a  citing  sentence  is  classified  as     comparison     when  it  compares  or  contrasts  the  work  in  the 
cited paper to the author   s work. it overlaps with the first category when the citing sentence says 
one approach is not as good as the other approach. in this case we use the first category. 

use  a citing sentence is classified as    use    when the citing paper uses the method, idea or tool of the 

cited paper. 

substantiation  a  citing  sentence  is  classified  as     substantiating     when  the  results,  claims  of  the  citing  work 

substantiate, verify the cited paper and support each other. 

basis  a citing sentence is classified as    basis    when the author uses the cited work as starting point or 

motivation and extends on the cited work. 

neutral  a citing sentence is classified as    neutral    when it is a neutral description of the cited work or if it 

doesn   t come under any of the above categories.

a  strength  in  a  cited  work  may  refer  to  its  easiness  of  use,  its  little

some citations do not only state a strength or a weakness of the cited paper, 
but  provide  the  author   s  evaluation  of  the  research,  by  opposing  a  strength 
with a weakness or by giving his opinion in an explicit (or subtle) way. 
if  a  citation  can  be  considered  a  criticism,  but  cannot  be  included  in  the 
previous sub-purposes, then it should be annotated as criticism_other. 
the comparison focuses on the similarities with the author   s work. 
the comparison focuses on the differences with the author   s work.

citation analysis 

conclusions 

 

    citations represent a primary device of scientific literature useful to 
issue explicit author-created links among publications 

 

    both the network of citations and the textual contents of citation 
contexts are exploited in many different tasks including: research 
collaboration analysis, topic analysis and evolution, citation 
recommendation, scientific document summarization 

 

    besides citation counts, the (complex task of) characterization of the 
purpose of citations can provide deeper insights on the quality of 
scientific publications and the feedback of the research community 

 

    citation id126 can complement pure scientific 
literature search engines in helping to cope with scientific information 
overload 

 

    a rich collection of citation datasets, including id191 and 
corpora of citations annotated with respect to their sentiment and 
purpose, is freely available for further experimentation

citation-based summarization: finding non-explicit citations 

finding sentences that potentially contain useful information about a cited source, 

but not explicitly cite it     i.e. expanding explicit citations to citation contexts 

    a limitation of citation-based approaches to scientific 

summarizations is the use of explicit citation information  
    explicit citation:  
this approach is one of those described in eisner (1996)  
offers very little information about eisner   s paper 
implicit or non-explicit citation sentences may contain useful 
information on the cited paper 
     ....the parser searches for the best parse for the sentence.

sentences are selected based on: their category (b, p, m, r, l), size of the cluster

    the information provided by citations is essential to support and 

improve the generation of summaries of scientific documents 

    several kinds of information can be included in a summary of a 

scientific publication: the relevant contents of the paper, which parts 
of the papers had more impact on the research community, the 
feedback of the research community concerning a specific article, etc. 

    id57 is useful to help the creation of 

state-of-the-art reports

order to assess scientific content

some  alternative  phrase  alignment  approaches  have  been 
developed,  which  do  not rely  on  the  viterbi  word  alignment. 
both (marcu, 2002) and (zhang, 2003) consider a sentence pair 
as  different  realizations  of  a  sequence  of    concepts.  these 
alignment approaches segment the sentences into a sequence 
of phrases.

several high level tasks look for either one-way rewriting between single sentences, like recognizing id123 (rte) ( dagan et al., 2006 ), or two-way rewritings like 
paraphrase identification ( dolan et al., 2004 ) and semantic textual similarity ( agirre et al., 2012 ). 
our system based on type-enriched string rewriting kernels obtains state-of-the-art results on paraphrase identification and answer sentence selection and outperforms 
comparable methods on rte. 
string rewriting kernels ( bu et al., 2012 ) count the number of common rewritings between two pairs of sentences seen as sequences of words. 
following the terminology of string kernels, we use the term string and character instead of sentence and word.  
a type-enriched string rewriting kernel (tesrk) is simply a string rewriting kernel as defined in equation 1 but with r a set of typed rewriting rules.  
however, it cannot match the pair of sentences (c) in the original kb-srk.  
we experimented on three tasks: paraphrase identification, recognizing id123 and answer sentence selection. 
recognizing id123 asks whether the meaning of a sentence hypothesis can be inferred by reading a sentence text.  
a id166 classifier with this kernel yields state-of-the-art results in paraphrase identification and answer sentence selection and outperforms comparable systems in recognizing 
id123.

global conclusions  
and discussion 

    there is considerable room for improvement in the next future with 

respect to the automation of the analysis, aggregation and 
summarization of scientific literature 

 

    the natural language processing community plays a key role in 

providing better automated techniques to mine scientific literature 

 

    the investigation of scientific id111 approaches should take into 

account both their effectiveness and the possibility to scale over 
large, heterogeneous and dynamic collections of papers 

natural language processing 

for intelligent access 

to scientific information
