introduction

example (o or t?)

we want to see countries that can produce the best

product for the best price in that particular business . i have
to agree with the member that free trade agreements by
de   nition do not mean that we have to be less vigilant all of a
sudden .

example (t or o?)

i would like as my    nal point to say that we support free
trade , but we must learn from past mistakes . let us hope
that negotiations for free trade agreements with the four
central american countries introduce a number of other
dimensions absent from these    rst generation agreements .

introduction

corpus-based translation studies

translated texts exhibit lower lexical variety (type-to-token ratio)
than originals (al-shabab, 1996)

their mean sentence length and lexical density (ratio of content to
non-content words) are lower (laviosa, 1998)

text classification with machine learning

supervised machine learning: a training corpus lists instances
of both classes
each instance in the two classes is represented by a set of numeric
features that are extracted from the instances
a generic machine-learning algorithm is trained to distinguish
between feature vectors representative of one class and those
representative of the other
the trained classi   er is tested on an    unseen    text, the test set
classi   ers assign weights to the features

analysis: simplification

lexical density fails altogether to predict the status of a text, being
nearly on chance level (53% accuracy)

the    rst two ttr measures perform relatively well (72%), and the
indirect measures of lexical variety (mean word length, 66% and
syllable ratio, 61%) are above chance level

mean word rank (77%) is closely related to the feature studied by
laviosa (1998) (n top words) with two di   erences: our list of
frequent items is much larger, and we generate the frequency list
not from the corpora under study but rather from an external
much larger reference corpus

in contrast, the design that follows laviosa (1998) more strictly (n
most frequent words) has a lower predictive power (64%)

while mean sentence length is much above chance level (65%), the
results are contrary to common assumptions in translation studies

on the other hand, the classi   er that uses 40 cohesive markers

accuracy

such cohesive markers are far more frequent in t than in o

none of these features perform very well

repetitions and contractions are rare in europarl; the corpus
may not be suited for studying these phenomena

threshold pmi, designed to pick on highly associated words and
therefore attesting to many    xed expressions, performs
considerably better, at 66% accuracy, but contrary to the
hypothesis (kenny, 2001)

english has far more highly associated bigrams than translations:
o has stand idly , stand    rm, stand trial, etc.; conversely, t
includes poorly associated bigrams such as stand unamended

analysis: interference

the interference-based classi   ers are the best performing ones

interference is the most robust phenomenon typifying translations

the character id165    ndings are consistent with popescu (2011):
they catch on both a   xes and function words

for example, typical trigrams in o are -ion and all whereas typical
to t are -ble and the

part-of-speech trigrams is an extremely cheap and e   cient classi   er

for example, md+vb+vbn, e.g., must be taken, should be
given, can be used

analysis: interference

positional token frequency yields 97% accuracy

the second most prominent feature typifying o is sentences
opening with the word    but   ; there are 2.25 times more cases of
such sentences in o

a long prescriptive tradition in english forbids writers to open a
sentence with    but   , and translators are conservative in their lexical
choices (kenny, 2001)
this is in fact standardization rather than interference

the function words classi   er replicates koppel and ordan (2011);
despite the good performance (96% accuracy) it is not very
meaningful theoretically
subject pronouns, like i , he and she are prominent indicators of o,
whereas virtually all re   exive pronouns (such as itself , himself ,
yourself ) typify t
t has about 1.15 times more passive verbs, but it is highly
dependent on the source language
punctuation marks are good predictors
the mark    .    (actually indicating sentence length) is a strong
feature of o;    ,    is a strong marker of t
in fact, these two features alone yield 79% accuracy
parentheses are very typical to t, indicating explicitation
translations from german use many more exclamation marks, 2.76
times more than original english!!!

cluster labeling

cluster labeling

labeling determines which of the clusters is o and which is t
id91 can divide observations into classes but cannot label
those classes
let om (o-markers) denote a set of function words that tend to be
associated with o; tm (t-markers) is a set of words typical of t
create unigram language models of o and t:

p(w | om) =
p(w | tm) =

tf (w )+  
|om|+    |v|
tf (w )+  
|tm|+    |v|

the similarity between a class x (either o or t) and a cluster ci is
determined using the jensen-shannon divergence (jsd) (lin, 1991)

(cid:113)
jsd(px||pci )

djs (x , ci ) = 2

cluster labeling

cluster labeling

the assignment of the label x to the cluster c1 is then supported
by both c1   s proximity to the class x and c2   s proximity to the
other class:

                  o    if djs (o, c1)  djs (t , c2) <

djs (o, c2)  djs (t , c1)
otherwise

   t   

label(c1) =

c2 is then assigned the complementary label
we select o- and t-markers from a random sample of europarl
and hansard texts, using 600 chunks from each corpus

labeling precision is 100% in all id91 experiments

this facilitates majority voting of several feature sets

mixed-domain classification

the in-domain discriminative features of translated texts cannot be
easily generalized to other, even related, domains

hypothesis: domain-speci   c features overshadow the features of
translationese

we mix 800 chunks each from europral and hansard,
yielding 1,600 chunks, half of them o and half t

running the id91 algorithm on this dataset yields perfect
separation by domain (and chance-level identi   cation of
translationese)

adding the literature corpus and id91 to three clusters yields
the same results

into an english sentence e = e1,       , el
the best translation:

  e = arg maxe p(e | f )

p(f|e )  p(e )

improve translation quality by taking advantage of information
pertaining to the direction of translation
techniques:

union: simple concatenation of corpora
two phrase-tables: train a phrase table for each subset and pass
both to moses
phrase table interpolation: using perplexity minimization
(sennrich, 2012)
add a feature in the phrase table indicating the direction of

the power of interference

translations to english from l1 di   er from translations to english
from l2
translations from two languages are more similar to each other
when the two source languages are closer

the native language of esl speakers can be accurately identi   ed
by looking at their english texts

cross-classification

a classi   er is trained to distinguish between o and t translated
from l1; it is then used to distinguish o from t translated from l2

id91 of translations from several
languages

first, translations to english from 14 european languages were
used for cross-classi   cation using pos trigrams as features

the accuracy of classi   cation was 76% (compare to a baseline of
100/14=7%)

then, an unsupervised hierarchical id91 algorithm grouped
together english (and french) texts translated from 16 european
languages

texts were represented using feature vectors, similarly to the
supervised experiments

native language identi   cation

native id46

given a set of essays composed by esl students, identify the
authors    native language (out of 11 languages)

the dataset consists of toefl essays, contributed by the ets

each text is annotated by the prompt, the pro   ciency level and the

conclusion

conclusion

machines can accurately identify translated texts

translation    universals    should be reconsidered. not only are they
dependent on genre and register, they also vary greatly across
di   erent pairs of languages

the best performing features are those that attest to the
      ngerprints    of the source on the target

interference, a pair-speci   c phenomenon, dominates other
manifestations of translationese

translationese features are overshadowed by more salient features
of the text, including genre, register, domain, etc.

conclusion

conclusion

language models compiled from translated texts are better for
smt than ones compiled from original texts

translation models translated in the same direction as that of the
smt task are better than ones translated in the reverse direction

translation models can be adapted to translationese, thereby
improving the quality of smt
