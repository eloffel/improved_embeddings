   in the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming
   so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book. don't worry
   if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. this
   chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter
   in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink

   great teacher chuck and obviously a great course for people just
   starting out with programming. well paced. the suggested timings for
   the assignments were a bit off, i think, but well, that's just me.

   lecture videos were broken into small parts whereby it's easy to
   understand and digest. assessment given were relevant to what was
   taught for each segment. navigating around course contents were easy.
