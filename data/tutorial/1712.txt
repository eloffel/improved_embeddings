how the specialization works

take courses

   a coursera specialization is a series of courses that helps you master
   a skill. to begin, enroll in the specialization directly, or review its
   courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. when you subscribe
   to a course that is part of a specialization, you   re automatically
   subscribed to the full specialization. it   s okay to complete just one
   course     you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any
   time. visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and
   your progress.

hands-on project

   every specialization includes a hands-on project. you'll need to
   successfully finish the project(s) to complete the specialization and
   earn your certificate. if the specialization includes a separate course
   for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of the other
   courses before you can start it.

earn a certificate

   when you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you'll
   earn a certificate that you can share with prospective employers and
   your professional network.

     * what is the refund policy?
     * can i just enroll in a single course?
       yes! to get started, click the course card that interests you and
       enroll. you can enroll and complete the course to earn a shareable
       certificate, or you can audit it to view the course materials for
       free. when you subscribe to a course that is part of a
       specialization, you   re automatically subscribed to the full
       specialization. visit your learner dashboard to track your
       progress.
     * is financial aid available?
     * can i take the course for free?
     * is this course really 100% online? do i need to attend any classes
       in person?
       this course is completely online, so there   s no need to show up to
       a classroom in person. you can access your lectures, readings and
       assignments anytime and anywhere via the web or your mobile device.
     * will i earn university credit for completing the specialization?
       this specialization doesn't carry university credit, but some
       universities may choose to accept specialization certificates for
       credit. check with your institution to learn more.
     * how long does it take to complete the python for everybody
       specialization?
       time to completion can vary based on your schedule and experience
       level, but most learners are able to complete the specialization in
       about 8 months.
     * how often is each course in the specialization offered?
       each course in the specialization is offered on a regular schedule,
       with sessions starting about once per month. if you don't complete
       a course on the first try, you can easily transfer to the next
       session, and your completed work and grades will carry over. the
       capstone project will be offered three times per year.
     * what background knowledge is necessary?
       this specialization is designed to serve as an on-ramp for
       programming, and has no pre-requisites. the pace of the first two
       courses is aimed at those with no programming experience at all.
     * what are the payment options?
       you can pay for the entire specialization upfront, or pay
       individually for each course as you progress. financial aid is
       available for learners who qualify.

       we recommend taking the courses in the order presented, as each
       subsequent course will build on material from previous courses.
     * will i earn university credit for completing the python for
       everybody specialization?
       coursera courses and certificates don't carry university credit,
       though some universities may choose to accept specialization
       certificates for credit. check with your institution to learn more.
     * what will i be able to do upon completing the python for everybody
       specialization?
       if you are new to programming, this specialization will prepare you
       to take other courses and develop advanced skills. recommended
       follow-up courses include johns hopkins university   s data science
       specialization and the university of michigan   s web design
       specialization. if you have some prior experience in data analysis,
       this specialization is an excellent way to add python skills to
       your repertoire.
     * what if i already earned a course certificate in programming for
       everybody (python)?
       if you previously earned a verified course certificate for the
       programming for everybody (python) course, you will automatically
       receive credit for completing courses 1 and 2 in the
       specialization. you may begin with the third course of the
       specialization, and you will receive a specialization certificate
       upon successful completion of courses 3 and 4 and the capstone
       project. however, if you earned an unverified statement of
       accomplishment, you will need to earn course certificates in all
       four courses, and successfully complete the capstone project.
