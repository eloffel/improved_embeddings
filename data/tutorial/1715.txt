matrix algebra tutorial

   this tutorial is a brief, easy-to-understand introduction to matrix
   algebra, emphasizing matrix methods that are widely used in statistics
   and mathematics. > [144]begin lesson 1

about the tutorial

   after completing this tutorial, you will be familiar with the
   nomenclature and notation used by matrix algebra. and you will be able
   to:
     * perform common matrix operations (addition, subtraction,
       multiplication, etc.).
     * determine matrix rank (i.e., distinguish singular from non-singular
       matrices).
     * find the determinant and inverse for any square matrix.
     * use matrix algebra to solve simultaneous linear equations.
     * express computations and sets of equations compactly in matrix
       format.
     * and more ...

   topics are introduced in short, easy-to-understand modules. each lesson
   covers a single topic, and most lessons include one or more review
   questions to reinforce learning.

   this tutorial is designed for students and researchers who have some
   familiarity with introductory statistics (e.g., a high school
   statistics course or [145]advanced placement statistics).

how to use this tutorial

   individual lessons are accessible through the table of contents, which
   can be found in the vertical column on the left side of the page. if
   you are already familiar with matrix algebra, you can choose any lesson
   at random and work effectively.

   individual lessons are accessible through the table of contents, which
   can be accessed by tapping the "matrix algebra: table of contents"
   button at the top of the page. if you are already familiar with matrix
   algebra, you can choose any lesson at random and work effectively.

   however, if you are new to the topic, you should work through lessons
   in the order in which they appear; because each lesson builds on
   previous lessons.

additional helpful resources

   as you progress through this matrix algebra tutorial, take advantage of
   the following helpful resources.
     * sample problems. most of the lessons include sample problems. the
       sample problems reinforce key concepts and help you test your
       knowledge.
     * on-line help. the stat trek [146]statistics dictionary takes the
       mystery out of technical jargon. if any term or concept is unclear,
       visit the dictionary for additional explanation.

   note: the dictionary can be accessed by clicking the help tab in the
   main menu (located at the top of this web page).
