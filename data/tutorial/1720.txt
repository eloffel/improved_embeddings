preface

these id202 lecture notes are designed to be presented as twenty    ve,
   fty minute lectures suitable for sophomores likely to use the material for
applications but still requiring a solid foundation in this fundamental branch
of mathematics. the main idea of the course is to emphasize the concepts
of vector spaces and linear transformations as mathematical structures that
can be used to model the world around us. once    persuaded    of this truth,
students learn explicit skills such as gaussian elimination and diagonalization
in order that vectors and linear transformations become calculational tools,
rather than abstract mathematics.

in practical terms, the course aims to produce students who can perform
computations with large linear systems while at the same time understand
the concepts behind these techniques. often-times when a problem can be re-
duced to one of id202 it is    solved   . these notes do not devote much
space to applications (there are already a plethora of textbooks with titles
involving some permutation of the words    linear   ,    algebra    and    applica-
tions   ). instead, they attempt to explain the fundamental concepts carefully
enough that students will realize for their own selves when the particular
application they encounter in future studies is ripe for a solution via linear
algebra.

there are relatively few worked examples or illustrations in these notes,
this material is instead covered by a series of    id202 how-to videos   .

. the    scripts   
they can be viewed by clicking on the take one icon
for these movies are found at the end of the notes if students prefer to read
this material in a traditional format and can be easily reached via the script

introductory video

the notes are designed to be used in conjunction with a set of online
homework exercises which help the students read the lecture notes and learn
basic id202 skills.
interspersed among the lecture notes are links
to simple online problems that test whether students are actively reading
the notes. in addition there are two sets of sample midterm problems with
solutions as well as a sample    nal exam. there are also a set of ten on-
line assignments which are usually collected weekly. the    rst assignment

8

is designed to ensure familiarity with some basic mathematic notions (sets,
functions, logical quanti   ers and basic methods of proof). the remaining
nine assignments are devoted to the usual matrix and vector gymnastics
expected from any sophomore id202 class. these exercises are all
available at

http://webwork.math.ucdavis.edu/webwork2/mat22a-waldron-
winter-2012/

webwork is an open source, online homework system which originated at
the university of rochester. it can e   ciently check whether a student has
answered an explicit, typically computation-based, problem correctly. the
problem sets chosen to accompany these notes could contribute roughly 20%
of a student   s grade, and ensure that basic computational skills are mastered.
most students rapidly realize that it is best to print out the webwork assign-
ments and solve them on paper before entering the answers online. those
who do not tend to fare poorly on midterm examinations. we have found
that there tend to be relatively few questions from students in o   ce hours
about the webwork assignments.
instead, by assigning 20% of the grade
to written assignments drawn from problems chosen randomly from the re-
view exercises at the end of each lecture, the student   s focus was primarily
on understanding ideas. they range from simple tests of understanding of
the material in the lectures to more di   cult problems, all of them require
thinking, rather than blind application of mathematical    recipes   . o   ce
hour questions re   ected this and o   ered an excellent chance to give students
tips how to present written answers in a way that would convince the person
grading their work that they deserved full credit!

each lecture concludes with references to the comprehensive online text-

books of jim he   eron and rob beezer:

and the notes are also hyperlinked to wikipedia where students can rapidly

there are still many errors in the notes, as well as awkwardly explained
concepts. an army of 400 students, fu liu, stephen pon and gerry puckett
have already found many of them. rohit thomas has spent a great deal of
time editing these notes and the accompanying webworks and has improved
them immeasurably. katrina glaeser and travis scrimshaw have spent many

hours shooting and scripting the how-to videos and taken these notes to a
whole new level! anne schilling shot a great guest video. we also thank
captain conundrum for providing us his solutions to the sample midterm

1 what is id202?

video overview

three bears go into a cave, two come out. would you go in?

brian butterworth

numbers are highly useful tools for surviving in the modern world, so much
so that we often introduce abstract pronumerals to represent them:

n bears go into a cave, n     1 come out. would you go in?

a single number alone is not su   cient to model more complicated real
world situations. for example, suppose i asked everybody in this room to
rate the likeability of everybody else on a scale from 1 to 10. in a room full
of n people (or bears sic) there would be n2 ratings to keep track of (how
much jill likes jill, how much does jill like andrew, how much does andrew
like jill, how much does andrew like andrew, etcetera). we could arrange
these in a square array

          9

4       

10 6
...

. . .

         

would it make sense to replace such an array by an abstract symbol m ? in
the case of numbers, the pronumeral n was more than a placeholder for a
particular piece of information; there exists a myriad of mathematical oper-
ations (addition, subtraction, multiplication,...) that can be performed with
the symbol n that could provide useful information about the real world sys-
tem at hand. the array m is often called a matrix and is an example of a

12

more general abstract structure called a linear transformation on which many
mathematical operations can also be de   ned. (to understand why having an
abstract theory of linear transformations might be incredibly useful and even
lucrative, try replacing    likeability ratings    with the number of times inter-
net websites link to one another!) in this course, we   ll learn about three main
topics: linear systems, vector spaces, and linear transformations. along
the way we   ll learn about matrices and how to manipulate them.

for now, we   ll illustrate some of the basic ideas of the course in the case of
two by two matrices. everything will carefully de   ned later, we just want to
start with some simple examples to get an idea of the things we   ll be working
with.

example suppose i have a bunch of apples and oranges. let x be the number of
apples i have, and y be the number of oranges i have. as everyone knows, apples and
oranges don   t mix, so if i want to keep track of the number of apples and oranges i
have, i should put them in a list. we   ll call this list a vector, and write it like this:
(x, y). the order here matters!
i should remember to always write the number of
apples    rst and then the number of oranges - otherwise if i see the vector (1, 2), i
won   t know whether i have two apples or two oranges.

this vector in the example is just a list of two numbers, so if we want
to, we can represent it with a point in the plane with the corresponding
coordinates, like so:

13

oranges

(x, y)

apples

in the plane, we can imagine each point as some combination of apples and
oranges (or parts thereof, for the points that don   t have integer coordinates).
then each point corresponds to some vector. the collection of all such
vectors   all the points in our apple-orange plane   is an example of a vector
space.

example there are 27 pieces of fruit in a barrel, and twice as many oranges as apples.
how many apples and oranges are in the barrel?

how to solve this conundrum? we can re-write the question mathematically as

follows:

x + y = 27

y = 2x

this is an example of a linear system. it   s a collection of equations in
which variables are multiplied by constants and summed, and no variables
are multiplied together: there are no powers of x or y greater than one, no
fractional or negative powers of x or y, and no places where x and y are
multiplied together.

reading homework: problem 1.1

notice that we can solve the system by manipulating the equations in-
volved. first, notice that the second equation is the same as    2x + y = 0.
then if you subtract the second equation from the    rst, you get on the left
side x + y     (   2x + y) = 3x, and on the left side you get 27     0 = 27. then

14

3x = 27, so we learn that x = 9. using the second equation, we then see
that y = 18. then there are 9 apples and 18 oranges.

let   s do it again, by working with the list of equations as an object in

itself. first we rewrite the equations tidily:

x + y = 27
2x     y = 0

we can express this set of equations with a matrix as follows:

(cid:18)1

1
2    1

(cid:19)(cid:18)x

(cid:19)

(cid:18)27
(cid:19)

=

y

0

the square list of numbers is an example of a matrix. we can multiply
the matrix by the vector to get back the linear system using the following
rule for multiplying matrices by vectors:

(cid:18)a b

(cid:19)(cid:18)x

(cid:19)

c d

y

=

(cid:18)ax + by

(cid:19)

cx + dy

reading homework: problem 1.2

a 3    3 matrix example

the matrix is an example of a linear transformation, because it takes

one vector and turns it into another in a    linear    way.

our next task is to solve linear systems. we   ll learn a general method

called gaussian elimination.

1. let m be a matrix and u and v vectors:

(cid:19)

m =

z

(a) propose a de   nition for u + v.

(b) check that your de   nition obeys m v + m u = m (u + v).

2. id127: let m and n be matrices

m =

c d

(cid:18)e f

and n =

(cid:19)

v =

compute the vector n v using the rule given above. now multiply this
vector by the matrix m , i.e., compute the vector m (n v).

next recall that multiplication of ordinary numbers is associative, namely
the order of brackets does not matter: (xy)z = x(yz). let us try to
demand the same property for matrices and vectors, that is

m (n v) = (m n )v .

we need to be careful reading this equation because n v is a vector and
so is m (n v). therefore the right hand side, (m n )v should also be a
vector. this means that m n must be a matrix; in fact it is the matrix
obtained by multiplying the matrices m and n . use your result for
m (n v) to    nd the matrix m n .

4. there are methods for solving linear systems other than gauss    method.
one often taught in high school is to solve one of the equations for a
variable, then substitute the resulting expression into other equations.
that step is repeated until there is an equation with only one vari-
able. from that, the    rst number in the solution is derived, and then
back-substitution can be done. this method takes longer than gauss   
method, since it involves more arithmetic operations, and is also more
likely to lead to errors. to illustrate how it can lead to wrong conclu-
sions, we will use the system

x + 3y = 1
2x + y =    3
2x + 2y = 0

(a) solve the    rst equation for x and substitute that expression into

the second equation. find the resulting y.

(b) again solve the    rst equation for x, but this time substitute that

expression into the third equation. find this y.

what extra step must a user of this method take to avoid erroneously
concluding a system has a solution?

we learned to write the linear system using a matrix and two vectors like so:

here   s another example of an augmented matrix, for a linear system with

three equations and four unknowns:

and    nally, here   s the general case. the number of equations in the linear
system is the number of rows r in the augmented matrix, and the number of
columns k in the matrix left of the vertical line is the number of unknowns.

eral augmented matrix and turning it into a very simple augmented matrix
consisting of the identity matrix on the left and a bunch of numbers (the
solution) on the right.

equivalence relations for linear systems

equivalence example

it often happens that two mathematical objects will appear to be di   er-
ent but in fact are exactly the same. the best-known example of this are
fractions. for example, the fractions 1
12 describe the same number.
we could certainly call the two fractions equivalent.

in our running example, we   ve noticed that the two augmented matrices

(cid:19)

both contain the same information: x = 9, y = 18.

two augmented matrices corresponding to linear systems that actually
have solutions are said to be (row) equivalent if they have the same solutions.

to denote this, we write:(cid:18)1

a small excursion into the philosophy of mathematical notation: suppose
i have a large pile of equivalent fractions, such as 2
200, and so on. most
people will agree that their favorite way to write the number represented by
all these di   erent factors is 1
2, in which the numerator and denominator are
relatively prime. we usually call this a reduced fraction. this is an example
of a canonical form, which is an extremely impressive way of saying    favorite
way of writing it down   . there   s a theorem telling us that every rational
number can be speci   ed by a unique fraction whose numerator and denom-
inator are relatively prime. to say that again, but slower, every rational
number has a reduced fraction, and furthermore, that reduced fraction is
unique.

a 3    3 example

2.2 reduced row echelon form

since there are many di   erent augmented matrices that have the same set
of solutions, we should    nd a canonical form for writing our augmented
matrices. this canonical form is called reduced row echelon form, or rref
for short. rref looks like this in general:

21

                                       

1     0     0        0 b1

the    rst non-zero entry in each row is called the pivot. the asterisks
denote arbitrary content which could be several columns long. the following
properties describe the rref.

1. in rref, the pivot of any row is always 1.

2. the pivot of any given row is always to the right of the pivot of the

row above it.

3. the pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column.

            1 0 7 0

0 1 3 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0

            

example

here is a non-example, which breaks all three of the rules:

the rref is a very useful way to write linear systems: it makes it very easy
to write down the solutions to the system.

example

            1 0 3 0
            

0 0 2 0
0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1

            1 0 7 0 4

0 1 3 0 1
0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 0

            

22

when we write this augmented matrix as a system of linear equations, we get the
following:

x + 7z

y + 3z

= 4

= 1

w = 2

solving from the bottom variables up, we see that w = 2 immediately. z is not a
pivot, so it is still undetermined. set z =   . then y = 1     3   and x = 4     7  . more
concisely:

            x

y
z
w

             =

             +

               7

   3

so we can read o    the solution set directly from the rref. (notice that we use the
word    set    because there is not just one solution, but one for every choice of   .)

reading homework: problem 2.2

you need to become very adept at reading o    solutions of linear systems
from the rref of their augmented matrix. the general method is to work
from the bottom up and set any non-pivot variables to unknowns. here is
another example.

example

            1 1 0 1 0 1

0 0 1 2 0 2
0 0 0 0 1 3
0 0 0 0 0 0

             .

here we were not told the names of the variables, so lets just call them x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.
(there are always as many of these as there are columns in the matrix before the ver-
tical line; the number of rows, on the other hand is the number of linear equations.)
to begin with we immediately notice that there are no pivots in the second and

fourth columns so x2 and x4 are undetermined and we set them to

x2 =   1 ,

x4 =   2 .

(note that you get to be creative here, we could have used    and    or any other names
we like for a pair of unknowns.)

23

working from the bottom up we see that the last row just says 0 = 0, a well
known fact! note that a row of zeros save for a non-zero entry after the vertical
line would be mathematically inconsistent and indicates that the system has no
solutions at all.
next we see from the second last row that x5 = 3. the second row says x3 =
2     2x4 = 2     2  2. the top row then gives x1 = 1     x2     x4 = 1       1       2. again
we can write this solution as a vector

                   +   1

   1
0
   2
1
0

                   .

observe, that since no variables were given at the beginning, we do not really need to
state them in our solution. as a challenge, look carefully at this solution and make sure
you can see how every part of it comes from the original augmented matrix without
every having to reintroduce variables and equations.

perhaps unsurprisingly in light of the previous discussions of rref, we

have a theorem:

theorem 2.1. every augmented matrix is row-equivalent to a unique aug-
mented matrix in reduced row echelon form.

next lecture, we will prove it.

3 elementary row operations

our goal is to begin with an arbitrary matrix and apply operations that
respect row equivalence until we have a matrix in reduced row echelon
form (rref). the three elementary row operations are:

   (row swap) exchange any two rows.

   (scalar multiplication) multiply any row by a non-zero constant.

   (row sum) add a multiple of one row to another row.

example

why do these preserve the linear system in question? swapping rows is
just changing the order of the equations begin considered, which certainly
should not alter the solutions. scalar multiplication is just multiplying the
equation by the same number on both sides, which does not change the solu-
tion(s) of the equation. likewise, if two equations share a common solution,
adding one to the other preserves the solution. therefore we can de   ne aug-
mented matrices to be row equivalent if the are related by a sequence of
elementary row operations. this de   nition can also be applied to augmented
matrices corresponding to linear systems with no solutions at all!

there is a very simple process for row-reducing a matrix, working col-
umn by column. this process is called gauss   jordan elimination or simply
gaussian elimination.

1. if all entries in a given column are zero, then the associated variable is
undetermined; make a note of the undetermined variable(s) and then
ignore all such columns.

2. swap rows so that the    rst entry in the    rst column is non-zero.

3. multiply the    rst row by    so that this pivot entry is 1.

4. add multiples of the    rst row to each other row so that the    rst entry

of every other row is zero.

27

5. before moving on to step 6, add multiples of the    rst row any rows
above that you have ignored to ensure there are zeros in the column
above the current pivot entry.

6. now ignore the    rst row and    rst column and repeat steps 2-5 until

the matrix is in rref.

2. (gaussian elimination) another method for solving linear systems is
to use row operations to bring the augmented matrix to row echelon
form. in row echelon form, the pivots are not necessarily set to one,
and we only require that all entries left of the pivots are zero, not
necessarily entries above a pivot. provide a counterexample to show
that row echelon form is not unique.

once a system is in row echelon form, it can be solved by    back substi-
tution.    write the following row echelon matrix as a system of equa-

4 solution sets for systems of linear equa-

tions

for a system of equations with r equations and k unknowns, one can have a
number of di   erent outcomes. for example, consider the case of r equations
in three variables. each of these equations is the equation of a plane in three-
dimensional space. to    nd solutions to the system of equations, we look for
the common intersection of the planes (if an intersection exists). here we
have    ve di   erent possibilities:

1. no solutions. some of the equations are contradictory, so no solutions

exist.

2. unique solution. the planes have a unique point of intersection.

3. line. the planes intersect in a common line; any point on that line

then gives a solution to the system of equations.

4. plane. perhaps you only had one equation to begin with, or else all
of the equations coincide geometrically. in this case, you have a plane
of solutions, with two free parameters.

planes

5. all of r3. if you start with no information, then any point in r3 is a

solution. there are three free parameters.

in general, for systems of equations with k unknowns, there are k + 2
possible outcomes, corresponding to the number of free parameters in the
solutions set, plus the possibility of no solutions. these types of    solution
sets    are hard to visualize, but luckily    hyperplanes    behave like planes in
r3 in many ways.

example

here, x1 and x2 are the pivot variables and x3 and x4 are non-leading variables,
and thus free. the solutions are then of the form x3 =   1, x4 =   2, x2 = 1 +   1      2,
x1 = 1       1 +   2.

the preferred way to write a solution set is with set notation. let s be the set of

solutions to the system. then:

                     
            x1

then if we take for the product of the matrix m with the vector x of
unknowns

our system becomes simply

m x = v .

stare carefully at our answer for the product m x above. first you should
notice that each of the three rows corresponds to the left hand side of one of
the equations in the system. also observe that each entry was obtained by
matching the entries in the corresponding row of m with the column entries
of x. for example, using the second row of m we obtained the second entry
of m x

in lecture 8 we will study id127 in detail, but you can al-
ready try to discover the main rules for yourself by working through review
question 3 on multiplying matrices by vectors.

given two vectors we can add them term-by-term:

we can also multiply a vector by a scalar, like so:

                     

a1
a2
a3
...
ar

                     

a1 + b1
a2 + b2
a3 + b3

ar + br

                      +
                     

  

                     

a1
a2
a3
...

b1

b3
...
br

                     
                      =
                     
                      =

  a1
  a2
  a3
...
  ar

...

                     

then yet another way to write the solution set for the example is:

where

x0 =

x = x0 +   1y1 +   2y2

            1
             , y1 =

               1

de   nition let x and y be vectors and    and    be scalars. a function f
is linear if

f (  x +   y ) =   f (x) +   f (y )

this is called the linearity property for id127.

the notion of linearity is a core concept in this course. make sure you
understand what it means and how to use it in computations!

example consider our example system above with

      1 0

       , x =

             and y =

             ,

            y1

y2
y3
y4

and take for the function of vectors

f (x) = m x .

now let us check the linearity property for f . the property needs to hold for any
scalars    and   , so for simplicity let us concentrate    rst on the case    =    = 1. this
means that we need to compare the following two calculations:

1. first add x + y , then compute f (x + y ).

2. first compute f (x) and f (y ), then compute the sum f (x) + f (y ).

the second computation is slightly easier:

      x1 + x3     x4

x2     x3 + x4

f (x) = m x =

(using our result above). adding these gives

f (x) + f (y ) =

       ,

y2     y3 + y4

      y1 + y3     y4
          .

       and f (y ) = m y =
         x1 + x3     x4 + y1 + y3     y4
            x1 + y1

x2     x3 + x4 + y2     y3 + y4

             ,

0

x2 + y2
x3 + y3
x4 + y4

x + y =

37

next we perform the    rst computation beginning with:

from which we calculate

f (x + y ) =

         x1 + y2 + x3 + y3     (x4 + y4)
          .

x2 + y2     (x3 + y3) + x4 + y4

0

distributing the minus signs and remembering that the order of adding numbers like
x1, x2, . . . does not matter, we see that the two computations give exactly the same
answer.

of course, you should complain that we took a special choice of    and   . actually,
it is your job to

to take care of this we only need to check that f (  x) =   f (x).
explain this in review question 1

later we will show that id127 is always linear. then we

will know that:

m (  x +   y ) =   m x +   m y

then the two equations m x = v and x = x0 +   1y1 +   2y2 together say
that:

m x0 +   1m y1 +   2m y2 = v
for any   1,   2     r. choosing   1 =   2 = 0, we obtain

m x0 = v .

here, x0 is an example of what is called a particular solution to the system.
given the particular solution to the system, we can then deduce that
  1m y1 +   2m y2 = 0. setting   1 = 1,   2 = 0, and recalling the particular
solution m x0 = v , we obtain

likewise, setting   1 = 0,   1 = 0, we obtain

m y1 = 0 .

m y2 = 0 .

here y1 and y2 are examples of what are called homogeneous solutions to
the system. they do not solve the original equation m x = v , but instead
its associated homogeneous system of equations m y = 0.

38

example consider the linear system with the augmented matrix we   ve been working
with.

recall that the system has the following solution set:

notice how adding any multiple of a homogeneous solution to the particular solution
yields another particular solution.

de   nition let m a matrix and v a vector. given the linear system m x =
v , we call x0 a particular solution if m x0 = v . we call y a homogeneous
solution if m y = 0. the linear system

is called the (associated) homogeneous system.

m x = 0

if x0 is a particular solution, then the general solution to the system is1:
1the notation s = {x0 + y : m y = 0} is read,    s is the set of all x0 + y such that

m y = 0,    and means exactly that. sometimes a pipe | is used instead of a colon.

39

s = {x0 + y : m y = 0}

in other words, the general solution = particular + homogeneous.

5 vectors in space, n-vectors

in vector calculus classes, you encountered three-dimensional vectors. now
we will develop the notion of n-vectors and learn some of their properties.

overview

we begin by looking at the space rn, which we can think of as the space
of points with n coordinates. we then specify an origin o, a favorite point
in rn. now given any other point p , we can draw a vector v from o to p .
just as in r3, a vector has a magnitude and a direction.

if o has coordinates (o1, . . . , on) and p has coordinates (p1, . . . , pn), then

               p1     o1

p2     o2

pn     on

...

               . this construction allows us

the components of the vector v are

to put the origin anywhere that seems most convenient in rn, not just at the
point with zero coordinates:

remark a quick note on points versus vectors. we might sometimes interpret a point
and a vector as the same object, but they are slightly di   erent concepts and should
be treated as such. for more details, see appendix d

do not be confused by our use of a superscript to label components of a vector.
here v2 denotes the second component of a vector v, rather than a number v
squared!

43

most importantly, we can add vectors and multiply vectors by a scalar:

de   nition given two vectors a and b whose components are given by

their sum is

given a scalar   , the scalar multiple

notice that these are the same rules we saw in lecture 4! in lectures 1-4,
we thought of a vector as being a list of numbers which captured information
about a linear system. now we are thinking of a vector as a magnitude and
a direction in rn, and luckily the same rules apply.

a special vector is the zero vector connecting the origin to itself. all
of its components are zero. notice that with respect to the usual notions
of euclidean geometry, it is the only vector with zero magnitude, and the
only one which points in no particular direction. thus, any single vector

44

determines a line, except the zero-vector. any scalar multiple of a non-zero
vector lies in the line determined by that vector.

the line determined by a non-zero vector v through a point p can be

                     
            1
             + t

                      describes

written as {p + tv|t     r}. for example,

a line in 4-dimensional space parallel to the x-axis.

given two non-zero vectors u, v, they will usually determine a plane,

unless both vectors are in the same line. in this case, one of the vectors can
be realized as a scalar multiple of the other. the sum of u and v corresponds
to laying the two vectors head-to-tail and drawing the connecting vector. if u
and v determine a plane, then their sum lies in plane determined by u and v.

the plane determined by two vectors u and v can be written as

{p + su + tv|s, t     r} .

describes a plane in 6-dimensional space parallel to the xy-plane.

parametric notation

we can generalize the notion of a plane:

de   nition a set of k vectors v1, . . . , vk in rn with k     n determines a
k-dimensional hyperplane, unless any of the vectors vi lives in the same hy-
perplane determined by the other vectors.
if the vectors do determine a
k-dimensional hyperplane, then any point in the hyperplane can be written
as:

k(cid:88)

{p +

  ivi|  i     r}

when the dimension k is not speci   ed, one usually assumes that k = n     1
for a hyperplane inside rn.

i=1

5.1 directions and magnitudes

consider the euclidean length of a vector:

(cid:107)v(cid:107) =(cid:112)(v1)2 + (v2)2 +        (vn)2 =

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) n(cid:88)

(vi)2 .

i=1

using the law of cosines, we can then    gure out the angle between two
vectors. given two vectors v and u that span a plane in rn, we can then
connect the ends of v and u with the vector v     u.

46

then the law of cosines states that:

(cid:107)v     u(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)u(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)v(cid:107)2     2(cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107) cos   

then isolate cos   :

(cid:107)v     u(cid:107)2     (cid:107)u(cid:107)2     (cid:107)v(cid:107)2 = (v1     u1)2 +        + (vn     un)2
   ((u1)2 +        + (un)2)
   ((v1)2 +        + (vn)2)

=    2u1v1                2unvn

thus,

(cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107) cos    = u1v1 +        + unvn .

note that in the above discussion, we have assumed (correctly) that eu-
clidean lengths in rn give the usual notion of lengths of vectors in the plane.
this now motivates the de   nition of the dot product.

the angle    between two vectors is determined by the formula

u v = (cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107) cos    .

the dot product has some important properties:

1. the dot product is symmetric, so

u v = v u ,

2. distributive so

u (v + w) = u v + u w ,

and u u = 0 only when u itself is the 0-vector.

there are, in fact, many di   erent useful ways to de   ne lengths of vectors.
notice in the de   nition above that we    rst de   ned the dot product, and then
de   ned everything else in terms of the dot product. so if we change our idea
of the dot product, we change our notion of length and angle as well. the
dot product determines the euclidean length and angle between two vectors.
other de   nitions of length and angle arise from inner products, which
have all of the properties listed above (except that in some contexts the
positive de   nite requirement is relaxed). instead of writing for other inner
products, we usually write (cid:104)u, v(cid:105) to avoid confusion.

example consider a four-dimensional space, with a special direction which we will
call    time   . the lorentzian inner product on r4 is given by (cid:104)u, v(cid:105) = u1v1 + u2v2 +
u3v3     u4v4. this is of central importance in einstein   s theory of special relativity, but
note that it is not positive de   nite.
as a result, the    squared-length    of a vector with coordinates x, y, z and t is
(cid:107)v(cid:107)2 = x2 + y2 + z2     t2. notice that it is possible for (cid:107)v(cid:107)2     0 for non-vanishing v!

|(cid:104)u, v(cid:105)|
(cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107)     1

proof. the easiest proof would use the de   nition of the angle between two
vectors and the fact that cos        1. however, strictly speaking speaking we
did not check our assumption that we could apply the law of cosines to the

48

euclidean length in rn. there is, however a simple algebraic proof. let    be
any real number and consider the following positive, quadratic polynomial
in   

0     (cid:104)u +   v, u +   v(cid:105) = (cid:104)u, u(cid:105) + 2  (cid:104)u, v(cid:105) +   2(cid:104)v, v(cid:105) .

you should carefully check for yourself exactly which properties of an inner
product were used to write down the above inequality!

now it is easy to rearrange this inequality to reach the cauchy   schwarz one
above.

theorem 5.2 (triangle inequality). given vectors u and v, we have:

(cid:107)u + v(cid:107)     (cid:107)u(cid:107) + (cid:107)v(cid:107)

proof.

(cid:107)u + v(cid:107)2 = (u + v) (u + v)

= u u + 2u v + v v
= (cid:107)u(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)v(cid:107)2 + 2(cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107) cos   
= ((cid:107)u(cid:107) + (cid:107)v(cid:107))2 + 2(cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107)(cos        1)
    ((cid:107)u(cid:107) + (cid:107)v(cid:107))2

then the square of the left-hand side of the triangle inequality is     the
right-hand side, and both sides are positive, so the result is true.

6 vector spaces
thus far we have thought of vectors as lists of numbers in rn. as it turns
out, the notion of a vector applies to a much more general class of structures
than this. the main idea is to de   ne vectors based on their most important
properties. once complete, our new de   nition of vectors will include vectors
in rn, but will also cover many other extremely useful notions of vectors.
we do this in the hope of creating a mathematical structure applicable to a
wide range of real-world problems.

the two key properties of vectors are that they can be added together

and multiplied by scalars. so we make the following de   nition.
de   nition a vector space (over r) is a set v with two operations + and   
satisfying the following properties for all u, v     v and c, d     r:
(+i) (additive closure) u + v     v . (adding two vectors gives a vector.)

(+ii) (additive commutativity) u + v = v + u. (order of addition doesn   t

matter.)

(+iii) (additive associativity) (u + v) + w = u + (v + w) (order of adding

many vectors doesn   t matter.)

(+iv) (zero) there is a special vector 0v     v such that u + 0v = u for all u

in v .

(+v) (additive inverse) for every u     v there exists w     v such that

u + w = 0v .

(   i) (multiplicative closure) c    v     v . (scalar times a vector is a vector.)
(   ii) (distributivity) (c+d)  v = c  v +d  v. (scalar multiplication distributes

over addition of scalars.)

(   iii) (distributivity) c  (u+v) = c  u+c  v. (scalar multiplication distributes

over addition of vectors.)

(   iv) (associativity) (cd)    v = c    (d    v).
(   v) (unity) 1    v = v for all v     v .

examples of each rule

remark don   t confuse the scalar product    with the dot product . the scalar product
is a function that takes a vector and a number and returns a vector. (in notation, this
can be written    : r   v     v .) on the other hand, the dot product takes two vectors
and returns a number. (in notation:
once the properties of a vector space have been veri   ed, we   ll just write scalar
multiplication with juxtaposition cv = c    v, though, to avoid confusing the notation.

: v    v     r.)

remark it isn   t hard to devise strange rules for addition or scalar multiplication that
break some or all of the rules listed above.

example of a vector space

one can also    nd many interesting vector spaces, such as the following.

example

v = {f | f : n     r}

here the vector space is the set of functions that take in a natural number n and return
a real number. the addition is just addition of functions: (f1+f2)(n) = f1(n)+f2(n).
scalar multiplication is just as simple: c    f (n) = cf (n).

we can think of these functions as in   nite sequences: f (0) is the    rst term, f (1)
is the second term, and so on. then for example the function f (n) = n3 would look
like this:

f = {0, 1, 8, 27, . . . , n3, . . .}.
thinking this way, v is the space of all in   nite sequences.

let   s check some axioms.

(+i) (additive closure) f1(n) + f2(n) is indeed a function n     r, since the sum of

two real numbers is a real number.

(+iv) (zero) we need to propose a zero vector. the constant zero function g(n) = 0

works because then f (n) + g(n) = f (n) + 0 = f (n).

the other axioms that should be checked come down to properties of the real

numbers.

reading homework: problem 6.1

example another very important example of a vector space is the space of all di   er-
entiable functions:

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

f | f : r     r,

d
dx

f exists

.

the addition is point-wise

(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x) ,

as is scalar multiplication

c    f (x) = cf (x) .

from calculus, we know that the sum of any two di   erentiable functions is dif-
ferentiable, since the derivative distributes over addition. a scalar multiple of a func-
tion is also di   erentiable, since the derivative commutes with scalar multiplication
( d
dx (cf ) = c d
dx f ). the zero function is just the function such that 0(x) = 0 for ev-
ery x. the rest of the vector space properties are inherited from addition and scalar
multiplication in r.

in fact, the set of functions with at least k derivatives is always a vector space, as

is the space of functions with in   nitely many derivatives.

vector spaces over other fields above, we de   ned vector spaces over the real
numbers. one can actually de   ne vector spaces over any    eld. a    eld is a collection
of    numbers    satisfying a number of properties.

one other example of a    eld is the complex numbers,

c =(cid:8)x + iy | i2 =    1, x, y     r(cid:9) .

in quantum physics, vector spaces over c describe all possible states a system of
particles can have.

for example,

v =

   down   . other states, like

are permissible, since the base    eld is the complex

polynomials. for example, the polynomial x2 + 1 doesn   t factor over the real numbers,
but over the complex numbers it factors into (x+i)(x   i). this property ends up having
very far-reaching consequences: often in mathematics problems that are very di   cult
when working over the real numbers become relatively simple when working over
the complex numbers. one example of this phenomenon occurs when diagonalizing
matrices, which we will learn about later in the course.

another useful    eld is the rational numbers q. this is    eld is important in com-
puter algebra: a real number given by an in   nite string of numbers after the decimal
point can   t be stored by a computer. so instead rational approximations are used.
since the rationals are a    eld, the mathematics of vector spaces still apply to this
special case.
in this class, we will work mainly over the real numbers and the complex numbers,
and occasionally work over z2 = {0, 1} where 1 + 1 = 0. for more on    elds in
general, see appendix e.3; however the full story of    elds is typically covered in a class
on abstract algebra or galois theory.

7 linear transformations

recall that the key properties of vector spaces are vector addition and scalar
multiplication. now suppose we have two vector spaces v and w and a map
l between them:

l : v     w

now, both v and w have notions of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
it would be ideal if the map l preserved these operations. in other words,
if adding vectors and then applying l were the same as applying l to two
vectors and then adding them. likewise, it would be nice if, when multiplying
by a scalar, it didn   t matter whether we multiplied before or after applying l.
in formulas, this means that for any u, v     v and c     r:

l(u + v) = l(u) + l(v)

l(cv) = cl(v)

combining these two requirements into one equation, we get the de   nition

of a linear function or linear transformation.
de   nition a function l : v     w is linear if for all u, v     v and r, s     r
we have

l(ru + sv) = rl(u) + sl(v)

notice that on the left the addition and scalar multiplication occur in v ,
while on the right the operations occur in w . this is often called the linearity
property of a linear transformation.

a linear and non-linear example

example let v be the vector space of polynomials of    nite degree with standard
addition and scalar multiplication.

foreshadowing dimension. you probably have some intuitive notion of what dimen-
sion means, though we haven   t actually de   ned the idea of dimension mathematically
yet. some of the examples of vector spaces we have worked with have been    nite
dimensional. (for example, rn will turn out to have dimension n.) the polynomial
example above is an example of an in   nite dimensional vector space.

roughly speaking, dimension is the number of independent directions available.
to    gure out dimension, i stand at the origin, and pick a direction.
if there are any
vectors in my vector space that aren   t in that direction, then i choose another direction
that isn   t in the line determined by the direction i chose.
if there are any vectors in
my vector space not in the plane determined by the    rst two directions, then i choose
one of them as my next direction. in other words, i choose a collection of independent
vectors in the vector space. the size of a minimal set of independent vectors is the
dimension of the vector space.

for    nite dimensional vector spaces, linear transformations can always be repre-
sented by matrices. for that reason, we will start studying matrices intensively in the
next few lectures.

matrices are a very useful and e   cient way to store information:

example in computer graphics, you may have encountered image    les with a .gif
extension. these    les are actually just matrices: at the start of the    le the size of the
matrix is given, and then each entry of the matrix is a number indicating the color of
a particular pixel in the image.

the resulting matrix then has its rows shu   ed a bit: by listing, say, every eighth
row, then a web browser downloading the    le can start displaying an incomplete version
of the picture before the download is complete.

finally, a compression algorithm is applied to the matrix to reduce the size of the

   le.

adjacency matrix example

example graphs occur in many applications, ranging from telephone networks to
airline routes.
in the subject of id207 , a graph is just a collection of vertices
and some edges connecting vertices. a matrix can be used to indicate how many edges
attach one vertex to another.

for example, the graph pictured above would have the following matrix, where mi
j
indicates the number of edges between the vertices labeled i and j:

            
            1 2 1 1

2 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 3

k is a vector space with the addition and

scalar multiplication de   ned as follows:

m + n = (mi

in other words, addition just adds corresponding entries in two matrices, and
1 = rn is just the
scalar multiplication multiplies every entry. notice that m n
vector space of column vectors.

recall that we can multiply an r    k matrix by a k    1 column vector to

produce a r    1 column vector using the rule

m v =(cid:0) k(cid:88)

jvj(cid:1) .

j=1

this suggests a rule for multiplying an r  k matrix m by a k  s matrix n :
our k  s matrix n consists of s column vectors side-by-side, each of dimension
k   1. we can multiply our r   k matrix m by each of these s column vectors
using the rule we already know, obtaining s column vectors each of dimension
r    1. if we place these s column vectors side-by-side, we obtain an r    s
matrix m n.

that is, let

n =

               n1
                , n2 =

and call the columns n1 through ns:

then

m n = m

notice that in order for the multiplication to make sense, the columns
and rows must match. for an r    k matrix m and an s    m matrix n , then
to make the product m n we must have k = s. likewise, for the product
n m , it is required that m = r. a common shorthand for keeping track of
the sizes of the matrices involved in a given product is:

example multiplying a (3    1) matrix and a (1    2) matrix yields a (3    2) matrix.

any r    r matrix is called a square matrix . a square matrix that is zero

for all non-diagonal entries is called a diagonal matrix.

66

the r    r diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries equal to 1 is called

the identity matrix , ir, or just 1. an identity matrix looks like

                     

1 0 0        0

observations

   only square matrices can be symmetric.

   the transpose of a column vector is a row vector, and vice-versa.

   taking the transpose of a matrix twice does nothing. i.e., (m t )t = m .

theorem 8.1 (transpose and multiplication). let m, n be matrices such
that m n makes sense. then (m n )t = n t m t .

the proof of this theorem is left to review question 2.
sometimes matrices do not share the properties of regular numbers, watch

this video to see why:

matrices do not commute

many properties of matrices following from the same property for real

numbers. here is an example.

example associativity of id127. we know for real numbers x, y
and z that

x(yz) = (xy)z ,

the order of bracketing does not matter. the same property holds for matrix
i.e.
are, respectively, m    n, n    r and r    t matrices. then from the rule for matrix
multiplication we have

multiplication, let us show why. suppose m = (cid:0)mi
(cid:1), n = (cid:0)nj
(cid:17)
(cid:16) r(cid:88)

(cid:1) and r = (cid:0)rk

m n =

(cid:104) n(cid:88)

in the    rst step we just wrote out the de   nition for id127, in the second
step we moved summation symbol outside the bracket (this is just the distributive
property x(y +z) = xy +xz for numbers) and in the last step we used the associativity
property for real numbers to remove the square brackets. exactly the same reasoning
shows that

(cid:16) n(cid:88)

reading homework: problem 9.1

   there are many ways to cut up an n    n matrix into blocks. often
context or the entries of the matrix will suggest a useful way to divide
the matrix into blocks. for example, if there are large blocks of zeros
in a matrix, or blocks that look like an identity matrix, it can be useful
to partition the matrix accordingly.

   matrix operations on block matrices can be carried out by treating the

blocks as matrix entries. in the example above,

this is exactly m 2.

9.2 the algebra of square matrices

not every pair of matrices can be multiplied. when multiplying two matrices,
the number of rows in the left matrix must equal the number of columns in
the right. for an r    k matrix m and an s    l matrix n , then we must
have k = s.
this is not a problem for square matrices of the same size, though. two
n  n matrices can be multiplied in either order. for a single matrix m     m n
n ,
we can form m 2 = m m , m 3 = m m m , and so on, and de   ne m 0 = in, the
identity matrix.

as a result, any polynomial equation can be evaluated on a matrix.

example let f (x) = x     2x2 + 3x3.

let m =

suppose f (x) is any function de   ned by a convergent taylor series:

f (x) = f (0) + f(cid:48)(0)x +

f(cid:48)(cid:48)(0)x2 +

then we can de   ne the matrix function by just plugging in m :

f (m ) = f (0) + f(cid:48)(0)m +

f(cid:48)(cid:48)(0)m 2 +

there are additional techniques to determine the convergence of taylor series
of matrices, based on the fact that the convergence problem is simple for
diagonal matrices. it also turns out that exp(m ) = 1+m + 1
always converges.

matrix exponential example

id127 does not commute. for generic n    n square matrices m
and n , then m n (cid:54)= n m . for example:

on the other hand:

since n    n matrices are linear transformations rn     rn, we can see that the
order of successive linear transformations matters. for two linear transformations k
and l taking rn     rn, and v     rn, then in general
k(l(v)) (cid:54)= l(k(v)) .

finding matrices such that m n = n m is an important problem in mathematics.

also shows matrices not commuting.

perform rotations by an angle    in the xy and yz planes, respectively. because, they
rotate single vectors, you can also use them to rotate objects built from a collection of
vectors like pretty colored blocks! here is a picture of m and then n acting on such
a block, compared with the case of n followed by m . the special case of    = 90    is
shown.

notice how the end product of m n and n m are di   erent, so m n (cid:54)= n m here.

trace

matrices contain a great deal of information, so    nding ways to extract es-
sential information is useful. here we need to assume that n <     otherwise
there are subtleties with convergence that we   d have to address.

10.1 three properties of the inverse

1. if a is a square matrix and b is the inverse of a, then a is the inverse

of b, since ab = i = ba. then we have the identity:

(a   1)   1 = a

2. notice that b   1a   1ab = b   1ib = i = abb   1a   1. then:

(ab)   1 = b   1a   1

then much like the transpose, taking the inverse of a product reverses
the order of the product.

3. finally, recall that (ab)t = bt at . since i t = i, then (a   1a)t =

at (a   1)t = i. similarly, (aa   1)t = (a   1)t at = i. then:

(a   1)t = (at )   1

80

as such, we could even write a   t for the inverse of the transpose of a
(or equivalently the transpose of the inverse).

10.2 finding inverses

suppose m is a square matrix and m x = v is a linear system with unique
solution x0. since there is a unique solution, m   1v , then the reduced row
echelon form of the linear system has an identity matrix on the left:

(cid:0)m v(cid:1)    (cid:0)i m   1v(cid:1)

solving the linear system m x = v then tells us what m   1v is.

to solve many linear systems at once, we can consider augmented matrices
with a matrix on the right side instead of a column vector, and then apply
gaussian row reduction to the left side of the matrix. once the identity
matrix is on the left side of the augmented matrix, then the solution of each
of the individual linear systems is on the right.

to compute m   1, we would like m   1, rather than m   1v to appear on
the right side of our augmented matrix. this is achieved by solving the
collection of systems m x = ek, where ek is the column vector of zeroes with
a 1 in the kth entry. i.e., the n   n identity matrix can be viewed as a bunch
of column vectors in = (e1 e2        en). so, putting the ek   s together into an

identity matrix, we get:(cid:0)m i(cid:1)    (cid:0)i m   1i(cid:1) =(cid:0)i m   1(cid:1)

10.4 homogeneous systems

theorem 10.1. a square matrix m is invertible if and only if the homoge-
neous system

m x = 0

has no non-zero solutions.
proof. first, suppose that m   1 exists. then m x = 0     x = m   10 = 0.
thus, if m is invertible, then m x = 0 has no non-zero solutions.

on the other hand, m x = 0 always has the solution x = 0. if no other
solutions exist, then m can be put into reduced row echelon form with every
variable a pivot. in this case, m   1 can be computed using the process in the
previous section.

a great test of your id202 knowledge is to make a list of conditions
for a matrix to be singular. you will learn more of these as the course goes
by, but can also skip straight to the list in section 24.1.

10.5 bit matrices

in computer science, information is recorded using binary strings of data.
for example, the following string contains an english word:

011011000110100101101110011001010110000101110010

a bit is the basic unit of information, keeping track of a single one or zero.
computers can add and multiply individual bits very quickly.
consider the set z2 = {0, 1} with addition and multiplication given by

the following tables:

+ 0 1
0 1
0
1 0
1
notice that    1 = 1, since 1 + 1 = 0.

   0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1

it turns out that z2 is almost as good as the real or complex numbers
(they are all    elds), so we can apply all of the id202 we have learned
thus far to matrices with z2 entries. a matrix with entries in z2 is sometimes
called a bit matrix 3.

application: cryptography a very simple way to hide information is to use a sub-
stitution cipher, in which the alphabet is permuted and each letter in a message is
systematically exchanged for another. for example, the rot-13 cypher just exchanges
a letter with the letter thirteen places before or after it in the alphabet. for example,
hello becomes uryyb. applying the algorithm again decodes the message, turning

uryyb back into hello. substitution ciphers are easy to break, but the basic idea
can be extended to create cryptographic systems that are practically uncrackable. for
example, a one-time pad is a system that uses a di   erent substitution for each letter
in the message. so long as a particular set of substitutions is not used on more than
one message, the one-time pad is unbreakable.

english characters are often stored in computers in the ascii format.

in ascii,
a single character is represented by a string of eight bits, which we can consider as a
vector in z8
2 (which is like vectors in r8, where the entries are zeros and ones). one
way to create a substitution cipher, then, is to choose an 8    8 invertible bit matrix
m , and multiply each letter of the message by m . then to decode the message, each
string of eight characters would be multiplied by m   1.

to make the message a bit tougher to decode, one could consider pairs (or longer
(or a higher-dimensional space), and

sequences) of letters as a single vector in z16
then use an appropriately-sized invertible matrix.

diagonal are zero. in notation, l = (li

   u is upper triangular . this means that all entries below the main

diagonal are zero. in notation, u = (ui

j) with ui

j = 0 for all j < i.

m = lu is called an lu decomposition of m .

this is a useful trick for many computational reasons. it is much easier
to compute the inverse of an upper or lower triangular matrix. since inverses
are useful for solving linear systems, this makes solving any linear system
associated to the matrix much faster as well. the determinant   a very im-
portant quantity associated with any square matrix   is very easy to compute
for triangular matrices.

angular matrices, forward substitution gives the solution.

v
w

   step 1: set w =

   step 2: solve the system lw = v . this should be simple by forward
substitution since l is lower triangular. suppose the solution to lw =
v is w0.

   step 3: now solve the system u x = w0. this should be easy by
backward substitution, since u is upper triangular. the solution to
this system is the solution to the original system.

we can think of this as using the matrix l to perform row operations on the
matrix u in order to solve the system; this idea also appears in the study of
determinants.

11.2 finding an lu decomposition.

for any given matrix, there are actually many di   erent lu decompositions.
however, there is a unique lu decomposition in which the l matrix has ones
on the diagonal; then l is called a lower unit triangular matrix .

to    nd the lu decomposition, we   ll create two sequences of matrices
l0, l1, . . . and u0, u1, . . . such that at each step, liui = m . each of the li
will be lower triangular, but only the last ui will be upper triangular.

start by setting l0 = i and u0 = m , because l0u0 = m . a main concept

of this calculation is captured by the following example:

here the matrix on the left is lower triangular, while the matrix on the right has had
a row operation performed on it.

we would like to use the    rst row of u0 to zero out the    rst entry of every

row below it. for our running example,

u0 = m =

       ,

if the matrix you   re working with has more than three rows, just continue
this process by zeroing out the next column below the diagonal, and repeat
until there   s nothing left to do.

another lu decomposition example

the fractions in the l matrix are admittedly ugly. for two matrices
lu , we can multiply one entire column of l by a constant    and divide the
corresponding row of u by the same constant without changing the product
of the two matrices. then:

for matrices that are not square, lu decomposition still makes sense.
given an m    n matrix m , for example we could write m = lu with l
a square lower unit triangular matrix, and u a rectangular matrix. then
l will be an m    m matrix, and u will be an m    n matrix (of the same
shape as m ). from here, the process is exactly the same as for a square
matrix. we create a sequence of matrices li and ui that is eventually the
lu decomposition. again, we start with l0 = i and u0 = m .

(cid:18)   2 1 3

(cid:19)

example let   s    nd the lu decomposition of m = u0 =
. since m is
a 2    3 matrix, our decomposition will consist of a 2    2 matrix and a 2    3 matrix.
then we start with l0 = i2 =

(cid:18)1 0

   4 4 1

(cid:19)

.

the next step is to zero-out the    rst column of m below the diagonal. there is
only one row to cancel, then, and it can be removed by subtracting 2 times the    rst
row of m to the second row of m . then:

l1 =

u1 =

since u1 is upper triangular, we   re done. with a larger matrix, we would just continue
the process.

11.3 block ldu decomposition
let m be a square block matrix with square blocks x, y, z, w such that x   1
exists. then m can be decomposed as a block ldu decomposition, where
d is block diagonal, as follows:

(cid:18)x y

(cid:19)

this can be checked explicitly simply by block-multiplying these three ma-
trices.

12 elementary matrices and determinants

given a square matrix, is there an easy way to know when it is invertible?
answering this fundamental question is our next goal.
for small cases, we already know the answer. if m is a 1   1 matrix, then
m = (m)     m   1 = (1/m). then m is invertible if and only if m (cid:54)= 0.

for m a 2    2 matrix, we showed in section 10 that if m =

12.1 permutations

consider n objects labeled 1 through n and shu   e them. each possible
shu   e is called a permutation   . for example, here is an example of a
permutation of 5:

(cid:20)1 2 3 4 5

(cid:21)

4 2 5 1 3

   =

we can consider a permutation    as a function from the set of numbers
[n] := {1, 2, . . . , n} to [n], and write   (3) = 5 from the above example. in

general we can write (cid:20) 1

(cid:21)

2

3

4

5

  (1)   (2)   (3)   (4)   (5),

but since the top line of any permutation is always the same, we can omit
the top line and just write:

   =(cid:2)  (1)   (2)   (3)   (4)   (5)(cid:3)

so we can just write    = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]. there is also one more notation called
cycle notation, but we do not discuss it here.

the mathematics of permutations is extensive and interesting; there are

a few properties of permutations that we   ll need.

   there are n! permutations of n distinct objects, since there are n choices
for the    rst object, n     1 choices for the second once the    rst has been
chosen, and so on.

   every permutation can be built up by successively swapping pairs of

objects. for example, to build up the permutation(cid:2)3 1 2(cid:3) from the
trivial permutation (cid:2)1 2 3(cid:3), you can    rst swap 2 and 3, and then

swap 1 and 3.

   for any given permutation   , there is some number of swaps it takes to
build up the permutation. (it   s simplest to use the minimum number of
swaps, but you don   t have to: it turns out that any way of building up
the permutation from swaps will have have the same parity of swaps,
either even or odd.)
if this number happens to be even, then    is
called an even permutation; if this number is odd, then    is an odd
permutation. in fact, n! is even for all n     2, and exactly half of the

97

permutations are even and the other half are odd. it   s worth noting
that the trivial permutation (which sends i     i for every i) is an even
permutation, since it uses zero swaps.

de   nition the sign function is a function sgn(  ) that sends permutations
to the set {   1, 1}, de   ned by:

(cid:26) 1

sgn(  ) =

if    is even;
   1 if    is odd.

(cid:88)

for more on the swaps (also known as inversions) and the sign function,

see problem 4.

permutation example

reading homework: problem 12.1

we can use permutations to give a de   nition of the determinant.

de   nition for an n   n matrix m , the determinant of m (sometimes writ-
ten |m|) is given by:

det m =

sgn(  ) m1

  (1)m2

  (2)        mn

  (n).

  

the sum is over all permutations of n. each summand is a product of a
single entry from each row, but with the column numbers shu   ed by the
permutation   .

the last statement about the summands yields a nice property of the

determinant:

theorem 12.1. if m has a row consisting entirely of zeros, then mi
for every   . then det m = 0.

  (i) = 0

example because there are many permutations of n, writing the determinant this way
for a general matrix gives a very long sum. for n = 4, there are 24 = 4! permutations,
and for n = 5, there are already 120 = 5! permutations.

98

this is very cumbersome.

(cid:88)

luckily, it is very easy to compute the determinants of certain matrices.
j = 0 whenever i (cid:54)= j. then all

for example, if m is diagonal, then m i
summands of the determinant involving o   -diagonal entries vanish, so:

det m =

sgn(  )m1

  (1)m2

  (2)        mn

  (n) = m1

1m2

2        mn
n.

  

thus, the determinant of a diagonal matrix is just the product of its diagonal
entries.

since the identity matrix is diagonal with all diagonal entries equal to

one, we have:

det i = 1.

we would like to use the determinant to decide whether a matrix is invert-
ible or not. previously, we computed the inverse of a matrix by applying row
operations. as such, it makes sense to ask what happens to the determinant
when row operations are applied to a matrix.

swapping rows swapping rows i and j (with i < j) in a matrix changes the determi-
nant. for a permutation   , let      be the permutation obtained by swapping positions
i and j. the sign of      is the opposite of the sign of   . let m be a matrix, and m(cid:48)
be the same matrix, but with rows i and j swapped. then the determinant of m(cid:48) is:

det m(cid:48) =

thus we see that swapping rows changes the sign of the determinant. i.e.

m(cid:48) =     det m .

reading homework: problem 12.2

applying this result to m = i (the identity matrix) yields

det ei

j =    1 ,

where the matrix ei
example of an elementary matrix and we will meet it again soon.

j is the identity matrix with rows i and j swapped. it is our    rst

this implies another nice property of the determinant. if two rows of the matrix
are identical, then swapping the rows changes the sign of the matrix, but leaves the
matrix unchanged. then we see the following:

theorem 12.2. if m has two identical rows, then det m = 0.

12.2 elementary matrices

our next goal is to    nd matrices that emulate the gaussian row operations
on a matrix. in other words, for any matrix m , and a matrix m(cid:48) equal to m
after a row operation, we wish to    nd a matrix r such that m(cid:48) = rm .

see some ideas explained

we will    rst    nd a matrix that, when it multiplies a matrix m , rows i

and j of m are swapped.

100

let r1 through rn denote the rows of m , and let m(cid:48) be the matrix m
with rows i and j swapped. then m and m(cid:48) can be regarded as a block
matrices:

                         , and m(cid:48) =

because det i = 1 and swapping a pair of rows changes the sign of the
determinant, we have found that

det ei

j =    1 .

101

moreover, since swapping a pair of rows    ips the sign of the determinant,
j =    1 and det ei
jm is the matrix m with rows i and j swapped we

det ei
have that

det ei

jm = det ei

j det m .

this result hints at an even better one for determinants of products of

determinants. stare at it again before reading the next lecture:

4. this problem is a    hands-on    look at why the property describing the

parity of permutations is true.

the inversion number of a permutation    is the number of pairs i <
j such that   (i) >   (j);
it   s the number of    numbers that appear
left of smaller numbers    in the permutation. for example, for the
permutation    = [4, 2, 3, 1], the inversion number is 5. the number 4
comes before 2, 3, and 1, and 2 and 3 both come before 1.

problem 4 hints

5. (extra credit) here we will examine a (very) small set of the general
properties about permutations and their applications.
in particular,
we will show that one way to compute the sign of a permutation is by
   nding the inversion number n of    and we have

sgn(  ) = (   1)n .

for this problem, let    = [1, 2, 4, 3].

(a) show that every permutation    can be sorted by only taking sim-
ple (adjacent) transpositions si where si interchanges the numbers
in position i and i + 1 of a permutation    (in our other notation
si =   i,i+1). for example s2   = [1, 4, 2, 3], and to sort    we have
s3   = [1, 2, 3, 4].

(b) we can compose simple transpositions together to represent a per-
mutation (note that the sequence of compositions is not unique),
and these are associative, we have an identity (the trivial permu-
tation where the list is in order or we do nothing on our list), and
we have an inverse since it is clear that sisi   =   . thus permuta-
tions of [n] under composition are an example of a group. however

5the parity of an integer refers to whether the integer is even or odd. here the parity

of a permutation    refers to the parity of its inversion number.

104

note that not all simple transpositions commute with each other
since

s1s2[1, 2, 3] = s1[1, 3, 2] = [3, 1, 2]
s2s1[1, 2, 3] = s2[2, 1, 3] = [2, 3, 1]

(you will prove here when simple transpositions commute). when
we consider our initial permutation to be the trivial permutation
e = [1, 2, . . . , n], we do not write it; for example si     sie and
   = s3     s3e. this is analogous to not writing 1 when multiplying.
show that sisi = e (in shorthand s2
i = e), si+1sisi+1 = sisi+1si for
all i, and si and sj commute for all |i     j|     2.

(c) show that every way of expressing    can be obtained from using
the relations proved in part 5b.
in other words, show that for
any expression w of simple transpositions representing the trivial
permutation e, using the proved relations.
hint: use induction on n. for the induction step, follow the path
of the (n + 1)-th strand by looking at snsn   1        sksk  1        sn and
argue why you can write this as a subexpression for any expression
of e. consider using diagrams of these paths to help.

vectors v     v . therefore we can just represent a permutation
i+1) =    1.
   as the matrix m  
thus prove that det(m  ) = (   1)n where n is a number of simple
transpositions needed to represent    as a permutation. you can
assume that msisj = msimsj (it is not hard to prove) and that
det(ab) = det(a) det(b) from chapter 13.
hint: you to make sure det(m  ) is well-de   ned since there are
in   nite ways to represent    as simple transpositions.

(e) show that si+1sisi+1 =   i,i+2, and so give one way of writing   i,j
in terms of simple transpositions? is   i,j an even or an odd per-

13 elementary matrices and determinants ii

in lecture 12, we saw the de   nition of the determinant and derived an ele-
mentary matrix that exchanges two rows of a matrix. next, we need to    nd
elementary matrices corresponding to the other two row operations; multi-
plying a row by a scalar, and adding a multiple of one row to another. as a
consequence, we will derive some important properties of the determinant.

since ri(  ) is just the identity matrix with a single row multiplied by   ,

then by the above rule, the determinant of ri(  ) is   . thus:

the    nal row operation is adding   rj to ri. this is done with the

matrix si

we have seen that any matrix m can be put into reduced row echelon
form via a sequence of row operations, and we have seen that any row op-
eration can be emulated with left id127 by an elementary
matrix. suppose that rref(m ) is the reduced row echelon form of m .
then rref(m ) = e1e2        ekm where each ei is an elementary matrix.

what is the determinant of a square matrix in reduced row echelon form?

110

   if m is not invertible, then some row of rref(m ) contains only zeros.
then we can multiply the zero row by any constant    without chang-
ing m ; by our previous observation, this scales the determinant of m
by   . thus, if m is not invertible, det rref(m ) =    det rref(m ),
and so det rref(m ) = 0.

   otherwise, every row of rref(m ) has a pivot on the diagonal; since
m is square, this means that rref(m ) is the identity matrix. then
if m is invertible, det rref(m ) = 1.

   additionally, notice that det rref(m ) = det(e1e2        ekm ). then
by the theorem above, det rref(m ) = det(e1)       det(ek) det m . since
each ei has non-zero determinant, then det rref(m ) = 0 if and only
if det m = 0.

then we have shown:
theorem 13.2. for any square matrix m , det m (cid:54)= 0 if and only if m is
invertible.

since we know the determinants of the elementary matrices, we can im-

mediately obtain the following:

determinants and inverses

corollary 13.3. any elementary matrix ei
j(  ) is invertible, except
for ri(0). in fact, the inverse of an elementary matrix is another elementary
matrix.

j, ri(  ), si

to obtain one last important result, suppose that m and n are square
n    n matrices, with reduced row echelon forms such that, for elementary
matrices ei and fi,

m = e1e2        ek rref(m ) ,

111

and

n = f1f2        fl rref(n ) .

if rref(m ) is the identity matrix (i.e., m is invertible), then:

det(m n ) = det(e1e2        ek rref(m )f1f2        fl rref(n ))

= det(e1e2        ekif1f2        fl rref(n ))
= det(e1)       det(ek) det(i) det(f1)       det(fl) det(rref(n )
= det(m ) det(n )

otherwise, m is not invertible, and det m = 0 = det rref(m ). then there
exists a row of zeros in rref(m ), so rn(  ) rref(m ) = rref(m ). then:

det(m n ) = det(e1e2        ek rref(m )n )
= det(e1e2        ek rref(m )n )
= det(e1)       det(ek) det(rref(m )n )
= det(e1)       det(ek) det(rn(  ) rref(m )n )
= det(e1)       det(ek)   det(rref(m )n )
=    det(m n )

which implies that det(m n ) = 0 = det m det n .

thus we have shown that for any matrices m and n ,

det(m n ) = det m det n

this result is extremely important; do not forget it!

14 properties of the determinant

in lecture 13 we showed that the determinant of a matrix is non-zero if and
only if that matrix is invertible. we also showed that the determinant is a
multiplicative function, in the sense that det(m n ) = det m det n . now we
will devise some methods for calculating the determinant.

recall that:

det m =

(cid:88)

sgn(  )m1

  (1)m2

  (2)        mn

  (n).

  

a minor of an n    n matrix m is the determinant of any square matrix
obtained from m by deleting rows and columns. in particular, any entry mi
j
of a square matrix m is associated to a minor obtained by deleting the ith
row and jth column of m .

it is possible to write the determinant of a matrix in terms of its minors

as follows:

det m =

(cid:88)

  
= m1

    m1

+ m1

    (2)m4

    (4)        mn

    (n)          

    

here the symbols      refer to permutations of n    1 objects. what we   re doing
here is collecting up all of the terms of the original sum that contain the
   rst row entry m1
j for each column number j. each term in that collection
is associated to a permutation sending 1     j. the remainder of any such
permutation maps the set {2, . . . , n}     {1, . . . , j     1, j + 1, . . . , n}. we call

         (n)(cid:3).
this partial permutation      =(cid:2)  (2)
since j comes    rst in the permutation (cid:2)j   (2)

the last issue is that the permutation      may not have the same sign as   .
from previous homework, we know that a permutation has the same parity
as its inversion number. removing 1     j from a permutation reduces the
inversion number by the number of elements right of j that are less than j.

         (n)(cid:3), the inversion

row, then add (   1)j   1 times the determinant of the matrix with row i and
column j deleted.

in other words, to expand by minors we pick an entry m1

theorem 14.1. for any square matrix m , we have:

for any permutation   , there is a unique inverse permutation      1 that
undoes   . if    sends i     j, then      1 sends j     i. in the two-line notation
for a permutation, this corresponds to just    ipping the permutation over. for

since any permutation can be built up by transpositions, one can also    nd
the inverse of a permutation    by undoing each of the transpositions used to
build up   ; this shows that one can use the same number of transpositions
to build    and      1. in particular, sgn    = sgn      1.

the second-to-last equality is due to the existence of a unique inverse permu-

let   s multiply m adj m . for any matrix n , the i, j entry of m n is given
by taking the dot product of the ith row of m and the jth column of n .
notice that the dot product of the ith row of m and the ith column of adj m
is just the expansion by minors of det m in the ith row. further, notice that
the dot product of the ith row of m and the jth column of adj m with j (cid:54)= i
is the same as expanding m by minors, but with the jth row replaced by the
ith row. since the determinant of any matrix with a row repeated is zero,
then these dot products are zero as well.

we know that the i, j entry of the product of two matrices is the dot

product of the ith row of the    rst by the jth column of the second. then:

15 subspaces and spanning sets

it is time to study vector spaces more carefully and answer some fundamental
questions.

1. subspaces: when is a subset of a vector space itself a vector space?

(this is the notion of a subspace.)

2. linear independence: given a collection of vectors, is there a way to
tell whether they are independent, or if one is a    linear combination   
of the others?

3. dimension: is there a consistent de   nition of how    big    a vector space

is?

4. basis: how do we label vectors? can we write any vector as a sum of
some basic set of vectors? how do we change our point of view from
vectors labeled one way to vectors labeled in another way?

let   s start at the top!

15.1 subspaces

de   nition we say that a subset u of a vector space v is a subspace of v
if u is a vector space under the inherited addition and scalar multiplication
operations of v .
example consider a plane p in r3 through the origin:

ax + by + cz = 0.

124

       = 0,

c(cid:1)      x

y
z

this equation can be expressed as the homogeneous system(cid:0)a b
or m x = 0 with m the matrix (cid:0)a b

c(cid:1).

if x1 and x2 are both solutions to

m x = 0, then, by linearity of id127, so is   x1 +   x2:

m (  x1 +   x2) =   m x1 +   m x2 = 0.

so p is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. additionally, p contains the
origin (which can be derived from the above by setting    =    = 0). all other vector
space requirements hold for p because they hold for all vectors in r3.

theorem 15.1 (subspace theorem). let u be a non-empty subset of a
vector space v . then u is a subspace if and only if   u1 +   u2     u for
arbitrary u1, u2 in u , and arbitrary constants   ,   .

proof. one direction of this proof is easy: if u is a subspace, then it is a vector
space, and so by the additive closure and multiplicative closure properties of
vector spaces, it has to be true that   u1 +   u2     u for all u1, u2 in u and all
constants constants   ,   .
the other direction is almost as easy: we need to show that if   u1 +  u2    
u for all u1, u2 in u and all constants   ,   , then u is a vector space. that
is, we need to show that the ten properties of vector spaces are satis   ed.
we know that the additive closure and multiplicative closure properties are
satis   ed. each of the other eight properties is true in u because it is true in
v . the details of this are left as an exercise.

note that the requirements of the subspace theorem are often referred to as
   closure   .

125

from now on, we can use this theorem to check if a set is a vector space.
that is, if we have some set u of vectors that come from some bigger vector
space v , to check if u itself forms a smaller vector space we need check only
two things: if we add any two vectors in u , do we end up with a vector in
u ? and, if we multiply any vector in u by any constant, do we end up with
a vector in u ? if the answer to both of these questions is yes, then u is a
vector space. if not, u is not a vector space.

because u consists of only two vectors, it clear that u is not a vector space,
since any constant multiple of these vectors should also be in u . for example,
the 0-vector is not in u , nor is u closed under vector addition.

but we know that any two vectors de   ne a plane:

in this case, the vectors in u de   ne the xy-plane in r3. we can consider the
xy-plane as the set of all vectors that arise as a linear combination of the two
vectors in u . call this set of all linear combinations the span of u :

then the span of s is the set:

span(s) = {r1s1 + r2s2 +        + rn sn|ri     r, n     n}.

that is, the span of s is the set of all    nite linear combinations8 of elements
of s. any    nite sum of the form (a constant times s1 plus a constant times
s2 plus a constant times s3 and so on) is in the span of s.

so span(s) is the xy-plane, which is a vector space. (try drawing a picture to

verify this!)

lemma 15.2. for any subset s     v , span(s) is a subspace of v .

proof. we need to show that span(s) is a vector space.
it su   ces to show that span(s) is closed under linear combinations. let
u, v     span(s) and   ,    be constants. by the de   nition of span(s), there are
constants ci and di (some of which could be zero) such that:

u = c1s1 + c2s2 +       
v = d1s1 + d2s2 +       

      u +   v =   (c1s1 + c2s2 +        ) +   (d1s1 + d2s2 +        )

= (  c1 +   d1)s1 + (  c2 +   d2)s2 +       

this last sum is a linear combination of elements of s, and is thus in span(s).
then span(s) is closed under linear combinations, and is thus a subspace
of v .

note that this proof, like many proofs, consisted of little more than just

writing out the de   nitions.

therefore we should choose a so that m is invertible:

i.e., 0 (cid:54)= det m =    2a2 + 3 + a =    (2a     3)(a + 1).

then the span is r3 if and only if a (cid:54)=    1, 3

16 linear independence
consider a plane p that includes the origin in r3 and a collection {u, v, w}
of non-zero vectors in p :

if no two of u, v and w are parallel, then p = span{u, v, w}. but any two
vectors determines a plane, so we should be able to span the plane using
only two of the vectors u, v, w. then we could choose two of the vectors in
{u, v, w} whose span is p , and express the other as a linear combination of
those two. suppose u and v span p . then there exist constants d1, d2 (not
both zero) such that w = d1u + d2v. since w can be expressed in terms of u
and v we say that it is not independent. more generally, the relationship

c1u + c2v + c3w = 0

ci     r, some ci (cid:54)= 0

expresses the fact that u, v, w are not all independent.

de   nition we say that the vectors v1, v2, . . . , vn are linearly dependent if
there exist constants9 c1, c2, . . . , cn not all zero such that

c1v1 + c2v2 +        + cnvn = 0.

otherwise, the vectors v1, v2, . . . , vn are linearly independent.

9usually our vector spaces are de   ned over r, but in general we can have vector spaces
de   ned over di   erent base    elds such as c or z2. the coe   cients ci should come from
whatever our base    eld is (usually r).

this system has solutions if and only if the matrix m =(cid:0)v1 v2 v3

we should    nd the determinant of m :

c1, c2, c3 that satisfy the linear equation. so we can set    = 1 and obtain:

c1v1 + c2v2 + c3v3 = 0        2v1     v2 + v3 = 0.

theorem 16.1 (linear dependence). a set of non-zero vectors {v1, . . . , vn}
is linearly dependent if and only if one of the vectors vk is expressible as a
linear combination of the preceding vectors.

proof. the theorem is an if and only if statement, so there are two things to
show.

i. first, we show that if vk = c1v1 +        ck   1vk   1 then the set is linearly

dependent.

this is easy. we just rewrite the assumption:

c1v1 +        + ck   1vk   1     vk + 0vk+1 +        + 0vn = 0.

this is a vanishing linear combination of the vectors {v1, . . . , vn} with
not all coe   cients equal to zero, so {v1, . . . , vn} is a linearly dependent
set.

ii. now, we show that linear dependence implies that there exists k for

which vk is a linear combination of the vectors {v1, . . . , vk   1}.
the assumption says that

c1v1 + c2v2 +        + cnvn = 0.

take k to be the largest number for which ck is not equal to zero. so:

c1v1 + c2v2 +        + ck   1vk   1 + ckvk = 0.

(note that k > 1, since otherwise we would have c1v1 = 0     v1 = 0,
contradicting the assumption that none of the vi are the zero vector.)
as such, we can rearrange the equation:

c1v1 + c2v2 +        + ck   1vk   1 =    ckvk
ck v1     c2

ck v2                ck   1

ck vk   1 = vk.

        c1

133

therefore we have expressed vk as a linear combination of the previous
vectors, and we are done.

worked proof

example consider the vector space p2(t) of polynomials of degree less than or equal
to 2. set:

v1 = 1 + t
v2 = 1 + t2
v3 = t + t2
v4 = 2 + t + t2
v5 = 1 + t + t2.

the set {v1, . . . , v5} is linearly dependent, because v4 = v1 + v2.

we have seen two di   erent ways to show a set of vectors is linearly depen-
dent: we can either    nd a linear combination of the vectors which is equal
to zero, or we can express one of the vectors as a linear combination of the
other vectors. on the other hand, to check that a set of vectors is linearly
independent, we must check that every linear combination of our vectors with
non-vanishing coe   cients gives something other than the zero vector. equiv-
alently, to show that the set v1, v2, . . . , vn is linearly independent, we must
show that the equation c1v1 + c2v2 +        + cnvn = 0 has no solutions other
than c1 = c2 =        = cn = 0.

are they linearly independent?

we need to see whether the system

has any solutions for c1, c2, c3. we can rewrite this as a homogeneous system:

this system has solutions if and only if the matrix m =(cid:0)v1 v2 v3

(cid:1) is singular, so

we should    nd the determinant of m :

when we write a vector space as the span of a list of vectors, we would
like that list to be as short as possible (we will explore this idea further in
lecture 17). this can be achieved by iterating the above procedure.

135

example in the above example, we found that v4 = v1 + v2.
in this case, any
expression for a vector as a linear combination involving v4 can be turned into a
combination without v4 by making the substitution v4 = v1 + v2.

then:

s = span{1 + t, 1 + t2, t + t2, 2 + t + t2, 1 + t + t2}

= span{1 + t, 1 + t2, t + t2, 1 + t + t2}.
2 (1 + t2) + 1

2 (1 + t) + 1

now we notice that 1 + t + t2 = 1
2 (t + t2). so the vector
1 + t + t2 = v5 is also extraneous, since it can be expressed as a linear combination of
the remaining three vectors, v1, v2, v3. therefore

s = span{1 + t, 1 + t2, t + t2}.

in fact, you can check that there are no (non-zero) solutions to the linear system

c1(1 + t) + c2(1 + t2) + c3(t + t2) = 0.

therefore the remaining vectors {1 + t, 1 + t2, t + t2} are linearly independent, and
span the vector space s. then these vectors are a minimal spanning set, in the sense
that no more vectors can be removed since the vectors are linearly independent. such
a set is called a basis for s.

solutions exist if and only if the determinant of the matrix is non-zero. but:

if the set is linearly dependent, then we can    nd non-zero solutions to the system:

therefore non-trivial solutions exist, and the set is not linearly independent.

17 basis and dimension

in lecture 16, we established the notion of a linearly independent set of
vectors in a vector space v , and of a set of vectors that span v . we saw that
any set of vectors that span v can be reduced to some minimal collection of
linearly independent vectors; such a set is called a basis of the subspace v .

de   nition let v be a vector space. then a set s is a basis for v if s is
linearly independent and v = span s.

if s is a basis of v and s has only    nitely many elements, then we say
that v is    nite-dimensional. the number of vectors in s is the dimension
of v .

suppose v is a    nite-dimensional vector space, and s and t are two
di   erent bases for v . one might worry that s and t have a di   erent number
of vectors; then we would have to talk about the dimension of v in terms
of the basis s or in terms of the basis t . luckily this isn   t what happens.
later in this section, we will show that s and t must have the same number
of vectors. this means that the dimension of a vector space does not depend
on the basis. in fact, dimension is a very important way to characterize of
any vector space v .
example pn(t) has a basis {1, t, . . . , tn}, since every polynomial of degree less than
or equal to n is a sum

a0 1 + a1 t +        + an tn,

ai     r

so pn(t) = span{1, t, . . . , tn}. this set of vectors is linearly independent:
if the
polynomial p(t) = c01 + c1t +        + cntn = 0, then c0 = c1 =        = cn = 0, so p(t) is
the zero polynomial.

then pn(t) is    nite dimensional, and dim pn(t) = n + 1.

theorem 17.1. let s = {v1, . . . , vn} be a basis for a vector space v . then
every vector w     v can be written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors
in the basis s:

w = c1v1 +        + cnvn.

proof. since s is a basis for v , then span s = v , and so there exist con-
stants ci such that w = c1v1 +        + cnvn.

139

suppose there exists a second set of constants di such that

w = d1v1 +        + dnvn .

then:

0v = w     w

= c1v1 +        + cnvn     d1v1 +        + dnvn
= (c1     d1)v1 +        + (cn     dn)vn.

(cid:54)= di, then the equation reduces to 0 =
if it occurs exactly once that ci
(ci     di)vi, which is a contradiction since the vectors vi are assumed to be
non-zero.
if we have more than one i for which ci (cid:54)= di, we can use this last equation
to write one of the vectors in s as a linear combination of other vectors in s,
which contradicts the assumption that s is linearly independent. then for
every i, ci = di.

proof of theorem

next, we would like to establish a method for determining whether a
collection of vectors forms a basis for rn. but    rst, we need to show that
any two bases for a    nite-dimensional vector space has the same number of
vectors.
lemma 17.2. if s = {v1, . . . , vn} is a basis for a vector space v and t =
{w1, . . . , wm} is a linearly independent set of vectors in v , then m     n.

the idea of the proof is to start with the set s and replace vectors in s
one at a time with vectors from t , such that after each replacement we still
have a basis for v .

reading homework: problem 17.1

proof. since s spans v , then the set {w1, v1, . . . , vn} is linearly dependent.
then we can write w1 as a linear combination of the vi; using that equation,
we can express one of the vi in terms of w1 and the remaining vj with j (cid:54)=

140

i. then we can discard one of the vi from this set to obtain a linearly
independent set that still spans v . now we need to prove that s1 is a basis;
we need to show that s1 is linearly independent and that s1 spans v .
the set s1 = {w1, v1, . . . , vi   1, vi+1, . . . , vn} is linearly independent: by
the previous theorem, there was a unique way to express w1 in terms of
the set s. now, to obtain a contradiction, suppose there is some k and
constants ci such that

vk = c0w1 + c1v1 +        + ci   1vi   1 + ci+1vi+1 +        + cnvn.

then replacing w1 with its expression in terms of the collection s gives a way
to express the vector vk as a linear combination of the vectors in s, which
contradicts the linear independence of s. on the other hand, we cannot
express w1 as a linear combination of the vectors in {vj|j (cid:54)= i}, since the
expression of w1 in terms of s was unique, and had a non-zero coe   cient on
the vector vi. then no vector in s1 can be expressed as a combination of
other vectors in s1, which demonstrates that s1 is linearly independent.
the set s1 spans v : for any u     v , we can express u as a linear com-
bination of vectors in s. but we can express vi as a linear combination of
vectors in the collection s1; rewriting vi as such allows us to express u as a
linear combination of the vectors in s1.

and so on.
vi1, . . . , vin   m}, which is    ne.

then s1 is a basis of v with n vectors.
we can now iterate this process, replacing one of the vi in s1 with w2,
if m     n, this process ends with the set sm = {w1, . . . , wm,
otherwise, we have m > n, and the set sn = {w1, . . . , wn} is a basis
for v . but we still have some vector wn+1 in t that is not in sn. since sn
is a basis, we can write wn+1 as a combination of the vectors in sn, which

141

contradicts the linear independence of the set t . then it must be the case
that m     n, as desired.

worked example

corollary 17.3. for a    nite-dimensional vector space v , any two bases
for v have the same number of vectors.

proof. let s and t be two bases for v . then both are linearly independent
sets that span v . suppose s has n vectors and t has m vectors. then by
the previous lemma, we have that m     n. but (exchanging the roles of s
and t in application of the lemma) we also see that n     m. then m = n,
as desired.

rn = span

and that this set of vectors is linearly independent. so this set of vectors is
a basis for rn, and dim rn = n. this basis is often called the standard or
canonical basis for rn. the vector with a one in the ith position and zeros
everywhere else is written ei. it points in the direction of the ith coordinate
axis, and has unit length. in multivariable calculus classes, this basis is often
written {i, j, k} for r3.

note that it is often convenient to order basis elements, so rather than
writing a set of vectors, we would write a list. this is called an ordered
basis. for example, the canonical ordered basis for rn is (e1, e2, . . . , en). the
possibility to reorder basis vectors is not the only way in which bases are
non-unique:

142

bases are not unique. while there exists a unique way to express a vector in terms
of any particular basis, bases themselves are far from unique. for example, both of
the sets:

(cid:19)
(cid:26)(cid:18)1

(cid:19)(cid:27)
(cid:18)0

and

are bases for r2. rescaling any vector in one of these sets is already enough to show
that r2 has in   nitely many bases. but even if we require that all of the basis vectors
have unit length, it turns out that there are still in   nitely many bases for r2. (see
review question 3.)

to see whether a collection of vectors s = {v1, . . . , vm} is a basis for rn,
we have to check that they are linearly independent and that they span rn.
from the previous discussion, we also know that m must equal n, so assume s
has n vectors.

if s is linearly independent, then there is no non-trivial solution of the

equation

0 = x1v1 +        + xnvn.

let m be a matrix whose columns are the vectors vi. then the above equa-
tion is equivalent to requiring that there is a unique solution to

to see if s spans rn, we take an arbitrary vector w and solve the linear

system

w = x1v1 +        + xnvn

143

in the unknowns ci. for this, we need to    nd a unique solution for the linear
system m x = w.

thus, we need to show that m   1 exists, so that

x = m   1w

is the unique solution we desire. then we see that s is a basis for v if and
only if det m (cid:54)= 0.
theorem 17.4. let s = {v1, . . . , vm} be a collection of vectors in rn. let m
be the matrix whose columns are the vectors in s. then s is a basis for v if
and only if m is the dimension of v and

18 eigenvalues and eigenvectors

before discussing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we need to have a better un-
derstanding of the relationship between linear transformations and matrices.
consider, as an example the plane r2

the information of the vector v can be transmitted in many ways. in the
basis {e1, e2} it is the ordered pair (x, y) = (2, 2) while in the basis {f1, f2}
is corresponds to (s, t) = (2, 1). this can be confusing, the idea to keep
   rm in your mind is that the vector space and its elements   vectors   are
what really    exist   . typically they will correspond to con   gurations of the
real world system you are trying to describe. on the other hand, things like
coordinate axes and    components of a vector    (x, y) are just mathematical
tools used to label vectors.

18.1 matrix of a linear transformation
let v and w be vector spaces, with bases s = {e1, . . . , en} and t =
{f1, . . . , fm} respectively. since these are bases, there exist constants vi and
wj such that any vectors v     v and w     w can be written as:

v = v1e1 + v2e2 +        + vnen
w = w1f1 + w2f2 +        + wmfm

147

we call the coe   cients v1, . . . , vn the components of v in the basis10 {e1, . . . , en}.
it is often convenient to arrange the components vi in a column vector and
the basis vector in a row vector by writing

v =(cid:0)e1 e2

(cid:1)

                .

example consider the basis s = {1    t, 1 + t} for the vector space p1(t). the vector
v = 2t has components v1 =    1, v2 = 1, because

we may consider these components as vectors in rn and rm:

(cid:33)

v =    1(1     t) + 1(1 + t) =(cid:0)1     t 1 + t(cid:1)(cid:32)   1

now suppose we have a linear transformation l : v     w . then we can
expect to write l as an m    n matrix, turning an n-dimensional vector of
coe   cients corresponding to v into an m-dimensional vector of coe   cients
for w.

using linearity, we write:

l(v) = l(v1e1 + v2e2 +        + vnen)

= v1l(e1) + v2l(e2) +        + vnl(en)

labeled by a superscript, while basis vectors are labeled by subscripts in the conventions
of these lecture notes.

this is a vector in w . let   s compute its components in w .

we know that for each ej, l(ej) is a vector in w , and can thus be written
uniquely as a linear combination of vectors in the basis t . then we can    nd

we   ve written the m i

matching indices for the multiplied objects run up and to the right, like
so: fim i

now m i

j is the ith component of l(ej). regarding the coe   cients m i

j as
a matrix, we can see that the jth column of m is the coe   cients of l(ej) in
the basis t .

and m = (m i

on a choice of bases for both v and w . also observe that the columns of m
are computed by examining l acting on each basis vector in v expanded in
the basis vectors of w .
example let l : p1(t) (cid:55)    p1(t), such that l(a + bt) = (a + b)t. since v = p1(t) =
w , let   s choose the same basis for v and w . we   ll choose the basis {1    t, 1 + t} for
this example.

thus:

l(1     t) = (1     1)t = 0 = (1     t)    0 + (1 + t)    0 =(cid:0)(1     t)

example any vector in rn can be written as a linear combination of the standard

for any matrix m , observe that m ei is equal to the ith column of m . then if the
ith column of m equals l(ei) for every i, then m v = l(v) for every v     rn. then
the matrix representing l in the standard basis is just the matrix whose ith column is
l(ei).

invariant directions

have a look at the linear transformation l depicted below:

151

it was picked at random by choosing a pair of vectors l(e1) and l(e2) as
the outputs of l acting on the canonical basis vectors. notice how the unit
square with a corner at the origin get mapped to a parallelogram. the second
line of the picture shows these superimposed on one another. now look at the
second picture on that line. there, two vectors f1 and f2 have been carefully
chosen such that if the inputs into l are in the parallelogram spanned by f1
and f2, the outputs also form a parallelogram with edges lying along the same
two directions. clearly this is a very special situation that should correspond
to a interesting properties of l.

now lets try an explicit example to see if we can achieve the last picture:

now, notice that any vector with the same direction as v1 can be written as cv1
for some constant c. then l(cv1) = cl(v1) = cv1, so l    xes every vector pointing
in the same direction as v1.

also notice that

l

then l    xes the direction of the vector v2 =

but stretches v2 by a factor of 2.

now notice that for any constant c, l(cv2) = cl(v2) = 2cv2. then l stretches every
vector pointing in the same direction as v2 by a factor of 2.

in short, given a linear transformation l it is sometimes possible to    nd

a vector v (cid:54)= 0 and constant    (cid:54)= 0 such that

l(v) =   v.

153

we call the direction of the vector v an invariant direction. in fact, any
vector pointing in the same direction also satis   es the equation: l(cv) =
cl(v) =   cv. the vector v is called an eigenvector of l, and    is an eigen-
value. since the direction is all we really care about here, then any other
vector cv (so long as c (cid:54)= 0) is an equally good choice of eigenvector. notice
that the relation    u and v point in the same direction    is an equivalence
relation.

in our example of the linear transformation l with matrix

(cid:18)    4

(cid:19)

,

we have seen that l enjoys the property of having two invariant directions,
represented by eigenvectors v1 and v2 with eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively.
it would be very convenient if we could write any vector w as a linear
combination of v1 and v2. suppose w = rv1 + sv2 for some constants r and s.
then:

l(w) = l(rv1 + sv2) = rl(v1) + sl(v2) = rv1 + 2sv2.

now l just multiplies the number r by 1 and the number s by 2. if we

could write this as a matrix, it would look like:

which is much slicker than the usual scenario

here, s and t give the coordinates of w in terms of the vectors v1 and v2. in the
previous example, we multiplied the vector by the matrix l and came up with
a complicated expression. in these coordinates, we can see that l is a very
simple diagonal matrix, whose diagonal entries are exactly the eigenvalues of
l.

this process is called diagonalization. it makes complicated linear sys-

tems much easier to analyze.

now that we   ve seen what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are, there are a

number of questions that need to be answered.

154

   how do we    nd eigenvectors and their eigenvalues?

   how many eigenvalues and (independent) eigenvectors does a given

linear transformation have?

   when can a linear transformation be diagonalized?

we   ll start by trying to    nd the eigenvectors for a linear transformation.

for any square n    n matrix m , the polynomial in    given by
pm (  ) = det(  i     m ) = (   1)n det(m       i)

is called the characteristic polynomial of m , and its roots are the eigenvalues of m .
in this case, we see that l has two eigenvalues,   1 = 10 and   2 =    2. to    nd the
eigenvectors, we need to deal with these two cases separately. to do so, we solve the

   find the roots of the characteristic polynomial; these are the eigenvalues of l.
   for each eigenvalue   i, solve the linear system (m       ii)v = 0 to obtain an

eigenvector v associated to   i.

19 eigenvalues and eigenvectors ii

in lecture 18, we developed the idea of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the
case of linear transformations r2     r2. in this section, we will develop the
idea more generally.

eigenvalues

de   nition for a linear transformation l : v     v , then    is an eigenvalue
of l with eigenvector v (cid:54)= 0v if

lv =   v.

this equation says that the direction of v is invariant (unchanged) under l.
let   s try to understand this equation better in terms of matrices. let
v be a    nite-dimensional vector space and let l : v     v . since we can
represent l by a square matrix m , we    nd eigenvalues    and associated
eigenvectors v by solving the homogeneous system

this system has non-zero solutions if and only if the matrix

(m       i)v = 0.

is singular, and so we require that

m       i

det(  i     m ) = 0.

the left hand side of this equation is a polynomial in the variable   
called the characteristic polynomial pm (  ) of m . for an n    n matrix, the
characteristic polynomial has degree n. then

pm (  ) =   n + c1  n   1 +        + cn.

notice that pm (0) = det(   m ) = (   1)n det m .
the fundamental theorem of algebra states that any polynomial can be
factored into a product of linear terms over c. then there exists a collection
of n complex numbers   i (possibly with repetition) such that

pm (  ) = (         1)(         2)       (         n),

pm (  i) = 0

159

the eigenvalues   i of m are exactly the roots of pm (  ). these eigenvalues
could be real or complex or zero, and they need not all be di   erent. the
number of times that any given root   i appears in the collection of eigenvalues
is called its multiplicity.
example let l be the linear transformation l : r3     r3 given by
l(x, y, z) = (2x + y     z, x + 2y     z,   x     y + 2z) .

the matrix m representing l has columns lei for each i, so:

= (       1)2(       4)

then l has eigenvalues   1 = 1 (with multiplicity 2), and   2 = 4 (with multiplicity 1).
to    nd the eigenvectors associated to each eigenvalue, we solve the homogeneous
system (m       ii)x = 0 for each i.
13it is often easier (and equivalent) to solve det(m       i) = 0.

so we see that z = t, y =    t, and x =    t gives a formula for eigenvectors in

terms of the free parameter t. any such eigenvector is of the form t

thus l leaves a line through the origin invariant.

   = 1: again we set up an augmented matrix and    nd the solution set:

then the solution set has two free parameters, s and t, such that z = t, y = s,
and x =    s + t. then l leaves invariant the set:

example let v be the vector space of smooth (i.e. in   nitely di   erentiable) functions
dx : v     v . what are the
f : r     r. then the derivative is a linear operator d
eigenvectors of the derivative? in this case, we don   t have a matrix to work with, so
we have to make do.

a function f is an eigenvector of d

  f . an obvious candidate is the exponential function, e  x; indeed, d
dx has an eigenvector e  x for every        r.

as such, the operator d

this is actually the whole collection of eigenvectors for d

dx ; this can be proved
using the fact that every in   nitely di   erentiable function has a taylor series with
in   nite radius of convergence, and then using the taylor series to show that if two
functions are eigenvectors of d
dx with eigenvalues   , then they are scalar multiples of
each other.

of l with eigenvalue 1. in fact, any linear combination r

these two eigenvectors will be another eigenvector with the same eigenvalue.
more generally, let {v1, v2, . . .} be eigenvectors of some linear transforma-
tion l with the same eigenvalue   . a linear combination of the vi can be
written c1v1 + c2v2 +        for some constants {c1, c2, . . .}. then:

l(c1v1 + c2v2 +        ) = c1lv1 + c2lv2 +        by linearity of l
= c1  v1 + c2  v2 +        since lvi =   vi
=   (c1v1 + c2v2 +        ).

so every linear combination of the vi is an eigenvector of l with the same
eigenvalue   . in simple terms, any sum of eigenvectors is again an eigenvector
if they share the same eigenvalue.

the space of all vectors with eigenvalue    is called an eigenspace.

it
is, in fact, a vector space contained within the larger vector space v : it
contains 0v , since l0v = 0v =   0v , and is closed under addition and scalar
multiplication by the above calculation. all other vector space properties are
inherited from the fact that v itself is a vector space.

an eigenspace is an example of a subspace of v , a notion explored in

lecture 15.

20 diagonalization

given a linear transformation, we are interested in how to write it as a
matrix. we are especially interested in the case that the matrix is written
with respect to a basis of eigenvectors, in which case it is a particularly nice
matrix.

20.1 diagonalization
now suppose we are lucky, and we have l : v (cid:55)    v , and the basis {v1, . . . , vn}
is a set of linearly independent eigenvectors for l, with eigenvalues   1, . . . ,   n.
then:

l(v1) =   1v1
l(v2) =   2v2

...

l(vn) =   nvn

as a result, the matrix of l in the basis of eigenvectors is diagonal:

                 1

                ,

  2

. . .

  n

where all entries o    of the diagonal are zero.
suppose that v is any n-dimensional vector space. we call a linear trans-
formation l : v (cid:55)    v diagonalizable if there exists a collection of n linearly
independent eigenvectors for l. in other words, l is diagonalizable if there
exists a basis for v of eigenvectors for l.
in a basis of eigenvectors, the matrix of a linear transformation is diag-
onal. on the other hand, if an n    n matrix is diagonal, then the standard
basis vectors ei must already be a set of n linearly independent eigenvectors.
we have shown:

165

theorem 20.1. given a basis s for a vector space v and a linear transfor-
mation l : v     v , then the matrix for l in the basis s is diagonal if and
only if s is a basis of eigenvectors for l.

20.2 change of basis
suppose we have two bases s = {v1, . . . , vn} and t = {u1, . . . , un} for a
vector space v . (here vi and ui are vectors, not components of vectors in a
basis!) then we may write each vi uniquely as a linear combination of the uj:

(cid:88)

j is the k, j entry of the product of the matrices qp . since the
only expression for vj in the basis s is vj itself, then qp    xes each vj. as
a result, each vj is an eigenvector for qp with eigenvalue 1, so qp is the
identity.

the matrix p is called a change of basis matrix. there is a quick and
dirty trick to obtain it: look at the formula above relating the new basis
vectors v1, v2, . . . vn to the old ones u1, u2, . . . , un. in particular focus on v1
for which

v1 =(cid:0)u1 u2

this says that the    rst column of the change of basis matrix p is really just
the components of the vector v1 in the basis u1, u2, . . . , un.

study of this course, not matrices; matrices are merely a convenient way of
doing computations.

since the expression for a vector in a basis is unique, then we see that the
entries of m p are the same as the entries of p d. in other words, we see that

m p = p d

or

d = p    1m p.

this motivates the following de   nition:

de   nition a matrix m is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix
p and a diagonal matrix d such that

d = p    1m p.

we can summarize as follows:

   change of basis multiplies vectors by the change of basis matrix p , to

give vectors in the new basis.

168

   to get the matrix of a linear transformation in the new basis, we con-
jugate the matrix of l by the change of basis matrix: m     p    1m p .

if for two matrices n and m there exists an invertible matrix p such
that m = p    1n p , then we say that m and n are similar . then the
above discussion shows that diagonalizable matrices are similar to diagonal
matrices.

corollary 20.2. a square matrix m is diagonalizable if and only if there
exists a basis of eigenvectors for m . moreover, these eigenvectors are the
columns of the change of basis matrix p which diagonalizes m .

the canonical/standard basis in rn

you may have noticed that we have only rarely used the dot product. that
is because many of the results we have obtained do not require a preferred
notion of lengths of vectors. now let us consider the case of rn where the

length of a vector (x1, x2, . . . , xn)     rn is(cid:112)(x1)2 + (x2)2 +        (xn)2.

   each of the standard basis vectors has unit length:

(cid:113)

(cid:107)ei(cid:107) =

   
ei ei =

et
i ei = 1.

   the standard basis vectors are orthogonal (in other words, at right

angles or perpendicular).

where   ij is the kronecker delta. notice that the kronecker delta gives the
entries of the identity matrix.

given column vectors v and w, we have seen that the dot product v w is
the same as the id127 vt w. this is the inner product on rn.
we can also form the outer product vwt , which gives a square matrix.

moreover, for a diagonal matrix d with diagonal entries   1, . . . ,   n, we

can write

d =   1  1 +        +   n  n.

14this is reminiscent of an older notation, where vectors are written in juxtaposition.

this is called a    dyadic tensor   , and is still used in some applications.

174

other bases that share these properties should behave in many of the

same ways as the standard basis. as such, we will study:

   orthogonal bases {v1, . . . , vn}:

vi vj = 0 if i (cid:54)= j

in other words, all vectors in the basis are perpendicular.

   orthonormal bases {u1, . . . , un}:

ui uj =   ij.

in addition to being orthogonal, each vector has unit length.

suppose t = {u1, . . . , un} is an orthonormal basis for rn. since t is
a basis, we can write any vector v uniquely as a linear combination of the
vectors in t :

v = c1u1 +        cnun.

since t is orthonormal, there is a very easy way to    nd the coe   cients of this
linear combination. by taking the dot product of v with any of the vectors
in t , we get:

v ui = c1u1 ui +        + ciui ui +        + cnun ui

= c1    0 +        + ci    1 +        + cn    0
= ci,

    ci = v ui
    v = (v u1)u1 +        + (v un)un

(cid:88)

(v ui)ui.

u    u

v

v   

u  v
u  u u = v(cid:107)

this new vector v    is orthogonal to u because

u v    = u v     u    v
u    u

u u = 0.

hence, {u, v   } is an orthogonal basis for span{u, v}. when v is not par-
allel to u, v    (cid:54)= 0, and normalizing these vectors we obtain
, an
orthonormal basis.

|v   |

(cid:110) u|u| , v   

(cid:111)

sometimes we write v = v    + v(cid:107) where:
v    = v     u    v
u    u
u    v
v(cid:107) =
u    u
u.

this is called an orthogonal decomposition because we have decomposed v
into a sum of orthogonal vectors. it is signi   cant that we wrote this decom-
position with u in mind; v(cid:107) is parallel to u.
if u, v are linearly independent vectors in r3, then the set {u, v   , u   v   }
would be an orthogonal basis for r3. this set could then be normalized by
dividing each vector by its length to obtain an orthonormal basis.

181

however, it often occurs that we are interested in vector spaces with di-
mension greater than 3, and must resort to craftier means than cross products
to obtain an orthogonal basis. 15

given a third vector w, we should    rst check that w does not lie in the
span of u and v, i.e. check that u, v and w are linearly independent. we
then can de   ne:

v    v    v   .
we can check that u w    and v    w    are both zero:

w    = w     u w
u u

u     v    w

u w    = u

since u is orthogonal to v   , and

v    w    = v    (cid:18)

because u is orthogonal to v   . since w    is orthogonal to both u and v   , we
have that {u, v   , w   } is an orthogonal basis for span{u, v, w}.
in fact, given a collection {x, v2, . . .} of linearly independent vectors, we
can produce an orthogonal basis for span{v1, v2, . . .} consisting of the follow-
15actually, given a set t of (n     1) independent vectors in n-space, one can de   ne an
analogue of the cross product that will produce a vector orthogonal to the span of t , using
a method exactly analogous to the usual computation for calculating the cross product of
two vectors in r3. this only gets us the last orthogonal vector, though; the process in
this section gives a way to get a full orthogonal basis.

in lecture 11 we learned how to solve linear systems by decomposing a

matrix m into a product of lower and upper triangular matrices

the gram   schmidt procedure suggests another matrix decomposition,

m = lu .

m = qr

where q is an orthogonal matrix and r is an upper triangular matrix. so-
called qr-decompositions are useful for solving linear systems, eigenvalue
problems and least squares approximations. you can easily get the idea
behind qr decomposition by working through a simple example.

m =

what we will do is to think of the columns of m as three vectors and use gram   
schmidt to build an orthonormal basis from these that will become the columns of
the orthogonal matrix q. we will use the matrix r to record the steps of the gram   
schmidt procedure in such a way that the product qr equals m .

to begin with we write

in the    rst matrix the    rst two columns are mutually orthogonal because we simpy
replaced the second column of m by the vector that the gram   schmidt procedure
produces from the    rst two columns of m , namely

your own understanding is to work out why this is true!

another qr decomposition example

22.1 orthogonal complements

let u and v be subspaces of a vector space w . we saw as a review exercise
that u     v is a subspace of w , and that u     v was not a subspace. however,
span(u   v ) is certainly a subspace, since the span of any subset is a subspace.
notice that all elements of span(u     v ) take the form u + v with u     u
and v     v . we call the subspace

u + v = span(u     v ) = {u + v|u     u, v     v }

the sum of u and v . here, we are not adding vectors, but vector spaces to
produce a new vector space!

185

de   nition given two subspaces u and v of a space w such that u     v =
{0w}, the direct sum of u and v is de   ned as:

u     v = span(u     v ) = {u + v|u     u, v     v }.

notice that when u     v = {0w}, u + v = u     v .

the direct sum has a very nice property.

theorem 22.1. let w = u + v     u     v . then the expression w = u + v is
unique. that is, there is only one way to write w as the sum of a vector in
u and a vector in v .
proof. suppose that u + v = u(cid:48) + v(cid:48), with u, u(cid:48)     u , and v, v(cid:48)     v . then we
could express 0 = (u     u(cid:48)) + (v     v(cid:48)). then (u     u(cid:48)) =    (v     v(cid:48)). since u
and v are subspaces, we have (u     u(cid:48))     u and    (v     v(cid:48))     v . but since
these elements are equal, we also have (u    u(cid:48))     v . since u     v = {0}, then
(u     u(cid:48)) = 0. similarly, (v     v(cid:48)) = 0, proving the theorem.

reading homework: problem 22.1

given a subspace u in w , we would like to write w as the direct sum of
u and something. there is not a unique answer to this question as can be
seen from this picture of subspaces in w = r3:

however, using the inner product, there is a natural candidate u    for this
second subspace as shown here:

186

the general de   nition is as follows:

de   nition given a subspace u of a vector space w , de   ne:

u    = {w     w|w u = 0 for all u     u}.

the set u    (pronounced    u -perp   ) is the set of all vectors in w orthogo-
nal to every vector in u . this is also often called the orthogonal complement
of u . probably by now you may be feeling overwhelmed, it may help to
watch this quick overview video:

overview

example consider any plane p through the origin in r3. then p is a subspace, and
p     is the line through the origin orthogonal to p . for example, if p is the xy-plane,
then

r3 = p     p     = {(x, y, 0)|x, y     r}     {(0, 0, z)|z     r}.

theorem 22.2. let u be a subspace of a    nite-dimensional vector space w .
then the set u    is a subspace of w , and w = u     u   .
proof. to see that u    is a subspace, we only need to check closure, which
requires a simple check.

we have u     u    = {0}, since if u     u and u     u   , we have:

u u = 0     u = 0.

187

finally, we show that any vector w     w is in u     u   . (this is where
we use the assumption that w is    nite-dimensional.) let e1, . . . , en be an
orthonormal basis for w . set:

u = (w e1)e1 +        + (w en)en     u
u    = w     u

it is easy to check that u        u    (see the gram-schmidt procedure). then
w = u + u   , so w     u     u   , and we are done.

example consider any line l through the origin in r4. then l is a subspace, and l   
is a 3-dimensional subspace orthogonal to l. for example, let l be the line spanned
by the vector (1, 1, 1, 1)     r4. then l    is given by

l    = {(x, y, z, w) | x, y, z, w     r and (x, y, z, w) (1, 1, 1, 1) = 0}

= {(x, y, z, w) | x, y, z, w     r and x, y, z, w = 0}.

de   nition a matrix is symmetric if it obeys

m = m t .

one very nice property of symmetric matrices is that they always have
real eigenvalues. the general proof is an exercise, but here   s an example for
2    2 matrices.
example for a general symmetric 2    2 matrix, we have:

(cid:18)a b

(cid:115)

(cid:18) a     d

(cid:19)2

.

       =

a + d

b2 +

notice that the discriminant 4b2 + (a     d)2 is always positive, so that the eigenvalues
must be real.

now, suppose a symmetric matrix m has two distinct eigenvalues    (cid:54)=   

and eigenvectors x and y:

m x =   x,

m y =   y.

191

consider the dot product x y = xt y = yt x. and now calculate:

xt m y = xt   y =   x y, and
xt m y = (yt m x)t (by transposing a 1    1 matrix)

= xt m t y
= xt m y
= xt   y
=   x y.

subtracting these two results tells us that:

0 = xt m y     xt m y = (         ) x y.

since    and    were assumed to be distinct eigenvalues,           is non-zero,
and so x y = 0. then we have proved the following theorem.

theorem 23.1. eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix with distinct eigenval-
ues are orthogonal.

vectors {v1, . . . , vn}

was an orthogonal matrix:

p    1 = p t , or p p t = i = p t p.

moreover, given any (unit) vector x1, one can always    nd vectors x2, . . . , xn
such that {x1, . . . , xn} is an orthonormal basis. (such a basis can be obtained
using the gram-schmidt procedure.)
now suppose m is a symmetric n   n matrix and   1 is an eigenvalue with
eigenvector x1. let the square matrix of column vectors p be the following:

where x1 through xn are orthonormal, and x1 is an eigenvector for m , but
the others are not necessarily eigenvectors for m . then

1)    (n     1) matrix and that it is symmetric. but then, by    nding an (unit)
eigenvector for   m , we could repeat this procedure successively. the end
result would be a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of m on the diagonal.
then we have proved a theorem.

given a linear transformation l : v     w , we would like to know whether
it has an inverse. that is, we would like to know whether there exists a
linear transformation m : w     v such that for any vector v     v , we have
m (l(v)) = v, and for any vector w     w , we have l(m (w)) = w. a linear
transformation is just a special kind of function from one vector space to
another. so before we discuss which linear transformations have inverses, let
us    rst discuss inverses of arbitrary functions. when we later specialize to
linear transformations, we   ll also    nd some nice ways of creating subspaces.
let f : s     t be a function from a set s to a set t . recall that s is

called the domain of f , t is called the codomain of f , and the set

ran(f ) = im(f ) = f (s) = {f (s)|s     s}     t

is called the range or image of f . the image of f is the set of elements of t
to which the function f maps, i.e., the things in t which you can get to by
starting in s and applying f . we can also talk about the pre-image of any
subset u     t :

f   1(u ) = {s     s|f (s)     u}     s.

the pre-image of a set u is the set of all elements of s which map to u .
the function f is one-to-one if di   erent elements in s always map to
di   erent elements in t . that is, f is one-to-one if for any elements x (cid:54)= y     s,
we have that f (x) (cid:54)= f (y). one-to-one functions are also called injective
functions. notice that injectivity is a condition on the pre-image of f .
the function f is onto if every element of t is mapped to by some element
of s. that is, f is onto if for any t     t , there exists some s     s such that
f (s) = t. onto functions are also called surjective functions. notice that
surjectivity is a condition on the image of f .

if f is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.

theorem 24.1. a function f : s     t has an inverse function g : t     s if
and only if it is bijective.
proof. suppose that f is bijective. since f is surjective, every element t     t
has at least one pre-image, and since f is injective, every t has no more
than one pre-image. therefore, to construct an inverse function g, we simply
de   ne g(t) to be the unique pre-image f   1(t) of t.

conversely, suppose that f has an inverse function g.

197

   the function f is injective:

suppose that we have x, y     s such that f (x) = f (y). we must have
that g(f (s)) = s for any s     s, so in particular g(f (x)) = x and
g(f (y)) = y. but since f (x) = f (y), we have g(f (x)) = g(f (y)) so
x = y. therefore, f is injective.

   the function f is surjective:

let t be any element of t . we must have that f (g(t)) = t. thus, g(t)
is an element of s which maps to t. so f is surjective.

now let us restrict to the case that our function f is not just an arbitrary
function, but a linear transformation between two vector spaces. everything
we said above for arbitrary functions is exactly the same for linear trans-
formations. however, the linear structure of vector spaces lets us say much
more about one-to-one and onto functions than we can say about functions
on general sets. for example, we always know that a linear function sends 0v
to 0w . you will show that a linear transformation is one-to-one if and only if
0v is the only vector that is sent to 0w : by looking at just one (very special)
vector, we can    gure out whether f is one-to-one. for arbitrary functions
between arbitrary sets, things aren   t nearly so convenient!
let l : v     w be a linear transformation. suppose l is not injective.
then we can    nd v1 (cid:54)= v2 such that lv1 = lv2. then v1     v2 (cid:54)= 0, but

l(v1     v2) = 0.

de   nition let l : v     w be a linear transformation. the set of all vectors
v such that lv = 0w is called the kernel of l:

ker l = {v     v |lv = 0w}.

theorem 24.2. a linear transformation l is injective if and only if

ker l = {0v } .

proof. the proof of this theorem is an exercise.

notice that if l has matrix m in some basis, then    nding the kernel of

l is equivalent to solving the homogeneous system

m x = 0.

198

example let l(x, y) = (x + y, x + 2y, y). is l one-to-one?

to    nd out, we can solve the linear system:

      1 1 0
          

1 2 0
0 1 0

      1 0 0
       .

0 1 0
0 0 0

then all solutions of m x = 0 are of the form x = y = 0. in other words, ker l = 0,
and so l is injective.

theorem 24.3. let l : v     w . then ker l is a subspace of v .

proof. notice that if l(v) = 0 and l(u) = 0, then for any constants c, d,
l(cu + dv) = 0. then by the subspace theorem, the kernel of l is a subspace
of v .

this theorem has an interpretation in terms of the eigenspaces of l : v    
v . suppose l has a zero eigenvalue. then the associated eigenspace consists
of all vectors v such that lv = 0v = 0; in other words, the 0-eigenspace of l
is exactly the kernel of l.

returning to the previous example, let l(x, y) = (x + y, x + 2y, y). l is

clearly not surjective, since l sends r2 to a plane in r3.
example let l : r3     r be the linear transformation de   ned by l(x, y, z) = (x +
y + z). then ker l consists of all vectors (x, y, z)     r3 such that x + y + z = 0.
therefore, the set

v = {(x, y, z)     r3 | x + y + z = 0}

is a subspace of r3.

notice that if x = l(v) and y = l(u), then for any constants c, d, cx +
dy = l(cv + du). now the subspace theorem strikes again, and we have the
following theorem.
theorem 24.4. let l : v     w . then the image l(v ) is a subspace of w .
to    nd a basis of the image of l, we can start with a basis s = {v1, . . . , vn}

for v , and conclude (see the review exercises) that

l(v ) = span l(s) = span{l(v1), . . . , l(vn)}.

199

however, the set {l(v1), . . . , l(vn)} may not be linearly independent, so we
solve

c1l(v1) +        + cnl(vn) = 0.

by    nding relations amongst l(s), we can discard vectors until a basis is
arrived at. the size of this basis is the dimension of the image of l, which
is known as the rank of l.

de   nition the rank of a linear transformation l is the dimension of its
image, written rank l = dim l(v ) = dim ran l.

the nullity of a linear transformation is the dimension of the kernel,

written null l = dim ker l.
theorem 24.5 (dimension formula). let l : v     w be a linear transfor-
mation, with v a    nite-dimensional vector space16. then:

dim v = dim ker v + dim l(v )

= null l + rank l.

proof. pick a basis for v :

{v1, . . . , vp, u1, . . . , uq},

where v1, . . . , vp is also a basis for ker l. this can always be done, for exam-
ple, by    nding a basis for the kernel of l and then extending to a basis for v .
then p = null l and p + q = dim v . then we need to show that q = rank l.
to accomplish this, we show that {l(u1), . . . , l(uq)} is a basis for l(v ).
to see that {l(u1), . . . , l(uq)} spans l(v ), consider any vector w in l(v ).

then we can    nd constants ci, dj such that:

w = l(c1v1 +        + cpvp + d1u1 +        + dquq)

= c1l(v1) +        + cpl(vp) + d1l(u1) +        + dql(uq)
= d1l(u1) +        + dql(uq) since l(vi) = 0,

    l(v ) = span{l(u1), . . . , l(uq)}.

16the formula still makes sense for in   nite dimensional vector spaces, such as the space
of all polynomials, but the notion of a basis for an in   nite dimensional space is more
sticky than in the    nite-dimensional case. furthermore, the dimension formula for in   nite
dimensional vector spaces isn   t useful for computing the rank of a linear transformation,
since an equation like     =     + x cannot be solved for x. as such, the proof presented
assumes a    nite basis for v .

200

now we show that {l(u1), . . . , l(uq)} is linearly independent. we argue
by contradiction: suppose there exist constants dj (not all zero) such that

0 = d1l(u1) +        + dql(uq)

= l(d1u1 +        + dquq).

but since the uj are linearly independent, then d1u1 +        + dquq (cid:54)= 0, and
so d1u1 +        + dquq is in the kernel of l. but then d1u1 +        + dquq must
be in the span of {v1, . . . , vp}, since this was a basis for the kernel. this
contradicts the assumption that {v1, . . . , vp, u1, . . . , uq} was a basis for v , so
we are done.

24.1 summary

we have seen that a linear transformation has an inverse if and only if it is
bijective (i.e., one-to-one and onto). we also know that linear transforma-
tions can be represented by matrices, and we have seen many ways to tell
whether a matrix is invertible. here is a list of them.

201

theorem 24.6 (invertibility). let m be an n    n matrix, and let l : rn    
rn be the linear transformation de   ned by l(v) = m v. then the following
statements are equivalent:

1. if v is any vector in rn, then the system m x = v has exactly one

solution.

2. the matrix m is row-equivalent to the identity matrix.
3. if v is any vector in rn, then l(x) = v has exactly one solution.

4. the matrix m is invertible.

5. the homogeneous system m x = 0 has no non-zero solutions.

6. the determinant of m is not equal to 0.

7. the transpose matrix m t is invertible.

8. the matrix m does not have 0 as an eigenvalue.

9. the linear transformation l does not have 0 as an eigenvalue.
10. the characteristic polynomial det(  i     m ) does not have 0 as a root.
11. the columns (or rows) of m span rn.

12. the columns (or rows) of m are linearly independent.
13. the columns (or rows) of m are a basis for rn.

14. the linear transformation l is injective.

15. the linear transformation l is surjective.

16. the linear transformation l is bijective.

note:

it is important that m be an n    n matrix! if m is not square,
then it can   t be invertible, and many of the statements above are no longer
equivalent to each other.

proof. many of these equivalences were proved earlier in these notes. some
were left as review questions or sample    nal questions. the rest are left as
exercises for the reader.

25 least squares
consider the linear system l(x) = v, where l : u linear       w , and v     w
is given. as we have seen, this system may have no solutions, a unique
solution, or a space of solutions. but if v is not in the range of l then there
will never be any solutions for l(x) = v.

however, for many applications we do not need a exact solution of the
system; instead, we try to    nd the best approximation possible. to do this,
we try to    nd x that minimizes ||l(x)     v||.

   my work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful,
but when i had to choose one or the other, i usually chose the
beautiful.   

    hermann weyl.

this method has many applications, such as when trying to    t a (perhaps
linear) function to a    noisy    set of observations. for example, suppose we
measured the position of a bicycle on a racetrack once every    ve seconds.
our observations won   t be exact, but so long as the observations are right on
average, we can    gure out a best-possible linear function of position of the
bicycle in terms of time.

suppose m is the matrix for l in some bases for u and w , and v and x
are given by column vectors v and x in these bases. then we need to
approximate

m x     v     0 .

note that if dim u = n and dim w = m then m can be represented by
an m    n matrix and x and v as vectors in rn and rm, respectively. thus,
we can write w = l(u )     l(u )   . then we can uniquely write v = v(cid:107) + v   ,
with v(cid:107)     l(u ) and v        l(u )   .
then we should solve l(u) = v(cid:107). in components, v    is just v     m x,

and is the part we will eventually wish to minimize.
in terms of m , recall that l(v ) is spanned by the columns of m . (in
the natural basis, the columns of m are m e1, . . ., m en.) then v    must be
perpendicular to the columns of m . i.e., m t (v     m x) = 0, or

m t m x = m t v.

solutions x to m t m x = m t v are called least squares solutions to

m x = v .

206

notice that any solution x to m x = v is a least squares solution.
however, the converse is often false. in fact, the equation m x = v may have
no solutions at all, but still have least squares solutions to m t m x = m t v .
observe that since m is an m    n matrix, then m t is an n    m matrix.
then m t m is an n    n matrix, and is symmetric, since (m t m )t = m t m .
then, for any vector x, we can evaluate x t m t m x to obtain a num-
it is just the length |m x|2 =
ber. this is a very nice number, though!
(m x)t (m x) = x t m t m x.

reading homework: problem 25.1

now suppose that ker l = {0}, so that the only solution to m x = 0 is
x = 0. (this need not mean that m is invertible because m is an n    m
matrix, so not necessarily square.) however the square matrix m t m is
invertible. to see this, suppose there was a vector x such that m t m x = 0.
then it would follow that x t m t m x = |m x|2 = 0. in other words the
vector m x would have zero length, so could only be the zero vector. but we
are assuming that ker l = {0} so m x = 0 implies x = 0. thus the kernel
of m t m is {0} so this matrix is invertible. so, in this case, the least squares
solution (the x that solves m t m x = m v ) is unique, and is equal to

x = (m t m )   1m t v.

in a nutshell, this is the least squares method.

   compute m t m and m t v .

   solve (m t m )x = m t v by gaussian elimination.

a linear function from v to v , where v = {f : r     r | f is integrable}
is a vector space over r with usual addition and scalar multiplication.

9. what are the four main things we need to de   ne for a vector space?
which of the following is a vector space over r? for those that are
not vector spaces, modify one part of the de   nition to make it into a
vector space.
(a) v = { 2    2 matrices with entries in r}, usual matrix addition,

(cid:19)

(cid:18) a b

c d

=

(cid:19)

(cid:18) ka b

kc d

and k   

for k     r.

(b) v = {polynomials with complex coe   cients of degree     3}, with

usual addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials.

(c) v = {vectors in r3 with at least one entry containing a 1}, with

usual addition and scalar multiplication.

10. subspaces: if v is a vector space, we say that u is a subspace of v when
the set u is also a vector space, using the vector addition and scalar
multiplication rules of the vector space v . (remember that u     v
says that    u is a subset of v    , i.e., all elements of u are also elements
of v . the symbol     means    for all    and     means    is an element of   .)
explain why additive closure (u + w     u     u, v     u ) and multiplicative
closure (r.u     u     r     r, u     v ) ensure that (i) the zero vector 0     u
and (ii) every u     u has an additive inverse.

in fact it su   ces to check closure under addition and scalar multipli-
cation to verify that u is a vector space. check whether the following
choices of u are vector spaces:

         

      x

y

as a check, count that the total number of 2    2 bit matrices is
2(number of entries) = 24 = 16.

(d) to disprove this statement, we just need to    nd a single counterex-
ample. all the unit determinant examples above are actually row
equivalent to the identity matrix, so focus on the bit matrices with
vanishing determinant. then notice (for example), that

(cid:18)1 1

(cid:19)

0 0

(cid:18)0 0

(cid:19)

0 0

   /

.

so we have found a pair of matrices that are not row equivalent
but do have the same determinant. it follows that the statement
is false.

8. we can call a function f : v        w linear if the sets v and w are

vector spaces and f obeys

f (  u +   v) =   f (u) +   f (v) ,

for all u, v     v and   ,        r.
now, integration is a linear transformation from the space v of all in-
tegrable functions (don   t be confused between the de   nition of a linear
function above, and integrable functions f (x) which here are the vec-
      (  f (x) +   g(x))dx =

tors in v ) to the real numbers r, because (cid:82)

9. the four main ingredients are (i) a set v of vectors, (ii) a number
   eld k (usually k = r), (iii) a rule for adding vectors (vector addition)
and (iv) a way to multiply vectors by a number to produce a new vector
(scalar multiplication). there are, of course, ten rules that these four
ingredients must obey.

(a) this is not a vector space. notice that distributivity of scalar
multiplication requires 2u = (1 + 1)u = u + u for any vector u but

which does not equal(cid:18)a b

(b) this is a vector space. although, the question does not ask you to,
it is a useful exercise to verify that all ten vector space rules are
satis   ed.

(c) this is not a vector space for many reasons. an easy one is
that (1,   1, 0) and (   1, 1, 0) are both in the space, but their sum
(0, 0, 0) is not (i.e., additive closure fails). the easiest way to re-
pair this would be to drop the requirement that there be at least
one entry equaling 1.

10. (i) thanks to multiplicative closure, if u     u , so is (   1)    u. but
(   1)    u + u = (   1)    u + 1    u = (   1 + 1)    u = 0.u = 0 (at each step in
this chain of equalities we have used the fact that v is a vector space
and therefore can use its vector space rules). in particular, this means
that the zero vector of v is in u and is its zero vector also. (ii) also,
in v , for each u there is an element    u such that u + (   u) = 0. but
by additive close, (   u) must also be in u , thus every u     u has an
additive inverse.

219

(a) this is a vector space. first we check additive closure: let

w

and

      x

       +

      x
      
       z
       be arbitrary vectors in u . but since
       z
       =
      x + z
      , so is their sum (because vectors in u are those whose
      , which also has no third component,
       =
      x
       is not in u
       is in u but the vector u + u =

third component vanishes). multiplicative closure is similar: for
any        r,

(a) multiplying m by    replaces every matrix element m i

  (j) in the
  (j), and therefore produces an

formula for the permanent by   m i
overall factor   n.

(b) multiplying the ith row by    replaces m i

  (j) in the formula for the
  (j). therefore the permanent is multiplied by

permanent by   m i
an overall factor   .

(c) the permanent of a matrix transposed equals the permanent of
the original matrix, because in the formula for the permanent
this amounts to summing over permutations of rows rather than
columns. but we could then sort the product m   (1)
. . . m   (n)
back into its original order using the inverse permutation      1. but
summing over permutations is equivalent to summing over inverse
permutations, and therefore the permanent is unchanged.

(d) swapping two rows also leaves the permanent unchanged. the
argument is almost the same as in the previous part, except that
we need only reshu   e two matrix elements m j
  (j) (in
the case where rows i and j were swapped). then we use the fact

that summing over all permutations    or over all permutations(cid:101)  

  (i) and m i

obtained by swapping a pair in    are equivalent operations.

5. firstly, lets call (1) = 1 (the 1    1 identity matrix). then we calculate
h t = (i   2xx t )t = i t   2(xx t )t = i   2(x t )t x t = i   2xx t = h ,

which demonstrates the    rst equality. now we compute

h 2 = (i     2xx t )(i     2xx t ) = i     4xx t + 4xx t xx t
= i     4xx t + 4x(x t x)x t = i     4xx t + 4x.1.x t = i .

so, since hh = i, we have h   1 = h.

6. we know m v =   v. hence

m 2v = m m v = m   v =   m v =   2v ,

and similarly

m kv =   m k   1v = . . . =   kv .
so v is an eigenvector of m k with eigenvalue   k.

226

now let us assume v is an eigenvector of the nilpotent matrix n with
eigenvalue   . then from above

n kv =   kv

but by nilpotence, we also have

n kv = 0

hence   kv = 0 and v (being an eigenvector) cannot vanish. thus
  k = 0 and in turn    = 0.

7. let us think about the eigenvalue problem m v =   v. this has solutions

mented matrix form)

observe that any 2    2 matrix is a zero of its own characteristic poly-
nomial (in fact this holds for square matrices of any size).
now if a = p    1dp then a2 = p    1dp p    1dp = p    1d2p . similarly
ak = p    1dkp . so for any matrix polynomial we have

an + c1an   1 +        cn   1a + cni

= p    1dnp + c1p    1dn   1p +        cn   1p    1dp + cnp    1p
= p    1(dn + c1dn   1 +        cn   1d + cni)p .

thus we may conclude pa(a) = p    1pa(d)p .

9. a subset of a vector space is called a subspace if it itself is a vector space,
using the rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication inherited
from the original vector space.
(a) so long as u (cid:54)= u     w (cid:54)= w the answer is no. take, for example,

u to be the x-axis in r2 and w to be the y-axis. then(cid:0)1 0(cid:1)     u
and(cid:0)0 1(cid:1)     w , but(cid:0)1 0(cid:1) +(cid:0)0 1 0(cid:1) =(cid:0)1 1(cid:1) /    u     w . so

u     w is not additively closed and is not a vector space (and thus
not a subspace). it is easy to draw the example described.

(b) here the answer is always yes. the proof is not di   cult. take
a vector u and w such that u     u     w (cid:51) w. this means that
both u and w are in both u and w . but, since u is a vector
space,   u +   w is also in u . similarly,   u +   w     w . hence
  u +   w     u     w . so closure holds in u     w and this set is a
subspace by the subspace theorem. here, a good picture to draw
is two planes through the origin in r3 intersecting at a line (also
through the origin).

10. (i) we say that the vectors {v1, v2, . . . vn} are linearly independent if
there exist no constants c1, c2, . . . cn (all non-vanishing) such that c1v1+
c2v2 +        + cnvn = 0. alternatively, we can require that there is
no non-trivial solution for scalars c1, c2, . . . , cn to the linear system
c1v1 + c2v2 +        + cnvn = 0. (ii) we say that these vectors span a
vector space v if the set span{v1, v2, . . . vn} = {c1v1 + c2v2 +       + cnvn :
c1, c2, . . . cn     r} = v .
(iii) we call {v1, v2, . . . vn} a basis for v if
{v1, v2, . . . vn} are linearly independent and span{v1, v2, . . . vn} = v .
for u, v, w to be a basis for r3, we    rstly need (the spanning require-

       can be written as a linear combination of

ment) that any vector

9. elite nasa engineers determine that if a satellite is placed in orbit
starting at a point o, it will return exactly to that same point after
one orbit of the earth. unfortunately, if there is a small mistake in the
original location of the satellite, which the engineers label by a vector
x in r3 with origin18 at o, after one orbit the satellite will instead
return to some other point y     r3. the engineer   s computations show
that y is related to x by a matrix

          x .

let us assume that the rule found by the engineers applies to all sub-

12. conic sections: the equation for the most general conic section is

given by

ax2 + 2bxy + dy2 + 2cx + 2ey + f = 0 .

(b) does your matrix m obey any special properties? find its eigen-
values. you may call your answers    and    for the rest of the
problem to save writing.

for the rest of this problem we will focus on central conics
for which the matrix m is invertible.

(c) your equation in part (a) above should be be quadratic in x.

if all has gone well, you have found a way to shift coordi-
nates for the original conic equation to a new coordinate
system with its origin at the center of symmetry. our next
aim is to rotate the coordinate axes to produce a readily
recognizable equation.

(d) why is the angle between vectors v and w is not changed when
you replace them by p v and p w for p any orthogonal matrix?

(e) explain how to choose an orthogonal matrix p such that m p =

p d where d is a diagonal matrix.

these cases.

13. let l : v     w be a linear transformation between    nite-dimensional
vector spaces v and w , and let m be a matrix for l (with respect
to some basis for v and some basis for w ). we know that l has an
inverse if and only if it is bijective, and we know a lot of ways to tell
whether m has an inverse. in fact, l has an inverse if and only if m
has an inverse:

(a) suppose that l is bijective (i.e., one-to-one and onto).

i. show that dim v = rank l = dim w .
ii. show that 0 is not an eigenvalue of m .
iii. show that m is an invertible matrix.

(b) now, suppose that m is an invertible matrix.

i. show that 0 is not an eigenvalue of m .
ii. show that l is injective.
iii. show that l is surjective.

14. captain conundrum gives queen quandary a pair of newborn doves,
male and female for her birthday. after one year, this pair of doves
breed and produce a pair of dove eggs. one year later these eggs hatch
yielding a new pair of doves while the original pair of doves breed again
and an additional pair of eggs are laid. captain conundrum is very
happy because now he will never need to buy the queen a present ever
again!

let us say that in year zero, the queen has no doves.
in year one
she has one pair of doves, in year two she has two pairs of doves etc...
call fn the number of pairs of doves in years n. for example, f0 = 0,
f1 = 1 and f2 = 1. assume no doves die and that the same breeding
pattern continues well into the future. then f3 = 2 because the eggs
laid by the    rst pair of doves in year two hatch. notice also that in
year three, two pairs of eggs are laid (by the    rst and second pair of
doves). thus f4 = 3.

(a) compute f5 and f6.

2. both junctions give the same equation for the currents

i + j + 13 = 0 .

there are three voltage loops (one on the left, one on the right and one
going around the outside of the circuit). respectively, they give the
equations

60     i     80     3i = 0
80 + 2j     v + 3j = 0

60     i + 2j     v + 3j     3i = 0

the above equations are easily solved (either using an augmented ma-
trix and row reducing, or by substitution). the result is i =    5 amps,
j = 8 amps, v = 120 volts.

(b) n.

(c) yes.
(d) n    n.
(e) m    m.
(f) yes. this relies on kerm = 0 because if m t m had a non-trivial
kernel, then there would be a non-zero solution x to m t m x = 0.
but then by multiplying on the left by x t we see that ||m x|| = 0.
this in turn implies m x = 0 which contradicts the triviality of
the kernel of m .

(g) yes because(cid:0)m t m(cid:1)t = m t (m t )t = m t m .

(h) yes, all symmetric matrices have a basis of eigenvectors.

(i) no, because otherwise it would not be invertible.

(j) since the kernel of l is non-trivial, m must have 0 as an eigen-

value.

vanish. i.e., det m = 0.

however, since we know that dim r3 = 3, if u spans r3, it will also be
a basis. then the solution for c1, c2 and c3 would be unique. hence, the
3    3 matrix above must be invertible, so we examine its determinant

thus u spans r3 whenever a (cid:54)= 2. when a = 2 we can write the third
vector in u in terms of the preceding ones as

from the 4    4 case above, you can see all the tricks required for a
general vandermonde matrix. first zero out the    rst column by sub-
tracting the    rst row from all other rows (which leaves the determinant
unchanged). now zero out the top row by subtracting x1 times the
   rst column from the second column, x1 times the second column from
the third column etc. again these column operations do not change
the determinant. now factor out x2     x1 from the second row, x3     x1
from the third row, etc. this does change the determinant so we write
these factors outside the remaining determinant, which is just the same
problem but for the (n   1)  (n   1) case. iterating the same procedure

orbits, the approximations used by the engineers in their calculations
probably fail and a new computation will be needed). in this case, the
satellite will be lost in outer space and the engineers will likely lose

      . hence, to compute l(v) we use linearity of l

l(v) = l(b1v1 + b2v2 + b3v3) = b1l(v1) + b2l(v2) + b3l(v3)

(f) from the notation of the previous part, we see that we can list
linear transformations l : b3     b by writing out all possible
bit-valued row vectors

(cid:0)0 0 0(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)1 0 0(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)0 1 0(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)0 0 1(cid:1) ,

(cid:0)1 0 1(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)0 1 1(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)1 1 1(cid:1) .

there are 23 = 8 di   erent linear transformations l : b3     b,
exactly the same as the number of elements in b3.

(g) yes, essentially just because l1 and l2 are linear transformations.
in detail for any bits (a, b) and vectors (u, v) in b3 it is easy to
check the linearity property for (  l1 +   l2)

(  l1 +   l2)(au + bv) =   l1(au + bv) +   l2(au + bv)

248

=   al1(u) +   bl1(v) +   al1(u) +   bl1(v)

= a(  l1(u) +   l2(v)) + b(  l1(u) +   l2(v))

= a(  l1 +   l2)(u) + b(  l1 +   l2)(v) .

here the    rst line used the de   nition of (  l1 +   l2), the second
line depended on the linearity of l1 and l2, the third line was just
algebra and the fourth used the de   nition of (  l1 +   l2) again.
(h) yes. the easiest way to see this is the identi   cation above of these
maps with bit-valued column vectors. in that notation, a basis is

(cid:110)(cid:0)1 0 0(cid:1) ,(cid:0)0 1 0(cid:1) ,(cid:0)0 0 1(cid:1)(cid:111)

.

since this (spanning) set has three (linearly independent) ele-
ments, the vector space of linear maps b3     b has dimension 3.
this is an example of a general notion called the dual vector space.

(c) the trick is to write

x t m x+c t x+x t c = (x t +c t m   1)m (x+m   1c)   c t m   1c ,

so that

(x t + c t m   1)m (x + m   1c) = c t m c     f .

hence y = x + m   1c and g = c t m c     f .

(d) the cosine of the angle between vectors v and w is given by

   

v w

   

=

v t w

.

v v w w

v t v w t w

so replacing v     p v and w     p w will always give a factor
p t p inside all the products, but p t p = i for orthogonal matri-
ces. hence none of the dot products in the above formula changes,
so neither does the angle between v and w .

(e) if we take the eigenvectors of m , normalize them (i.e. divide
them by their lengths), and put them in a matrix p (as columns)
then p will be an orthogonal matrix. (if it happens that    =   ,
then we also need to make sure the eigenvectors spanning the two
dimensional eigenspace corresponding to    are orthogonal.) then,
since m times the eigenvectors yields just the eigenvectors back
again multiplied by their eigenvalues, it follows that m p = p d
where d is the diagonal matrix made from eigenvalues.

(h) when    =    and g/   = r2, we get the equation for a circle radius
r in the (z, w)-plane. when   ,    and g are postive, we have the
equation for an ellipse. vanishing g along with    and    of opposite
signs gives a pair of straight lines. when g is non-vanishing, but
   and    have opposite signs, the result is a pair of hyperbol  .
these shapes all come from cutting a cone with a plane, and are
therefore called conic sections.

13. we show that l is bijective if and only if m is invertible.

(a) we suppose that l is bijective.

i. since l is injective, its kernel consists of the zero vector alone.

hence

l = dim ker l = 0.

so by the dimension formula,

dim v = l + rank l = rank l.

since l is surjective, l(v ) = w. thus

rank l = dim l(v ) = dim w.

thereby

dim v = rank l = dim w.

ii. since dim v = dim w , the matrix m is square so we can talk
about its eigenvalues. since l is injective, its kernel is the zero
vector alone. that is, the only solution to lx = 0 is x = 0v .
but lx is the same as m x, so the only solution to m x = 0
is x = 0v . so m does not have zero as an eigenvalue.

iii. since m x = 0 has no non-zero solutions, the matrix m is

invertible.

(b) now we suppose that m is an invertible matrix.

i. since m is invertible, the system m x = 0 has no non-zero
solutions. but lx is the same as m x, so the only solution to
lx = 0 is x = 0v . so l does not have zero as an eigenvalue.
ii. since lx = 0 has no non-zero solutions, the kernel of l is

the zero vector alone. so l is injective.

iii. since m is invertible, we must have that dim v = dim w . by

the dimension formula, we have

dim v = l + rank l

and since ker l = {0v } we have l = dim ker l = 0, so

dim w = dim v = rank l = dim l(v ).

251

since l(v ) is a subspace of w with the same dimension as w ,
it must be equal to w . to see why, pick a basis b of l(v ).
each element of b is a vector in w , so the elements of b form
a linearly independent set in w . therefore b is a basis of w ,
since the size of b is equal to dim w . so l(v ) = span b = w.
so l is surjective.

dim v = l + rank l = rank l.

since l(v ) is a subspace of w with the same dimension as w ,
it must be equal to w . to see why, pick a basis b of l(v ).
each element of b is a vector in w , so the elements of b form

d points vs. vectors

this is an expanded explanation of this remark. people might interchange-
ably use the term point and vector in rn, however these are not quite the
same concept. there is a notion of a point in rn representing a vector, and
while we can do this in a purely formal (mathematical) sense, we really can-
not add two points together (there is the related notion of this using convex
combinations, but that is for a di   erent course) or scale a point. we can
   subtract    two points which gives us the vector between as done which de-
scribing choosing the origin, thus if we take any point p , we can represent it
as a vector (based at the origin o) by taking v = p     o. naturally (as we
should be able to) we can add vectors to points and get a point back.

   lift    rn up to rn+1 (sometimes written as (cid:101)rn) by stating that all tu-
ples (cid:101)p = (p1, p2, . . . , pn, 1)     rn+1 correspond to a point p     rn and (cid:101)v =

to make all of this mathematically (and computationally) rigorous, we

(v1, . . . , vn, 0)     rn+1 correspond to a vector v     rn. note that if the last
coordinate w is not 0 or 1, then it does not carry meaning in terms of rn but
just exists in a formal sense. however we can project it down to a point by
scaling by 1
w , and this concept is highly used in rendering computer graphics.
we also do a similar procedure for all matrices acting on rn by the fol-
lowing. let a be a k    n matrix, then when we lift, we get the following
(k + 1)    (n + 1) matrix

(cid:18) a 0

(cid:19)

0

1

.

(cid:101)a =

note that we keep the last coordinate    xed, so we move points to points and
vectors to vectors. we can also act on rn in a somewhat non-linear fashion

by taking matrices of the form (cid:18)        

(cid:19)

0 1

and this still    xes the last coordinate. for example we can also represent
a translation, which is non-linear since it moves the origin, in the direction
v = (v1, v2, . . . , vn) by the following matrix

(cid:18) in v

0

1

(cid:19)

.

tv =

where in is the n    n identity matrix. note that this is an invertible matrix
with determinant 1, and it is stronger, a translation is what is known an

256

isometry on rn (note it is not an isometry on rn+1), an operator where
(cid:107)tvx(cid:107) = (cid:107)x(cid:107) for all vectors x     rn.

a good exercises to try are to check that lifting r2 to r3 allows us to add,
subtract, and scale points and vectors as described and generates nonsense
when we can   t (i.e. adding two points gives us a 2 in the last coordinate,
so it is neither a point nor a vector). another good exercise is to describe
all isometries of r2. as hint, you can get all of them by rotation about the
origin, re   ection about a single line, and translation.

257

e abstract concepts

here we will introduce some abstract concepts which are mentioned or used
in this book. this is material is more advanced but will be interesting to
anybody wanting a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical
structures behind id202.
in all cases below, we assume that the
given set is closed under the operation(s) introduced.

e.1 dual spaces
de   nition a bounded operator is a linear operator    : v     w such that
(cid:107)  v(cid:107)w     c(cid:107)v(cid:107)v where c > 0 is a    xed constant.

let v be a vector space over f, and a functional is a function    : v     f.
de   nition the dual space v     of a vector space v is the vector space of all
bounded linear functionals on v .

there is a natural basis {  i} for v     by   i(ej) =   ij where {ej} is the
canonical (standard) basis for v and   ij is the kronecker delta, which is 1
if i = j and 0 otherwise. concretely for a    nite dimensional vector space
v , we can associate v     with row vectors wt as a functional by the matrix
multiplication wt v for vectors v     v . alternatively we can associated v    
with vectors in v as a functional by taking the usual dot product. so the
basis for v     is et

i or (cid:104)ei, v(cid:105) for vectors v     v .

e.2 groups
de   nition a group is a set g with a single operation    which satis   es the
axioms:

   associativity (a    b)    c = a    (b    c) for all a, b, c     g.
   there exists an identity 1     g.
   there exists an inverse g   1     g for all g     g.

groups can be    nite or in   nite, and notice that not alls element in a
group must commute (i.e., the order of multiplication can matter). here are
some examples of groups:

258

   non-zero real numbers under multiplication.

   all real numbers under addition.
   all invertible n    n real matrices.
   all n    n real matrices of determinant 1.

   all permutations of [1, 2, . . . , n] under compositions.

   any vector space under addition.

note that all real numbers under multiplication is not a group since 0 does
not have an inverse.

e.3 fields
de   nition a    eld f is a set with two operations + and    that for all a, b, c    
f the following axioms are satis   ed:

a1. addition is associative (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

a2. there exists an additive identity 0.

a3. addition is commutative a + b = b + a.
a4. there exists an additive inverse    a.
m1. multiplication is associative (a    b)    c = a    (b    c).

m2. there exists a multiplicative identity 1.
m3. multiplication is commutative a    b = b    a.
m4. there exists a multiplicative inverse a   1 if a (cid:54)= 0.
d. the distributive law holds a    (b + c) = ab + ac.

roughly, all of the above mean that you have notions of +,    ,    and    just
as for regular real numbers.

fields are a very beautiful structure; some examples are q, r, and c. we
note that every one of the these examples are in   nite, however this does not
necessarily have to be the case. let q     0 and let zq be the set of remainders

259

of z (the set of integers) by dividing by q. we say zq is the set of all a
modulo q or a mod q for short or a     q where a     z, and we de   ne addition
and multiplication to be their usual counterparts in z except we take the
result mod q. so for example we have z2 = {0, 1} where 1 + 1 = 2     0 (these
are exactly the bits used in bit matrices) and z3 = {0, 1, 2} with 1 + 1 = 2,
2    2 = 4     1. now if p is a prime number, then zp is a    eld (often written
as zp). clearly z2 is a    eld, and from above for z3 we have 2   1 = 2, so z3
is also a    eld. for z5 we have 2   1 = 3 since 2    3 = 6     1 and 4   1 = 4 since
4    4 = 16     1. often when q = pn where p is a prime, then people will write
fq to reinforce that it is a    eld.

e.4 rings
however z4 is not a    eld since 2    2 = 4     0 and 2    3 = 6     2. similarly
z is not a    eld since 2 does not have a multiplicative inverse. these are
known as rings. for rings all of the addition axioms hold, but none of the
multiplicative ones must.
de   nition a ring r is a set with two operations + and    that for all a, b, c    
r the following axioms are satis   ed:

a1. addition is associative (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

a2. there exists an additive identity 0.

a3. addition is commutative a + b = b + a.
a4. there exists an additive inverse    a.
d. the distributive law holds a  (b+c) = a  b+a  c and (a+b)  c = a  c+b  c.

note that when we have axiom m3, then the two equations in axiom d are
equivalent.

clearly all    elds are rings, but rings in general are not nearly as nice
(for example, in z4 two things can be multiplied together to give you 0). an
important example of a ring is f[x], which is the ring of all polynomials in one
variable x with coe   cients in a    eld f. recall that you can do everything you
want in a    eld except divide polynomials, but if you take the modulus with
respect to a polynomial which is not a product of two smaller polynomials,
you can get a    eld. we call such polynomials irreducible. in other words,

260

one    nal de   nition: we say that a    eld f has characteristic p if(cid:80)p

you take a polynomial p and you set p     0, thus this is just making sure
you don   t have ab     0. for example, the polynomial p(x) = x2 + 1 cannot
be factored over r (i.e. with real coe   cients), so what you get is actually
the same    eld as c since we have x2 + 1 = 0 or perhaps more suggestively
x2 =    1. this is what is known as a    eld extension; these are the central
objects in galois theory and are denoted f(  ) where    is a root of p.
i=1 1    
0 (i.e. we sum 1 together p times and return to 0). for example z3 has
characteristic 3 since 1 + 1 + 1     0, and in general zp has characteristic p.
a good exercise is to    nd an irreducible degree 2 polynomial p in z2[x],
and check that the    eld extension z2(  ) has 4 elements and has characteris-
tic 2 (hence it is not actually z4).

e.5 algebras
de   nition an algebra a is a vector space over f with the operation    such
that for all u, v, w     a and   ,        f, we have

d. the distributive law holds u    (v + w) = u    v + u    w and (u + v)    w =

u    w + v    w.

s. we have (  v)    (  w) = (    )(v    w).

essentially an algebra is a ring that is also a vector space over some    eld.
or in simpler words, an algebra is a vector space where you can multiply
vectors.
for example, all n   n real matrices mn(r) is a ring but we can let scalars
in r act on these matrices in their usual way. another algebra is we can take
mn(r) but take scalars in c and just formally say im is another element
in this algebra. another example is r3 where multiplication is the cross-
product   . we note that this is not associative nor commutative under   
and that v    v = 0 (so there are in fact no multiplicative inverses), and there
is no multiplicative identity. lastly, recall that sln de   ned here is an algebra
under [, ].

261

f sine and cosine as an orthonormal basis
de   nition let         rn for some n. let lp

otherwise |f (x)| < m for some    xed m and all x        .

in particular, we can take s1, the unit circle in r2, and to turn this into
a valid integral, take     = [0, 2  ) and take functions f : [0, 2  ]     r such that
f (0) = f (2  ) (or more generally for a periodic function f : r     r where
f (x) = f (x + 2  n) for all n     z). additionally we can de   ne an inner
product on h = l2

0(s1) by taking

and note that (cid:104)f, f(cid:105) = (cid:107)f(cid:107)2
2. so the natural question to ask is what is a good
basis for h? the answer is sin(nx) and cos(nx) for all n     z   0, and in fact,
they are orthogonal. first note that

now it is not immediately apparent that we haven   t missed some basis vec-

g.2 what is id202: overview

in this course, we start with linear systems

                f1(x1, . . . , xm) = a1

...
fn(x1, . . . , xm) = an ,

...

(3)

and discuss how to solve them.

we end with the problem of finding a least squares fit---find

the line that best fits a given data set:

in equation (3) we have n linear functions called f1, . . . , fn, m
unknowns x1, . . . , xm and n given constants a1, . . . , an. we need to say
what it means for a function to be linear. in one variable, a
linear function obeys the linearity property

f (a + b) = f (a) + f (b) .

the solution to this is

f (x) =   x ,

for some constant   . the plot of this is just a straight line
through the origin with slope   

265

we should also check that our solution obeys the linearity prop-
erty. the logic is to start with the left hand side f (a + b) and
try to turn it into the right hand side f (a) + f (b) using correct
manipulations:

f (a + b) =   (a + b) =   a +   b = f (a) + f (b) .

the first step here just plugs a + b into f (x), the second is the
distributive property, and in the third we recognize that   a = f (a)
and   b = f (b). this proves our claim.

for functions of many variables, linearity must hold for every

slot. for a linear function of two variables f (x, y) this means

f (a + b, c + d) = f (a, c) + f (b, d) .

we finish with a question. the plot of f (x) =   x+   is a straight

line, but does it obey the linearity property?

g.3 what is id202: 3    3 matrix example

your friend places a jar on a table and tells you that there is
65 cents in this jar with 7 coins consisting of quarters, nickels,
and dimes, and that there are twice as many dimes as quarters. your
friend wants to know how many nickels, dimes, and quarters are in
the jar.

we can translate this into a system of the following linear

equations:

5n + 10d + 25q = 65
n + d + q = 7
d = 2q

now we can rewrite the last equation in the form of    d + 2q = 0,
and thus express this problem as the matrix equation

or as an augmented matrix (see also this script on the notation).

now to solve it, using our original set of equations and by sub-
stitution, we have

5n + 20q + 25q = 5n + 45q = 65
n + 2q + q = n + 3q = 7

and by subtracting 5 times the bottom equation from the top, we
get

45q     15q = 30q = 65     35 = 30

and hence q = 1. clearly d = 2, and hence n = 7   2   1 = 4. therefore
there are four nickels, two dimes, and one quarter.

g.4 what is id202: hint

looking at the problem statement we find some important informa-
tion, first that oranges always have twice as much sugar as ap-
ples, and second that the information about the barrel is recorded
as (s, f ), where s = units of sugar in the barrel and f = number of
pieces of fruit in the barrel.

we are asked to find a linear transformation relating this new
representation to the one in the lecture, where in the lecture x =
the number of apples and y = the number of oranges. this means we
must create a system of equations relating the variable x and y to
the variables s and f in matrix form. your answer should be the
matrix that transforms one set of variables into the other.
hint: let    represent the amount of sugar in each apple.

1. to find the first equation find a way to relate f to the

variables x and y.

2. to find the second equation, use the hint to figure out how
much sugar is in x apples, and y oranges in terms of   . then
write an equation for s using x, y and   .

to be equivalent?
they are certainly not equal, because they don   t match in each
component, but since these augmented matrices represent a system,
we might want to introduce a new kind of equivalence relation.

well we could look at the system of linear equations this rep-

resents

x + y = 27
2x     y = 0 ?

and notice that the solution is x = 9 and y = 18. the other

augmented matrix represents the system

x + 0    y = 9
0    x + y = 18 ?

this which clearly has the same solution. the first and second
system are related in the sense that their solutions are the same.
notice that it is really nice to have the augmented matrix in the
second form, because the id127 can be done in your
head.

270

g.7 gaussian elimination: hints for review ques-

tions 4 and 5

the hint for review question 4 is simple--just read the lecture on
elementary row operations.

question 5 looks harder than it actually is:

row equivalence of matrices is an example of an equivalence
relation. recall that a relation     on a set of objects u
is an equivalence relation if the following three properties
are satisfied:

   reflexive: for any x     u , we have x     x.
   symmetric: for any x, y     u , if x     y then y     x.
   transitive: for any x, y and z     u , if x     y and y     z

then x     z.

(for a more complete discussion of equivalence relations, see
webwork homework 0, problem 4)

show that row equivalence of augmented matrices is an equivalence
relation.

firstly remember that an equivalence relation is just a more
general version of       equals      . here we defined row equivalence
for augmented matrices whose linear systems have solutions by the
property that their solutions are the same.

so this question is really about the word same. lets do a silly
example: lets replace the set of augmented matrices by the set of
people who have hair. we will call two people equivalent if they
have the same hair color. there are three properties to check:

   reflexive: this just requires that you have the same hair

color as yourself so obviously holds.

271

   symmetric: if the first person, bob (say) has the same hair
color as a second person betty(say), then bob has the same
hair color as betty, so this holds too.

   transitive: if bob has the same hair color as betty (say) and
betty has the same color as brenda (say), then it follows that
bob and brenda have the same hair color, so the transitive
property holds too and we are done.

g.9 elementary row operations: example

we have three basic rules

1. row swap

2. scalar multiplication

3. row sum

lets look at an example. the system

3x + y = 7
x + 2y = 4

is something we learned to solve in high school algebra. now we

can write it in augmented matrix for this way

(cid:18) 3 1 7

(cid:19)

1 2 4

.

we can see what these operations allow us to do:

1. row swap allows us to switch the order of rows. in this exam-
ple there are only two equations, so i will switch them. this
will work with a larger system as well, but you have to decide
which equations to switch. so we get

the augmented matrix looks like

x + 2y = 4
3x + y = 7

(cid:18) 1 2 4

(cid:19)

3 1 7

.

notice that this won   t change the solution of the system, but
the augmented matrix will look different. this is where we
can say that the original augmented matrix is equivalent to
the one with the rows swapped. this will work with a larger
system as well, but you have to decide which equations, or
rows to switch. make sure that you don   t forget to switch the
entries in the right-most column.

274

2. scalar multiplication allows us to multiply both sides of an

equation by a non-zero constant. so if we are starting with

x + 2y = 4
3x + y = 7

then we can multiply the first equation by    3 which is a non-
zero scalar. this operation will give us

   3x +    6y =    12

3x + y = 7

which has a corresponding augmented matrix

(cid:18)    3    6    12

(cid:19)

3

1

7

.

notice that we have multiplied the entire first row by    3,
and this changes the augmented matrix, but not the solution
of the system. we are not allowed to multiply by zero because
it would be like replacing one of the equations with 0 =
0, effectively destroying the information contained in the
equation.

3. row summing allows us to add one equation to another. in our

example we could start with

   3x +    6y =    12

3x + y = 7

and replace the first equation with the sum of both equations.
so we get

   3x + 3x +    6y + y =    12 + 7

3x + y = 7,

which after some simplification is translates to

(cid:18) 0    5    5

(cid:19)

.

3

1

7

275

when using this row operation make sure that you end up with
as many equations as you started with. here we replaced the
first equation with a sum, but the second equation remained
untouched.

in the example, notice that the x-terms in the first equation
disappeared, which makes it much easier to solve for y. think
about what the next steps for solving this system would be
using the language of elementary row operations.

276

g.10 elementary row operations: worked examples

give rise to the following two (augmented) matrices:

1. we begin by interchanging the first two rows in order to get
a 1 in the upper-left hand corner and avoiding dealing with
fractions.

2. next we subtract row 1 from row 3 and twice from row 2 to get

zeros in the left-most column.

3. then we scale row 2 to have a 1 in the eventual pivot.

4. finally we subtract row 2 from row 1 and three times from row 2

to get it into row-reduced echelon form.

277

therefore we can write x = 1       , y = 0, z =    and w =   , or in
vector form

we scale the second and third rows appropriately in order to avoid
fractions, then subtract the corresponding rows as before. fi-
nally scale the first row and hence we have x = 1 and y = 2 as a
unique solution.

g.11 elementary row operations: explanation of proof

for theorem 3.1

the first thing to realize is that there are choices in the gaus-
sian elimination recipe, so maybe that could lead to two different
rref   s and in turn two different solution sets for the same linear
system. but that would be weird, in fact this theorem says that
this can never happen!

because this proof comes at the end of the section it is often
glossed over, but it is a very important result. here   s a sketch
of what happens in the video:

in words: we start with a linear system and convert it to an aug-
mented matrix. then, because we are studying a uniqueness state-
ment, we try a proof by contradiction. that is the method where
to show that a statement is true, you try to demonstrate that the
opposite of the statement leads to a contradiction.
here, the
opposite statement to the theorem would be to find two different
rrefs for the same system.

suppose, therefore, that alice and bob do find different rref
augmented matrices called a and b. then remove all the non-pivot

elementary row operations: hint for review
question 3

the first part for review question 3 is simple--just write out the
associated linear system and you will find the equation 0 = 6 which
is inconsistent. therefore we learn that we must avoid a row of
zeros preceding a non-vanishing entry after the vertical bar.

turning to the system of equations, we first write out the aug-

mented matrix and then perform two row operations

next we would like to subtract some amount of r2 from r3 to achieve
a zero in the third entry of the second column. but if

k + 6 = 3     k     k =    3

,

this would produce zeros in the third row before the vertical line.
you should also check that this does not make the whole third
line zero. you now have enough information to write a complete
solution.

g.13 solution sets for systems of linear equations:

planes

here we want to describe the mathematics of planes in space. the
video is summarised by the following picture:

a plane is often called r2 because it is spanned by two coordi-
nates, and space is called r3 and has three coordinates, usually
called (x, y, z). the equation for a plane is

ax + by + cz = d .

lets simplify this by calling v = (x, y, z) the vector of unknowns
and n = (a, b, c). using the dot product in r3 we have

n v = d .

remember that when vectors are perpendicular their dot products
vanish. i.e. u v = 0     u     v . this means that if a vector v0
solves our equation n v = d, then so too does v0 + c whenever c
is perpendicular to n . this is because

n (v0 + c) = n v0 + n c = d + 0 = d .

but c is any vector perpendicular to n , so all the possibilities
for c span a plane whose normal vector is n . hence we have shown
that solutions to the equation ax + by + cz = 0 are a plane with
normal vector n = (a, b, c).

282

g.14 solution sets for systems of linear equations:

pictures and explanation

this video considers solutions sets for linear systems with three
unknowns. these are often called (x, y, z) and label points in r3.
lets work case by case:

   if you have no equations at all, then any (x, y, z) is a solu-
tion, so the solution set is all of r3. the picture looks a
little silly:

   for a single equation, the solution is a plane. this is ex-
plained in this video or the accompanying script. the picture
looks like this:

   for two equations, we must look at two planes. these usu-
ally intersect along a line, so the solution set will also
(usually) be a line:

283

   for three equations, most often their intersection will be a

single point so the solution will then be unique:

   of course stuff can go wrong. two different looking equations
could determine the same plane, or worse equations could be
inconsistent. if the equations are inconsistent, there will
be no solutions at all. for example, if you had four equations
determining four parallel planes the solution set would be
empty. this looks like this:

this means we will have to write the solutions for the system in

let x3 =   . then we can rewrite the first equation in our system

x1 + 3x3 = 2
x1 + 3   = 2

x1 = 2     3  .

then since the second equation doesn   t depend on    we can keep the

for the first part of this problem, the key is to consider the

g.17 vectors in space, n-vectors: overview
what is the space rn. in short it is the usual vectors we are used
to. for example, if n = 1, then it is just the number line where we
either move in the positive or negative directions, and we clearly
have a notion of distance. this is something you should understand
well, but ultimately there is nothing really interesting that goes
on here.

luckily when n = 2, things begin to get interesting. it is lucky
for us because we can represent this by drawing arrows on paper.
however what is interesting is that we no longer just have two
directions, but an infinite number which we typically encapsulate
as 0 to 2   radians (i.e. 0 to 360 degrees). recall that the length
of the vector is also known as its magnitude. we can add vectors
by putting them head to toe and we can scale our vectors, and this
concept is useful in physics such as force vector diagrams. so why
is this system r2? the answer comes from trigonometry, and what
i have described is polar coordinates which you should be able to
translate back to the usual cartesian coordinates of (x, y). you
still should be familiar with what things look like here.

now for r3, if we look at this in cartesian coordinates (x, y, z),
this is exactly the same as r2, just we can now move around in
our usual       3d       space by basically being able to draw in the air.
now our notion of direction in somewhat more complicated using
azimuth and altitude (see figure g.17 below), but it is secretly
still there. so we will just use the tuple to encapsulate the data
of it   s direction and magnitude. also we can equivalently write
our tuple (x, y, z) as

      x

      

y
z

so our notation is consistent with id127. thus
for all n     3, we just use the tuple (x1, x2, . . . , xn) to encapsulate
our direction and magnitude and you can just treat vectors in rn
the same way as you would for vectors in r2.

just one final closing remark; i have been somewhat sloppy
through here on points and vectors, so make sure you read the
note: points versus vectors or appendix d.

g.18 vectors in space, n-vectors: review of paramet-

ric notation

the equation for a plane in three variables x, y and z looks like

ax + by + cz = d

where a, b, c, and d are constants. lets look at the example

x + 2y + 5z = 3 .

in fact this is a system of linear equations whose solutions form a
plane with normal vector (1, 2, 5). as an augmented matrix the system
is simply

(cid:16)

1 2 5

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 3
(cid:17)

.

this is actually rref! so we can let x be our pivot variable and
y, z be represented by free parameters   1 and   2:

x =   1 ,

y =   2 .

thus we write the solution as

x =    2  1    5  2 +3
y =   1
z =

g.19 vectors in space, n-vectors: the story of your

life

this video talks about the weird notion of a       length-squared       for
a vector v = (x, t) given by ||v||2 = x2   t2 used in einstein   s theory of
relativity. the idea is to plot the story of your life on a plane
with coordinates (x, t). the coordinate x encodes where an event
happened (for real life situations, we must replace x     (x, y, z)    
r3). the coordinate t says when events happened. therefore you
can plot your life history as a worldline as shown:

each point on the worldline corresponds to a place and time of an
event in your life. the slope of the worldline has to do with your
speed. or to be precise, the inverse slope is your velocity. ein-
stein realized that the maximum speed possible was that of light,
often called c. in the diagram above c = 1 and corresponds to the
lines x =   t     x2     t2 = 0. this should get you started in your
search for vectors with zero length.

291

g.20 vector spaces: examples of each rule
lets show that r2 is a vector space. to do this (unless we in-
vent some clever tricks) we will have to check all parts of the
definition. its worth doing this once, so here we go:

before we start, remember that for r2 we define vector addition

and scalar multiplication component-wise.

(+i) additive closure: we need to make sure that when we add

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)

y2

and
that we do not get something outside the original
vector space r2. this just relies on the underlying structure
of real numbers whose sums are again real numbers so, using
our component-wise addition law we have

+

:=

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:18)x1
(cid:18)x1

x2

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

y2

(cid:18)y1
(cid:18)y1

y2

(cid:19)

+

?=

(cid:19)

y1 + y2

(cid:18)x1 + x2
(cid:19)
(cid:18)y1

+

y2

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

.

    r2 .

(+ii) additive commutativity: we want to check that when we add any

two vectors we can do so in either order, i.e.

this again relies on the underlying real numbers which for
any x, y     r obey

x + y = y + x .

this fact underlies the middle step of the following compu-

tation(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

+

x2

(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)

y2

(cid:18)x1 + y1

(cid:19)

x2 + y2

=

=

(cid:18)y1 + x1

(cid:19)

y2 + x2

(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)

y2

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

=

+

,

which demonstrates what we wished to show.

(+iii) additive associativity: this shows that we needn   t specify
with parentheses which order we intend to add triples of vec-
tors because their sums will agree for either choice. what we
have to check is

(cid:18)(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)(cid:19)

x2

+

y2

+

(cid:18)z1

(cid:19)

z2

?=

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:18)(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)

(cid:18)z1

(cid:19)(cid:19)

+

y2

+

z2

.

292

again this relies on the underlying associativity of real
numbers:

(x + y) + z = x + (y + z) .

the computation required is

(cid:19)(cid:19)
(cid:18)y1
(cid:18)(cid:18)x1
(cid:19)
(cid:18)x1 + (y1 + z1)
(cid:19)

x2

y2

+

x2 + (y2 + z2)

=

+

(cid:19)
(cid:18)z1
(cid:19)
(cid:18)x1

z2

=

=

+

y1

(cid:19)
(cid:18)x1 + y1
(cid:19)
(cid:18)y1 + z1

(cid:18)z1

(cid:19)
(cid:18)(x1 + y1) + z1
(cid:19)(cid:19)
(cid:18)z1
(cid:18)(cid:18)y1

(x2 + y2) + z2

(cid:19)

y2

+

z2

.

+

=

(iv) zero: there needs to exist a vector (cid:126)0 that works the way we

would expect zero to behave, i.e.

it is easy to find, the answer is

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

y1

+ (cid:126)0 =

(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)x1
(cid:18)0
(cid:19)

y1

.

0

(cid:126)0 =

,

(cid:18)x1
(cid:19)
(cid:19)
(cid:18)   x1   x2

x2

you can easily check that when this vector is added to any
vector, the result is unchanged.

(+v) additive inverse: we need to check that when we have

there is another vector that can be added to it so the sum is
(cid:126)0. (note that it is important to first figure out what (cid:126)0 is

here!) the answer for the additive inverse of

is

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)   x1   x2

+

=

(cid:19)

(cid:18)x1     x1

x2     x2

(cid:18)0
(cid:19)

0

=

= (cid:126)0 .

because

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

we are half-way done, now we need to consider the rules for scalar
multiplication. notice, that we multiply vectors by scalars (i.e.
numbers) but do not multiply a vectors by vectors.

293

(  i) multiplicative closure: again, we are checking that an op-
eration does not produce vectors outside the vector space.
for a scalar a     r, we require that a
lies in r2. first
we compute using our component-wise rule for scalars times
vectors:

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

a

=

(cid:18)ax1

(cid:19)

ax2

.

since products of real numbers ax1 and ax2 are again real
numbers we see this is indeed inside r2.

(  ii) multiplicative distributivity: the equation we need to check

is

once again this is a simple lhs=rhs proof using properties of
the real numbers. starting on the left we have

x2

x2

?= a

(cid:19)

(cid:18)x1
(cid:18)x1
(cid:19)
(cid:18)(a + b)x1
(cid:18)ax1
(cid:19)
(cid:18)bx1

(a + b)x2

(cid:19)

=

x2

(cid:19)

+ b

(cid:19)

(cid:18)x1
(cid:18)ax1 + bx1

ax2 + bx2

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

=

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

,

(a + b)

as required.

(  iii) additive distributivity: this time we need to check the equa-

tion the equation we need to check is

(cid:18)(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

(cid:18)y1

(cid:19)(cid:19)

i.e., one scalar but two different vectors. the method is by
now becoming familiar

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

y2

,

again as required.

ax2

294

(  iv) multiplicative associativity. just as for addition, this is
the requirement that the order of bracketing does not matter.
we need to establish whether

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

(cid:18)

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)(cid:19)

x2

.

(a.b)   

?= a   

b   

this clearly holds for real numbers a.(b.x) = (a.b).x. the com-
putation is

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

=

(cid:18)(a.b).x1

(cid:19)

(a.b).x2

(cid:18)a.(b.x1)
(cid:19)

a.(b.x2)

=

(a.b)  

(cid:18)(b.x1)
(cid:19)

(b.x2)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)(cid:19)

x2

,

= a  

b   

= a.

which is what we want.

(  v) unity: we need to find a special scalar acts the way we would

expect       1       to behave. i.e.

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

=

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

.

      1         

there is an obvious choice for this special scalar---just the
real number 1 itself. indeed, to be pedantic lets calculate

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

1   

(cid:18)1.x1

(cid:19)

1.x2

=

=

(cid:18)x1

(cid:19)

x2

.

now we are done---we have really proven the r2 is a vector space
so lets write a little square (cid:3) to celebrate.

295

g.21 vector spaces: example of a vector space

this video talks about the definition of a vector space. even
though the defintion looks long, complicated and abstract, it is
actually designed to model a very wide range of real life situa-
tions. as an example, consider the vector space

v = {all possible ways to hit a hockey puck} .

the different ways of hitting a hockey puck can all be considered
as vectors. you can think about adding vectors by having two play-
ers hitting the puck at the same time. this picture shows vectors
n and j corresponding to the ways nicole darwitz and jenny potter
hit a hockey puck, plus the vector obtained when they hit the puck
together.

you can also model the new vector 2j obtained by scalar multi-
plication by 2 by thinking about jenny hitting the puck twice (or
a world with two jenny potters....). now ask yourself questions
like whether the multiplicative distributive law

2j + 2n = 2(j + n )

make sense in this context.

296

g.22 vector spaces: hint

i will only really worry about the last part of the problem. the
problem can be solved by considering a non-zero simple polynomial,
such as a degree 0 polynomial, and multiplying by i     c. that is
3 and then considering i    p. this
to say we take a vector p     p
will violate one of the vector space rules about scalars, and you
should take from this that the scalar field matters.

as a second hint, consider q (the field of rational numbers).
2 /    q, so it is
this is not a vector space over r since
not closed under scalar multiplication, but it is clearly a vector
space over q.

g.23 linear transformations: a linear and a non-

linear example

this video gives an example of a linear transformation as well as a
transformation that is not linear. in what happens below remember
the properties that make a transformation linear:

l(u + v) = l(u) + l(v)

and

l(cu) = cl(u) .

the first example is the map

via

(cid:18)x

(cid:19)

y

l : r2        r2 ,

(cid:18)2    3

(cid:19)(cid:18)x

(cid:55)   

1

1

y

(cid:19)

.

here we focus on the scalar multiplication property l(cu) = cl(u)
which needs to hold for any scalar c     r and any vector u. the
additive property l(u + v) = l(u) + l(v) is left as a fun exercise.
the calculation looks like this:

(cid:18)

(cid:18)x

(cid:19)(cid:19)

y

l(cu) = l

c

= l

(cid:18)(cid:18)cx
(cid:19)(cid:19)
(cid:18)2x     3y

(cid:18)2cx     3cy
(cid:19)
(cid:18)(cid:18)x
(cid:19)

cx + cy

cy

=

x + y

= cl

y

= c

(cid:19)(cid:19)

= cl(u) .

the first equality uses the fact that u is a vector in r2, next
comes the rule for multiplying a vector by a number, then the
rule for the given linear transformation l is used.
the c is
then factored out and we recognize that the vector next to c is
just our linear transformation again. this verifies the scalar
multiplication property l(cu) = cl(u).

for a non-linear example lets take the vector space r1 = r with

via

l : r        r

x (cid:55)    x + 1 .

this looks linear because the variable x appears once, but the
constant term will be our downfall! computing l(cx) we get:

but on the other hand

l(cx) = cx + 1 ,

cl(x) = c(x + 1) = cx + c .

now we see the problem, unless we are lucky and c = 1 the two
expressions above are not linear. since we need l(cu) = cl(u) for
any c, the game is up! x (cid:55)    x + 1 is not a linear transformation.

g.24 linear transformations: derivative and integral

of (real) polynomials of degree at most 3

for this, we consider the vector space pr
3 of real coefficient
polynomials p such that the degree of deg p is at most 3. let d
denote the usual derivative operator and we note that it is linear,
and we can write this as the matrix

            0 1 0 0
             .

0 0 2 0
0 0 0 3

d =

similarly now consider the map i where i(f ) = (cid:82) f (x) dx is the

indefinite integral on any integrable function f . now we first
note that for any   ,        r, we have

i(      p +       q) =

(cid:90) (cid:0)      p(x) +       q(x)(cid:1) dx
(cid:90)

(cid:90)

=   

p(x) dx +   

q(x) dx =   i(p) +   i(q),

integral instead, so we define i(f ) :=(cid:82) x

so i is a linear map on functions. however we note that this is not
a well-defined map on vector spaces since the additive constant
states the image is not unique. for example i(3x2) = x3 + c where
c can be any constant. therefore we have to perform a definite
0 f (y) dy. the other thing
we could do is explicitly choose our constant, and we note that
this does not necessarily give the same map (ex. take the constant
to be non-zero with polynomials which in-fact will make it non-
linear).

now going to our vector space pr

3 , if we take any p(x) =   x3 +

  x2 +   x +   , then we have

i(p) =

  
2
and we note that this is outside of pr
3 . so to make our image in
pr

g.25 linear transformations: linear transformations

hint

the first thing we see in the problem is a definition of this new
space pn. elements of pn are polynomials that look like

a0 + a1t + a2t2 + . . . + antn

where the ai   s are constants.
so this means if l is a linear
transformation from p2     p3 that the inputs of l are degree two
polynomials which look like

a0 + a1t + a2t2

and the output will have degree three and look like

b0 + b1t + b2t2 + b3t3

we also know that l is a linear transformation, so what does
that mean in this case? well, by linearity we know that we can
separate out the sum, and pull out the constants so we get

l(a0 + a1t + a2t2) = a0l(1) + a1l(t) + a2l(t2)

just this should be really helpful for the first two parts of the
problem. the third part of the problem is asking us to think about
this as a id202 problem, so lets think about how we could
write this in the vector notation we use in the class. we could
write

a0 + a1t + a2t2 as

and think for a second about how you add polynomials, you match
up terms of the same degree and add the constants component-wise.
so it makes some sense to think about polynomials this way, since
vector addition is also component-wise.

      

      a0

a1
a2

       b3

      b0

b1
b2

we could also write the output

b0 + b1t + b2t2 + b3t3 as

302

then lets look at the information given in the problem and think

about it in terms of column vectors

   l(1) = 4 but we can think of the input 1 = 1 + 0t + 0t2 and the

output 4 = 4 + 0t + 0t20t3 and write this as l(

   l(t) = t3 this can be written as l(

      0
      ) =

1
0

   l(t2) = t    1 it might be a little trickier to figure out how to
write t     1 but if we write the polynomial out with the terms
in order and with zeroes next to the terms that do not appear,
we can see that

t     1 =    1 + t + 0t2 + 0t3 corresponds to

so this can be written as l(

      0
      ) =

now to think about how you would write the linear transforma-
tion l as a matrix, first think about what the dimensions of
the matrix would be. then look at the first two parts of this
problem to help you figure out what the entries should be.

g.26 matrices: adjacency matrix example

lets think about a graph as a mini-facebook. in this tiny facebook
there are only four people, alice, bob, carl, and david.

suppose we have the following relationships

   alice and bob are friends.

   alice and carl are friends.

   carl and bob are friends.

   david and bob are friends.

now draw a picture where each person is a dot, and then draw a
line between the dots of people who are friends. this is an example
of a graph if you think of the people as nodes, and the friendships
as edges.
now lets make a 4    4 matrix, which is an adjacency matrix for
the graph. make a column and a row for each of the four people. it
will look a lot like a table. when two people are friends put a 1
the the row of one and the column of the other. for example alice
and carl are friends so we can label the table below.

a
b
c
d

a b c d

1

1

304

we can continue to label the entries for each friendship. here
lets assume that people are friends with themselves, so the diag-
onal will be all ones.

then take the entries of this table as a matrix

a b c d
1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1

a
b
c
d

             1 1 1 0

1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1

            

notice that this table is symmetric across the diagonal, the
same way a multiplication table would be symmetric. this is be-
cause on facebook friendship is symmetric in the sense that you
can   t be friends with someone if they aren   t friends with you too.
this is an example of a symmetric matrix.

you could think about what you would have to do differently to
draw a graph for something like twitter where you don   t have to
follow everyone who follows you. the adjacency matrix might not
be symmetric then.

g.27 matrices: do matrices commute?

this video shows you a funny property of matrices. some matrix
properties look just like those for numbers. for example numbers
obey

and so do matrices:

a(bc) = (ab)c

a(bc) = (ab)c.

this says the order of bracketing does not matter and is called
associativity. now we ask ourselves whether the basic property of
numbers

holds for matrices

ab = ba ,

ab ?= ba .

for this, firstly note that we need to work with square matrices
even for both orderings to even make sense. lets take a simple
2    2 example, let

(cid:18)1 a

(cid:19)

0 1

(cid:19)
(cid:18)1 b
(cid:18)1 a + b

a =

b =

c =

in fact, computing ab and ba we get the same result

so this pair of matrices do commute. lets try a and c:

ab = ba =

(cid:18)1 + a2 a

(cid:19)

a

ac =

so

,

and

ca =

ac (cid:54)= ca

and this pair of matrices does not commute. generally, matrices
usually do not commute, and the problem of finding those that do
is a very interesting one.

g.28 matrices: hint for review question 4

this problem just amounts to remembering that the dot product of
x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) is

x1y1 + x2y2 +        + xnyn .

then try multiplying the above row vector times yt and compare.

307

g.29 matrices: hint for review question 5

the majority of the problem comes down to showing that matrices
are right distributive. let mk is all n    k matrices for any n,
and define the map fr : mk     mm by fr(m ) = m r where r is some
k   m matrix. it should be clear that fr(     m ) = (  m )r =   (m r) =
  fr(m ) for any scalar   . now all that needs to be proved is that

fr(m + n ) = (m + n )r = m r + n r = fr(m ) + fr(n ),

and you can show this by looking at each entry.

we can actually generalize the concept of this problem. let v
be some vector space and m be some collection of matrices, and we
say that m is a left-action on v if

(m    n )     v = m     (n     v)

for all m, n     n and v     v where    denoted multiplication in m
(i.e. standard id127) and     denotes the matrix is
a linear map on a vector (i.e. m (v)). there is a corresponding
notion of a right action where

v     (m    n ) = (v     m )     n

where we treat v    m as m (v) as before, and note the order in which
the matrices are applied. people will often omit the left or right
because they are essentially the same, and just say that m acts
on v .

g.30 properties of matrices: matrix exponential ex-

on vector in the plane.

g.31 properties of matrices: explanation of the proof

in this video we will talk through the steps required to prove

tr m n = tr n m .

there are some useful things to remember, first we can write

where the upper index labels rows and the lower one columns. then

m = (mi
j)

and

n = (ni
j)

m n =(cid:0)(cid:88)

(cid:1) ,

mi

lnl
j

l

where the       open       indices i and j label rows and columns, but the
index l is a       dummy       index because it is summed over. (we could
have given it any name we liked!).

finally the trace is the sum over diagonal entries for which

the row and column numbers must coincide

tr m =

mi
i .

hence starting from the left of the statement we want to prove, we
have

lhs = tr m n =

mi

lnl
i .

next we do something obvious, just change the order of the entries
mi

i (they are just numbers) so

l and nl

equally obvious, we now rename i     l and l     i so

mi

i =

g.32 properties of matrices: a closer look at the

trace function

this seemingly boring function which extracts a single real number
does not seem immediately useful, however it is an example of an
element in the dual-space of all n    n matrices since it is a
bounded linear operator to the underlying field f. by a bounded
operator, i mean it will at most scale the length of the matrix
(think of it as a vector in fn2
) by some fixed constant c > 0 (this
can depend upon n), and for example if the length of a matrix m
is d, then tr(m )     cd (i believe c = 1 should work).

some other useful properties is for block matrices, it should

be clear that we have

tr

(cid:18)a b

(cid:19)

c d

= tr a + tr d.

and that

tr(p ap    1) = tr(cid:0)p (ap    1)(cid:1) = tr(cid:0)(ap    1)p(cid:1) = tr(ap    1p ) = tr(a)

so the trace function is conjugate (i.e. similarity) invariant.
using a concept from chapter 17, it is basis invariant. addition-
ally in later chapters we will see that the trace function can be
used to calculate the determinant (in a sense it is the derivative
of the determinant, see lecture 13 problem 5) and eigenvalues.
additionally we can define the set sln as the set of all n    n
matrices with trace equal to 0, and since the trace is linear and
a  0 = 0, we note that sln is a vector space. additionally we can use
the fact tr(m n ) = tr(n m ) to define an operation called bracket

[m, n ] = m n     n m,

and we note that sln is closed under bracket since

tr(m n     n m ) = tr(m n )     tr(n m ) = tr(m n )     tr(m n ) = 0.

by just thinking about what it means for m to be non-singular and
for a linear function to be well-defined. therefore we assume that
m is singular which implies that there exists a non-zero vector
x0 such that m x0 = 0. now assume there exists some vector xv
such that m xv = v , and look at what happens to xv + c    x0 for
any c in your field. lastly don   t forget to address what happens
if xv does not exist.

inverse matrix: left and right inverses

this video is a hint for question 4 in the inverse matrixlec-
ture 10. in the lecture, only inverses for square matrices were
discussed, but there is a notion of left and right inverses for
matrices that are not square. it helps to look at an example with
bits to see why. to start with we look at vector spaces

2 = {(x, y, z)|x, y, z = 0, 1}
z3

and

z2

2
2 .

these have 8 and 4 vectors, respectively, that can be depicted as
corners of a cube or square:

z3

or z2

now lets consider a linear transformation

l : z3

this must be represented by a matrix, and lets take the example

       =

since we have bits, we can work out what l does to every vector,
this is listed below

l(cid:55)    (1, 1)
l(cid:55)    (1, 1)
l(cid:55)    (1, 1)

now lets think about left and right inverses. a left inverse b to
the matrix a would obey

ba = i

and since the identity matrix is square, b must be 2    3. it would
have to undo the action of a and return vectors in z3
2 to where
they started from. but above, we see that different vectors in z3
2
are mapped to the same vector in z2
2 by the linear transformation
l with matrix a. so b cannot exist. however a right inverse c
obeying

ac = i

can. it would be 2    2. its job is to take a vector in z2

however we now have a problem since 0    c = 0 for any value of c

by swapping the second and third rows of u2 to get u(cid:48)

we just interchange the corresponding rows all columns left of and
including the column we added values to in l2 to get l(cid:48)

gives us a small problem as l(cid:48)
similar matrix m(cid:48) with the second and third rows swapped. in our
original problem m x = v , we also need to make the corresponding
swap on our vector v to get a v (cid:48) since all of this amounts to
changing the order of our two equations, and note that this clearly
does not change the solution. back to our example, we have

g.39 lu decomposition: block ldu explanation

this video explains how to do a block ldu decomposition. firstly
remember some key facts about block matrices: it is important that
the blocks fit together properly. for example, if we have matrices

matrix shape
r    r
r    t
t    r
t    t

x
y
z
w

we could fit these together as a (r + t)   (r + t) square block matrix

m =

(cid:18) x y

(cid:19)(cid:18) x y

z w

z w

m 2 =

(cid:18) x y
(cid:19)

(cid:19)
(cid:18) x 2 + y z xy + y w

z w

.

zx + w z zy + w 2

=

(cid:19)

.

id127 works for blocks just as for matrix entries:

now lets specialize to the case where the square matrix x has an
inverse. then we can multiply out the following triple product
of a lower triangular, a block diagonal and an upper triangular

matrix: (cid:18) i

0
i

(cid:19)(cid:18) x
(cid:18) x
(cid:18)

this shows that the ldu decomposition given in section 11 is

g.40 elementary matrices and determinants: permu-

tations

lets try to get the hang of permutations.
function which scrambles things. suppose we had

a permutation is a

this looks like a function    that has values

  (1) = 3,   (2) = 2,   (3) = 4,   (4) = 1

then we could write this as

(cid:20) 1

2

3

4

  (1)   (2)   (3)   (4)

(cid:21)

(cid:20)1 2 3 4
(cid:21)

3 2 4 1

=

we could write this permutation in two steps by saying that first
we swap 3 and 4, and then we swap 1 and 3.
the order here is
important.

this is an even permutation, since the number of swaps we used

is two (an even number).

g.41 elementary matrices and determinants: some

ideas explained

this video will explain some of the ideas behind elementary matri-
ces. first think back to linear systems, for example n equations

in n unknowns:                                  
               a1

nxn = v1
nxn = v2

...

1 x1 + an

we know it is helpful to store the above information with matrices

v :=

here we will focus on the case the m is square because we are
interested in its inverse m   1 (if it exists) and its determinant
(whose job it will be to determine the existence of m   1).

we know at least three ways of handling this linear system prob-

lem:

1. as an augmented matrix

(cid:0) m v (cid:1) .
(cid:0) i m   1v (cid:1) ,

here our plan would be to perform row operations until the
system looks like

(assuming that m   1 exists).

2. as a matrix equation

m x = v ,

which we would solve by finding m   1 (again, if it exists),
so that

x = m   1v .

324

3. as a linear transformation

via

l : rn        rn

rn (cid:51) x (cid:55)       m x     rn .

in this case we have to study the equation l(x) = v because
v     rn.

lets focus on the first two methods. in particular we want to
think about how the augmented matrix method can give information
about finding m   1. in particular, how it can be used for handling
determinants.

the main idea is that the row operations changed the augmented
matrices, but we also know how to change a matrix m by multiplying
it by some other matrix e, so that m     em . in particular can
we find       elementary matrices       the perform row operations?

once we find these elementary matrices is is very important to
ask how they effect the determinant, but you can think about that
for your own self right now.

lets tabulate our names for the matrices that perform the var-

ious row operations:

g.42 elementary matrices and determinants: hints

for problem 4

here we will examine the inversion number and the effect of the
transposition   1,2 and   2,4 on the permutation    = [3, 4, 1, 2]. recall
that the inversion number is basically the number of items out of
order. so the inversion number of    is 4 since 3 > 1 and 4 > 1 and
3 > 2 and 4 > 2. now we have   1,2   = [4, 3, 1, 2] by interchanging the
first and second entries, and the inversion number is now 5 since
we now also have 4 > 3. next we have   2,4   = [3, 2, 1, 4] whose inversion
number is 3 since 3 > 2 > 1. finally we have   1,2  2,4   = [2, 3, 1, 4] and
the resulting inversion number is 2 since 2 > 1 and 3 > 1. notice
how when we are applying   i,j the parity of the inversion number
changes.

327

g.43 elementary matrices and determinants ii: ele-

mentary determinants

this video will show you how to calculate determinants of elemen-
tary matrices. first remember that the job of an elementary row
matrix is to perform row operations, so that if e is an elementary
row matrix and m some given matrix,

em

is the matrix m with a row operation performed on it.

the next thing to remember is that the determinant of the iden-
tity is 1. moreover, we also know what row operations do to deter-
minants:

   row swap ei

j: flips the sign of the determinant.

   scalar multiplication ri(  ): multiplying a row by    multi-

plies the determinant by   .

   row addition si

j(  ): adding some amount of one row to another

does not change the determinant.

the corresponding elementary matrices are obtained by performing
exactly these operations on the identity:

j =

ri(  ) =

so to calculate their determinants, we just have to apply the above
list of what happens to the determinant of a matrix under row
operations to the determinant of the identity. this yields

det ei

j =    1 ,

det ri(  ) =    ,

det si

j(  ) = 1 .

g.44 elementary matrices and determinants ii: de-

terminants and inverses

lets figure out the relationship between determinants and in-
if we have a system of equations m x = b and we
vertibility.
have the inverse m   1 then if we multiply on both sides we get
x = m   1m x = m   1b. if the inverse exists we can solve for x and
get a solution that looks like a point.

so what could go wrong when we want solve a system of equations
and get a solution that looks like a point? something would go
wrong if we didn   t have enough equations for example if we were
just given

x + y = 1

or maybe, to make this a square matrix m we could write this as

the matrix for this would be m =

x + y = 1
0 = 0

(cid:20)1 1

0 0

(cid:21)

and det(m ) = 0. when we

compute the determinant, this row of all zeros gets multiplied in
every term. if instead we were given redundant equations

the matrix for this would be m =

x + y = 1
2x + 2y = 2

(cid:20)1 1

2 2

(cid:21)

and det(m ) = 0. but we

know that with an elementary row operation, we could replace the
second row with a row of all zeros. somehow the determinant is
able to detect that there is only one equation here. even if we
had a set of contradictory set of equations such as

x + y = 1
2x + 2y = 0,

where it is not possible for both of these equations to be true,
the matrix m is still the same, and still has a determinant zero.

330

lets look at a three by three example, where the third equation

is the sum of the first two equations.

x + y + z = 1
y + z = 1
x + 2y + 2z = 2

and the matrix for this is

m =

0 1 1
1 2 2

      1 1 1
      
       1 1 1
       =

if we were trying to find the inverse to this matrix using ele-

mentary matrices       1 1 1 1 0 0

0 1 1 0 1 0
1 2 2 0 0 1

      

0 0
0 1 1
1 0
0 0 0    1    1 1

1
0

and we would be stuck here. the last row of all zeros cannot be
converted into the bottom row of a 3    3 identity matrix. this
matrix has no inverse, and the row of all zeros ensures that the
determinant will be zero. it can be difficult to see when one of
the rows of a matrix is a linear combination of the others, and what
makes the determinant a useful tool is that with this reasonably
simple computation we can find out if the matrix is invertible,
and if the system will have a solution of a single point or column
vector.

331

g.45 elementary matrices and determinants ii: prod-

uct of determinants

j = rj +   ri for j (cid:54)= i and r(cid:48)

here we will prove more directly that the determinant of a prod-
uct of matrices is the product of their determinants. first we
reference that for a matrix m with rows ri, if m(cid:48) is the matrix
i = ri, then det(m ) = det(m(cid:48))
with rows r(cid:48)
essentially we have m(cid:48) as m multiplied by the elementary row sum
matrices si
j(  ). hence we can create an upper-triangular matrix
u such that det(m ) = det(u ) by first using the first row to set
(cid:55)    0 for all i > 1, then iteratively (increasing k by 1 each
m1
i (cid:55)    0 for all i > k.
i
time) for fixed k using the k-th row to set mk
i ) and
u(cid:48) = (u
i ) is
iu(cid:48)i
upper-triangular and xi
i . also since every permutation would
i ui
i.
let a and a(cid:48) have corresponding upper-triangular matrices u and
u(cid:48) respectively (i.e. det(a) = det(u )), we note that aa(cid:48) has a
corresponding upper-triangular matrix u u(cid:48), and hence we have

contain a lower diagonal entry (which is 0) have det(u ) = (cid:81)

now note that for two upper-triangular matrices u = (uj
(cid:48)j
i ), by id127 we have x = u u(cid:48) = (xj

i = ui

det(aa(cid:48)) = det(u u(cid:48)) =

g.46 properties of the determinant: practice taking

determinants

lets practice taking determinants of 2    2 and 3    3 matrices.

for 2    2 matrices we have a formula

(cid:20)a b

(cid:21)

c d

det

= ad     bc

this formula can be easier to remember when you think about this
picture.

now we can look at three by three matrices and see a few ways
to compute the determinant. we have a similar pattern for 3    3
matrices.

       = ((1  1  1)+(2  2  0)+(3  3  0))   ((3  1  0)+(1  2  0)+(3  2  1)) =    5

consider the example

det

      1 2 3

3 1 2
0 0 1

we can draw a picture with similar diagonals to find the terms that
will be positive and the terms that will be negative.

333

another way to compute the determinant of a matrix is to use
this recursive formula. here i take the coefficients of the first
row and multiply them by the determinant of the minors and the
cofactor. then we can use the formula for a two by two determinant
to compute the determinant of the minors

      1 2 3
       = 1

3 1 2
0 0 1

det

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)3 1

0 0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 1(1   0)   2(3   0)+3(0   0) =    5

decide which way you prefer and get good at taking determinants,
you   ll need to compute them in a lot of problems.

properties of the determinant: the adjoint

in this video we show how the adjoint matrix works in detail for
the 3x3 case. recall, that for a 2    2 matrix

m =

(cid:18)a b
(cid:18) d    b

c d

   c

a

,

(cid:19)

the matrix

n =

had the marvelous property

m n = (det m ) i

(you can easily check this for yourself). we call

the adjoint matrix of m . when the determinant det m (cid:54)= 0, we can
use it to immediately compute the inverse

n := adjm ,

det m
lets now think about a 3    3 matrix

m   1 =

1

the first thing to remember is that we can compute the determinant
by expanding in a row and computing determinants of minors, so

det m = a det

+ c det

we can think of this as the product of a row and column vector

(cid:18)e f

these vanish because the determinant of an matrix with a pair of
equal rows is zero. thus we have found a nice result

notice the answer is the number det m times the first column of
the identity matrix. in fact, the column vector above is exactly
the first column of the adjoint matrix adjm . the rule how to get
the rest of the adjoint matrix is not hard. you first compute the
cofactor matrix obtained by replacing the entries of m with the
signed determinants of the corresponding minors got by deleting
the row and column of the particular entry. for the 3   3 case this

suppose that we were given a set of linear equations lj(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
and we want to find out if lj(x) = vj for all j for some vector
v = (vj). we know that we can express this as the matrix equation

(cid:88)

lj
i xi = vj

i

where lj
i is the coefficient of the variable xi in the equation lj.
however, this is also stating that v is in the span of the vectors
{li}i where li = (lj

i )j. for example, consider the set of equations

2x + 3y     z = 5
   x + 3y + z = 1
x + y     2z = 3

which corresponds to the matrix equation

we can thus express this problem as determining if the vector

lem 2

we want to check whether

x     x3     span{x2, 2x + x2, x + x3}

if you are wondering what it means to be in the span of these
polynomials here is an example

2(x2) + 5(2x + x2)     span{x2, 2x + x2, x + x3}

linear combinations where the polynomials are multiplied by scalars
in r is fine. we are not allowed to multiply the polynomials to-
gether, since in a vector space there is not necessarily a notion
of multiplication for two vectors.

lets put this problem in the language of matrices. since we can
write x2 = 0 + 0x + 1x2 + 0x3 we can write it as a column vector,
where the coefficient of each of the terms is an entry.

there are two ways to do this, one is by finding a r1, r2 and r3 that

r1, r2 and r3 that satisfy this equation, without actually finding
them.

g.51 subspaces and spanning sets: hint

this is a hint for the problem on intersections and unions of
subspaces.

for the first part, try drawing an example in r3:

here we have taken the subspace w to be a plane through the origin
and u to be a line through the origin. the hint now is to think
about what happens when you add a vector u     u to a vector w     w .
does this live in the union u     w ?
suppose that v     u     w and v(cid:48)     u     w . this implies

for the second part, we take a more theoretical approach. lets

v     u and v(cid:48)     u .

so, since u is a subspace and all subspaces are vector spaces, we
know that the linear combination

  v +   v(cid:48)     u .

now repeat the same logic for w and you will be nearly done.

lowing four vectors in r3 consider the following vectors in r3:

v2 =

v3 =

v4 =

       4   1
       ,

3

the example asks whether they are linearly independent, and the
answer is immediate: no, four vectors can never be linearly in-
dependent in r3. this vector space is simply not big enough for
that, but you need to understand the notion of the dimension of a
vector space to see why. so we think the vectors v1, v2, v3 and v4
are linearly dependent, which means we need to show that there is
a solution to

  1v1 +   2v2 +   3v3 +   4v4 = 0

for the numbers   1,   2,   3 and   4 not all vanishing.

to find this solution we need to set up a linear system. writing

out the above linear combination gives

4  1    3  2 +5  3      4 = 0 ,
     1 +7  2 +12  3 +  4 = 0 ,
= 0 .
3  1 +4  2 +17  3

this can be easily handled using an augmented matrix whose columns
are just the vectors we started with

since there are only zeros on the right hand column, we can drop
it. now we perform row operations to achieve rref

  3 =    ,

  4 =    .

in fact this is not just one relation, but infinitely many, for
any choice of   ,   . the relationship quoted in the notes is just
one of those choices.

finally, since the vectors v1, v2, v3 and v4 are linearly depen-
dent, we can try to eliminate some of them. the pattern here is
to keep the vectors that correspond to columns with pivots. for
example, setting    =    1 (say) and    = 0 in the above allows us to
solve for v3 while    = 0 and    =    1 (say) gives v4, explicitly we
get

v3 =

v1 +

v4 =     4

this eliminates v3 and v4 and leaves a pair of linearly independent

g.53 linear independence: proof of theorem 16.1
here we will work through a quick version of the proof. let {vi}
i civi = 0 where
there exists some ck (cid:54)= 0. now without loss of generality we order
our vectors such that c1 (cid:54)= 0, and we can do so since addition is
commutative (i.e. a + b = b + a). therefore we have

c1v1 =     n(cid:88)
v1 =     n(cid:88)

i=2

i=2

civi

ci
c1 vi

and we note that this argument is completely reversible since every
ci (cid:54)= 0 is invertible and 0/ci = 0.

345

g.54 linear independence: hint for problem 1
lets first remember how z2 works. the only two elements are 1 and
0. which means when you add 1 + 1 you get 0. it also means when you
have a vector (cid:126)v     bn and you want to multiply it by a scalar, your
only choices are 1 and 0. this is kind of neat because it means
that the possibilities are finite, so we can look at an entire
vector space.

now lets think about b3 there is choice you have to make for
each coordinate, you can either put a 1 or a 0, there are three
places where you have to make a decision between two things. this
means that you have 23 = 8 possibilities for vectors in b3.

when you want to think about finding a set s that will span
b3 and is linearly independent, you want to think about how many
vectors you need. you will need you have enough so that you can
make every vector in b3 using linear combinations of elements in
s but you don   t want too many so that some of them are linear com-
binations of each other. i suggest trying something really simple
perhaps something that looks like the columns of the identity ma-
trix

for part (c) you have to show that you can write every one of
the elements as a linear combination of the elements in s, this
will check to make sure s actually spans b3.

for part (d) if you have two vectors that you think will span the
space, you can prove that they do by repeating what you did in part
(c), check that every vector can be written using only copies of of
these two vectors. if you don   t think it will work you should show
why, perhaps using an argument that counts the number of possible
vectors in the span of two vectors.

346

g.55 basis and dimension: proof of theorem

lets walk through the proof of this theorem. we want to show that
for s = {v1, . . . , vn} a basis for a vector space v , then every vector
w     v can be written uniquely as a linear combination of vectors
in the basis s:

w = c1v1 +        + cnvn.

we should remember that since s is a basis for v , we know two

things

   v = span s

   v1, . . . , vn are linearly independent, which means that whenever
we have a1v1 + . . . + anvn = 0 this implies that ai = 0 for all
i = 1, . . . , n.

this first fact makes it easy to say that there exist constants ci
such that w = c1v1 +       + cnvn. what we don   t yet know is that these
c1, . . . cn are unique.

in order to show that these are unique, we will suppose that
they are not, and show that this causes a contradiction. so suppose
there exists a second set of constants di such that

w = d1v1 +        + dnvn .

for this to be a contradiction we need to have ci (cid:54)= di for some i.
then look what happens when we take the difference of these two
versions of w:

0v = w     w

= (c1v1 +        + cnvn)     (d1v1 +        + dnvn)
= (c1     d1)v1 +        + (cn     dn)vn.

since the vi   s are linearly independent this implies that ci     di =
(cid:54)= di, which is a
0 for all i, this means that we cannot have ci
contradiction.

g.56 basis and dimension: worked example

in this video we will work through an example of how to extend a
set of linearly independent vectors to a basis. for fun, we will
take the vector space

v = {(x, y, z, w)|x, y, z, w     z5} .

this is like four dimensional space r4 except that the numbers can
only be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. this is like bits, but now the rule is

0 = 5 .

thus, for example, 1
too caught up on this aspect, its a choice of base field designed
to make computations go quicker!

the way to proceed is to add a known (and preferably simple)

            0

the last four vectors are clearly a basis (make sure you understand
this....) and are called the canonical basis. we want to keep v1 and
v2 but find a way to turf out two of the vectors in the canonical
basis leaving us a basis of four vectors. to do that, we have
to study linear independence, or in other words a linear system
problem defined by

0 =   1e1 +   2e2 +   3v1 +   4v2 +   5e3 +   6e4 .

the pivots are underlined. the columns corresponding to non-pivot
variables are the ones that can be eliminated--their coefficients
(the      s) will be arbitrary, so set them all to zero save for the
one next to the vector you are solving for which can be taken to
be unity. thus that vector can certainly be expressed in terms of
previous ones. hence, altogether, our basis is

g.57 basis and dimension: hint for problem 2
since there are two possible values for each entry, we have |bn| =
2n. we note that dim bn = n as well. explicitly we have b1 =

and so choosing any two non-zero vectors will form a basis. now
in general we note that we can build up a basis {ei} by arbitrarily
(independently) choosing the first i     1 entries, then setting the
i-th entry to 1 and all higher entries to 0.

351

g.58 eigenvalues and eigenvectors: worked example

lets consider a linear transformation
l : v        w

where a basis for v is the pair of vectors {   ,   } and a basis
for w is given by some other pair of vectors {(cid:37),(cid:45)}. (don   t be
afraid that we are using arrows instead of latin letters to denote
vectors!) to test your understanding, see if you know what dim v
and dim w are. now suppose that l does the following to the basis
vectors in v

    l(cid:55)    a (cid:37) + c (cid:45)=: l(   ) ,

    l(cid:55)    b (cid:37) + d (cid:45)=: l(   ) .

now arrange l acting on the basis vectors in a row vector (this
will be a row vector whose entries are vectors).

(cid:0)l(   ) l(   )(cid:1) =(cid:0)a (cid:37) + c (cid:45) b (cid:37) + d (cid:45)(cid:1) .
(cid:0)l(   ) l(   )(cid:1) =(cid:0) (cid:37) (cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:18)a b

.

now we rewrite the right hand side as a matrix acting from the
right on the basis vectors in w :

the matrix on the right is the matrix of l with respect to this
pair of bases.
v     v . such a v can be written

we can also write what happens when l acts on a general vector

v = x     + y     .

first we compute l acting on this using linearity of l

l(v) = l(x     + y    )

and then arrange this as a row vector (whose entries are vectors)
times a column vector of numbers

l(v) =(cid:0)l(   ) l(   )(cid:1)(cid:18)x

(cid:19)

.

can you compute what happens to the matrix of l?

remember that an eigenvector v with eigenvalue    for m will be
a vector such that m v =   v i.e. m (v)       i(v) = (cid:126)0. when we are
talking about a nonzero v then this means that det(m       i) = 0.
we will start by finding the eigenvalues that make this statement
true.

after computing this determinant det(m       i) = (4       )(3       )     2    1
we set this equal to zero to find values of    that make this true.

(4       )(3       )     2    1 = 10     7   +   2 = (2       )(5       ) = 0

which means that    = 2 and    = 5 are solutions. now if we want to
find the eigenvectors that correspond to these values we look at
vectors v such that

consider the matrix

j2 =

,

and we note that we can just read off the eigenvector e1 with
eigenvalue   .
however the characteristic polynomial of j2 is
pj2(  ) = (        )2 so the only possible eigenvalue is   , but we claim
it does not have a second eigenvector v. to see this, we require
that

  v1 + v2 =   v1
  v2 =   v2

which clearly implies that v2 = 0. this is known as a jordan 2-
cell, and in general, a jordan n-cell with eigenvalue    is (similar
to) the n    n matrix

which has a single eigenvector e1.

m =

and we see that pm (  ) = (       3)2(       2). therefore for    = 3 we need
to find the solutions to (m     3i3)v = 0 or in equation form:

v2 = 0
v3 = 0
   v3 = 0,

356

and we immediately see that we must have v = e1. next for    = 2,
we need to solve (m     2i3)v = 0 or

v1 + v2 = 0
v2 + v3 = 0
0 = 0,

and thus we choose v1 = 1, which implies v2 =    1 and v3 = 1. hence
this is the only other eigenvector for m .

this is a specific case of problem 20.5.

eigenvalues and eigenvectors are extremely important.
video we review the theory of eigenvalues.
transformation

in this
consider a linear

l : v        v

where dim v = n <    .
represent l by a square matrix m by choosing a basis for v .

since v is finite dimensional, we can

so the eigenvalue equation

becomes

lv =   v

m v =   v,

where v is a column vector and m is an n  n matrix (both expressed
in whatever basis we chose for v ).
the scalar    is called an
eigenvalue of m and the job of this video is to show you how to
find all the eigenvalues of m .

the first step is to put all terms on the left hand side of the

equation, this gives

(m       i)v = 0 .

notice how we used the identity matrix i in order to get a matrix
times v equaling zero. now here comes a very important fact

n u = 0 and u (cid:54)= 0        det n = 0.

i.e., a square matrix can have an eigenvector with vanishing eigenvalue if
and only if its determinant vanishes! hence

det(m       i) = 0.

358

the quantity on the left (up to a possible minus sign) equals the
so-called characteristic polynomial

pm (  ) := det(  i     m ) .

it is a polynomial of degree n in the variable   . to see why, try
a simple 2    2 example

= (a       )(d       )     bc ,

which is clearly a polynomial of order 2 in   . for the n    n case,
the order n term comes from the product of diagonal matrix elements
also.

there is an amazing fact about polynomials called the funda-
mental theorem of algebra: they can always be factored over complex
numbers. this means that degree n polynomials have n complex roots
(counted with multiplicity). the word can does not mean that ex-
plicit formulas for this are known (in fact explicit formulas can
only be give for degree four or less). the necessity for complex
numbers is easily seems from a polynomial like

z2 + 1

whose roots would require us to solve z2 =    1 which is impossible
for real number z. however, introducing the imaginary unit i with

i2 =    1 ,

we have

z2 + 1 = (z     i)(z + i) .

returning to our characteristic polynomial, we call on the funda-
mental theorem of algebra to write

pm (  ) = (         1)(         2)       (         n) .

the roots   1,   2,...,  n are the eigenvalues of m (or its underly-
ing linear transformation l).

a vector that satisfies v = m v. consider that eigenvectors are a
possibility, but think what would the eigenvalue have to be? if
you found a v(0) with this property would cv(0) for a scalar c also
work? remember that eigenvectors have to be nonzero, so what if
c = 0?

for part (c) if we tried an eigenvector would we have restric-

we note that this transforms into an infinite jordan cell with
eigenvalue 0 or

which is in the basis {n   1xn}n (where for n = 0, we just have 1).
therefore we note that 1 (constant polynomials) is the only eigen-
vector with eigenvalue 0 for polynomials since they have finite
degree, and so the derivative is not diagonalizable. note that
we are ignoring infinite cases for simplicity, but if you want to
consider infinite terms such as convergent series or all formal
power series where there is no conditions on convergence, there
are many eigenvectors. can you find some? this is an example of
how things can change in infinite dimensional spaces.

you can easily check that the only eigenvector is 1 with eigenvalue
0 since d always lowers the degree of a polynomial by 1 each time
it is applied. note that this is a nilpotent matrix since d4 = 0,
but the only nilpotent matrix that is       diagonalizable       is the 0

g.65 diagonalization: change of basis example

this video returns to our first example of a barrel filled with
fruit

as a demonstration of changing basis.

since this was a linear systems problem, we can try to represent
what   s in the barrel using a vector space. the first representa-
tion was the one where (x, y) = (apples, oranges):

oranges

(x, y)

apples

calling the basis vectors (cid:126)e1 := (1, 0) and (cid:126)e2 := (0, 1), this represen-
tation would label what   s in the barrel by a vector

(cid:126)x := x(cid:126)e1 + y(cid:126)e2 =(cid:0)(cid:126)e1 (cid:126)e2

(cid:1)(cid:18)x

(cid:19)

y

.

since this is the method ordinary people would use, we will call
this the       engineer   s       method!

363

but this is not the approach nutritionists would use.

they

would note the amount of sugar and total number of fruit (s, f ):

fruit

(s, f )

sugar

warning: to make sense of what comes next you need to allow for the
possibity of a negative amount of fruit or sugar. this would be
just like a bank, where if money is owed to somebody else, we can
use a minus sign.

the vector (cid:126)x says what is in the barrel and does not depend which
mathematical description is employed. the way nutritionists label
(cid:126)x is in terms of a pair of basis vectors (cid:126)f1 and (cid:126)f2:

(cid:16) (cid:126)f1

(cid:17)(cid:18)s

(cid:19)

(cid:126)f2

.

f

(cid:126)x = s (cid:126)f1 + f (cid:126)f2 =

thus our vector space now has a bunch of interesting vectors:

the vector (cid:126)x labels generally the contents of the barrel. the
vector (cid:126)e1 corresponds to one apple and one orange. the vector (cid:126)e2 is

364

we can easily invert this to get

one orange and no apples. the vector (cid:126)f1 means one unit of sugar and
zero total fruit (to achieve this you could lend out some apples
and keep a few oranges). finally the vector (cid:126)f2 represents a total
of one piece of fruit and no sugar.

you might remember that the amount of sugar in an apple is called

   while oranges have twice as much sugar as apples. thus

(cid:26) s =    (x + 2y)

f = x + y .

essentially, this is already our change of basis formula, but lets
play around and put it in our notations. first we can write this
as a matrix

putting this in the engineer   s formula for (cid:126)x gives

(cid:126)x =(cid:0)(cid:126)e1 (cid:126)e2

we can also go the other direction, changing from the nutrition-
ist   s basis to the engineer   s basis

of course, we must have

q = p    1 ,

(which is in fact how we constructed p in the first place).

finally, lets consider the very first linear systems problem,
where you were given that there were 27 pieces of fruit in total
and twice as many oranges as apples. in equations this says just

x + y = 27 and 2x     y = 0 .

but we can also write this as a matrix system

now the matrix m is the matrix of some linear transformation l in

ture 21

this video gives a hint for problem 2 in lecture 21. you are asked
to consider an orthogonal basis {v1, v2, . . . vn}. because this is a
basis any v     v can be uniquely expressed as
v = c1v1 + c2v2 +        + vncn ,

and the number n = dim v . since this is an orthogonal basis

vi vj = 0 ,

i (cid:54)= j .

so different vectors in the basis are orthogonal:

however, the basis is not orthonormal so we know nothing about the
lengths of the basis vectors (save that they cannot vanish).

to complete the hint, lets use the dot product to compute a

formula for c1 in terms of the basis vectors and v. consider

v1 v = c1v1 v1 + c2v1 v2 +        + cnv1 vn = c1v1 v1 .

solving for c1 (remembering that v1 v1 (cid:54)= 0) gives

c1 =

v1 v
v1 v1

this should get you started on this problem.

(a) is the vector v    = v     u  v

u  uu in the plane p ?

remember that the dot product gives you a scalar not a vector,
so if you think about this formula u  v
u  u is a scalar, so this is
a linear combination of v and u. do you think it is in the
span?

(b) what is the angle between v    and u?

this part will make more sense if you think back to the dot
product formulas you probably first saw in multivariable cal-
culus. remember that

u    v = (cid:107)u(cid:107)(cid:107)v(cid:107) cos(  ),

and in particular if they are perpendicular    =   
you will get u    v = 0.

(c) given your solution to the above, how can you find a third

vector perpendicular to both u and v   ?
remember what other things you learned in multivariable cal-
culus? this might be a good time to remind your self what the
cross product does.

(d) construct an orthonormal basis for r3 from u and v.

if you did part (c) you can probably find 3 orthogonal vectors
to make a orthogonal basis. all you need to do to turn this
into an orthonormal basis is turn those into unit vectors.

(e) test your abstract formulae starting with

u =(cid:0)1 2 0(cid:1) and v =(cid:0)0 1 1(cid:1) .

try it out, and if you get stuck try drawing a sketch of the

g.71 gram-schmidt and orthogonal complements: overview

this video depicts the ideas of a subspace sum, a direct sum and an
orthogonal complement in r3. firstly, lets start with the subspace
sum. remember that even if u and v are subspaces, their union
u     v is usually not a subspace. however, the span of their union
certainly is and is called the subspace sum
u + v = span(u     v ) .

you need to be aware that this is a sum of vector spaces (not
vectors). a picture of this is a pair of planes in r3:

here u + v = r3.
next lets consider a direct sum. this is just the subspace sum
for the case when u     v = {0}. for that we can keep the plane u
but must replace v by a line:

taking a direct sum we again get the whole space, u     v = r3.

now we come to an orthogonal complement. there is not really a
notion of subtraction for subspaces but the orthogonal complement
comes close. given u it provides a space u    such that the direct
sum returns the whole space:

u     u    = r3 .

376

the orthogonal complement u    is the subspace made from all vectors
perpendicular to any vector in u . here, we need to just tilt the
line v above until it hits u at a right angle:

notice, we can apply the same operation to u    and just get u back
again, i.e.

(cid:0)u   (cid:1)   

= u .

g.72 gram-schmidt and orthogonal complements: qr

decomposition example

we can alternatively think of the qr decomposition as performing
the gram-schmidt procedure on the column space, the vector space
of the column vectors of the matrix, of the matrix m . the re-
sulting orthonormal basis will be stored in q and the negative
of the coefficients will be recorded in r. note that r is upper
triangular by how gram-schmidt works. here we will explicitly do
an example with the matrix

first we normalize m1 to get m(cid:48)

for problem 1

this video shows you a way to solve problem 1 that   s different to
the method described in the lecture. the first thing is to think

v3 =

as a set of 3 vectors

then you need to remember that we are searching for a decomposition

m = qr

where q is an orthogonal matrix. thus the upper triangular matrix
r = qt m and qt q = i. moreover, orthogonal matrices perform
rotations. to see this compare the inner product u v = ut v of
vectors u and v with that of qu and qv:

(qu) (qv) = (qu)t (qv) = ut qt qv = ut v = u v .

since the dot product doesn   t change, we learn that q does not
change angles or lengths of vectors.

now, here   s an interesting procedure: rotate v1, v2 and v3 such
that v1 is along the x-axis, v2 is in the xy-plane. then if you put
these in a matrix you get something of the form

which is exactly what we want for r!

moreover, the vector

is ab and must equal v1 v2 = 0. (that v1 and v2 were orthogonal is
just a coincidence here... .) thus b = 0. so now we know most of
the matrix r

you can work out the last column using the same ideas. thus it only
remains to compute q from

q = m r   1 .

be orthogonal, which means that the inverse of the matrix p will
be easy to compute. we can start by finding the eigenvalues of

about what values a     r can take if a =    a? part (c), just compute

for part (d), note that x   x is just a number, so we can divide by
it. parts (e) and (f) follow right from definitions. for part (g),
first notice that every row vector is the (unique) transpose of a
column vector, and also think about why (aat )t = aat for any
matrix a. additionally you should see that xt = x    and mention
this. finally for part (h), show that

g.76 kernel, range, nullity, rank: invertibility con-

ditions

here i am going to discuss some of the conditions on the invert-
ibility of a matrix stated in theorem 24.6. condition 1 states
that x = m   1v uniquely, which is clearly equivalent to 4. sim-
ilarly, every square matrix m uniquely corresponds to a linear
transformation l : rn     rn, so condition 3 is equivalent to con-
dition 1.

condition 6 implies 4 by the adjoint construct the inverse, but
the converse is not so obvious. for the converse (4 implying 6), we
refer back the proofs in chapter 18 and 19. note that if det m = 0,
there exists an eigenvalue of m equal to 0, which implies m is not
invertible. thus condition 8 is equivalent to conditions 4, 5, 9,
and 10.

the map m is injective if it does not have a null space by
definition, however eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0 form a basis
for the null space. hence conditions 8 and 14 are equivalent,
and 14, 15, and 16 are equivalent by the dimension formula (also
known as the rank-nullity theorem).

now conditions 11, 12, and 13 are all equivalent by the defi-
nition of a basis. finally if a matrix m is not row-equivalent
to the identity matrix, then det m = 0, so conditions 2 and 8 are
equivalent.

385

g.77 kernel, range, nullity, rank: hint for 1

lets work through this problem.

let l : v     w be a linear transformation. show that ker l = {0v }

if and only if l is one-to-one:

1. first, suppose that ker l = {0v }. show that l is one-to-one.
remember what one-one means, it means whenever l(x) = l(y) we
can be certain that x = y. while this might seem like a weird
thing to require this statement really means that each vector
in the range gets mapped to a unique vector in the range.

we know we have the one-one property, but we also don   t want to
forget some of the more basic properties of linear transfor-
mations namely that they are linear, which means l(ax + by) =
al(x) + bl(y) for scalars a and b.
what if we rephrase the one-one property to say whenever l(x)   
l(y) = 0 implies that x     y = 0? can we connect that to the
statement that ker l = {0v }? remember that if l(v) = 0 then
v     ker l = {0v }.

2. now, suppose that l is one-to-one. show that ker l = {0v }.
that is, show that 0v is in ker l, and then show that there
are no other vectors in ker l.

what would happen if we had a nonzero kernel? if we had some
vector v with l(v) = 0 and v (cid:54)= 0, we could try to show that
this would contradict the given that l is one-one. if we found
x and y with l(x) = l(y), then we know x = y. but if l(v) = 0
then l(x) + l(v) = l(y). does this cause a problem?

386

g.78 least squares: hint for problem 1
lets work through this problem. let l : u     v be a linear trans-
formation. suppose v     l(u ) and you have found a vector ups that
obeys l(ups) = v.

explain why you need to compute ker l to describe the solution

space of the linear system l(u) = v.

remember the property of linearity that comes along with any
linear transformation: l(ax + by) = al(x) + bl(y) for scalars a and
b. this allows us to break apart and recombine terms inside the
transformation.
now suppose we have a solution x where l(x) = v. if we have an
vector y     ker l then we know l(y) = 0. if we add the equations
together l(x) + l(y) = l(x + y) = v + 0 we get another solution for
free. now we have two solutions, is that all?

387

g.79 least squares: hint for problem 2
for the first part, what is the transpose of a 1    1 matrix? for
the other two parts, note that v v = vt v. can you express this in
terms of (cid:107)v(cid:107)? also you need the trivial kernel only for the last
part and just think about the null space of m . it might help to
substitute w = m x.
