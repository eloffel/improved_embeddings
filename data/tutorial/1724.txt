a complete guide on getting started with deep learning in python

   [97]faizan shaikh, august 31, 2016

introduction

   deep learning, a prominent topic in artificial intelligence domain, has
   been in the spotlight for quite some time now. it is especially known
   for its breakthroughs in fields like id161 and game playing
   (alpha go), surpassing human ability. since the last survey, there has
   been a drastic increase in the trends. ([98]click here to check out the
   survey)


   here is what google trends shows us:

   [99]dl_trends

   if you are interested in the topic here   s an excellent
   [100]non-technical introduction. if you are interested to know the
   recent trends, here   s a [101]great compilation.

   here our aim is to provide a learning path to all those who are new to
   deep learning and also the ones who want to explore it further. so are
   you ready to step onto the journey of conquering deep learning? let   s
   go!


step 0 : pre-requisites

   it is recommended that before jumping on to deep learning, you should
   know the basics of machine learning. the [102]learning path on machine
   learning is a complete resource to get you started in the field.

   if you want a shorter version, here it is:
     * basics of math (resource 1: [103]   math | khan academy    (especially
       calculus, id203 and id202))
     * basics of python (resource: [104]   intro to computer science   , edx
       course)
     * basics of statistics (resource: [105]   intro to stats   , udacity
       course)
     * basics of machine learning (resource: [106]   intro to machine
       learning   , udacity course)


   timeline : suggested: 2-6 months


step 1 : setup your machine

   before going on to the next step, make sure you have the supported
   hardware. it is generally recommended that you should have atleast
     * a good enough gpu (4+ gb), preferably nvidia
     * an ok cpu (eg. intel core i3 is ok, intel pentium may not be)
     * 4 gb ram or depending upon the dataset.

   if you are still unsure, go through this [107]hardware guide.

   ps: if you are a hardcore gamer (not just candy crushers obviously!),
   you may already have the required hardware.

   if you don   t have the required specifications, you could either buy it
   or lease an [108]amazon web service instance. here   s a good guide for
   using [109]aws for deep learning.

   note: do not install any deep learning libraries at this stage, do it
   on step 3.


step 2 : a shallow dive

   now that you have a good enough knowledge of pre-requisites, you should
   go on further into understanding deep learning.

   as per your preference you could follow:
     * blog approach : (resource 1: [110]   fundamentals of deep learning   ,
       resource 2: [111]   hacker   s guide to neural networks   )
     * video approach : [112]   deep learning simplified   
     * textbook approach : ([113]   neural networks and deep learning   )

   along with the pre-requisites, you should get to know the popular deep
   learning libraries and the languages for running them. here   s a
   (non-comprehensive) list (check the wiki page for a more
   [114]comprehensive list):
     * [115]caffe
     * [116]deeplearning4j
     * [117]tensorflow
     * [118]theano
     * [119]torch

   some other notable libraries include [120]mocha, [121]neon, [122]h2o,
   [123]mxnet, [124]keras, [125]lasagne, [126]nolearn. here   s a list of
   [127]deep learning libraries by language.

   check out [128]lecture 12 of stanford   s cs231n course for a brief
   overview of some of the popular libraries.


   timeline : suggested 1-3 weeks


step 3 : choose your own adventure!

   now comes the interesting part! deep learning has been applied in
   various fields with state-of-the-art results. to get a taste of this
   side of the moon, you, the reader, gets to choose which path to take.
   this should be a hands-on experience, so that you get a proper
   foundation on what you have understood until now.

   note: each path contains a primer blog, a practical project, the
   required deep learning library for the project and an assisting course.
   first go through the primer, then install the required libraries and
   get on with the project. if you face any difficulties along the way,
   use the associated course to back you up.
     * deep learning for id161
          + primer : [129]   dl for id161    blog.
          + project : [130]   facial keypoint detection    tutorial
          + required libraries : [131]nolearn
          + associated course : [132]   cs231n: convolutional neural
            networks for visual recognition   
     * deep learning for natural language processing
          + primer : [133]   deep learning, nlp, and representations    blog.
          + project :    deep learning for chatbots   : [134]   part 1   ,
            [135]   part 2   
          + required library : [136]tensorflow
          + associated course : [137]   cs224d: deep learning for natural
            language processing   
     * deep learning for speech/audio
          + primer : [138]   deep speech: lessons from deep learning    news
            article and corresponding video.
          + project : [139]   music generation using magenta (tensorflow)   
          + required library : [140]magenta
          + associated course : [141]   deep learning (spring 2016), cilvr
            [email protected]   
     * deep learning for id23
          + primer and project : [142]   deep id23: pong
            from pixels   
          + required library : no deep learning library required. although
            you do require [143]openai gym to test your model.
          + associated course : [144]   cs294: deep id23   


   timeline : suggested 1-2 months


step 4 : deep dive into deep learning

   now you are (almost) ready to make a dent in deep learning hall of
   fame! the path ahead is long and deep (pun intended) and mostly
   unexplored. now it is upto you to make use of this newly acquired skill
   as efficiently as you can. here are some tips you should do to hone
   your skill.
     * reiterate the above step with a different adventure.
     * deep learning for none of the above! (eg. [145]dl for trading,
       [146]dl for optimizing energy efficiency)
     * use your newly learned skills to build something ([147]remember,
       with great power; comes great responsibility)
     * test your deep learning skills (eg. [148]kaggle)
     * participate in deep learning community. (eg. [149]google group,
       [150]dl subreddit)
     * follow recent researches / researchers. (eg. [151]   re.work dl
       summit   )


   timeline : suggested     infinity!

   read as much as you can. to gain expertise in working in neural network
   try out our deep learning practice problem     [157]identify the digits.

   once you have an understanding of deep learning and its associated
   concepts, take the [158]deep learning skill test. the way deep learning
   is gaining recognition it is important to be familiar with it.

   good luck! did you like reading this article? do you follow a different
   approach / package / library to get started with deep learning? i   d
