   by [28]michael nielsen / oct 2018

   neural networks and deep learning is a free online book. the book will
   teach you about:
     * neural networks, a beautiful biologically-inspired programming
       paradigm which enables a computer to learn from observational data
     * deep learning, a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural
       networks

   neural networks and deep learning currently provide the best solutions
   to many problems in image recognition, id103, and natural
   language processing. this book will teach you many of the core concepts
   behind neural networks and deep learning.

   for more details about the approach taken in the book, [29]see here. or
   you can jump directly to [30]chapter 1 and get started.
