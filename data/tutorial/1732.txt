spacy: industrial-strength nlp

   spacy is a library for advanced natural language processing in python
   and cython. it's built on the very latest research, and was designed
   from day one to be used in real products. spacy comes with
   [128]pre-trained statistical models and word vectors, and currently
   supports id121 for 45+ languages. it features the fastest
   syntactic parser in the world, convolutional neural network models for
   tagging, parsing and id39 and easy deep learning
   integration. it's commercial open-source software, released under the
   mit license.

        version 2.1 out now! [129]check out the release notes here.

     where to ask questions

   the spacy project is maintained by [146]@honnibal and [147]@ines.
   please understand that we won't be able to provide individual support
   via email. we also believe that help is much more valuable if it's
   shared publicly, so that more people can benefit from it.

install spacy

   for detailed installation instructions, see the [157]documentation.
     * operating system: macos / os x    linux    windows (cygwin, mingw,
       visual studio)
     * python version: python 2.7, 3.5+ (only 64 bit)
     * package managers: [158]pip    [159]conda (via conda-forge)

pip

   using pip, spacy releases are available as source packages and binary
   wheels (as of v2.0.13).
pip install spacy

   when using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a
   virtual environment to avoid modifying system state:
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install spacy

conda

   thanks to our great community, we've finally re-added conda support.
   you can now install spacy via conda-forge:
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install spacy

   for the feedstock including the build recipe and configuration, check
   out [160]this repository. improvements and pull requests to the recipe
   and setup are always appreciated.

updating spacy

   some updates to spacy may require downloading new statistical models.
   if you're running spacy v2.0 or higher, you can use the validate
   command to check if your installed models are compatible and if not,
   print details on how to update them:
pip install -u spacy
python -m spacy validate

   if you've trained your own models, keep in mind that your training and
   runtime inputs must match. after updating spacy, we recommend
   retraining your models with the new version.

        for details on upgrading from spacy 1.x to spacy 2.x, see the
   [161]migration guide.

download models

   as of v1.7.0, models for spacy can be installed as python packages.
   this means that they're a component of your application, just like any
   other module. models can be installed using spacy's download command,
   or manually by pointing pip to a path or url.
   documentation
   [162]available models detailed model descriptions, accuracy figures and
   benchmarks.
   [163]models documentation detailed usage instructions.
# download best-matching version of specific model for your spacy installation
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# out-of-the-box: download best-matching default model
python -m spacy download en

# pip install .tar.gz archive from path or url
pip install /users/you/en_core_web_sm-2.1.0.tar.gz
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_
web_sm-2.1.0/en_core_web_sm-2.1.0.tar.gz

loading and using models

   to load a model, use spacy.load() with the model name, a shortcut link
   or a path to the model data directory.
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(u"this is a sentence.")

   you can also import a model directly via its full name and then call
   its load() method with no arguments.
import spacy
import en_core_web_sm

nlp = en_core_web_sm.load()
doc = nlp(u"this is a sentence.")

        for more info and examples, check out the [164]models documentation.

support for older versions

   if you're using an older version (v1.6.0 or below), you can still
   download and install the old models from within spacy using python -m
   spacy.en.download all or python -m spacy.de.download all. the .tar.gz
   archives are also [165]attached to the v1.6.0 release. to download and
   install the models manually, unpack the archive, drop the contained
   directory into spacy/data and load the model via spacy.load('en') or
   spacy.load('de').

compile from source

   the other way to install spacy is to clone its [166]github repository
   and build it from source. that is the common way if you want to make
   changes to the code base. you'll need to make sure that you have a
   development environment consisting of a python distribution including
   header files, a compiler, [167]pip, [168]virtualenv and [169]git
   installed. the compiler part is the trickiest. how to do that depends
   on your system. see notes on ubuntu, os x and windows for details.
# make sure you are using the latest pip
python -m pip install -u pip
git clone https://github.com/explosion/spacy
cd spacy

python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
export pythonpath=`pwd`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

   compared to regular install via pip, [170]requirements.txt additionally
   installs developer dependencies such as cython. for more details and
   instructions, see the documentation on [171]compiling spacy from source
   and the [172]quickstart widget to get the right commands for your
   platform and python version.

ubuntu

   install system-level dependencies via apt-get:
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev git

macos / os x

   install a recent version of [173]xcode, including the so-called
   "command line tools". macos and os x ship with python and git
   preinstalled.

windows

   install a version of the [174]visual c++ build tools or [175]visual
   studio express that matches the version that was used to compile your
   python interpreter. for official distributions these are vs 2008
   (python 2.7), vs 2010 (python 3.4) and vs 2015 (python 3.5).

run tests

   spacy comes with an [176]extensive test suite. in order to run the
   tests, you'll usually want to clone the repository and build spacy from
   source. this will also install the required development dependencies
   and test utilities defined in the requirements.txt.

   alternatively, you can find out where spacy is installed and run pytest
   on that directory. don't forget to also install the test utilities via
   spacy's requirements.txt:
python -c "import os; import spacy; print(os.path.dirname(spacy.__file__))"
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
python -m pytest <spacy-directory>

   see [177]the documentation for more details and examples.
