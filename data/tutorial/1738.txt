  abstract

   how to find patterns in large graphs, spanning giga and tera bytes?
   what are the best tools from matrix algebra, and how can they help us
   solve graph mining problems? these are exactly the goals of this
   tutorial. matrix algebra and id207 can offer powerful tools and
   theorems, like svd, spectral analysis, community detection, and more;
   we single out the most useful tools, we show the intuition behind them,
   and we give one or more practical settings that each tool performed
   well. we also cover the emerging map/reduce architecture, and its
   impact on large graph mining.
