   a great overview of principal component analysis (pca), with an example
   application in the field of nutrition.

the problem


   imagine that you are a nutritionist trying to explore the nutritional
   content of food. what is the best way to differentiate food items? by
   vitamin content? protein levels? or perhaps a combination of both?

                             emoji food pyramid

   knowing the variables that best differentiate your items has several
   uses:

   1. visualization. using the right variables to plot items will give
   more insights.

   2. uncovering clusters. with good visualizations, hidden categories or
   clusters could be identified. among food items for instance, we may
   identify broad categories like meat and vegetables, as well as
   sub-categories such as types of vegetables.

   the question is, how do we derive the variables that best differentiate
   items?

definition


   principal components analysis (pca) is a technique that finds
   underlying variables (known as principal components) that best
   differentiate your data points. principal components are dimensions
   along which your data points are most spread out:

                                pca intro.png

   a principal component can be expressed by one or more existing
   variables. for example, we may use a single variable     vitamin c     to
   differentiate food items. because vitamin c is present in vegetables
   but absent in meat, the resulting plot (below, left) will differentiate
   vegetables from meat, but meat items will clumped together.

   to spread the meat items out, we can use fat content in addition to
   vitamin c levels, since fat is present in meat but absent in
   vegetables. however, fat and vitamin c levels are measured in different
   units. so to combine the two variables, we first have
   to normalize them, meaning to shift them onto a uniform standard scale,
   which would allow us to calculate a new variable     vitamin c minus fat.
   combining the two variables helps to spread out both vegetable and meat
   items.

   the spread can be further improved by adding fiber, of which vegetable
   items have varying levels. this new variable     (vitamin c + fiber)
   minus fat     achieves the best data spread yet.

                   test variable combinations for pca.png

   while in this demonstration we tried to derive principal components by
   trial-and-error, pca does this by systematic computation.
