          example of id28 in python using scikit-learn

   back in april, i provided a worked example of a [11]real-world linear
   regression problem using r. these types of examples can be useful for
   students getting started in machine learning because they demonstrate
   both the machine learning workflow and the detailed commands used to
   execute that workflow.

my id28 example

   this time around, i wanted to provide a machine learning example in
   python using the ever-popular [12]scikit-learn module. for my [13]data
   science class, i worked through a classification problem using logistic
   regression and [14]posted my results online in an ipython notebook.
   here are the steps demonstrated in this example:
     * loading a dataset from statsmodels into a pandas dataframe
     * exploring the data using pandas
     * visualizing the data using matplotlib
     * preparing the data for id28 using patsy
     * building a id28 model using scikit-learn
     * model evaluation using cross-validation from scikit-learn

   after [15]viewing the notebook online, you can easily [16]download the
   notebook and re-run this code on your own computer, especially because
   the dataset i used is built into statsmodels.

publishing your own ipython notebook

   much like r markdown documents, [20]ipython notebooks are a great way
   to weave together your code, output, and explanation into a single
   document that can be shared with others via the [21]ipython notebook
   viewer. and unlike r markdown documents, ipython notebooks are fully
   interactive once download by a user. making a notebook accessible via
   the notebook viewer is as simple as posting your .ipynb file to a
   publicly accessible url (such as a github repo or a [22]gist), and
   pasting the link to that file on the notebook viewer homepage.

   if you're just getting started in python, i highly recommend
   downloading the [23]anaconda distribution of python 2.7 since it
   already contains all of the most popular python modules for data
   analysis and scientific computing.
