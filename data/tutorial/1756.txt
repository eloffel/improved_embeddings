icml 2010 tutorial on id20
   _______________________________________________________________________

overview of id20

   almost anyone who has deployed machine learning systems in the real
   world has encountered the task of id20: we build our
   models from some fixed source domain, but we wish to deploy them across
   one or more different target domains.  for example, large-scale speech
   recognition systems need to work well across arbitrary speech,
   regardless of background noise or accents.  text processing systems
   trained on news often need to be applied to blogs or forum posts.  gene
   finders are trained on a particular organism, but often we wish to
   identify the genes of another organism or even group of organisms.
   face recognition systems might be trained under certain pose, lighting,
   and occlusion settings, but applied to arbitrary sets of pose,
   lighting, and occlusion.  the purpose of this tutorial is to introduce
   participants to the problem of id20, the variety of forms
   it takes, the techniques that have been used to solve it, and our
   current understanding of when these techniques can and cannot work.  we
   hope that our tutorial leads to new and interesting work on the open
   questions of id20.
