                                lecture notes

          + [11]week 1: vectors, vector spaces, span, linear independence,
            bases (corrected, aug 19 2008; thanks to radhakrishna
            bettadapura for the correction) [further correction, jul 16
            2014: on page 25, last sentence of third paragraph, "course"
            should be "of course", and on page 35, "which both spans s"
            should be "which both spans v". thanks to luqing ye for the
            correction.] [further correction, aug 8 2014: on page 17,
            first bullet point, "every vector in v is also a vector in w"
            should be "every vector in w is also a vector in v", and a
            right parenthesis is missing in the first paragraph. thanks to
            cristhian gonzales for the correction.] [further correction,
            sep 10 2015: in the third bullet point on page 3, all
            occurrences of 1/m should be m.]
          + [12]week 2: dimension, lagrange interpolation, linear
            transformations
          + [13]week 3: null spaces, range, co-ordinate bases, matrix
            representation, composition (corrected, oct 23) [further
            correction: in the dimension theorem on page 6, "dim(t) should
            be dim(v)". thanks to hannah kim for the correction.] [further
            correction, sep 10 2015: on page 22, "eisenstein" should be
            "einstein".]
          + [14]week 4: id127, invertibility, isomorphisms
            (corrected, oct 28) [further errata (nov 21, 2016): in the
            last line of page 15, "invertible" should be "injective".
            thanks to sasha illarionov for the correction.]
          + [15]week 5: co-ordinate change, midterm review [correction,
            may 2016: on page 2, in the first example, the column vector
            (4, -1) should instead be (4,1). thanks to wilson sov for the
            correction.]
          + [16]week 6: review of elementary row operations, rank,
            determinants (corrected, nov 25)
          + [17]week 7: eigenvalues, eigenvectors, diagonalization
            (corrected, nov 25. further correction, jul 26 2017: in the
            fourth display of page 4, the matrix entries reading -c and -b
            should be swapped. thanks to lin yubin for the correction.)
          + [18]week 8: characteristic polynomials, inner products
            (corrected, dec 1) [further correction, nov 17 2010: on the
            bottom of page 24, the subscript 2 on the norm of w should not
            be present. thanks to michael smith for the correction.]
          + [19]week 9: norms, orthogonal bases, orthognalization,
            orthogonal complements[correction: on the end of page 3, all
            series starting with v_2 should instead start with v_1].
          + [20]week 10: adjoints, normal and self-adjoint operators,
            final review note that the material on adjoints, normal
            operators, and self-adjoint operators will not be covered in
            the final, but this material is still worth reading,
            especially if you are taking math 115b or any other course
            which requires 115a as a prerequisite. [further correction,
            oct 26 2010: on page 2, example 3, "thu" should be "thus", and
            on page 19, "ahve" should be "have". on page 3, in the
            statement of the riesz representation theorem, "w \in w"
            should be "w \in v"; also, a right bracket is missing in the
            middle of the proof. thanks to michael smith, yu cao, and
            shijia yu for the corrections.]
            ___________________________________________________________

                         sample exams and solutions

          + [21]sample midterm. and [22]solutions (note: this is from an
            honors class of 115a; i've toned down the difficulty a bit,
            but this is still more challenging than the actual midterm).
          + [23]actual midterm and [24]solutions. (corrected, nov 8)
          + [25]sample final. note: "kernel" is the same thing as "null
            space". for the purposes of this class, the field of scalars f
            can always taken to be the real numbers r. question 6 is a
            little tricky, and questions 7,8 should be skipped altogether
            (they cover some material not covered in this course, and
            besides q7 has some typos). solutions are available [26]here.
          + [27]another practice final. note that this is from a 115ah
            course and so covers some material beyond what is covered in
            this course. in particular, questions 4,5,6,10 require
            material not covered in this course, question 12 uses material
            from the week 10 notes (which are not covered in the final),
            and question 8 is doable but may be a little tricky for a
            non-honors class. however, the other questions give a
            reasonable indication of what to expect on this class's final.
          + [28]solution to homework 1.
          + [29]solution to homework 2.
