   [1]more and more of life is now manifested online, and many of the
   digital traces that are left by human activity are increasingly
   recorded in natural-language format. this research-oriented course
   examines the opportunities for natural language processing to
   contribute to the analysis and facilitation of socially embedded
   processes. possible topics include analysis of online conversations,
   learning social-network structure, analysis of text in political or
   legal domains, review aggregation systems.

prerequisites, course selection, enrollment

   prerequisites all of the following: cs 2110 or equivalent programming
   experience; a course in artificial intelligence or any relevant
   subfield (e.g., nlp, information retrieval, machine learning);
   proficiency with using machine learning tools (e.g., fluency at
   training an id166, knowledge of how to assess a classifier   s performance
   using cross-validation)

   enrollment cs/is phd students may enroll online. other students
   interested in adding the course, (wel)come to the first day of class.
   enrollment questions will be addressed then, when we have a better
   sense of what the demand is and how many cs/is phd students are
   interested in taking the class.

   choosing among nlp courses: how do i know which one is right for me?

   in 2015-2016, we are blessed with a plethora of nlp-related offerings!

   at the graduate level:
     * if you are interested in extracting information and meaning from
       text through machine learning techniques, then consider taking
       [2]cs6740/is6300, advanced language technologies (offered spring
       2016. to get a feel for that the course will be like, see [3]the
       fall 2012 offering).
     * if you are interested in studying formal representation of language
       meaning, and designing algorithms to learn to map sentences to such
       representations, then consider taking [4]cs6741, structured
       prediction for natural language processing (offered fall 2015).
     * if you are interested in exploring the social aspects of language
       and its role in online interactions, then consider taking
       [5]cs6742, natural language processing and social interaction
       (offered fall 2015. to get a feel for what the course will be like,
       see the [6]fall 2014 offering).
     * all three courses fulfill the same cs graduate course requirements.
       if you are truly passionate about nlp research, we would love to
       see you in all of these courses!

   #1

   course overview


   [14]a1 released: pilot empirical study for a research idea based on the
   given readings.
   #2 - #4

   lecture topics related to the a1 readings: online reviews: individual
   expression, community dynamics; online asynchronous conversations.

   case studies to explore some topics and research styles find
   interesting. get-to-know-you exercises to get everyone familiar and
   comfortable with each other.

   next 6 meetings, not counting presentations or discussions

   lectures on, potentially, linguistic coordination, linguistic
   adaptation, influence, persuasion, diffusion, discourse structure,
   advanced id38

   foundational material

   potentially some assignments based on the lectures.
   next large block of meetings

   dicussion of proposed projects based on the readings

   practice with fast research-idea generation. feedback as to what
   proposals are most interesting, most feasible, etc.

   discussion of student project proposals, based on the readings for that
   class meeting. each class meeting thus involves everyone reading at
   least one of the two assigned papers and posting a new research
   proposal based on the reading to piazza.

   thoughtfulness and creativity are most important to , but take
   feasibility into account.
   remainder of the course

   activities related to course projects

   development of a "full-blown" research project (although time
   restrictions may limit ambitions). for our purposes, "interesting" is
   more important than "thorough".


   some time in december (to be determined by the registrar): final
   project writeup due

   grading of most interest to is productive research-oriented discussion
   participation (in class and on piazza), interesting research proposals
   and pilot studies, and a good-faith final research project.

   academic integrity academic and scientific integrity compels one to
   properly attribute to others any work, ideas, or phrasing that one did
   not create oneself. to do otherwise is fraud.

   we emphasize certain points here. in this class, talking to and helping
   others is strongly encouraged. you may also, with attribution, use the
   code from other sources. the easiest rule of thumb is, acknowledge the
   work and contributions and ideas and words and wordings of others. do
   not copy or slightly reword portions of papers, wikipedia articles,
   textbooks, other students' work, stack overflow answers, something you
   heard from a talk or a conversation or saw on the internet, or anything
   else, really, without acknowledging your sources. see
   [15]http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6742/2011sp/handouts/ack-others
   .pdf and[16] http://www.theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/acadinteg/ for
   more information and useful examples.

   this is not to say that you can receive course credit for work that is
   not your own     e.g., taking someone else's report and putting your name
   at the top, next to the other person(s)' names. however, violations of
   academic integrity (e.g., fraud) undergo the academic-integrity hearing
   process on top of any grade penalties imposed, whereas not following
   the rules of the assignment only risk grade penalties.

   nov 26: thanksgiving break
   #27 dec 1: project presentations (mandatory attendance by all students
   for the whole session)

   assignments/announcements
     * schedule has been emailed. we'll end slightly later than usual ---
       11:30, but will make up for it by ending early next session.

   #28 dec 3: project presentations (mandatory attendance by all students
   for the whole session)

   assignments/announcements
     * schedule has been emailed.

   final project description due: december 9, 4:30pm on cms. (date
   determined by the registrar)

   the main evaluation criteria will be the reasonableness (in approach
   and amount of effort), thoughtfulness, and creativity of what you
   tried, as documented in your writeup. individual effort within team
   projects will be taken into account; see item 3 below.
    1. use the [296]icwsm style files provided by aaai (latex style and
       bib files, word template)
         a. we make this requirement to facilitate submission to icwsm
            2016. however, note that your final-project submission should
            have your names and acknowledgments included, in a particular
            format (see item 1c amd 2b below); in contrast, you will want
            to strip any identifying information for icwsm submissions.
         b. aaai prefers non-numbered section headings. you may change the
            style files to include section numbers in your headings for
            the purposes of cs6742 submission.
         c. for the author heading, list only the names of your teammates
            that are enrolled in the class, even if you had external
            collaborators. (reason: only students in the class are
            submitting the paper for a grade.) but see item 2b1 below.
    2. include the following sections:
         a. "content" sections: abstract, introduction/motivation, data
            description (how you gathered, cleaned, and processed it),
            methods, an experiments, related work, references, conclusions
            (what you learned), directions for future work.
               o make sure that your introduction section explicitly sets
                 out your hypothesis or hypotheses.
               o throughout, highlight your most interesting findings
                 (positive or negative).
               o for the purposes of cs6742 submission, your related-work
                 section does not need to be exhaustive; you may cover
                 just a few most-related papers.
         b. an "acknowledgments" section: give the name and state the
            contribution of those who you received significant help from.
            (this may or may not include your advisor(s), one or both of
            your instructors, fellow students in the class).
              1. authorship statement: if you intend to ask or have
                 already arranged to have people other than your
                 cs6742-enrolled teammates, also name each such person.
    3. projects done collaboratively must also include a section
       describing who did what. external collaborators should be included
       in this enumeration.
    4. use the number of pages you feel is appropriate.
