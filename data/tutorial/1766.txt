   making better use of the crowd
   tutorial information for nips 2016, acl 2017, and kdd 2017
   instructor: [1]jenn wortman vaughan

overview

   over the last decade, id104 has been used to harness the power
   of human computation to solve tasks that are notoriously difficult to
   solve with computers alone, such as determining whether or not an image
   contains a tree, rating the relevance of a website, or verifying the
   phone number of a business.

   the machine learning and natural language processing communities were
   early to embrace id104 as a tool for quickly and inexpensively
   obtaining the vast quantities of labeled data needed to train systems.
   once this data is collected, it can be handed off to algorithms that
   learn to make autonomous predictions or actions.

   usually this handoff is where interaction with the crowd ends. the
   crowd provides the data, but the ultimate goal is to eventually take
   humans out of the loop. are there better ways to make use of the crowd?

   in this tutorial, i will showcase innovative uses of id104 that
   go beyond the collection of data. i will also dive into recent research
   aimed at understanding who crowdworkers are, how they behave, and what
   this should teach us about best practices for interacting with the
   crowd.

   the innovations i'll discuss fall into three categories:
     * applications to machine learning and/or natural language processing
       that go beyond the collection of data. for example, the crowd can
       be used to generate kernels by providing information about object
       similarity, or to debug the large and complex machine learning
       models used in fields like id161 and id103.
     * hybrid intelligence systems. these    human in the loop    ai systems
       leverage the complementary strengths of humans and machines in
       order to achieve more than either could achieve alone. while the
       study of hybrid intelligence systems is relatively new, there are
       already compelling examples that suggest its great potential for
       applications like real-time on-demand closed captioning of
       day-to-day conversations and crowd-powered writing and editing.
     * large scale studies of human behavior online. id104 is
       gaining popularity among social scientists who use platforms like
       amazon mechanical turk to quickly and easily recruit large pools of
       subjects for behavioral experiments. such experiments can benefit
       computer science too. with the rise of social computing, computer
       scientists can no longer ignore the effects of human behavior when
       reasoning about the performance of computer systems. experiments
       allow us to better model this human behavior, which leads to better
       designed algorithms and systems.

   in the second half of the tutorial, i will talk about one of the most
   obvious and important yet often overlooked aspects of id104:
   the crowd is made of people.

   i'll discuss recent research   both qualitative and quantitative   that has
   opened up the black box of id104 to uncover that crowdworkers
   are not independent contractors, but rather a network with a rich
   communication structure.

   i'll cover experiments that explored how to boost the quality of
   crowdwork using both well-designed monetary incentives (such as
   performance-based payments) and intrinsic motivation (such as
   gamification or a sense of doing good).

   finally, i'll discuss what this research can teach us about how to most
   effectively interacting with the crowd. (hint: be respectful, be
   responsive, be clear.)

   despite the inclusion of best practices and tips, this tutorial should
   not be viewed as a prescriptive guide for applying existing techniques.
   the goals of the tutorial are to inspire you to find novel ways of
   using id104 in your own research and to provide you with the
   resources you need to avoid common pitfalls when you do.

target audience

   this tutorial is open to anyone who wants to learn more about cutting
   edge research in id104. no assumptions will be made about your
   familiarity with either id104 or specific machine learning
   techniques. anyone who is curious is welcome to attend!
