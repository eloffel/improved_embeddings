   what is the potential of machine learning over the next 5-10 years? and
   how can we develop this technology in a way that benefits everyone?

   the royal society   s machine learning project has been investigating
   these questions, and has launched a report setting out the action
   needed to maintain the uk   s role in advancing this technology while
   ensuring careful stewardship of its development.

   machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that allows
   computer systems to learn from examples, data, and experience. through
   enabling computers to perform specific tasks intelligently, machine
   learning systems can carry out complex processes by learning from data,
   rather than following pre-programmed rules.

   recent years have seen exciting advances in machine learning, which
   have raised its capabilities across a suite of applications. many
   people now interact with systems based on machine learning every day,
   for example in image recognition systems, such as those used on social
   media; voice recognition systems, used by virtual personal assistants;
   and recommender systems, such as those used by online retailers. as the
   field develops further, machine learning promises to support
   potentially transformative advances in a range of areas, and the social
   and economic opportunities which follow are significant.

   the royal society   s programme of work on machine learning has been
   investigating the potential of this technology over the next 5-10
   years, and the barriers to realising that potential.

   [68]catch up on the royal society's you and ai events, exploring how
   machine learning affects our lives.
