deep learning tutorials[12]  

   deep learning is a new area of machine learning research, which has
   been introduced with the objective of moving machine learning closer to
   one of its original goals: artificial intelligence. see these course
   notes for a [13]brief introduction to machine learning for ai and an
   [14]introduction to deep learning algorithms.

   deep learning is about learning multiple levels of representation and
   abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and
   text. for more about deep learning algorithms, see for example:

     * the monograph or review paper [15]learning deep architectures for
       ai (foundations & trends in machine learning, 2009).
     * the icml 2009 workshop on learning feature hierarchies [16]webpage
       has a [17]list of references.
     * the lisa [18]public wiki has a [19]reading list and a
       [20]bibliography.
     * geoff hinton has [21]readings from 2009   s [22]nips tutorial.

   the tutorials presented here will introduce you to some of the most
   important deep learning algorithms and will also show you how to run
   them using [23]theano. theano is a python library that makes writing
   deep learning models easy, and gives the option of training them on a
   gpu.

   the algorithm tutorials have some prerequisites. you should know some
   python, and be familiar with numpy. since this tutorial is about using
   theano, you should read over the [24]theano basic tutorial first. once
   you   ve done that, read through our [25]getting started chapter     it
   introduces the notation, and downloadable datasets used in the
   algorithm tutorials, and the way we do optimization by stochastic
   id119.

   the code is available on the [26]deep learning tutorial repositories.

   the purely supervised learning algorithms are meant to be read in
   order:

    1. [27]id28 - using theano for something simple
    2. [28]multilayer id88 - introduction to layers
    3. [29]deep convolutional network - a simplified version of lenet5

   the unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms can be read in
   any order (the auto-encoders can be read independently of the rbm/dbn
   thread):

     * [30]auto encoders, denoising autoencoders - description of
       autoencoders
     * [31]stacked denoising auto-encoders - easy steps into unsupervised
       pre-training for deep nets
     * [32]restricted id82s - single layer generative rbm
       model
     * [33]id50 - unsupervised generative pre-training of
       stacked rbms followed by supervised fine-tuning

   building towards including the mcrbm model, we have a new tutorial on
   sampling from energy models:

     * [34]hmc sampling - hybrid (aka hamiltonian) monte-carlo sampling
       with scan()

   building towards including the contractive auto-encoders tutorial, we
          have the code for now:

          + [35]contractive auto-encoders code - there is some basic doc
            in the code.

   recurrent neural networks with id27s and context window:

          + [36]id29 of speech using recurrent net

   lstm network for id31:

          + [37]lstm network

   energy-based recurrent neural network (id56-rbm):

          + [38]modeling and generating sequences of polyphonic music

   segmentation for medical imagery (meant to be read in order):

          + [39]fully convolutional networks (fcn) for 2d segmentation
          + [40]u-net
          + [41]1d segmentation

   note that the tutorials here are all compatible with python 2 and 3,
   with the exception of [42]modeling and generating sequences of
   polyphonic music with the id56-rbm which is only available for python 2,
   like the tutorials in medical imagery segmentation.

   if you work with conda, [43]these command-line guidelines may also help
   you run segmentation tutorials.
