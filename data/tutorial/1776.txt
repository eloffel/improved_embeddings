welcome[25]  

   theano is a python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
   evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays
   efficiently. theano features:
     * tight integration with numpy     use numpy.ndarray in theano-compiled
       functions.
     * transparent use of a gpu     perform data-intensive computations much
       faster than on a cpu.
     * efficient symbolic differentiation     theano does your derivatives
       for functions with one or many inputs.
     * speed and stability optimizations     get the right answer for
       log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.
     * dynamic c code generation     evaluate expressions faster.
     * extensive unit-testing and self-verification     detect and diagnose
       many types of errors.

   theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive
   scientific investigations since 2007. but it is also approachable
   enough to be used in the classroom (university of montreal   s [26]deep
   learning/machine learning classes).

   you can watch a quick (20 minute) introduction to theano given as a
   talk at [37]scipy 2010 via streaming (or downloaded) video:

   [38]transparent gpu computing with theano. james bergstra, scipy 2010,
   june 30, 2010.

download[39]  

   theano is now [40]available on pypi, and can be installed via
   easy_install theano, pip install theano or by downloading and unpacking
   the tarball and typing python setup.py install.

   those interested in bleeding-edge features should obtain the latest
   development version, available via:
git clone git://github.com/theano/theano.git

   you can then place the checkout directory on your $pythonpath or use
   python setup.py develop to install a .pth into your site-packages
   directory, so that when you pull updates via git, they will be
   automatically reflected the    installed    version. for more information
   about installation and configuration, see [41]installing theano.

citing theano[46]  

   if you use theano for academic research, you are highly encouraged
   (though not required) to cite the following, most recent paper:
     * theano development team. [47]   theano: a python framework for fast
       computation of mathematical expressions   . ([48]short bibtex,
       [49]full bibtex)

   theano is primarily developed by academics, and so citations matter a
   lot to us. as an added benefit, you increase theano   s exposure and
   potential user (and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all
   users of theano. thanks in advance!

   see our [50]theano citation policy for details.

documentation[51]  

   roughly in order of what you   ll want to check out:
     * [52]installing theano     how to install theano.
     * [53]theano at a glance     what is theano?
     * [54]tutorial     learn the basics.
     * [55]troubleshooting     tips and tricks for common debugging.
     * [56]api documentation     theano   s functionality, module by module.
     * [57]frequently asked questions     a set of commonly asked questions.
     * [58]optimizations     guide to theano   s graph optimizations.
     * [59]extending theano     learn to add a type, op, or graph

     * [63]acknowledgements     what we took from other projects.
     * [64]related projects     link to other projects that implement new
       functionalities on top of theano

   you can download the latest [65]pdf documentation, rather than reading
   it online.

   check out how theano can be used for machine learning: [66]deep
   learning tutorials.

   theano was featured at [67]scipy 2010.

community[68]  

      thank you for correcting it so quickly. i wish all packages i worked
   with would have such an active maintenance - this is as good as it gets
   :-)

help![79]  

how to seek help[80]  

   the appropriate venue for seeking help depends on the kind of question
   you have.
     * how do i?     [81]theano-users mailing list or [82]stackoverflow
     * i got this error, why?     [83]theano-users mailing list or
       [84]stackoverflow (please include the full error message, even if
       it   s long)
     * i got this error and i   m sure it   s a bug     [85]github ticket
     * i have an idea/request     post the suggestion to [86]theano-dev or,
       even better, implement the idea and submit a [87]github pull
       request!
     * why do you?     [88]theano-users mailing list (not appropriate for
       stackoverflow)
     * when will you?     [89]theano-dev mailing list (not appropriate for
       stackoverflow)

   please do take some time to search for similar questions that were
   asked and answered in the past. if you find something similar that
   doesn   t fully answer your question, it can be helpful to say something
   like    i found x but it doesn   t address facet y    and link to the
   previous discussion.

   when asking questions on stackoverflow, please use the theano tag, so
   your question can be found, and follow stackoverflow   s guidance on
   [90]asking questions. consider also using the python and numpy tags,
   especially if you are unsure which library your problem relates to.

   it   s often helpful to include the following details with your question:
     * if you have an error, the full error message, even if it   s long
     * which versions of python and theano you   re using
     * whether you   re using a cpu or gpu device
     * details of your theano configuration settings (you can print this
       in python via [91]print theano.config)

   spending the time to create a minimal specific example of a problem is
   likely to get you to an answer quicker than posting something quickly
   that has too much irrelevant detail or is too vague. a minimal example
   may take you a bit more time to create but the first response is more
   likely to be the answer you need than, rather than a frustrated request
   for clarification.

how to provide help[92]  

   if you see a question on the [93]theano-users mailing list, or on
   [94]stackoverflow, that you feel reasonably confident you know an
   answer to, please do support the community by helping others.

   we were all newbies to theano once and, as the community expands, there
   is a constant stream of new theano users looking for help. perhaps you
   asked a question when you were first starting out? now you can pay it
   forward by helping others. it   s also a good way to reinforce your own
   theano knowledge.

   often it   s easiest to answer a question directly but sometimes it may
   be better to refer people to a good answer that was provided in the
   past. pointing people to relevant sections in the documentation, or to
   a theano tutorial, can also be helpful.

   when answering questions please [95]be nice (as always!) and, on
   stackoverflow, follow their guidance for [96]answering questions.
