title:id76: algorithms and complexity

   authors:[29]s  bastien bubeck
   (submitted on 20 may 2014 ([30]v1), last revised 16 nov 2015 (this
   version, v2))

     abstract: this monograph presents the main complexity theorems in
     id76 and their corresponding algorithms. starting
     from the fundamental theory of black-box optimization, the material
     progresses towards recent advances in structural optimization and
     stochastic optimization. our presentation of black-box optimization,
     strongly influenced by nesterov's seminal book and nemirovski's
     lecture notes, includes the analysis of cutting plane methods, as
     well as (accelerated) id119 schemes. we also pay special
     attention to non-euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include
     frank-wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their
     relevance in machine learning. we provide a gentle introduction to
     structural optimization with fista (to optimize a sum of a smooth
     and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox
     (nemirovski's alternative to nesterov's smoothing), and a concise
     description of interior point methods. in stochastic optimization we
     discuss stochastic id119, mini-batches, random coordinate
     descent, and sublinear algorithms. we also briefly touch upon convex
     relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to
     round solutions, as well as id93 based methods.
