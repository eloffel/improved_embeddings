   abstract

   this unique book provides a comprehensive introduction to the most
   popular syntax-based id151 models, filling a
   gap in the current literature for researchers and developers in human
   language technologies. while phrase-based models have previously
   dominated the field, syntax-based approaches have proved a popular
   alternative, as they elegantly solve many of the shortcomings of
   phrase-based models. the heart of this book is a detailed introduction
   to decoding for syntax-based models.

   the book begins with an overview of synchronous-id18
   (sid18) and synchronous tree-substitution grammar (stsg) along with
   their associated statistical models. it also describes how three
   popular instantiations (hiero, samt, and ghkm) are learned from
   parallel corpora. it introduces and details hypergraphs and associated
   general algorithms, as well as algorithms for decoding with both tree
   and string input. special attention is given to efficiency, including
   search approximations such as id125 and cube pruning, data
   structures, and parsing algorithms. the book consistently highlights
   the strengths (and limitations) of syntax-based approaches, including
   their ability to generalize phrase-based translation units, their
   modeling of specific linguistic phenomena, and their function of
   structuring the search space.
