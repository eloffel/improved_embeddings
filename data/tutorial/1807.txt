   abstract

   thanks to the availability of texts on the web in recent years,
   increased knowledge and information have been made available to broader
   audiences. however, the way in which a text is written   its vocabulary,
   its syntax   can be difficult to read and understand for many people,
   especially those with poor literacy, cognitive or linguistic
   impairment, or those with limited knowledge of the language of the
   text. texts containing uncommon words or long and complicated sentences
   can be difficult to read and understand by people as well as difficult
   to analyze by machines. automatic text simplification is the process of
   transforming a text into another text which, ideally conveying the same
   message, will be easier to read and understand by a broader audience.
   the process usually involves the replacement of difficult or unknown
   phrases with simpler equivalents and the transformation of long and
   syntactically complex sentences into shorter and less complex ones.
   automatic text simplification, a research topic which started 20 years
   ago, now has taken on a central role in natural language processing
   research not only because of the interesting challenges it posesses but
   also because of its social implications. this book presents past and
   current research in text simplification, exploring key issues including
   automatic readability assessment, lexical simplification, and syntactic
   simplification. it also provides a detailed account of machine learning
   techniques currently used in simplification, describes full systems
   designed for specific languages and target audiences, and offers
   available resources for research and development together with text
   simplification evaluation techniques.
