recognizing words     like that the sequence of letters    c-a-t    represents the word    cat        is the foundation to 
any technology that works on text    but it   s not always so easy, especially on the internet where writers so 
often vary their spelling to express emphasis, emotion, surprise, etc.  how can you recognize the word 
   what    when it could appear as    whaaaat    or    whaaa    or    wat    or    waaat    or    whut    or    wut    or   ? 
 
one way to recognize many variants at once is to use a regular expression (also called a    regex   )     a special 
sequence of symbols where you can indicate that a letter is optional, that it can occur many times, that one 
of several letters might occur, etc.  for example, the regular expression 
 

wh?a+t* 

 

 

 

  wat 

  wha 

  waaaa 

  whaaa 

 
means that the    h    can occur exactly once or not at all, the    a    can occur one or more times, and the    t    can 
occur any number of times (including zero times). the symbols used in this regex are defined as follows (in 
this example, unit refers to single letters, but as you will see below, a unit can be larger): 
 
  ?  the previous unit can occur zero or one times 
  *  the previous unit can occur zero or more times 
  +  the previous unit can occur one or more times. 
 
so the regular expression    wh?a+t*    would    recognize    the words below (and infinitely many more): 
 
  what   
 
it won   t, however, recognize the word    wht    (because there   s no    a    in this word and it requires at least one 
   a   ),    whut    (there   s no    u    allowed here),    whhhat    (because it only allows zero or one    h    and this word 
has three), or "waaaah" (because the "h", if it occurs, must precede the "a"; no reordering is allowed). 
 
there are many more symbols that can appear in id157, but for this problem you only need the 
above three symbols and parentheses.  parentheses group letters into units that themselves can be operated 
on by symbols, so that l(ol)+ would recognize any of the words below (and infinitely many more): 
 
 
 
it won   t, however, recognize the word    l    (because it needs at least one instance of    ol   ), or 
   looool    (because the entire    ol    part needs to be repeated, not just the    o   ), or    looll    (because the 
   ol    needs to repeated as a unit).

c1. we   ve put together a small crossword puzzle entirely of internet laughter, and clued each entry with a 
regular expression like    l(ol)+   . 
 
the clues do not appear in any particular order, so you   ll have to work out for yourself where each entry 
goes, but each clue corresponds to only one entry. to help you get started, we   ve entered one answer into 
the grid already (there is no clue for this pre-entered answer). be sure to write your answers in the answer 
sheets; nothing on this page will be graded!
