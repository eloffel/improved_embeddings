(r) text-o-matic (1/3) [10 points] 

one day, while looking through a storage closet in the linguistics building at her university, ada discovers a 
dusty machine labelled the text-o-matic 1000. she switches it on, and sees the following on the screen: 
 
 

<     <can 

lll 

 

intrigued, she types in her name, and presses enter. the machine whirrs and prints a small slip of paper that 
reads: 
 

ada // canada 

 
 

she fiddles with the machine and gets the screen to read: 
 
 

d     lbert 

 

again, she types in her name and presses enter, and this time the machine prints: 
 
 

ada // alberta 

 

if text-o-matic 1000 cannot apply a rule, it skips to the next one. 

important! 
1.  text-o-matic 1000 applies rules in descending order. 
2. 
3.  before applying the first rule, the text-o-matic 1000 adds < at the begin-

finally, she notices a note taped to the top of the machine, which reads: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ada decides to use the text-o-matic 1000 to convert the first twenty cardinal french numbers into their ordi-
nal equivalents. in other words, she wants to find a set of rules so that when any of the first twenty numbers 
is entered (in written form), the machine prints the corresponding output shown below. 
 
 
 

ning and > at the end of the input word, and it removes them right before 
printing. if any rule deletes these symbols, the machine will crash!

trois // troisi  me

(r) text-o-matic (3/3)  

r3. you have been hired to program the text-o-matic 2000, which will be able to work in both directions, 
either producing ordinal numbers from cardinal numbers or cardinal numbers from ordinal numbers.  
 
however, it still only contains one set of rules. it produces cardinal numbers from ordinal numbers by 
   reversing    these rules, undoing each rule (that is, replacing the letters after the arrow with the letters before 
the arrow) going from the bottom rule to the top rule. 
 
the rules you found above, however, won   t work in the new text-o-matic 2000. for example, instead of pro-
ducing six from sixi  me, they produce sixe! 
 
find a set of rules that works in both directions, producing the ordinal numbers from the cardinal numbers 
when run in the normal direction, and producing the cardinal numbers from the ordinal numbers when 
   undone    in the reverse direction. remember to handle the special cases for vingt-et-un and quatre-
vingts!
