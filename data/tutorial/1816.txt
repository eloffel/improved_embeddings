(j) get edumacated! (1/2) 

 

 

(yu, a.c.l. 2004. reduplication in english homeric infixation. nels 34) 

   homeric infixation is a morphological construction that has recently gained currency in vernacular american 
english. people who are familiar with this construction invariably credit the tv animation series, the simp-
sons, particularly the speech of the main character homer simpson, for popularizing this construction.    
 
 
many speakers of american english, particularly younger generations, can insert the syllable    ma    into a 
word (like    edumacation    or    saxomaphone   ) to produce a humorous variant. for many words, everyone 
agrees on how the    edumacated    variant should be formed, but there   s a lot of disagreement, too.  
 
below, three people give what they feel are the correct    edumacated    versions of twelve words. we   ve capi-
talized the stressed syllables of the respondent   s answers. stressed syllables are spoken with more emphasis 
than unstressed syllables; for example, the second syllable in potato is stressed. 
 
j1. we   ve left out some of their responses. fill in the blanks with the appropriate words from the list be-
low. you should likewise indicate stress with capitalization in your answers.

j2. how would each respondent say the following words? we   ve given you a few to get started. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
j3. respondents usually hesitate before two-syllable words, and are less sure that their answers feel 
   correct   . why, and what motivates alan   s, barbara   s, and chris   s eventual answers?
