   excellent tutorial explaining recurrent neural networks (id56s) which
   hold great promise for learning general sequences, and have
   applications for text analysis, handwriting recognition and even
   machine translation.

   while feats of deep learning has been gathering much attention, there
   were also breakthroughs in a related technology of recurrent neural
   networks (id56). id56s hold great promise for learning general sequences,
   and have applications for text analysis, handwriting recognition and
   even machine translation.

     id56 is learning to paint house numbers (andrej karpathy)
   see a fantastic post by andrej karpathy, [36]"the unreasonable
   effectiveness of recurrent neural networks" where he uses id56s to do
   amazing stuff like paint house numbers in this image, or generate text
   in the style of paul graham, shakespeare, and even latex.
   see below an excellent tutorial
   "general sequence learning using recurrent neural networks"
   by alec radford, indico head of research, who led a workshop on general
   sequence learning using recurrent neural networks at [37]next.ml in san
   francisco, feb 2015.
   alec introduces id56s and sketches how to implement them and cover the
   tricks necessary to make them work well. then he investigates using
   id56s as general text classification and regression models, examining
   where they succeed and where they fail compared to more traditional
   text analysis models.
   finally, he presents simple python and theano library for training id56s
   with a scikit-learn style interface and you'll see how to use it
   through several hands-on tutorials on real world text datasets.
