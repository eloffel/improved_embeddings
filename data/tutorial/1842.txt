   recurrent neural networks (id56s) are popular models that have shown
   great promise in nlp and many other machine learning tasks. here is a
   much-needed guide to key id56 models and a few brilliant research
   papers.

   by [37]denny britz, wildml.

   recurrent neural networks (id56s) are popular models that have shown
   great promise in many nlp tasks. but despite their recent popularity
   i   ve only found a limited number of resources that thoroughly explain
   how id56s work, and how to implement them. that   s what this tutorial is
   about. it   s a multi-part series in which i   m planning to cover the
   following:
    1. introduction to id56s (this post)
    2. [38]implementing a id56 using python and theano
    3. understanding the id26 through time (bptt) algorithm and
       the vanishing gradient problem
    4. from id56s to id137

   as part of the tutorial we will implement a [39]recurrent neural
   network based language model. the applications of language models are
   two-fold: first, it allows us to score arbitrary sentences based on how
   likely they are to occur in the real world. this gives us a measure
   of grammatical and semantic correctness. such models are typically used
   as part of machine translation systems. secondly, a language model
   allows us to generate new text (i think that   s the much cooler
   application). training a language model on shakespeare allows us to
   generate shakespeare-like text. [40]this fun post by andrej
   karpathy demonstrates what character-level language models based on
   id56s are capable of.

   i   m assuming that you are somewhat familiar with basic neural networks.
   if you   re not, you may want to head over to [41]implementing a neural
   network from scratch,  which guides you through the ideas and
   implementation behind non-recurrent networks.

what are id56s?

   the idea behind id56s is to make use of sequential information. in a
   traditional neural network we assume that all inputs (and outputs) are
   independent of each other. but for many tasks that   s a very bad idea.
   if you want to predict the next word in a sentence you better know
   which words came before it. id56s are called recurrent because they
   perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output
   being depended on the previous computations. another way to think about
   id56s is that they have a    memory    which captures information about what
   has been calculated so far. in theory id56s can make use of information
   in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice they are limited to
   looking back only a few steps (more on this later). here is what a
   typical id56 looks like: [42]a recurrent neural network and the
   unfolding in time of the computation involved in its forward
   computation.
   fig. 1  a recurrent neural network and the unfolding in time of the
   computation involved in its forward computation. source: nature

   the above diagram shows a id56 being unrolled (or unfolded) into a full
   network. by unrolling we simply mean that we write out the network for
   the complete sequence. for example, if the sequence we care about is a
   sentence of 5 words, the network would be unrolled into a 5-layer
   neural network, one layer for each word. the formulas that govern the
   computation happening in a id56 are as follows:
     * x_t is the input at time step t . for example, x_1  could be
       a one-hot vector corresponding to the second word of a sentence.
     * s_t is the hidden state at time step t . it   s the    memory    of the
       network. s_t is calculated based on the previous hidden state and
       the input at the current step: s_t=f(ux_t + ws_{t-1}) . the
       function f usually is a nonlinearity such as [43]tanh or [44]relu.
         s_{-1} , which is required to calculate the first hidden state,
       is typically initialized to all zeroes.
     * o_t is the output at step t . for example, if we wanted to predict
       the next word in a sentence it would be a vector of probabilities
       across our vocabulary. o_t = \mathrm{softmax}(vs_t) .

   there are a few things to note here:
     * you can think of the hidden state s_t as the memory of the network.
       s_t captures information about what happened in all the previous
       time steps. the output at step o_t is calculated solely based on
       the memory at time t . as briefly mentioned above, it   s a bit more
       complicated  in practice because s_t typically can   t capture
       information from too many time steps ago.
     * unlike a traditional deep neural network, which uses different
       parameters at each layer, a id56 shares the same parameters ( u, v,
       w above) across all steps. this reflects the fact that we are
       performing the same task at each step, just with different inputs.
       this greatly reduces the total number of parameters we need to
       learn.
     * the above diagram has outputs at each time step, but depending on
       the task this may not be necessary. for example, when predicting
       the sentiment of a sentence we may only care about the final
       output, not the sentiment after each word. similarly, we may not
       need inputs at each time step. the main feature of an id56 is
       its hidden state, which captures some information about a sequence.

what can id56s do?

   id56s have shown great success in many nlp tasks. at this point i should
   mention that the most commonly used type of id56s are [45]lstms, which
   are much better at capturing long-term dependencies than vanilla id56s
   are. but don   t worry, lstms are essentially the same thing as the id56
   we will develop in this tutorial, they just have a different way of
   computing the hidden state. we   ll cover lstms in more detail in a later
   post. here are some example applications of id56s in nlp (by non means
   an exhaustive list).

id38 and generating text

   given a sequence of words we want to predict the id203 of each
   word given the previous words. language models allow us to measure how
   likely a sentence is, which is an important input for machine
   translation (since high-id203 sentences are typically correct). a
   side-effect of being able to predict the next word is that we get a
   generative model, which allows us to generate new text by sampling from
   the output probabilities. and depending on what our training data is we
   can generate [46]all kinds of stuff. in id38 our input is
   typically a sequence of words (encoded as one-hot vectors for example),
   and our output is the sequence of predicted words. when training the
   network we set o_t = x_{t+1} since we want the output at step t to be
   the actual next word.
