   deep learning has recently, and famously, taken on painting by
   imitating artists. we now find recurrent neural networks writing
   stories corresponding to images, in the style of romance novels or
   taylor swift lyrics.

   by [36]samim.
   stories are a fundamental human tool that we use to communicate
   thought. creating a stories about a image is a difficult task that many
   struggle with. new machine-learning experiments are enabling us to
   generate stories based on the content of images. this experiment
   explores how to generate little romantic stories about images (incl.
   guest star taylor swift).

   neural-storyteller
   neural-storyteller is a recently published experiment by [37]ryan kiros
   (university of toronto). it combines recurrent neural networks (id56),
   [38]skip-thoughts vectors and other techniques to generate little
   stories about images. neural-storyteller   s outputs are creative and
   often comedic. it is [39]open-source.
   experiment
   this experiment started by running 5000 randomly selected web-images
   through neural-storyteller and experimenting with hyper-parameters.
   neural-storyteller comes with 2 pre-trained models: one trained on 14
   million passages of [40]romance novels, the other trained on taylor
   swift lyrics. inputs and outputs were manually filtered and recombined
   into two videos.

   how does it work?
   1. train a recurrent neural network ([43]id56) decoder on romance
   novels.
   2. each passage from a novel is mapped to a [44]skip-thought vector.
   3. conditions id56 on skip-thought vector & generate the encoded
   passage.
   4. train a visual-semantic embedding between [45]coco images and
   captions. captions and images are mapped into a common vector space.
   5. after training, embed new images and retrieve captions.

   final thoughts
   neural-storyteller gives us a fascinating glimpse into the future of
   storytelling. even though these technologies are not fully mature yet,
   the art of storytelling is bound to change. in the near future, authors
   will be training custom models, combining styles across genres and
   generating text with images & sounds. exploring this exiting new medium
   is rewarding!
