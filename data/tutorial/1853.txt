id56lg

   id56lg is an open source benchmark toolkit for natural language
   generation (id86) in spoken dialogue system application domains. it is
   released by tsung-hsien (shawn) wen from cambridge dialogue systems
   group under apache license 2.0.

   **update: if you are interested in learning the techniques behind this
   toolkit, i recently had a tutorial at iid86 conference. the link of the
   slides is here:
   [95]https://shawnwun.github.io/talks/dl4id86_20160906.pdf.

requirement

   you need to have the following package to run the program:
* theano 0.8.2 and accompanying packages such as numpy, scipy ...
* nltk 3.0.0

benchmark datasets

   the toolkit encloses the following four benchmark datasets:
* data/original/restaurant/ : san francisco restaurant search
* data/original/hotel/      : san francisco hotel search
* data/original/laptop/     : laptop sale/search
* data/original/tv/         : television sale/search

   and the counterfeited datasets produced in wen et al, 2016:
* data/counterfeit/r2h/     : restaurant to hotel counterfeited dataset
* data/counterfeit/h2r/     : hotel to restaurant counterfeited dataset
* data/counterfeit/l2t/     : laptop to tv  counterfeited dataset
* data/counterfeit/t2l/     : tv to laptop  counterfeited dataset
* data/counterfeit/r+h2l+t/ : restaurant/hotel to laptop/tv ...
* data/counterfeit/l+t2r+h/ : laptop/tv to restaurant/hotel ...

   as well as some union of domains:
* data/union/r+h/
* data/union/l+t/
* data/union/r+h+l/
* data/union/r+h+l+t/

   each example in the file is represented as a 3-element list:
* [mr/dialogue act, human authored response, hdc baseline]

   for more detail of how the datasets were collected, please refer to wen
   et al, 2015b and wen et al, 2016.

toolkit overview

   the toolkit is implmented in python. the training of the neural
   networks is implemented in theano library, while the decoding is
   implemented in numpy for runtime efficiency. the toolkit supports
   several id56-based generators as well as several baselines:
* model
- (knn) knn generator:
    k-nearest neighbor example-based generator, based on mr similarty.
- (ngram) class-based ngram generator [oh & rudnicky, 2000]:
    class-based language model generator by utterance class partitions.
- (hlstm) heuristic gated lstm [wen et al, 2015a]:
    an mr-conditioned lstm generator with heuristic gates.
- (sclstm) semantically conditioned lstm [wen et al, 2015b]:
    an mr-conditioned lstm generator with learned gates.
- (encdec) attentive encoder-decoder lstm [wen et al, 2015c]:
    an encoder-decoder lstm with slot-value level attention.

* training strategy
- (ml) maximum likehood training, using token cross-id178
- (dt) discriminative training (or expected id7 training) [wen et al, 2016]

* decoding strategy
- (beam) id125
- (sample) random sampling

configuration parameters

   below are configuration parameters explained by sections:
* [learn]
- lr            : learning rate of sgd.
- lr_decay      : learning rate decay.
- lr_divide     : the maximum number of times when validation gets worse.
                  for early stopping.
- beta          : regularisation parameter.
- random_seed   : random seed.
- min_impr      : the relative minimal improvement allowed.
- debug         : debug flag
- llogp         : log prob in the last epoch

* [train_mode]
- mode          : training mode, currently only support 'all'
- obj           : training objective, 'ml' or 'dt'
- gamma         : hyperparameter for dt training
- batch         : batch size

* [generator]
- type          : the model type, [hlstm|sclstm|encdec]
- hidden        : hidden layer size

* [data]
- domain        : application domain
- train/valid/test: dataset operated on
- vocab         : vocabulary
- percentage    : the percentage of train/valid considered
- wvec          : pretrained word vectors
- model         : the produced model path

* [gen]
- topk          : the n-best list returned
- overgen       : number of over-generation
- beamwidth     : the beam width used to decode utterances
- detectpairs   : the mapping file for calculating the slot error rate
- verbose       : verbose level of the model, not supported yet
- decode        : decoding strategy, 'beam' or 'sample'


below are knn/ngram specific parameters:
* [ngram]
- ngram         : the n of ngram
- rho           : number of slots considered to partition the dataset

quick start

   to run ml training:
python main.py -config config/sclstm.id18 -mode train

   to run generation:
python main.py -config config/sclstm.id18 -mode test

   to run ngram/knn baselines:
python main.py -config config/ngram.id18 -mode ngram
python main.py -config config/knn.id18   -mode knn

   to run training/adaptation/dt training/fine-tuning on an existing model
python main.py -config config/sclstm-dt.id18 -mode adapt

   note : before you run anything, make sure the config vars are properly
   set.

benchmark results

   the following benchmark results were produced by training each neural
   network model on 5 different random seeds (1-5) and selected models
   with the best validation id7 score. both the testing and validating
   set performance are shown:
