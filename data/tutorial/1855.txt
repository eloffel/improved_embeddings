stack id56

   stack id56 is a project gathering the code from the paper inferring
   algorithmic patterns with stack-augmented recurrent nets by armand
   joulin and tomas mikolov ([82]pdf). in this research project, we focus
   on extending recurrent neural networks (id56) with a stack to allow them
   to learn sequences which require some form of persistent memory.

   examples are given in the script script_tasks.sh. the code is still
   under construction. we are working on releasing the code for the list
   id56. if you have any suggestion, please let us know (contacts below).

examples

   to run the code on a task:
> make toy
> ./train_toy  -ntask 1 -nchar 2 -nhid 10 -nstack 1 -lr .1 -nmax 10 -depth 2 -bp
tt 50 -mod 1

   to run the code on binary addition:
> make add
> ./train_add

requirements

   stack id56 works on:
     * mac os x
     * linux

   it was not tested on windows. to compile the code a relatively recent
   version of g++ is required.

building stack id56

   run make to compile everything.

options

   for more help about the options:
> make toy
> ./train_toy --help

   note that train_add can take the same options as train_toy.
