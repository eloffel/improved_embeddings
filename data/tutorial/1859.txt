overview

   bllip parser is a statistical natural language parser including a
   generative constituent parser (first-stage) and discriminative maximum
   id178 reranker (second-stage). the latest version can be found on
   [126]github. this document describes basic usage of the command line
   interface and describes how to build and run the reranking parser.
   there are now [127]python and java interfaces as well. the python
   interface is described in [128]readme-python.rst.

compiling the parser

    1. (optional) for optimal speed, you may want to define $gccflags
       specifically for your machine. however, this step can be safely
       skipped as the defaults are usually fine. with csh or tcsh, try
       something like:
shell> setenv gccflags "-march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mmmx"

       or:
shell> setenv gccflags "-march=opteron -m64"

    2. build the parser with:
shell> make

          + sidenote on compiling on os x
            os x uses the clang compiler by default which cannot currently
            compile the parser. try setting this environment variable
            before building to change the default c++ compiler:
shell> setenv cxx g++

            recent versions of os x may have additional issues. see issues
            [129]60, [130]19, and [131]13 for more information.

obtaining parser models

   the [132]github repository includes parsing and reranker models, though
   these are mostly around for historical purposes. see this page on
   [133]bllip parser models for information about obtaining newer and more
   accurate parsing models.

running the parser

   after it has been built, the parser can be run with:
shell> parse.sh <sourcefile.txt>

   for example:
shell> parse.sh sample-text/sample-data.txt

   the input text must be pre-sentence segmented with each sentence in an
   <s> tag:
<s> sentence 1 </s>
<s> sentence 2 </s>
...

   note that there needs to be a space before and after the sentence.

   the parser distribution currently includes a basic id32 wall
   street journal parsing models which parse.sh will use by default. the
   python interface to the parser includes a mechanism for listing and
   downloading additional parsing models (some of which are more accurate,
   depending on what you're parsing).

   the script parse-and-fuse.sh demonstrates how to run syntactic parse
   fusion. fusion can also be run via the python bindings.

   the script parse-eval.sh takes a list of treebank files as arguments
   and extracts the terminal strings from them, runs the two-stage parser
   on those terminal strings and then evaluates the parsing accuracy with
   sparseval. for example, if the id32 3 is installed at
   /usr/local/data/penn3/, the following code evaluates the two-stage
   parser on section 24:
shell> parse-eval.sh /usr/local/data/penn3/parsed/mrg/wsj/24/wsj*.mrg

   the makefile will attempt to automatically download and build sparseval
   for you if you run make sparseval.

   for more information on [134]sparseval see this [135]paper:
@inproceedings{roark2006sparseval,
    title={sparseval: id74 for parsing speech},
    author={roark, brian and harper, mary and charniak, eugene and
            dorr, bonnie and johnson, mark and kahn, jeremy g and
            liu, yang and ostendorf, mari and hale, john and
            krasnyanskaya, anna and others},
    booktitle={proceedings of lrec},
    year={2006}
}

   we no longer distribute [136]evalb with the parser since it sometimes
   skips sentences unnecessarily. sparseval does not have these issues.

more questions?

   there is more information about different components of the parser
   spread across readme files in this distribution (see below). bllip
   parser is maintained by [137]david mcclosky.

parser details

   for details on the running the parser, see [141]first-stage/readme.rst.
   for help retraining the parser, see [142]first-stage/train/readme.rst
   (also includes some information about the parser model file formats).

reranker details

   see [143]second-stage/readme for an overview.
   [144]second-stage/readme-retrain.rst details how to retrain the
   reranker. the second-stage/programs/*/readme files include additional
   notes about different reranker components.

other versions of the parser

   we haven't tested these all of these and can't support them, but they
   may be useful if you're working on other platforms or languages.
     * [145]native charniak parser for windows (doesn't need cygwin, no
       reranker)
     * [146]rutu mulkar-mehta's windows version
     * [147]french branch by [148]djame seddah
     * [149]liang huang's forest reranker (includes forest-dumping
       extensions)
