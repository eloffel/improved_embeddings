software and data sets

     * i've now released the source code for the parser described in my
       phd thesis, under a gnu general public license. follow [2]this link
       for a tar file that contains the code.

     * you may also want to try [3]dan bikel's parser. it has a number of
       great features: training of the original (wsj treebank) models;
       training of chinese and arabic models; n-best parsing, and so on.
       in addition, dan's code has a flag which gives output of the
       "events" files used in my original parser. if you need to retrain
       my parser, this is probably an excellent place to look.
