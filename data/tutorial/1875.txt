sippycup

   [94]bill maccartney
   spring 2015

   sippycup is a simple semantic parser, written in python, created purely
   for didactic purposes. the design favors simplicity and readability
   over efficiency and performance. the goal is to make id29
   look easy!

   sippycup demonstrates an approach to id29 based around:
     * a context-free grammar with semantic attachments,
     * a chart-parsing algorithm,
     * a linear, feature-based scoring function for ranking candidate
       parses,
     * learning of scoring parameters using stochastic id119,
       and
     * limited forms of grammar induction.

   we present applications of sippycup to three different domains:
     * natural language arithmetic: "two times three plus four"
     * travel queries: "driving directions to williamsburg virginia"
     * geographical queries: "how many states border the largest state"

   sippycup was inspired by, and partly adapted from, the
   [95]demonstration code published as a companion to [96]liang & potts
   2015, "bringing machine learning and id152 together".
   it was developed primarily for the benefit of students in stanford's
   [97]cs224u: natural language understanding, and therefore contains
   exercises (without solutions) for use in the class. however, it should
   be of use to anyone interested in learning about id29. if
   you're new to python, you might find this [98]python tutorial useful.

   in addition to the python source code, sippycup includes a [99]codelab
   on id29, published as a sequence of four [100]ipython
   notebooks:
     * [101]unit 0: introduction to id29
     * [102]unit 1: natural language arithmetic
     * [103]unit 2: travel queries
     * [104]unit 3: geography queries

   sippycup remains a work in progress, and you will find a number of
   todos throughout this notebook and the accompanying python codebase.
   you will likely also find errors! you can help to contribute to
   sippycup by sending corrections to [105]the author or by sending a pull
   request to the sippycup [106]github repository.
