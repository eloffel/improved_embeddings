dependency to lambda-calculus conversion rules

overview

   the files in this repository contain rules for conversion of syntactic
   dependency trees (in the "[65]stanford dependencies style") to
   lambda-calculus logical forms representing the semantics of a sentence
   or question.

   these rules are described in more detail in the paper:
   siva reddy, oscar t  ckstr  m, michael collins, tom kwiatkowski, dipanjan
   das, mark steedman, mirella lapata (2016). transforming dependency
   structures to logical forms for id29. transactions of the
   association for computational linguistics, vol 4.

   note that this repository does not include any software required to
   apply these rules.

content

   the rules consists of the following files:
     * [66]dependency-transformation-rule.proto:
       protocol buffer format in which the rules are specified.
     * [67]transformation-rules.pb.txt:
       transformation rules that modify the dependency-tree (e.g., by
       adding bind operations) and relabeling dependencies to simplify
       lambda expression assignment.
     * [68]assignment-rules.pb.txt:
       lambda-calculus assignment rules, which assign lambda-calculus
       expressions to each leaf node in the s-expressions.
