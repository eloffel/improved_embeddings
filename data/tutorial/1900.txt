   id31 can be incredibly useful, and can help companies
   better answer pertinent questions and gain valuable business insights.
   id31 technologies will continue to improve as they become
   more widely adopted. but what can id31 do for you?
     __________________________________________________________________

   by scott sims, [36]buzzlogix.
   sentiment hero!
   id31 is a term that refers to the use of natural language
   processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics in order to
   ascertain the attitude of a speaker or writer toward a specific topic.
   basically, it helps to determine whether a text is expressing
   sentiments that are positive, negative, or neutral. id31
   is an excellent way to discover how people, particularly consumers,
   feel about a particular topic, product, or idea.
   the origin of id31 can be traced to the 1950s, when
   id31 was primarily used on written paper documents.
   today, however, id31 is widely used to mine subjective
   information from content on the internet, including texts, tweets,
   blogs, social media, news articles, reviews, and comments. this is done
   using a variety of different techniques, including nlp, statistics, and
   machine learning methods. organizations then use the information mined
   to identify new opportunities and better target their message toward
   their target demographics. the obama administration even uses sentiment
   analysis to predict public response to its policy announcements.
   what are the different types of id31?
   sentiments refer to attitudes, opinions, and emotions. in other words,
   they are subjective impressions as opposed to objective facts.
   different types of id31 use different strategies and
   techniques to identify the sentiments contained in a particular text.
   there are two main types of id31:
   subjectivity/objectivity identification and feature/aspect-based
   id31.
   subjectivity/objectivity identification: subjectivity/objectivity
   identification entails classifying a sentence or a fragment of text
   into one of two categories: subjective or objectivity. however, it
   should be noted that there are challenges when it comes to conducting
   this type of analysis. the main challenge is that the meaning of the
   word or even a phrase is often contingent on its context.
   feature/aspect-based identification: feature/aspect identification
   allows for the determination of different opinions or sentiments
   (features) in relation to different aspects of an entity. unlike
   subjectivity/objectivity identification, feature/aspect based
   identification allows for a much more nuanced overview of opinions and
   feelings.
   how can id31 be used?
   id31 has a number of different uses. most notably, with
   the rise of social media sites like facebook and twitter, the increased
   popularity of blogs, and the rise in review, rating, and recommendation
   sites, companies are becoming increasingly interested in sentiment
   analysis. with consumers able to share their opinions across the web so
   easily, online opinions have become a valuable currency for businesses
   and companies trying to cultivate their digital reputations, identify
   new opportunities, and successfully market their products. but with so
   much information out there, it can be hard for companies to hone in on
   the most valuable parts of consumers    comments.
   that   s why sentimental analysis is so useful. organizations are
   leveraging the power of id31 to filter out this valuable
   information in order to better understand consumers    conversation and
   take more effective, better-targeted action. today, organizations are
   using id31 for everything from marketing to customer
   service. some of the many different applications for id31
   include:
   social media monitoring: in today   s world, the vast majority of social
   media tools have some kind of id31 capabilities.
   companies also use automated id31 based on word lists,
   with each word being given a pre-defined sentiment value. the value of
   the text is then determined based on the words it contains. this has a
   number of different uses. for example, a restaurant might engage in
   social media monitoring in order to gauge how people feel about their
   menu, figure out whether or not people enjoyed their food, and
   ascertain what feelings people associated with their overall experience
   at the restaurant. and the good news is that the accuracy rates of
   id31 for social media monitoring keep getting better.
   id31 companies achieve accuracy rates of over 75 percent
   with its automated id31 capabilities.
   monitoring social media
   furthermore, social media monitoring is also an excellent way to better
   identify your brand   s influencers and promoters. for example, let   s say
   you need to figure how where negative content about your brand is
   coming from. you could identify, say, 50 of the major influencers in
   your industry and then analyze sentiment of their tweets about your
   brand, to figure out who has negative perceptions. from there, you can
   reach out to the influencers individually, and hopefully change their
   perception.
   public relations: id31 can also help companies develop
   and refine their public relations strategy. for example, companies can
   use id31 to identify sales leads and spot industry
   trends. as previously mentioned, id31 can also be used to
   identify influencers in your industry with positive sentiments toward
   your brand, which can be leveraged in a pr strategy.
   marketing: companies are increasingly using the information found in
   customer-generated content on product reviews and social media sites.
   for example, let   s say that samsung wants to know how consumers feel
   about its new galaxy phone. instead of conducting a survey, analysts
   can go online and evaluate the comments customers have left on major
   online ecommerce sites like amazon. samsung can analyze the content of
   these reviews. for example, samsung could determine the tone of
   comments being left to gain insight into the emotions consumers feel
   toward the product or analyze the comments to figure out how much
   knowledge customers have about the product.
   data mining: id31 can also be used for data mining, or
   gathering competitive intelligence about your competitors. for example,
   a brand could easily track social media mentions or mentions of
   competitors in other places across the web, and analyze how consumers
   feel about the competitors and their products. this is an excellent way
   to gain a competitive edge in today   s highly competitive marketplace.
   political analysis: studies of sentient analysis of tweets and
   microblogs have shown that such analysis can accurately indicate
   political sentiment. in a research paper entitled    predicting elections
   with twitter: what 140 characters reveal about political sentiment,   
   four researchers at the technical university of munich found that
   tweets do indeed accurately reflect voter preferences, and that the
      the sentiment of twitter messages closely corresponds to political
   programs, candidate profiles, and evidence from the media coverage of
   the campaign trail.    after analyzing over 100,000 tweets that mentioned
   parties or politicians in the months leading up to germany   s 2009
   federal election, the researchers found that    the mere number of
   messages reflects the election result and even comes close to
   traditional election polls.   
   there are still a number of different challenges when it comes to
   effectively conducting id31. first and foremost, people
   tend to express their opinions in complex ways, which can make it
   difficult to identify a clear sentiment. furthermore, in an opinion
   text, lexical content alone can make it difficult to discern the
   opinion being expressed, while rhetorical devises such as irony and
   sarcasm can also make it more difficult to clearly identify sentiment.
   however, as technology continues to improve, it will become easier and
   easier to overcome these challenges.
   the bottom line is that in today   s world, id31 can be
   incredibly useful, helping companies to better answer a number of
   pertinent business questions, from    why don   t people like this new
   product?    to    how can i more effectively market this new service to my
   target demographic?    id31 is all about helping companies
   gain better insights into their customers, and helping them to bridge
   the gap between insight and action. and overall, id31
   capabilities will only to continue to grow and expand, making companies
   more likely to widely adopt id31 as a means of adding
   value to their organizations.
