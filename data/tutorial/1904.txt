   google recently open-sourced its tensorflow machine learning library,
   which aims to bring large-scale, distributed machine learning and deep
   learning to everyone. but does it deliver?

   tensorflow why was i disappointed with tensorflow? it doesn't seem to
   fit any particular niche very well. read on for the particulars. but
   first, let me get 2 things out of the way up front:
   #1 - i am not a deep learning expert. i am currently pursuing a
   master's thesis in machine learning, i read about, appreciate, and
   understand deep learning concepts and innovations, and implement nets
   in some of the leading frameworks, but i am not an expert.
   #2 - i am an avowed supporter of google, one might even say a "fan
   boy," in a way similar to how folks are apple obsessed, or microsoft
   manic (hey, there are probably a few).
   tensorflow graph moving on (for now)...
   as announced last week, [41]google has open sourced tensorflow, what it
   refers to as its second-generation system for large-scale machine
   learning implementations, and successor to distbelief.
   built by the google brain team, tensorflow represents computations as
   stateful dataflow graphs. tensorflow is able to model computations on a
   wide variety of hardware, from consumer devices such as those powered
   by android, to large-scale heterogeneous, multiple gpu systems.
   tensorflow claims to be able to, without significant alteration of
   code, move execution of the computationally expensive tasks of a given
   graph from solely cpu to heterogeneous gpu-accelerated environments.
   given these details, it goes without saying that tensorflow aims to
   bring massive parallelism and high scalability to machine learning for
   all.
   what follows is a general overview of tensorflow, its architecture, and
   how it is utilized, after which i share my preliminary thoughts on the
   system.
   tensorflow overview
   at the heart of tensorflow is the dataflow graph representing
   computations. nodes represent operations (ops), and the edges represent
   tensors (multi-dimensional arrays, the backbone of tensorflow). the
   entire dataflow graph is a complete description of computations, which
   occur within a session, and are executed on devices (cpus or gpus).
   like much contemporary scientific computing and large-scale machine
   learning, tensorflow favors its well-documented python api, where
   tensors are represented internally as familiar numpy ndarray objects.
   tensorflow relies on highly-optimized c++ for its computation, and also
   supports native apis in c and c++.
   installation of tensorflow is quick and painless, and can be
   accomplished easily with a pip install command. once installed, getting
   a hello, tensorworld! program up and running is straightforward:
import tensorflow as tf

# say hello.
hello = tf.constant('hello, tensorworld!')
sess = tf.session()
print sess.run(hello)
# --> hello, tensorworld!

# some simple math.
a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(32)
print sess.run(a+b)
# --> 42

   graphs are constructed from nodes (ops) that don't require input
   (source ops), which then pass their output to further ops which, in
   turn, perform computations on these output tensors, and so on. these
   subsequent ops are performed asynchronously and, optionally, in
   parallel. notice the run() method calls above; they take, as arguments,
   the result variables for computations you are interested in performing,
   and a backward chain of required calls are made to achieve this end
   goal.
   a further example illustrates randomly filling a pair of numpy ndarrays
   with floats, assigning these explicitly-created numpy ndarrays to
   tensorflow objects, and performing id127 on them. note,
   in particular, the creation of a session and the use of the run()
   method. with no graph specified, tensorflow uses the default instance.
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# pair of numpy arrays.
matrix1 = 10 * np.random.random_sample((3, 4))
matrix2 = 10 * np.random.random_sample((4, 6))

# create a pair of constant ops, add the numpy
# array matrices.
tf_matrix1 = tf.constant(matrix1)
tf_matrix2 = tf.constant(matrix2)

# create a id127 operation, pass
# the tensorflow matrices as inputs.
tf_product = tf.matmul(tf_matrix1, tf_matrix2)

# launch a session, use default graph.
sess = tf.session()

# invoking run() with tf_product variable will
# execute the ops necessary to satisfy the request,
# storing result in 'result.'
result = sess.run(tf_product)

# now let's have a look at the result.
print result

# close the session when we're done.
sess.close()

   for more details on tensorflow's implementation, see [42]this
   whitepaper.
   experimenting with tensorflow
   in order to gain some appreciation for google's newly open-sourced
   contribution to machine learning, i spent some time playing around with
   it. specifically, i undertook as projects a few of the tutorials on the
   [43]tensorflow website. the tutorials are admittedly well-written, and
   though they explicitly, in more than one location, state that they are
   not generally suitable for learning machine learning, i'd argue that
   even a beginner would be able to read the documents and get something
   generalizable and useful from them.
   the following are the specific tutorials i had a look at.
   [44]tensorflow mechanics 101

     the goal of this tutorial is to show how to use tensorflow to train
     and evaluate a simple feed-forward neural network for handwritten
     digit classification using the (classic) mnist data set. the
     intended audience for this tutorial is experienced machine learning
     users interested in using tensorflow.

   tsne
   learned embeddings using id167.
   [45]vector representation of words

     in this tutorial we look at the id97 model by mikolov et al.
     this model is used for learning vector representations of words,
     called id27s.

   [46]deep mnist for experts

     tensorflow is a powerful library for doing large-scale numerical
     computation. one of the tasks at which it excels is implementing and
     training deep neural networks. in this tutorial we will learn the
     basic building blocks of a tensorflow model while constructing a
     deep convolutional mnist classifier.

   as stated above, all of the tutorials are well-written. they also
   performed without issue, and had results as advertised. however, i
   couldn't help feel a real sense of been here, done that. i understand
   the need for standardized introductions to topics, but beside being
   technically sound, it seemed like they were just going through the
   motions.
