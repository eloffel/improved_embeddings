installation guides

     * [82]tensorflow installation
     * [83]os specific setup
     * [84]installation on ec2 gpu instances

   for ubuntu users using python3.4+ w/ cuda 7.5 and cudnn 7.0, you can
   find compiled wheels under the wheels directory. use pip3 install
   tensorflow-0.8.0rc0-py3-none-any.whl to install, e.g. and be sure to
   add: export ld_library_path="$ld_library_path:/usr/local/cuda/lib64" to
   your .bashrc. note, this still requires you to install cuda 7.5 and
   cudnn 7.0 under /usr/local/cuda.
