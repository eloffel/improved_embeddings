   in this series of articles, we present the gentlest introduction to
   tensorflow that starts off by showing how to do id75 for a
   single feature problem, and expand from there.

introduction


   we are going to solve an overly simple, and unrealistic problem, which
   has the upside of making understanding the concepts of ml and tf easy.
   we want to predict a single scalar outcome, house price (in $) based on
   a single feature, house size (in square meters, sqm). this eradicates
   the need to handle multi-dimensional data, enabling us to focus solely
   on defining a model, implementing, and training it in tf.

machine learning (ml) in brief


   we start with a set of data points that we have collected (chart
   below), each representing the relationship between two values
      an outcome (house price) and the influencing feature (house size).

   however, we cannot predict values for features that we don   t have data
   points for (chart below)

   we can use ml to discover the relationship (the    best-fit prediction
   line    in the chart below), such that given a feature value that is not
   part of the data points, we can predict the outcome accurately (the
   intersection between the feature value and the prediction line.

step 1: choose a model


   model types

   to do prediction using ml, we need to choose a model that can best-fit
   the data that we have collected.

   we can choose a linear (straight line) model, and tweak it to match the
   data points by changing its steepness/gradient and position.

   we can also choose an exponential (curve) model, and tweak it to match
   the same set of data points by changing its curvature and position.

   cost function

   to compare which model is a better-fit more rigorously, we define
   best-fit mathematically as a cost function that we need to minimize. an
   example of a cost function can simply be the absolute sum of the
   differences between the actual outcome represented by each data point,
   and the prediction of the outcome (the vertical projection of the
   actual outcome onto the best-fit line). graphically the cost is
   depicted by the sum of the length of the blue lines in the chart below.

   note: more accurately the cost function is often the squared of the
   difference between actual and predicted outcome, because the difference
   can sometimes can be negative; this is also known as min least-squared.

   linear model in brief

   in the spirit of keeping things simple, we will model our data points
   using a linear model. a linear model is represented mathematically as:
   y = w.x + b

   where:

   x: house size, in sqm

   y: predicted house price, in $

   to tweak the model to best fit our data points, we can:
     * tweak w to change the gradient of the linear model

     * tweak b to change the position of the linear model

   by going through many values of w, b, we can eventually find a best-fit
   linear model that minimizes the cost function. besides randomly trying
   different values, is there a better way to explore the w, b values
   quickly?

   id119

   if you are on an expansive plateau in the mountains, when trying to
   descent to the lowest point, your viewpoint looks like this.

   the direction of descent is not obvious! the best way to descend is
   then to perform id119:
     * determine the direction with the steepest downward gradient at
       current position
     * take a step of size x in that direction
     * repeat & rinse; this is known as training

   minimizing the cost function is similar because, the cost function is
   undulating like the mountains (chart below), and we are trying to find
   the minimum point, which we can similarly achieve through gradient
   descent.

   with the concepts of linear model, cost function, and id119
   in hand, we are ready to use tf.
