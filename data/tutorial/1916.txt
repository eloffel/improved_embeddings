   tensorflow.

     editor's note: you may want to check out [38]part 1 of this tutorial
     before proceeding.

quick review


   in the [39]previous article, we used tensorflow (tf) to build and learn
   a id75 model with a single feature so that given a feature
   value (house size/sqm), we can predict the outcome (house price/$).

   here is the review with illustration below:
    1. we have some data of house sizes & house prices (the gray round
       points)
    2. we model the data using id75 (the red dash line)
    3. we find the    best    model by training w, and b (of the linear
       regression model) to minimize the    cost    (the sum of the length of
       vertical blue lines, which represent the differences between
       predictions and actual outcomes)
    4. given any house size, we can use the linear model to predict the
       house size (the dotted blue lines with arrows)

   image

               id75 explained in a single diagram

   in machine learning (ml) literature, we come across the term    training   
   very often, let us literally look at what that means in tf.

id75 modeling


linear model (in tf notation): y = tf.matmul(x,w) + b

   the goal in id75 is to find w, b, such that given any
   feature value (x), we can find the prediction (y) by substituting w, x,
   b values into the model.
   however to find w, b that can give accurate predictions, we need to
      train    the model using available data (the multiple pairs of actual
   feature (x), and actual outcome (y_), note the underscore).

   training    illustrated


   to find the best w, b values, we can initially start with any w, b
   values. we also need to define a cost function, which is a measure of
   the differencebetween the prediction (y) for given a feature value (x),
   and the actual outcome (y_) for that same feature value (x). for
   simplicity, we use least[40]minimum squared error (mse) as our cost
   function.
cost function (in tf notation): tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_ - y))

   by minimizing the cost function, we can arrive at good w, b values.

   our code to do training is actually very simple and it is labelled with
   [a, b, c, d], which we will refer to later on. the full source is
   on [41]github.
# ... (snip) variable/constants declarations (snip) ...

# [a] tf.graph
y = tf.matmul(x,w) + b
cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_-y))

# [b] train with fixed 'learn_rate'
learn_rate = 0.1
train_step =
    tf.train.gradientdescentoptimizer(learn_rate).minimize(cost)

for i in range(steps):
  # [c] prepare datapoints
  # ... (snip) code to prepare datapoint as xs, and ys (snip) ...

  # [d] feed data at each step/epoch into 'train_step'
  feed = { x: xs, y_: ys }
  sess.run(train_step, feed_dict=feed)

   our linear model and cost function equations [a] can be represented as
   tf graph as shown:

   image

     create a tf graph with model & cost, and initialize w, b with some
                                   values

   next, we select a datapoint (x, y_) [c], and feed [d] it into the tf
   graph to get the prediction (y) as well as the cost.

   image

          calculate prediction (y) & cost using a single datapoint

   to get better w, b, we perform id119 using
   tf   stf.train.gradientdescentoptimizer [b] to reduce the cost. in
   non-technical terms: given the current cost, and based on the graph of
   how cost varies with other variables (namely w, b), the optimizer will
   perform small tweaks (increments/decrements) to w, b so that our
   prediction becomes better forthat single datapoint.

   image

        based on current cost, determine how to tweak w, b to improve
                       prediction (y) and reduce cost

   the final step in the training cycle is to update the w, b after
   tweaking them. note that    cycle    is also referred to as    epoch    in ml
   literature.

   image

   update w, b after tweaking them, and before iterating through the next
                               training epoch

   in the next training epoch, repeat the steps, but use a different
   datapoint!

   image

                     training using different datapoints

   using a variety of datapoints generalizes our model, i.e., it learns w,
   b values that can be used to predict any feature value. note that:
     * in most cases, the more datapoints, the better your model can learn
       and generalize
     * if you train more epochs than datapoints you have, you can re-use
       datapoints, which is not an issue. the id119 optimizer
       always use both the datapoint, and the cost (calculated from the
       datapoint, with w, b values of that epoch) to tweak w, b; the
       optimizer may have seen that datapoint before, but not with the
       same cost, thus it will learn something new, and tweak w, b
       differently.

   you can train the model a fixed number of epochs or until it reaches a
   cost threshold that is satisfactory.
