approach based upon language model in bengio et al icml 09 "curriculum learning"
.


you will need my common python library:
    [70]http://github.com/turian/common
and my textsne wrapper for id167:
    [71]http://github.com:turian/textsne

you will need murmur for hashing.
    easy_install murmur

to train a monolingual language model, probably you should run:
    [edit hyperparameters.language-model.yaml]
    ./build-vocabulary.py
    ./train.py

to train word-to-word multilingual model, probably you should run:
    cd scripts; ln -s hyperparameters.language-model.sample.yaml s hyperparamete
rs.language-model.yaml

    # create validation data:
    ./preprocess-validation.pl > ~/data/semeval-2-2010/task\ 3\ -\ cross-lingual
\ word\ sense\ disambiguation/validation.txt tokenizer v3

    # [optional: lemmatize]
    tadpole --skip=tmp -t ~/dev/python/mt-language-model/neural-language-model/d
ata/filtered-full-bilingual/en-nl/filtered-training.nl | perl -ne 's/\t/ /g; pri
nt lc($_);' | chop 3 | from-one-line-per-word-to-one-line-per-sentence.py > ~/de
v/python/mt-language-model/neural-language-model/data/filtered-full-bilingual-le
mmas/en-nl/filtered-training-lemmas.nl
    #

    [todo:
    * initialize using monolingual language model in source language.
    * loss = logistic, not margin.
    ]

    # [optional: run the following if your alignment for language pair l1-l2
    # is in form l2-l1]
    ./scripts/preprocess/reverse-alignment.pl

    ./w2w/build-vocabulary.py
    # then see the output with ./w2w/dump-vocabulary.py, to see if you want
    # to adjust the w2w minfreq hyperparameter

    ./w2w/build-target-vocabulary.py
    # then see the output with ./w2w/dump-target-vocabulary.py

    ./w2w/build-initial-embeddings.py

    # [optional: filter the corpora only to include sentences with certain
    # focus words.]
    # you want to make sure this happens after
    # ./w2w/build-initial-embeddings.py, so you have good embeddings for words
    # that aren't as common in the filtered corpora.
    ./scripts/preprocess/filter-sentences-by-lemma.py
    # you should then move the filtered corpora to a new data directory.]

    #[optional: this will cache all the training examples onto disk. this will
    # happen automatically during training anyhow.]
    ./scripts/w2w/build-example-cache.py

    ./w2w/train.py

todo:
    * sqrt scaling of sgd updates
    * use id172 of embeddings?
    * how do we initialize embeddings?
    * use tanh, not softsign?
    * when doing sgd on embeddings, use sqrt scaling of embedding size?
