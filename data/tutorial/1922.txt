data release

short version:

   here is the data: [6]raw, [7]deduped, and [8]lms.

   for english we provide the [9]raw data in several files that were
   sharded by a hash value of the line, so that identical lines end up in
   the same shard.

   the processing pipeline uses standard [10]moses tools and a truecasing
   model estimated on a large dataset. for english, spanish, and french
   the pipeline is available [11]here, more languages will follow soon.
