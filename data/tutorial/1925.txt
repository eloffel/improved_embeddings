reverb

id10 software

about

   reverb is a program that automatically identifies and extracts binary
   relationships from english sentences. reverb is designed for web-scale
   information extraction, where the target relations cannot be specified
   in advance and speed is important.

   to get a better idea of what reverb does:
     * download [3]the code on github.
     * read [4]identifying relations for id10.
     * browse [5]reverb's extractions from 500 million web pages.

code

   reverb is released under an academic license. for instructions on how
   to run reverb or use it in your own code, please see the [6]readme file
   (also included in the download).

data

   a collection of 15 million reverb extractions is available for academic
   use. the extractions are the result of running reverb on the
   [11]clueweb09 dataset. please review the information in the
   [12]readme_data.txt. also, consider downloading the smaller sample of
   wikipedia-only extractions before downloading the full set.
     * [13]readme_data.txt
