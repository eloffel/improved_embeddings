[6]graph-powered machine learning at google

   thursday, october 6, 2016
   posted by sujith ravi, staff research scientist, google research
   recently, there have been significant advances in [7]machine learning
   that enable computer systems to solve complex real-world problems. one
   of those advances is google   s large scale, [8]graph-based machine
   learning platform, built by the expander team in google research. a
   technology that is behind many of the google products and features you
   may use everyday, graph-based machine learning is a powerful tool that
   can be used to power useful features such as [9]reminders in inbox and
   [10]smart messaging in allo, or used in conjunction with deep neural
   networks to power the latest image recognition system in [11]google
   photos.

   learning with minimal supervision
   much of the recent success in [13]deep learning, and machine learning
   in general, can be attributed to models that demonstrate high
   predictive capacity when trained on large amounts of labeled data --
   often millions of training examples. this is commonly referred to as
      [14]supervised learning    since it requires supervision, in the form of
   labeled data, to train the machine learning systems. (conversely, some
   machine learning methods operate directly on raw data without any
   supervision, a paradigm referred to as [15]unsupervised learning.)
   however, the more difficult the task, the harder it is to get
   sufficient high-quality labeled data. it is often prohibitively labor
   intensive and time-consuming to collect labeled data for every new
   problem. this motivated the expander research team to build new
   technology for powering machine learning applications at scale and with
   minimal supervision.
   expander   s technology draws inspiration from how humans learn to
   generalize and bridge the gap between what they already know (labeled
   information) and novel, unfamiliar observations (unlabeled
   information). known as    [16]semi-supervised    learning, this powerful
   technique enables us to build systems that can work in situations where
   training data may be sparse. one of the key advantages to a graph-based
   semi-supervised machine learning approach is the fact that (a) one
   models labeled and unlabeled data jointly during learning, leveraging
   the underlying structure in the data, (b) one can easily combine
   multiple types of signals (for example, relational information from
   [17]id13 along with raw features) into a single graph
   representation and learn over them. this is in contrast to other
   machine learning approaches, such as neural network methods, in which
   it is typical to first train a system using labeled data with features
   and then apply the trained system to unlabeled data.
   graph learning: how it works
   at its core, expander   s platform combines semi-supervised machine
   learning with large-scale graph-based learning by building a
   multi-graph representation of the data with nodes corresponding to
   objects or concepts and edges connecting concepts that share
   similarities. the graph typically contains both labeled data (nodes
   associated with a known output category or label) and unlabeled data
   (nodes for which no labels were provided). expander   s framework then
   performs semi-supervised learning to label all nodes jointly by
   propagating label information across the graph.
   however, this is easier said than done! we have to (1) learn
   efficiently at scale with minimal supervision (i.e., tiny amount of
   labeled data), (2) operate over multi-modal data (i.e., heterogeneous
   representations and various sources of data), and (3) solve challenging
   prediction tasks (i.e., large, complex output spaces) involving high
   dimensional data that might be noisy.
   one of the primary ingredients in the entire learning process is the
   graph and choice of connections. graphs come in all sizes, shapes and
   can be combined from multiple sources. we have observed that it is
   often beneficial to learn over multi-graphs that combine information
   from multiple types of data representations (e.g., image pixels, object
   categories and chat response messages for [18]photoreply in allo). the
   expander team   s graph learning platform automatically generates graphs
   directly from data based on the inferred or known relationships between
   data elements. the data can be structured (for example, [19]relational
   data) or unstructured (for example, [20]sparse or dense feature
   representations extracted from raw data).
   to understand how expander   s system learns, let us consider an example
   graph shown below.
   [21][image03.png]
   there are two types of nodes in the graph:    grey    represents unlabeled
   data whereas the colored nodes represent labeled data. relationships
   between node data is represented via edges and thickness of each edge
   indicates strength of the connection. we can formulate the
   semi-supervised learning problem on this toy graph as follows: predict
   a color (   red    or    blue   ) for every node in the graph. note that the
   specific choice of graph structure and colors depend on the task. for
   example, as shown in [22]this research paper we recently published, a
   graph that we built for the [23]smart reply feature in inbox represents
   email messages as nodes and colors indicate semantic categories of user
   responses (e.g.,    yes   ,    awesome   ,    funny   ).
   the expander graph learning framework solves this labeling task by
   treating it as an optimization problem. at the simplest level, it
   learns a color label assignment for every node in the graph such that
   neighboring nodes are assigned similar colors depending on the strength
   of their connection. a naive way to solve this would be to try to learn
   a label assignment for all nodes at once -- this method does not scale
   to large graphs. instead, we can optimize the problem formulation by
   propagating colors from labeled nodes to their neighbors, and then
   repeating the process. in each step, an unlabeled node is assigned a
   label by inspecting color assignments of its neighbors. we can update
   every node   s label in this manner and iterate until the whole graph is
   colored. this process is a far more efficient way to optimize the same
   problem and the sequence of iterations converges to a unique solution
   in this case. the solution at the end of the graph propagation looks
   something like this:

                             [24][image00.gif]
                     semi-supervised learning on a graph

   in practice, we use complex optimization functions defined over the
   graph structure, which incorporate additional information and
   constraints for semi-supervised graph learning that can lead to hard,
   [25]non-convex problems. the real challenge, however, is to scale this
   efficiently to graphs containing billions of nodes, trillions of edges
   and for complex tasks involving billions of different label types.
   to tackle this challenge, we created an approach outlined in [26]large
   scale distributed semi-supervised learning using streaming
   approximation, published last year. it introduces a [27]streaming
   algorithm to process information propagated from neighboring nodes in a
   distributed manner that makes it work on very large graphs. in
   addition, it addresses other practical concerns, notably it guarantees
   that the space complexity or memory requirements of the system stays
   constant regardless of the difficulty of the task, i.e., the overall
   system uses the same amount of memory regardless of whether the number
   of prediction labels is two (as in the above toy example) or a million
   or even a billion. this enables wide-ranging applications for natural
   language understanding, machine perception, user modeling and even
   joint [28]multimodal learning for tasks involving multiple modalities
   such as text, image and video inputs.
   language graphs for learning humor
   as an example use of graph-based machine learning, consider emotion
   labeling, a language understanding task in [29]smart reply for inbox,
   where the goal is to label words occurring in natural language text
   with their fine-grained emotion categories. a neural network model is
   first applied to a text corpus to learn id27s, i.e., a
   mathematical vector representation of the meaning of each word. the
   dense embedding vectors are then used to build a sparse graph where
   nodes correspond to words and edges represent semantic relationship
   between them. edge strength is computed using similarity between
   embedding vectors     low similarity edges are ignored. we seed the graph
   with emotion labels known a priori for a few nodes (e.g., laugh is
   labeled as    funny   ) and then apply semi-supervised learning over the
   graph to discover emotion categories for remaining words (e.g., rotfl
   gets labeled as    funny    owing to its multi-hop semantic connection to
   the word    laugh   ).

                                         [30][image02.png]
       learning emotion associations using graph constructed from word
                              embedding vectors

   for applications involving large datasets or dense representations that
   are observed (e.g., pixels from images) or learned using neural
   networks (e.g., embedding vectors), it is infeasible to compute
   pairwise similarity between all objects to construct edges in the
   graph. the expander team [31]solves this problem by leveraging
   approximate, linear-time graph construction algorithms.
   graph-based machine intelligence in action
   the expander team   s machine learning system is now being used on
   massive graphs (containing billions of nodes and trillions of edges) to
   recognize and understand concepts in natural language, images, videos,
   and queries, powering google products for applications like
   [32]reminders, [33]id53, [34]language translation,
   [35]visual object recognition, [36]dialogue understanding, and more.
   we are excited that with the [37]recent release of allo, millions of
   chat users are now experiencing smart messaging technology powered by
   the expander team   s system for understanding and assisting with chat
   conversations in multiple languages. also, this technology isn   t used
   only for large-scale models in the cloud - as [38]announced this past
   week, android wear has opened up an [39]on-device smart reply
   capability for developers that will provide smart replies for any
   messaging application. we   re excited to tackle even more challenging
   internet-scale problems with expander in the years to come.
