   a starting point for id161 and how to get going deeper. dive
   into this post for some overview of the right resources and a little
   bit of advice.

     if we want machines to think, we need to teach them to see.

     -[38]fei fei li, director of [39]stanford ai lab and [40]stanford
     vision lab

   learning and computation provides machine the ability to better
   understand the context of images and build visual systems which truly
   understand intelligence. the huge amount of image and video content
   urges the scientific community to make sense and identify patterns
   amongst it to reveal details which we aren   t aware of. id161
   generates mathematical models from images; computer graphics draws in
   images from models and lastly image processing takes image as an input
   and gives an image at the output.

                           id161 fields

   id161 is an overlapping field drawing on concepts from areas
   such as artificial intelligence, digital image processing, machine
   learning, deep learning, pattern recognition, probabilistic graphical
   models, scientific computing and a lot of mathematics. so, take this
   post as a starting point to dwell into this field. i will try to cover
   as much as possible in this post but still there will be a lot of
   advanced topics and some cools things which might be left out (maybe
   for later posts?).

   step 1 - background check

   as usual get the basics right with an undergraduate course in
   [41]id203, [42]statistics, [43]id202, calculus (both:
   [44]differential and [45]integral). a brief introduction to [46]matrix
   calculus should come in handy. also, my experience says that if one has
   some idea of [47]digital signal processing then it should be helpful to
   grasp concepts easily.

   on the implementation side, i prefer one to have a background in both
   [48]matlab and python. check [49]sentdex (a youtube channel) for
   everything you need for scientific programming in python. do keep in
   mind that id161 is all about computational programming.

   you might want to have a look to [50]probabilistic id114
   (though it is a very advanced subject). you can always return to it
   later.

   step 2 - digital image processing

   watch the videos by [51]prof. guillermo sapiro of duke university. the
   syllabus is very self contained and comes in with lot of exercises. you
   can find videos on youtube or wait for the next session on coursera
   starting september 2016.

   refer to the book[52] digital image processing by gonzalez and woods.
   go through the examples of the concepts as taught by this course on
   matlab.

   step 3 - id161

   once done with digital image processing the next step is to understand
   the mathematical models underlying the formulations of variety of
   applications of image and video content. [53]university of florida   s
   prof. mubarak shah   s course on id161 act as good introductory
   course covering all the fundamental concepts required to build on
   advanced material.

                               id161

   watch these videos and alongside implementing the learned concepts and
   algorithms by following [54]gatech prof. james hays    projects of his
   id161 class. these assignments are also on matlab. do not
   skip these. you only get the deep understanding of the algorithms and
   equations once you implement them from scratch.

   step 4 - advanced id161

   following the first three steps will now make you get going for the
   advanced material.

   coursera   s offering [55]discrete id136 in artificial vision gives
   you a probabilistic id114 and mathematical overdose of
   id161. although coursera has removed this content from the
   website, you should be able to find that somewhere on the internet.
   things now seem to look interesting and will definitely give you a feel
   of how complex yet simple models are built for machine vision systems.
   this course should also be a stepping stone to get going with academic
   papers.

   step 5 - bring in python and open source

   let   s get into python.

   there are many packages such as [56]opencv, [57]pil, [58]vlfeat and the
   likes. now is the right time to use packages built by others into your
   projects. no need to implement everything from scratch.

   you can find many good blogs and videos to get started with
   [59]programming id161 with python. i would recommend this
   book; it should be more than enough. go and have fun! see how matlab
   and python get you to implement algorithms.

   step 6 - machine learning and convnets

   there are just too many posts on getting started with machine learning.

   check [60]here, [61]here and [62]here.

   from now on you are better off sticking with python. have a quick go
   through [63]building machine learning systems with python and
   [64]python machine learning.

   with all the deep learning hype around, you now enter into the current
   research work in id161: the use of convnets. [65]stanford   s
   cs231n: convolutional neural networks for visual recognition is a
   comprehensive course on this. although videos have been taken down from
   the official website, you can very easily find re-uploads on youtube.

   id161

   step 7 - how should i explore more?

   you might think that i have already overloaded you with so much of
   information. but, there is lot of stuff to explore.

   one good approach should be to have a look at some of the graduate
   seminar courses by [66]sanja fidler of university of toronto and
   [67]james hays to get an idea of current research directions in
   id161 through rich academic papers.

   another possible approach is to follow top papers from top conferences
   such as [68]cvpr, [69]iccv, [70]eccv, [71]bmvc. alternatively you can
   follow blogs such as [72]pyimagesearch.com or
   [73]computervisionblog.com or [74]aishack.in. watch endless talks and
   lectures on id161 and related fields at
   [75]videolectures.net!

   in a nutshell you have covered the history of id161 right
   from filters, feature detectors and descriptors, camera models,
   trackers to tasks such as recognition, segmentation and the most recent
   advancements in neural nets and deep learning. in the next post i will
   give a list of top blogs to follow and in the subsequent post i will
   write about the top papers of all time to read related to computer
   vision.

   bio: [76]pulkit khandelwal is an incoming computer science master   s
   student at mcgill university. his interests lie in id161 and
   machine learning.
