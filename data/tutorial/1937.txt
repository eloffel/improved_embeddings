   bringing semantics into focus using visual abstraction

   learning the visual interpretation of sentences


                      learning through abstract scenes

   abstract


   relating visual information to its linguistic semantic meaning remains
   an open and challenging area of research. the semantic meaning of
   images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their
   relations to other objects. but precisely characterizing this
   dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an
   image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. we
   propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from
   collections of clipart. abstract images provide several advantages.
   they allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic
   information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object,
   attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of
   images. importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate
   sets of semantically similar scenes. finding analogous sets of
   semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. we create
   1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with
   corresponding written descriptions. we thoroughly analyze this dataset
   to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to
   visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity.


   sentences that describe visual scenes contain a wide variety of
   information pertaining to the presence of objects, their attributes and
   their spatial relations. we propose learning the visual features that
   correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. specifically, we
   extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. the
   relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective
   or their combination. we model a scene using a conditional random field
   (crf) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the
   edges to their relations. we determine the potentials of the crf using
   the tuples extracted from the sentences. we generate novel scenes
   depicting the sentences' visual meaning by sampling from the crf. the
   crf is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image
   retrieval task. our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that
   convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are
   described by multiple sentences. significant improvement is found over
   several baseline approaches.
