opencv-gettingstarted

   this is a tutorial on opencv initially written for the hcc summer
   school in bremen: [[92]http://hcc.uni-bremen.de/school2016/]

   the target audience is broad and includes
     * people who have done computer science (maybe to graduate level) but
       who have not looked at opencv before
     * people who are studying other subjects and want to play with
       id161

   for those with computing experience, you can view this as a set of
   examples and code snippets to take and modify; it probably doesn't
   really matter what order you do things in.

   for those without computing expertise, try following the notebooks
   sequentially. this should take you through the basics of opening
   images, modifying images, and doing some straightforward image
   operations.
