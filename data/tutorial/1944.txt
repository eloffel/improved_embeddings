                    statistical id38 toolkit

   the cmu-cambridge statistical id38 toolkit is a suite of
   unix software tools to facilitate the construction and testing of
   statistical language models. the slm toolkit is meant for large amounts
   of training data. if you intend to train a language model from a few
   dozen or even hundred sentences, please refer to the [1]lmtool.

   version 1 was written by [2]roni rosenfeld at [3]carnegie mellon
   university.

   the toolkit has been rewritten by philip clarkson and roni rosenfeld,
   and now provides increased functionality and efficiency. version two is
   no longer limited to the use of bigram and trigram models, and provides
   support for id165s of arbitrary size. it also provides support for
   several discounting schemes, rather than limiting the user to the
   good-turing discounting strategy used in version one. in addition, the
   tools used to count word id165s, vocabulary id165s and id id165s
   have been re-written to increase greatly their speed of operation.
   other changes include a more flexible way of handling context cues, the
   ability to calculate probabilities from arpa format language models,
   the ability to force the model to back-off under certain circumstance
   (for example, if there is an unknown word in the context), and support
   for gnuzip compressed files as well as files compressed with the
   compress utility.

     * [4]download - download the current version (2.05) of the toolkit
     * [5]paper - a paper describing the toolkit. (p.r. clarkson and r.
       rosenfeld. statistical id38 using the cmu-cambridge
       toolkit from proceedings esca eurospeech 1997)
     * [6]documentation - the html documentation which accompanies the
       toolkit.
     * [7]changes - the changes between different versions of the toolkit.
     * [8]mailing list - a mailing list concerned with the toolkit.

   please note that as of june 1999, i am no longer at cambridge
   university, and am therefore unable to provide a great deal of support
   for the toolkit. i will try to provide answers to any quick questions
   that come up, however. the e-mail address at the foot of this page
   should continue to work for the foreseeable future.
