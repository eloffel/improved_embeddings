id195

   sequence to sequence learning with keras

   hi! you have just found id195. id195 is a sequence to sequence
   learning add-on for the python deep learning library [79]keras. using
   id195, you can build and train sequence-to-sequence neural network
   models in keras. such models are useful for machine translation,
   chatbots (see [80][4]), parsers, or whatever that comes to your mind.

   [81]id195

getting started

   id195 contains modular and reusable layers that you can use to build
   your own id195 models as well as built-in models that work out of the
   box. id195 models can be compiled as they are or added as layers to a
   bigger model. every id195 model has 2 primary layers : the encoder
   and the decoder. generally, the encoder encodes the input sequence to
   an internal representation called 'context vector' which is used by the
   decoder to generate the output sequence. the lengths of input and
   output sequences can be different, as there is no explicit one on one
   relation between the input and output sequences. in addition to the
   encoder and decoder layers, a id195 model may also contain layers
   such as the left-stack (stacked lstms on the encoder side), the
   right-stack (stacked lstms on the decoder side), resizers (for shape
   compatibility between the encoder and the decoder) and dropout layers
   to avoid overfitting. the source code is heavily documented, so lets go
   straight to the examples:

   a simple id195 model:
import id195
from id195.models import simpleid195

model = simpleid195(input_dim=5, hidden_dim=10, output_length=8, output_dim=8)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   that's it! you have successfully compiled a minimal id195 model!
   next, let's build a 6 layer deep id195 model (3 layers for encoding,
   3 layers for decoding).

   deep id195 models:
import id195
from id195.models import simpleid195

model = simpleid195(input_dim=5, hidden_dim=10, output_length=8, output_dim=8,
 depth=3)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   notice that we have specified the depth for both encoder and decoder as
   3, and your model has a total depth of 3 + 3 = 6. you can also specify
   different depths for the encoder and the decoder. example:
import id195
from id195.models import simpleid195

model = simpleid195(input_dim=5, hidden_dim=10, output_length=8, output_dim=20
, depth=(4, 5))
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   notice that the depth is specified as tuple, (4, 5). which means your
   encoder will be 4 layers deep whereas your decoder will be 5 layers
   deep. and your model will have a total depth of 4 + 5 = 9.

   advanced id195 models:

   until now, you have been using the simpleid195 model, which is a very
   minimalistic model. in the actual id195 implementation described in
   [82][1], the hidden state of the encoder is transferred to decoder.
   also, the output of decoder at each timestep becomes the input to the
   decoder at the next time step. to make things more complicated, the
   hidden state is propogated throughout the lstm stack. but you have no
   reason to worry, as we have a built-in model that does all that out of
   the box. example:
import id195
from id195.models import id195

model = id195(batch_input_shape=(16, 7, 5), hidden_dim=10, output_length=8, ou
tput_dim=20, depth=4)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   note that we had to specify the complete input shape, including the
   samples dimensions. this is because we need a static hidden
   state(similar to a stateful id56) for transferring it across layers.
   (update : full input shape is not required in the latest version, since
   we switched to recurrent shop backend). by the way, id195 models also
   support the stateful argument, in case you need it.

   you can also experiment with the hidden state propogation turned off.
   simply set the arguments broadcast_state and inner_broadcast_state to
   false.

   peeky id195 model:

   let's not stop there. let's build a model similar to [83]cho et al
   2014, where the decoder gets a 'peek' at the context vector at every
   timestep.

   [84]cho et al 2014

   to achieve this, simply add the argument peek=true:
import id195
from id195.models import id195

model = id195(batch_input_shape=(16, 7, 5), hidden_dim=10, output_length=8, ou
tput_dim=20, depth=4, peek=true)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   id195 model with attention:

   [85]attention id195

   let's not stop there either. in all the models described above, there
   is no allignment between the input sequence elements and the output
   sequence elements. but for machine translation, learning a soft
   allignment between the input and output sequences imporves
   performance.[86][3]. the id195 framework includes a ready made
   attention model which does the same. note that in the attention model,
   there is no hidden state propogation, and a bidirectional lstm encoder
   is used by default. example:
import id195
from id195.models import attentionid195

model = attentionid195(input_dim=5, input_length=7, hidden_dim=10, output_leng
th=8, output_dim=20, depth=4)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='rmsprop')

   as you can see, in the attention model you need not specify the samples
   dimension as there are no static hidden states involved(but you have to
   if you are building a stateful id195 model). note: you can set the
   argument bidirectional=false if you wish not to use a bidirectional
   encoder.

final words

   that's all for now. hope you love this library. for any questions you
   might have, create an issue and i will get in touch. you can also
   contribute to this project by reporting bugs, adding new examples,
   datasets or models.
