visual analysis for state changes in id56s

   more information about lstmvis, an introduction video, and the link to
   the live demo can be found at [95]lstm.seas.harvard.edu

   also check out our new work on sequence-to-sequence models on
   [96]github or the live demo at [97]http://id195-vis.io/
   [98][teaser_v2.png]

changes in v2

     * new design and server-backend
     * discrete zooming for hidden-state track
     * added annotation tracks for meta-data and prediction
     * added training and extraction workflow for tensorflow
     * client is now es6 and d3v4
     * some performance enhancements on client side
     * added keras tutorial [99]here (thanks to mohammadreza ebrahimi)

install

   please use python 2.7 to install lstmvis.

   clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hendrikstrobelt/lstmvis.git; cd lstmvis

   install python (server-side) requirements using [100]pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

on osx 10.11 (el capitan):
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

   download & unzip example dataset(s) into <lstmvis>/data/05childbook:

   [101]children book - gutenberg - 2.2 gb

   [102]parens dataset - 10k small - 0.03 gb

   start server:
python lstm_server.py -dir <datadir>

   for the example dataset, use python lstm_server.py -dir data

   open browser at [103]http://localhost:8888 - eh voila !

adding your own data

   if you want to train your own data first, please read the [104]training
   document. if you have your own data at hand, adding it to lstmvis is
   very easy. you only need three files:
     * hdf5 file containing the state vectors for each time step (e.g.
       states.hdf5)
     * hdf5 file containing a word id for each time step (e.g.
       train.hdf5)*
     * dict file containing the mapping from word id to word (e.g.
       train.dict)*

   a schematic representation of the data:

   [105]data format

   *if you don't have these files yet, but a space-separated .txt file of
   your training data instead, check out our [106]text conversion tool

data directory

   lstmvis parses all subdirectories of <datadir> for config files
   lstm.yml. a typical <datadir> might look like this:
<datadir>
          paren                       <--- project directory
                lstm.yml                <--- config file
                states.hdf5             <--- states for each time step
                train.hdf5              <--- word id for each time step
                train.dict              <--- mapping word id -> word
          fun ..

config file

   a simple example of an lstm.yml is:
name: children books  # project name
description: children book texts from the gutenberg project # little description

files: # assign files to reference name
  states: states.hdf5 # hdf5 files have to end with .h5 or .hdf5 !!!
  train: train.hdf5 # word ids of training set
  words: train.dict # dict files have to end with .dict !!

word_sequence: # defines the word sequence
  file: train # hdf5 file
  path: word_ids # path to table in hdf5
  dict_file: words # dictionary to map ids from hdf5 to words

states: # section to define which states of your model you want to look at
  file: states # hdf5 files containing the state for each position
  types: [
        {type: state, layer: 1, path: states1}, # type={state, output}, layer=[1
..x], path = hdf5 path
        {type: state, layer: 2, path: states2},
        {type: output, layer: 2, path: output2}
  ]
