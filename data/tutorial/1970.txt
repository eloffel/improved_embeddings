   recurrent neural networks, and in particular long short-term memory
   networks (lstms), are a remarkably effective tool for sequence
   processing that learn a dense black-box hidden representation of their
   sequential input. researchers interested in better understanding these
   models have studied the changes in hidden state representations over
   time and noticed some interpretable patterns but also significant
   noise.

   we present lstmvis a visual analysis tool for recurrent neural networks
   with a focus on understanding these hidden state dynamics. the tool
   allows a user to select a hypothesis input range to focus on local
   state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns in a
   large data set, and to align these results with structural annotations
   from their domain. we provide data for the tool to analyze specific
   hidden state properties on dataset containing nesting, phrase
   structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be
   used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis.

   see for example the pattern described for the [6]parens dataset or the
   patterns in the [7]children book dataset. start a matching by using the
   'fast' or 'precise' button.
