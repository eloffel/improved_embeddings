tree-structured id137

   an implementation of the tree-lstm architectures described in the paper
   [89]improved semantic representations from tree-structured long
   short-term memory networks by kai sheng tai, richard socher, and
   christopher manning.

requirements

     * [90]torch7
     * [91]penlight
     * [92]nn
     * [93]nngraph
     * [94]optim
     * java >= 8 (for stanford corenlp utilities)
     * python >= 2.7

   the torch/lua dependencies can be installed using [95]luarocks. for
   example:
luarocks install nngraph

usage

   first run the following script:
./fetch_and_preprocess.sh

   this downloads the following data:
     * [96]sick dataset (semantic relatedness task)
     * [97]stanford sentiment treebank (sentiment classification task)
     * [98]glove word vectors (common crawl 840b) -- warning: this is a
       2gb download!

   and the following libraries:
     * [99]stanford parser
     * [100]stanford pos tagger

   the preprocessing script generates dependency parses of the sick
   dataset using the [101]stanford neural network dependency parser.

   alternatively, the download and preprocessing scripts can be called
   individually.

semantic relatedness

   the goal of this task is to predict similarity ratings for pairs of
   sentences. we train and evaluate our models on the [102]sentences
   involving compositional knowledge (sick) dataset.

   to train models for the semantic relatedness prediction task on the
   sick dataset, run:
th relatedness/main.lua --model <dependency|constituency|lstm|bilstm> --layers <
num_layers> --dim <mem_dim> --epochs <num_epochs>

   where:
     * model: the lstm variant to train (default: dependency, i.e. the
       dependency tree-lstm)
     * layers: the number of layers (default: 1, ignored for tree-lstms)
     * dim: the lstm memory dimension (default: 150)
     * epochs: the number of training epochs (default: 10)

sentiment classification

   the goal of this task is to predict sentiment labels for sentences. for
   this task, we use the [103]stanford sentiment treebank dataset. here,
   there are two sub-tasks: binary and fine-grained. in the binary
   sub-task, the sentences are labeled positive or negative. in the
   fine-grained sub-task, the sentences are labeled very positive,
   positive, neutral, negative or very negative.

   to train models for the sentiment classification task on the stanford
   sentiment treebank, run:
th sentiment/main.lua --model <constituency|dependency|lstm|bilstm> --layers <nu
m_layers> --dim <mem_dim> --epochs <num_epochs>

   this trains a constituency tree-lstm model for the "fine-grained"
   5-class classification sub-task.

   for the binary classification sub-task, run with the -b or --binary
   flag, for example:
th sentiment/main.lua -m constituency -b

   predictions are written to the predictions directory and trained model
   parameters are saved to the trained_models directory.

   see the [104]paper for more details on these experiments.
