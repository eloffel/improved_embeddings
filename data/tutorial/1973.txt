news

   august 2017: the framenet-based model has been updated to framenet 1.7
   and now uses stanford corenlp for preprocessing.

   april 2017: the repository now also contains a compiled archive
   (pathlstm.jar) of the pathlstm source code. feel free to use this if
   you are unable or unwilling to compile the code yourself.

   may 2017: the source code and pre-compiled jar file are updated with
   additional code to support the framenet-based srl model described in
   roth (iid35 2016). note that this model requires syntactic preprocessing
   using external tools.

pathlstm

   this repository contains code for the pathlstm semantic role labeler
   introduced in [71]roth and lapata, 2016. it is built on top of the
   [72]mate-tools semantic role labeler. the pathlstm model achieves
   state-of-the-art results on the in-domain (87.9) and out-of-domain
   (76.6) test sets of the conll-2009 data set.

dependencies

   the following libraries and model files need to be downloaded in order
   to run the pathlstm propbank/nombank model on english text:
     * bernd bohnet's dependency parser and model files ([73]anna-3.3.jar
       and conll2009-st-english*.model^1
     * the wsj tokenizer from stanford corenlp
       ([74]stanford-corenlp-3.x.jar)
     * the most recent pathlstm srl model file (july 2016), available on
       google drive [75]here

   the srl classes can easily be compiled using maven (mvn compile).

   for frame-id14, the following dependencies are
   required:
     * stanford corenlp 3.8.0 ([76]https://stanfordnlp.github.io/corenlp/,
       make sure to use -stanford!)
     * a copy of framenet version 1.7
       ([77]http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/, make sure to use -framenet
       [fndir]!)
     * the most recent pathlstm frame-srl model file (august 2017),
       available on google drive [78]here

   to replicate the results from the abstract published at iid35 2016,
   please contact me personally.

running pathlstm

   if copies of all required libraries and models are available in the
   subdirectories lib/ and models/, respectively, pathlstm can simply be
   executed as a standalone application using the script scripts/parse.sh.
   these scripts run necessary preprocessing tools on a given input text
   file (assuming one sentence per line), and apply our state-of-the-art
   model for identifying and role labeling of semantic predicate-argument
   structures.

   it is also possible to apply the pathlstm model on already preprocessed
   text in the conll 2009 format, using the java class
   se.lth.cs.srl.parse. since pathlstm is trained based on preprocessed
   input from specific pipelines, however, we strongly recommend to use
   the complete pipeline to achieve best performance.

   if you are using the pathlstm srl model in your work--and we highly
   recommend you do!--please cite the following publication:

   with dependency path embeddings. in proceedings of the 54th annual
   meeting of the association for computational linguistics. berlin,
   germany, august, pp. 1192--1202.

   linguistics (coling), beijing, china.
     __________________________________________________________________

   ^1 to reproduce our evaluation results on the conll-2009 data set,
   preprocessing components must be retrained on the training split only,
   using 10-fold jackknifing.
