openid35: the opennlp id35 library

home



   _______________________________________________________________________

   openid35, the [1]opennlp id35 library, is an open source natural language
   processing library written in java, which provides parsing and
   realization services based on [2]mark steedman's [3]combinatory
   categorial grammar (id35) formalism.

   the library makes use of multi-modal extensions to id35 developed by
   [4]jason baldridge as part of the [5]grok system (the precursor to
   openid35). these extensions are described in jason's [6]dissertation and
   in a joint [7]eacl-03 paper with [8]geert-jan kruijff.

   subsequent development efforts, led by [9]michael white, have focused
   on making the realizer practical to use in dialogue systems, and more
   recently, on realization with broad coverage grammars. see the papers
   on mike's web page for details. since version 0.9.4, openid35 has
   included broad coverage english parsing and realization support that
   together make it possible to experiment with open domain grammatical
   id141. version 0.9.5 adds features for dependency ordering and
   dependency length minimization in realization, as in [10]white and
   rajkumar (2012), along with support for using 5-gram gigaword language
   models with [11]kenlm, and creating disjunctive logical forms based on
   the differences between aligned semantic graphs, as in [12]martin and
   white (2011). it also includes id352jsgf, an [13]extension developed for
   knexus research corporation for compiling an openid35 grammar into a
   context-free grammar in the java speech grammar format used by the
   sphinx speech recognizer, now released open source. (new!)

   also, jason baldridge and students at ut austin have developed dotid35,
   a new format for specifying openid35 grammars, and visid35, an editor and
   visualizer for grammars written in dotid35 format. these developments
   are described in [14]baldridge, chatterjee, palmer and wing (2007). see
   the ut austin computational linguistics lab's [15]openid35 wiki, which
   has a number of tutorials and example grammars for dotid35 and visid35.

   openid35 has been and is being used for a number of id71: see
   [16]the list of projects using openid35. please get in touch with jason
   if you would like add yours.

   for the latest news about openid35, check out the [17]sourceforge
   project page.

   further development of openid35 has moved to [18]github, where you can
   get the very latest code on branch master; releases and binaries will
   continue to be posted on sourceforge.
