   this introduction to id75 discusses a simple linear
   regression model with one predictor variable, and then extends it to
   the multiple id75 model with at least two predictors.

   id75

   prediction has always been a curious topic in life due to a key
   attribute     the extreme human desire to know what is coming next.

   let   s ponder over our thoughts to answer a simple question        where is
   prediction most relevant in your life today?   

   predictions are central to every aspect of our life, whether we realize
   it or not. during school days, it was predicting what we would love to
   do in the future to choose a career path, checking the weather today to
   determine how should i dress, evaluating inventory numbers for the next
   day, to less important predictions made daily during our interactions
   with other people     like doing time management and getting into classes
   for a student, to dining, socializing, etc.

so, what   s a prediction?


   a prediction or forecast, is a statement about the future. it   s a
   guess, sometimes based on knowledge or experience, but not always.

   now, let   s consider a popular and common use case of the speed of an
   object to understand how predictions play an important role in our real
   world; in shaping our lives in ways and instances that we aren   t aware
   of at first, and thereby help us to make informed decisions.

   have you ever thought of or answered day-to-day questions like    
     * how fast vehicles such as cars and trains can go and how their
       speeds are calculated?
     * when a police officer gives someone a speeding ticket, how does she
       know for sure if the person was speeding?

   these questions force us to recollect our old learnings and refresh the
   concept of the physical system     the speed of an object is the
   magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position) i.e. the
   speed of a certain object is calculated by dividing the distance
   travelled by the time taken to travel that distance.

   at first glance, the above equation states that speed is a function of
   two quantities     distance and time. but, it really is a simple linear
   relationship called the rate formula because at least one of the 3
   variables will always be a constant depending on the problem on hand.

   [37]distance-time plot

   the perfect linear relationship, as prevalent in the physical systems
   due to their inherent nature, are termed as deterministic (or
   functional) relationships     comprising of an equation, that exactly
   describes the relationship between the two variables. other examples
   could be
     * fahrenheit degree and celsius degree (fahr = 9/5 cels + 32),
     * circumference (circumference = pi x diameter) and
     * exchange rate conversion formula (new currency = (exchange rate) x
       (your currency))

   generally, we do come across scenarios
   depicting statistical relationships     where the relationship between
   the two variables is not perfect, but there could be negative or
   positive relationship between the variables. some examples could be
     * height and weight     as height increases, weight might increase but
       not perfectly
     * driving speed and gas mileage     as driving speed increases, gas
       mileage is expected to decrease, but not perfectly

   these relationships, not of perfect kind nature, when graphed, gives a
   scatter plot of points, as seen from the plot of height-weight
   information of 30 adults as below:

   [38]table-plot

   the above scatter plot reflects the relationship between height and
   weight as linear, depicting a positive increase in weight with height.
   we can thus fit a straight line to this data which would provide the
   best estimate of the observed trend.

   the data points in the above scatter plot could be summarized in many
   ways as shown by various lines in the below plot:

   [39]ht-wt-best fit

   now the question arises     what is the best fit line that summarizes the
   relationship between height-weight, amongst all possible lines?

   the best fit line is the one in blue color, and termed as regression
   line, which is actually the plot of the predicted score on y, for each
   possible value of x.

   but, the next question comes     how to arrive at this best line?

   the best line fitting the given data is obtained by    minimizing the
   residual variation    as below

   where

     is the actual observed value of response variable,

    is the predicted value of response variable (as obtained from the
   model), and

   is the residual variation     the variation between the observed and
   predicted value of y

   the closer the regression line comes to all the data points on the
   scatter plot, the better it is. this means that the minimum variation
   of points around the line results into low prediction error.

   the best fit straight line to summarize the data, as described above,
   could be obtained by using a prediction method such as simple
   regression.
