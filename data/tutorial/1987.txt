   this second part of an introduction to id75 moves past the
   topics covered in the first to discuss linearity, normality, outliers,
   and other topics of interest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [36]pushpa makhija, clevertap.

   id75

   in the [37]first part, we had discussed that the main task for building
   a multiple id75 model is to fit a straight line through a
   scatter-plot of data points in multidimensional space, that best
   estimates the observed trend.

   while building models to analyze the data, the foremost challenge is,
   the correct application of the techniques    how well analysts can apply
   the techniques to formulate appropriate statistical models to solve
   real problems.

   furthermore, before proceeding to analyze the data using multiple
   regression, part of the process encompasses to ensure that data you
   want to analyze, can actually be analyzed using multiple regression.
   therefore, it is only appropriate to use multiple regression if you
   understand the key assumptions underlying regression analysis and check
   whether your data    passes    the required assumptions to give a valid
   result.

   usually, it   s plausible for one or more of the assumptions being
   violated, while analyzing real-world data. even when the data fails
   certain assumptions, there is often a solution to overcome this. first,
   let   s look at the assumptions, and then learn how to check / validate
   the assumptions and also discuss about the proposed solutions for
   correcting these violations, if any.

   we would be using ivs for independent variables and dv for dependent
   variable interchangeably while going through listing and validating
   assumptions, exploring data, building the model and interpreting the
   model output.

assumptions of regression:


   number of cases/sample size

   when conducting regression analysis, the cases-to-independent variables
   ratio should ideally be 20 cases for every independent variable in the
   model. for instance, the simplest case with two ivs     would require
   that n>40. however, for qualitative i.e. categorical variables with
   many levels of values, we might require more than ideal 20 cases for
   this variable to have sufficient data points for each level of
   categorical variable.

   in this age of big data, we don   t need to worry about dealing with
   small samples. but, this assumption violation does result in
   generalizability issue of not being able to apply the model   s valuable
   insights and recommendations to other similar samples or situations.

   type of the variables

   the dependent variable should be measured on a continuous scale (i.e.
   an [38]interval or [39]ratio variable). examples include revision time
   (measured in hours), intelligence (measured using iq score), exam
   performance (measured from 0 to 100), weight (measured in kg or
   pounds), and so on.

   the two or more independent variables can be either continuous (i.e.
   an [40]interval or [41]ratio variable) or categorical (i.e.
   an [42]ordinal or [43]nominal variable).
     * examples of [44]ordinal variables include likert items     a 7-point
       scale from    strongly agree    to    strongly disagree    or other way of
       ranking categories     a 3-point scale to explain the liking of the
       product, from    yes   ,    no    and    may be   .
     * examples of [45]nominal variables include gender (2 groups: male
       and female), ethnicity (3 groups: caucasian, african-american and
       hispanic), physical activity level (5 groups: sedentary, slightly
       active, moderately active, active, and extremely active),
       profession (5 groups: surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist)
       and so forth.

   revisiting our weight   height example, we notice two of the independent
   variables to be continuous and one as categorical     exercise level with
   3 levels.   hence, for carrying out regression analysis, we need to
   create new variable(s) or recode the categorical variable     exercise
   level     into numerical values as the regression algorithm doesn   t work
   with non-numeric variables. exercise level for each person can be
   recoded as (1=sedentary, 2=moderately active, 3=very active) based on
   their lifestyle and attitude towards exercise.

   linearity

   multiple regression technique does not test whether the data is linear.
   instead, it requires the existence of a linear relationship between    
   the dependent variable and each of the independent variables, and the
   dependent variable and the independent variables collectively (assessed
   from the model fit or from 3rdscatterplot as shown below).

   [46]linearity

   the above plots help us to visually answer: are the two variables
   linearly related? we infer that each of the ivs (height, calorie
   intake) in first 2 plots, plotted one at a time, with the dependent
   variable (weight) and even the last plot (effect of ivs collectively
   via predicted values of dv) signifies linear relationship between the
   variables.

   normality

   multiple regression analysis requires that variables are normally
   distributed. in practice, the distribution of the variables, close to
   normal distribution is acceptable. there are various ways to check the
   normality assumption. histogram is a quick way to check normality.

   [47]hist-wt

   the above histogram plot includes a density curve that closely depicts
   the bell-shaped curve of normal distribution.

   absence of multicollinearity

   multicollinearity pertains to the relationship among ivs.  exists when
   the ivs are highly correlated with each other or when one iv is a
   combination of one or more of the other ivs.

   for example, when we look into the pricing of house flat, both the
   variables     area in square feet and area in square cm or square inches
   doesn   t contribute much to the price prediction as these 2 variables
   give the same information, though in a different way and are highly
   correlated as evident from the conversion formula.

   [48]ht-cal plot

   as indicated in the above plot, height and calorie intake used for
   predicting weight reflects no discernible pattern i.e. the data
   demonstrates an absence of multicollinearity.

   the other criteria that could be used to detect multicollinearity are
   tolerance, variance inflation factor (vif), or condition index.
