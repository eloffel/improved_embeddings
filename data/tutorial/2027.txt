what is natural language 

processing

    natural language processing (nlp) 

    it is the study of the computational treatment of natural 
    in other words, teaching computers how to understand 

(human) language.
(and generate) human language.

modern applications

   
    id53
    natural language assistants
    translation systems
    news digest
    automated earthquake reports
    automated stock market reports

search engines

    apple   s siri, ms cortana
    google translate
    yahoo!
    la times
    narrative science

notes

    computers are confused by (human) language
    nlp draws on research in many fields

    specific techniques are needed

    linguistics, theoretical computer science, mathematics, 
statistics, artificial intelligence, psychology, databases, 
etc.

structure of the course

    linguistic, mathematical, and computational 
background
    computational models of morphology, syntax, 
semantics, discourse, pragmatics
    core nlp technology: parsing, part of speech 
tagging, text generation, semantic analysis, etc.
    applications: text classification, id31, 
text summarization, id53, machine 
translation, information extraction, etc.
    neural networks and deep learning: autoencoders, 
recurrent nn, lstm, etc.

major goals of the class

underlying natural language processing 

    learn the basic principles and theoretical issues 
    understand why language processing is hard
    learn techniques and tools used to develop 
practical, robust systems that can understand text 
and communicate with users in one or more 
languages 
tools
natural language

    understand the limitations of these techniques and 
    gain insight into some open research problems in

how to get the most out of the class?

    attend the lectures and study the slides

    course syllabus + slides = road map 
    some material may not be found in any of the readings

    hands on experience
    ask questions in and after class

    implement what you   ve learned 

questions?

    use the right channels for communications
    in special cases (e.g., sickness, regrading), 

    piazza
email the instructors
    include [cpsc477] or [cpsc577] or [nlp class] in the
