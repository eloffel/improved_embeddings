summarizing 30 years of acl 

discoveries using citing sentences

1979

carbonell (1979) discusses inferring the meaning of new words.

1980 weischedel and black (1980) discuss techniques for interacting with the linguist/developer to identify insufficiencies in the grammar.

1984

1983

1982

1981 moore (1981) observed that determiners rarely have a direct correlation with the existential and universal quantifiers of id85.
heidorn (1982) provides a good summary of early work in weight-based analysis, as well as a weight-oriented approach to attachment
decisions based on syntactic considerations only.
grosz et al. (1983) proposed the centering model which is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse and
the choices of referring expressions.
karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful.
shieber (1985) proposes a more efficient approach to gaps in the patr-ii formalism, extending earley   s algorithm by using restriction
to do top-down filtering.
kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, center establishment (est), for utterances. e.g., in bruno was the bully of the
neighborhood.
brennan et al. (1987) propose a default ordering on transitions which correlates with discourse coherence.

1987
1988 whittaker and stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and

questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not.

1985

1986

1989

church and hanks (1989) explored tile use of mutual information statistics in ranking co-occurrences within five-word windows.

1999

hindle (1990) classified nouns on the basis of co-occurring patterns of subject verb and verb-object pairs.
gale and church (1991) extract pairs of anchor words, such as numbers, proper nouns (organization, person, title), dates, and
monetary information.
pereira and schabes (1992) establish that evaluation according to the bracketing accuracy and evaluation according to perplexity
or cross id178 are very different.
pereira et al. (1993) proposed a soft id91 scheme, in which membership of a word in a class is probabilistic.

hearst (1994) presented two implemented segmentation algorithms based on term repetition, and compared the boundaries
produced to the boundaries marked by at least 3 of 7 subjects, using information retrieval metrics.
yarowsky (1995) describes a    semi-unsupervised    approach to the problem of sense disambiguation of words, also using a set of
initial seeds, in this case a few high quality sense annotations.
collins (1996) proposed a statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree.

collins (1997)   s parser and its re-implementation and extension by bikel (2002) have by now been applied to a variety of
languages: english (collins, 1999), czech (collins et al., 1999), german (dubey and keller, 2003), spanish (cowan and collins,
2005), french (arun and keller, 2005), chinese (bikel, 2002) and, according to dan bikels web page, arabic.
lin (1998) proposed a word similarity measure based on the distributional pattern of words which allows to construct a thesaurus
using a parsed corpus.
rapp (1999) proposed that in any language there is a correlation between the cooccurrences of words which are translations of
each other.

och and ney (2000) introduce a null-alignment capability to id48 alignment models.
yamada and knight (2001) used a statistical parser trained using a treebank in the source language to produce parse trees and
proposed a tree to string model for alignment.
id7 (papineni et al., 2002) was devised to provide automatic evaluation of mt output.
och (2003) developed a training procedure that incorporates various mt evaluation criteria in the training procedure of log-linear
mt models.

pang and lee (2004) applied two different classifiers to perform sentiment annotation in two sequential steps: the first classifier
separated subjective (sentiment-laden) texts from objective (neutral) ones and then they used the second classifier to classify the
subjective texts into positive and negative.
chiang (2005) introduces hiero, a hierarchical phrase-based model for id151.
liu et al. (2006) experimented with tree-to-string translation models that utilize source side parse trees.

goldwater and grif   ths (2007) employ a bayesian approach to id52 and use sparse dirichlet priors to minimize model
size.
huang (2008) improves the re-ranking work of charniak and johnson (2005) by re-ranking on packed forest, which could
potentially incorporate exponential number of k-best list.

2009 mintz et al. (2009) uses freebase to provide distant supervision for id36.

2010

chiang (2010) proposes a method for learning to translate with both source and target syntax in the framework of a hierarchical
phrase-based system.

on her visit to armenia, millie has gotten lost in yerevan, the 
nation   s capital. she is now at the metropoliten (subway) station 
named shengavit,  but her friends are waiting for her at the station 
named barekamutyun. can you help millie meet up with her 
friends?

1. assuming millie takes a train in the right direction, 
which will be the first stop after shengavit?  

note that all names of stations listed below appear on the map.

a. gortsaranayin
b. zoravar andranik
c. charbakh
d. garegin njdehi hraparak
e. none of the above

2. after boarding at shengavit, how many stops will it take millie 
to get to barekamutyun (don   t include shengavit itself in the 
number of stops)?
