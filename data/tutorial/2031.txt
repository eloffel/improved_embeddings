linguistic knowledge 

       constituents:
       children eat pizza.
       they eat pizza.
       my cousin   s neighbor   s children eat pizza.
       eat pizza!
       collocations:

       strong beer but *powerful beer
       big sister but *large sister
       stocks rise but ?stocks ascend 

      

in the past: 225,000 hits vs. 47 hits on google, now 550,000 vs 57,000

       how to get this knowledge in the system:
       manual rules
       automatically acquired from large text collections (corpora)

linguistic knowledge 

       knowledge about language:

       id102 and phonology - the study of sounds
       morphology - the study of word components
       syntax - the study of sentence and phrase structure
       lexical semantics - the study of the meanings of 
       id152 - how to combine words
       pragmatics - how to accomplish goals
       discourse conventions - how to deal with units larger
