there are four bungalows in our cul-de-sac. they are made from these 
materials: straw, wood, brick and glass.   
   mrs. scott's bungalow is somewhere to the left of the wooden one and 
the third one along is brick. mrs. umbrella owns a straw bungalow and 
mr. tinsley does not live at either end, but lives somewhere to the right 
of the glass bungalow. mr. wilshaw lives in the fourth bungalow, whilst 
the first bungalow is not made from straw.   
   who lives where, and what is their bungalow made from?
