id31 

      

   i like the camera because i can edit images so easily, exactly as i do my ipad. 
i have found that its difficult to frame a picture when there isn't a zoom 
function as with the ipad. with this camera i can adjust my images by 
cropping as i did with my ipad but better yet, this camera has a built in zoom. 
a stretch or pinch of the fingers bring in the subject closer or back out again. 
with this iphone i can also, as i dido with my ipad, enhance, crop, rotate, red 
eye reduce, and set a range of tints. i am also quite impressed with the 
quality of the images. pretty darn good especially better than i expected for 
low light situations where i can use the built-in flash! quite frankly i was 
quite surprised with these built in features. i also hope too experiment with 
and learn what hdr photography is. it's built into this iphone and can be 
activated by a the touch of an icon.

nutrients
      

eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce risk for heart disease, including heart 
attack and stroke.
eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may protect against certain types of cancers.
diets rich in foods containing fiber, such as some vegetables and fruits, may reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2 
diabetes.
eating vegetables and fruits rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pressure, and may also reduce 
the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss.
eating foods such as vegetables that are lower in calories per cup instead of some other higher-calorie food may be useful in 
helping to lower calorie intake.
most vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories. none have cholesterol. (sauces or seasonings may add fat, calories, or 
cholesterol.)
vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin a, and vitamin 
c.
diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. vegetable sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, 
white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, spinach, lentils, and 
kidney beans.
dietary fiber from vegetables, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart 
disease. fiber is important for proper bowel function. it helps reduce constipation and diverticulosis. fiber-containing foods such 
as vegetables help provide a feeling of fullness with fewer calories.
folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume 
adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. this reduces the 
risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development.
vitamin a keeps eyes and skin healthy and helps to protect against infections.

summary 

eating vegetables is 
healthy.
