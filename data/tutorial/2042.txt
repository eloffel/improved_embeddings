    language:
    set of strings
    automaton:

    abstract model
    defines a language (all the strings that it accepts)
    input: string
    output: yes/no

the id154

recursively enumerable

context-sensitive

languages and automata

    regular

    context-free

    finite-state
    id157
    id39, id66
    push-down automata
    most nl and pl phenomena
    linear bounded automaton

in practice
    almost
in theory
    no
    center-embedding requires context-free rules

    example

proof that nl are not regular

    pumping lemma for regular languages

    if l is an infinite language over a, then there are strings 
    regular languages are closed under intersection

x,y,z     a* such that y     e and xynz     l for all n   0. 

[figure from jurafsky and martin]

proof (cont   d)

    consider the language l=anbn
    there are only three options for y:

    a+
    b+
    a+b+
in each case, repeating y (or skipping y) will 
result in a string that is not in l

   

another example

    sentences

    language

    the cat caught a fish
    the cat that the dog saw caught a fish
    the cat that the dog that the girl found saw caught a fish
    (the n)n (verb)n-1 caught a fish
    a = {the cat, the dog, the rat, the girl    }
    b = {ate, saw, caught, chased, found    } 
intersect with english
    a* b* caught a fish
    l =    an bn-1 caught a fish    is not regular (see previous slide)

are natural languages context-free

   

   

in practice
    almost
in theory
    no
    cross-serial dependencies cannot be captured using a id18
