some observations

    ambiguity

    count (noun) vs. count (verb)
    11% of all types but 40% of all tokens in the brown 
    examples

corpus are ambiguous.
    likecan be tagged as adp verb adj adv noun 
    presentcan be tagged as adj noun verb adv

some observations

    more examples: 

    transport, object, discount, address
    content

    french pronunciation:
    three main techniques:

markov models)

    rule-based
    machine learning (e.g., id49, maximum id178 
    transformation-based
disambiguation, etc.

    useful for parsing, translation, text to speech, word sense 

example

   

   

bethlehem/nnp steel/nnp corp./nnp ,/, hammered/vbn by/in higher/jjr 
costs/nns
bethlehem/nnp steel/nnp corp./nnp ,/, hammered/vbn by/in higher/jjr 
costs/vbz

classifier-based id52

    a baseline method would be to use a classifier to 

map each individual word into a likely pos tag
    why is this method unlikely to work well?

sources of information

   

   

bethlehem/nnp steel/nnp corp./nnp ,/, hammered/vbn by/in higher/jjr 
costs/nns
bethlehem/nnp steel/nnp corp./nnp ,/, hammered/vbn by/in higher/jjr 
costs/vbz

    knowledge about individual words

    lexical information
    spelling (-or)
    capitalization (ibm)

    knowledge about neighboring words

evaluation

    baseline

    tag each word with its most likely tag
    tag each oov word as a noun.
    around 90%

    current accuracy

    around 97% for english
    compared to 98% human performance

rule-based id52

    use dictionary or finite-state transducers to find 
all possible parts of speech
    use disambiguation rules 
    hundreds of constraints need to be designed 

    e.g., art+v
manually

sample rules

    bs3 bi1

    a bs3 (3rd person subject personal pronoun) cannot be followed by a bi1 (1st person indirect 
    in the example:    il nous faut    (=    we need   )        il    has the tag bs3ms and    nous    has the tags 
    the negative constraint    bs3 bi1    rules out    bi1p'', and thus leaves only 4 alternatives for the 

personal pronoun). 
[bd1p bi1p bj1p br1p bs1p]. 
word    nous   .

    the tag n (noun) cannot be followed by a tag k (interrogative pronoun); an example in the 
    since    qui    can be tagged both as an    e    (relative pronoun) and a    k    (interrogative pronoun), 

test corpus would be:    ... fleuve qui ...    (...river that...). 
the    e    will be chosen by the tagger since an interrogative pronoun cannot follow a noun 
(   n   ).

example    l' appelle    (calls him/her). 

    a word tagged with r (article) cannot be followed by a word tagged with v (verb): for 
    the word    appelle    can only be a verb, but    l'    can be either an article or a personal pronoun.  
    thus, the rule will eliminate the article tag, giving preference to the pronoun.
