introduction to nlp

information extraction

information extraction

    usually from unstructured or semi-structured 
    examples

data
    news stories
    scientific papers
    resumes 

    entities
    build knowledge base

    who did what, when, where, why

named entities

    types:
    people
    locations
    organizations
    teams
    newspapers
    companies 

    ambiguity:
    useful for interfaces to databases, question 

    geo-political entities
    london can be a person, city, country (by metonymy) etc.
answering, etc.

times and events

    times

    events

    absolute expressions
    relative expressions (e.g.,    last night   )

    e.g., a plane went past the end of the runway

sequence labeling

    many nlp problems can be cast as sequence labeling 

problems
    pos     id52
    ner     id39
    srl     id14 
input
   
    sequence w1w2w3
    output
    labeled words
    classification methods
classifying the next one

    can use the categories of the previous tokens as features in 
    direction matters

id39 (ner)
    segmentation

    which words belong to a named entity?
    brazilian football legend pele's condition has improved, 

according to a thursday evening statement from a sao paulo
hospital.

    classification

    what type of named entity is it?
    use gazetteers, spelling, adjacent words, etc.
    brazilian football legend [person pele]'s condition has 

improved, according to a [time thursday evening] statement 
from a [location sao paulo] hospital.

ner, time, and event extraction
    brazilian football legend [person pele]'s condition has 

improved, according to a [time thursday evening] 
statement from a [location sao paulo] hospital.
    there had been earlier concerns about pele's health 
after [org albert einstein hospital] issued a release 
that said his condition was "unstable.   
[time thursday night]'s release said [event pele was 
relocated] to the intensive care unit because a kidney 
dialysis machine he needed was in icu.

   

biomedical example

    gene labeling
    sentence:

    [gene brca1] and [gene brca2] are human genes that 

produce tumor suppressor proteins

muc example

example from 
grishman and sundheim 1996

other examples

job announcements
    location, title, starting date, qualifications, salary

   
    seminar announcements
    time, title, location, speaker
    medical papers

    drug, disease, gene/protein, cell line, species, substance 

filling the templates

    e.g., the names of people

    some fields get filled by text from the document
    others can be pre-defined values 
    e.g., successful/unsuccessful merger
    some fields allow for multiple values

approaches

    use id48

    view ie as a sequence labeling problem
    use patterns
    features

    e.g., id157

    capitalization (initial, allcaps), contains digits, spelling 

(e.g., suffixes), punctuation

perl id157

^
$
.
*
+
?
|
( )
[ ]
{ }
\

beginning of string; complement inside []
end of string
any character except newline
match 0 or more times
match 1 or more times
match 0 or 1 times
alternatives
grouping and memory
set of characters
repetition modifier
special symbol

perl id157

a*
a+
a?
a{m}
a{m,}
a{m,n}
repetition?

zero or more
one or more
zero or one
exactly m
at least m
at least m but at most n 
shortest match

perl id157

tab
newline
carriage return (cr)
asterisk
question mark
period
hexadecimal character
matches one alphanumeric (or    _   ) character

\t
\n
\r
\*
\?
\.
\xhh
\w
\w matches the complement of \w
\s
\s
\d
\d
\b
\b
[x-y]

space, tab, newline
complement of \s
same as [0-9]
complement of \d
   word    boundary
complement of \b
inclusive range from x to y

sample patterns

    price (e.g., $14,000.00)
    date (e.g., 2015-02-01)

    \$[0-9,]+(\.[0-9]{2})?

9]|3[01])$

    email

    ^(19|20)\d\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-
