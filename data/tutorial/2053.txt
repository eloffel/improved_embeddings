syntax

syntax

   

is language more than just a    bag of words   ?
    grammatical rules apply to categories and groups of words, not 

individual words.

    example

noun phrase and the predicate is a verb phrase.

    a sentence includes a subject and a predicate. the subject is a 
    noun phrase: the cat, samantha, she
    verb phrase: arrived, went away, had dinner
usage.
    examples: wug (n), cluvious (adj)     use them in sentences
    hard to come up with made up words: forkle, vleer, etc. all taken.

    when people learn a new word, they learn its syntactic 

defining parts of speech

    e.g., canbe preceded by    the   . 

    verbs can be preceded by    can   t   . 

    what do nouns typically have in common? 
    what about verbs?
    adjectives can come between    the    and a noun.
    determiners
    prepositions

    how is this different from grade school definitions?

    a, the, many, no, five

    for, to, in, without, before

the lexicon

    how do we think of words like cat, run, five?

    pronunciation, part of speech, meaning
    five: /fa  v/, numeral,    5   

    ambiguity

constituents

    constituents are continuous
    constituents are non-crossing

completely contain the other.
    each word is a constituent

    if two constituents share one word, then one of them must 

constituent tests

   

   

   

   coordination    test 
    she bought a bagel and three 
chocolate croissants
   pronoun    test
    a small dog is barking in the park.
    it is barking in the park
   question by repetition    test:
    i have seen blue elephants
    blue elephants?
    * seen blue?
    seen blue elephants?

   

   

   

   
   

   topicalization    test:
    blue elephants, i have seen.
   question    test:
    whathave i seen?
   deletion    test
    last year i saw a blue elephant in 
   semantic    test
   intuitition    test

the zoo.

how to generate sentences

    one way: tree structure

    generate the tree structure first
    then fill the leaf nodes with terminals

a simple syntactic rule

    the simplest rule for a sentence, e.g.    birds 

fly   
s    n v

simplest grammar

s    n v
n    samantha | min | jorge
v    left | sang | walked

sample sentences:
samantha sang
jorge left

syntax

    the verbs so far were intransitive (no direct 
    what rules are needed next? 

object)

    combinatorial explosion (even for the simplest 

samantha   )

    transitive verbs and direct objects (   jorge saw 
    determiners (   the cats   )
form of sentences)
    need for noun phrases
    ditto for verb phrases

latest grammar

s    np vp
np    dt n
vp    v np
dt    the | a
n    child | cat | dog
v    took | saw | liked | scared | chased
sample sentences:

a dog chased the cat
the child saw a dog

alternatives

    different expansions of a category are delineated 

with    |   
    np    pn | dt cn
nouns

    one rule for proper nouns and another for common 

latest grammar

s    np vp
np    dt cn
np    pn
vp    v np
dt    the | a
cn    child | cat | dog
pn    samantha | jorge | min
v    took | saw | liked | scared | chased

sample sentences:

a child scared jorge
min took the child

optional categories

    wherever n is allowed in a sentence, 

    dt n
    jj n
    dt jj n
are also allowed

    we can use the notation for alternatives
    optional categories can be also marked using 

    np    n | dt n | jj n | dt jj n
parentheses:
    np    (dt) (jj) n

verb phrases

    samantha ran.
    samantha ran to the park.
    samantha ran away.
    samantha bought a cookie.
    samantha bought a cookie for john.
    overall structure

    vp    v(np)(p)(np)

latest grammar

s    np vp
np    dt cn
np    pn
vp    v (np) (p) (np)
dt    the | a
cn    child | cat | dog
pn    samantha | jorge | min
p    to | for | from | in
v    took | saw | liked | scared | chased | gave

sample sentences:

samantha saw the cat
jorge gave the cat to min

prepositional phrases

    examples:

    mary bought a book for john in a bookstore.
    the bookstore sells magazines.
    the bookstore on main st. sells magazines.
    mary ran away.
    mary ran down the hill.
    changes are needed to both np and vp to accommodate 
prepositional phrases
    wherever a preposition is allowed, it can be followed by a noun phrase.
    run up 
    np can contain any number of pps but only up to two nps. 

    how do we revise the grammar accordingly?

the rules so far

    s    np vp
    np    (dt) (jj) n (pp)
    vp    v (np) (pp)
    pp    p (np)

pp ambiguity

    the boy saw the woman with the telescope.

pp    prep np
vp    v np pp
vp    v np
np    dt n
np    dt n pp

repetition (*)

(jj*) = a sequence of zero or more jj

   
    are all sequences of adjectives allowed?

    a big red house
    * a red big house
semantics!

    adjective ordering in english depends on 

exercise

    the little red riding hood
    three little pigs
    the three musketeers
    the steadfast tin soldier
    the french connection
    old macdonald
    five golden rings
    the ancient mariner

adjective ordering

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

   
   
   

det
number
strength
size
age
shape
color
origin
material
purpose
noun
det < number < size < color < purpose < noun
strength < material < noun
origin < noun

nested sentences

    examples:

    i don   t recall whether i took the dog out.
    do you know if the mall is still open?
    vp    v (np) (np) (c s) (pp*)
    can (c s) appear inside an np?

    whether he will win the elections remains to be seen.

recursion

    s can generate vp, vp can generate s
    np can generate pp, pp can generate np
    what does recursion allow?
is there a longest sentence in english?
   
    conjunction of nps: 
np    np and np
    conjunction of pps: 
    conjunction of vps: 

pp    pp and pp

vp    vp and vp

meta-patterns

    s    np vp

   

    np    (dt) (jj) n (pp)
    vp    v (np) (pp)
    pp    p (np)
is there a meta-pattern here?
    xp    (specifier) x   
    x       x (complement)
    example: np    dt n   
    x-bar theory

    http://www.unlweb.net/wiki/x-bar_theory

meta-rules for conjunctions

    conjunction
    this kind of rule even covers entire sentences

    x    x and x

    s    s and s

auxiliaries

is    aux v    a constituent?
    i have seen blue elephants and will remember them 

   

   

forever.
    recursion:

    vp -> aux vp
    raj may have been sleeping.
is such recursion unlimited?

exercise

    grammar:

    what rules are needed to generate these three 

    s    np vp | cp vp
    np    (dt) (jj*) n (cp) (pp*)
    vp    v (np) (np) (pp*) | v (np) (cp) (pp*) 
    pp    p np
    cp    c s
sentences:
    1. the small dog of the neighbors brought me an old tennis 
    2. that wugs have three eyes is unproven by scientists.
    3. i saw the gift that the old man gave me at the meeting.

ball.

notes

    syntax helps with sentences like    * the milk 
drank the cat   ,    the milk is drunk by the cat   
    overgeneration    the girl saw   
    undergeneration
    grammar     between the two

arguments vs. adjuncts

    arguments

    mandatory (e.g.,    * romeo likes   ,    *likes juliet   )
    cannot be repeated (e.g.,    * juliet likes romeo john   )
    verbs can have more than one subcategorization frame

    adjuncts
    optional
    typically prepositional phrases or adverbs
    can be repeated (e.g.,    apparently candace ate pizza 
yesterday at the restaurant with pleasure   )
