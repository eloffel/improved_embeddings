wsj/12/wsj_1273.mrg, sentence 11 
    because the cd had an effective yield of 13.4 % when 
it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general 
had declined sharply since then , part of the price dr. 
blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional 
amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued 
interest that represented the cd 's increased market 
value .

    disadvantages

grammar.

    a lot more work to annotate 40k+ sentences than to write a

    statistics about different constituents and phenomena

conclusions

    syntax helps understand the meaning of a 

sentence.
    bob gave alice a flower
    who gave a flower to alice?
    what did bob give to alice?
representation for syntactic information
parsing
    cubic time to find one parse
    still exponential time to find all parses
    why?

    context-free grammars are an appopriate 
    id145 is needed for efficient 

answer

    why does it still take an exponential time to 
find all parses?
    very simple     because the number of parses can 
be exponential
