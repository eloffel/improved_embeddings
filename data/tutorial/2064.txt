dependency grammars

    characteristics

    lexical/syntactic dependencies between words
    the top-level predicate of a sentence is the root
    simpler to parse than context-free grammars
    particularly useful for free word order languages

how to identify the heads

    h=head, m=modifier

    h determines the syntactic category of the construct
    h determines the semantic category of the construct
    h is required; m may be skipped
    fixed linear position of m with respect to h

head rules from collins   s thesis

the image part with relationship id r  was not found in the    le.

non-projectivity

    rare in english
    topicalization
    cats, i like a lot.
    extraposition

    the pizza is ready with pepperoni.

    how to extend a projective method for non-

projective parses
    use a swap operator (nivre 2009)

    not clear what to do with conjunctions
