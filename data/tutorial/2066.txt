transition-based id33

transition-based parsing

    similar to shift-reduce
    produces a single (projective) tree
    data structures

    stack of partially processed (unattached) words
    input buffer
    set of dependency arcs

    attach the word on the top of the stack to the word at the 

current position in the buffer (or in the other direction)

transition-based parsing

   

initial configuration
    stack (including the root token w0)
    buffer (sentence)
    arcs (empty)

    goal configuration

    stack (empty)
    buffer (empty)
    arcs (complete tree)

maltparser (nivre 2008)

the stack and one from the buffer

    the reduce operations combine an element from 
    arc-standard parser
    arc-eager parser

    the actions are shift, left-arc, right-arc

    the actions are shift, reduce, left-arc, right-arc

(arc-eager) maltparser actions

[example from nivre and kuebler]

[example from kuebler, mcdonald, nivre]

example

    example:    people want to be free   
[want, to, be, free] 
[want, to, be, free]  
[to, be, free]  

[root] 
   
    shift     [root, people] 
    lansubj [root] 
    raroot [root, want]

people)}
want)}

    characteristics

[people, want, to, be, free]    

    the next action is chosen locally using a classifier (e.g. id166)
    there is no search
    the final list of arcs is returned as the dependency tree
    trained on a dependency treebank

    very fast method

a1 = {nsubj(want, 
a2 = a1     {root(root, 

parsing

    oracle-based
deterministic

    assuming an oracle, parsing is 
in practice
    approximate the oracle with a 
classifier
    o(c) = argmaxt w.f(c,t)

   

[example from mcdonald and nivre]

greedy transition-based parsing

    id125 with q=1
    score is computed using a linear model
    because of the greedy property, errors can 
propagate parse (sent = w1...wn)

c = cs (sent)
while c is not in ct

t* = argmaxt score (c,t)
c = t*(c)

return gc

feature model

complexity

    arc-eager is o(n3)     like eisner
    arc-standard is o(n5)
