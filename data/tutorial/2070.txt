the id154

    regular languages
    context-free languages
    context-sensitive languages
    recursively enumerable languages

the id154

    regular languages
    context-free languages
    mildly context-sensitive languages
    context-sensitive languages
    recursively enumerable languages

mildly context-sensitive grammars
    superset of id18
    polynomial parsing
    constant growth property
    (string length grows linearly)
    cannot handle the language of strings with the 
same number of as, bs, and cs.

[example from julia hockenmaier]

other formalisms
    tree substitution grammar (tsg)
    terminals generate entire tree fragments
    tsg and id18 are formally equivalent

mildly context-sensitive grammars
    more powerful than tsg
    examples:

    id34 (tag)
    id35 (id35)

(tree) operations in tag

    substitution
    adjunction (not in tsg)

    insert an initial tree to the bottom of a tree
    insert an auxiliary tree fragment in the middle of a tree
    used for long-distance dependencies and for optional 

modifiers

    features

the top half and with the bottom half

    each elementary tree has features that can be associated with 
    unification is needed
(lexicalization)
    ltag: each initial or auxiliary tree is labeled with a lexical 

   

item

id34 (tag)
it can generate languages like anbncndn or ww 
(cross-serial dependencies): 
    e.g., mary gave a book and a magazine to chen and mike, 

   

respectively.

    expressive power

    tag is formally more powerful than id18 
    tag is less powerful than id19

notes

    embedded pushdown automaton (vijay-shanker
1988)
    similar to the usual pushdown automaton for 
id18, but the stack includes stacks of symbols, 
instead of symbols directly
it can generate the language {anbncndn}
