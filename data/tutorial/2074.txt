prepositional phrase attachment 
input
      
       a prepositional phrase and the surrounding context
       output
       a binary label: 0(high) or 1(low)
in practice
      
       the context consists only of four words: the preposition, the 
verb before the preposition, the noun before the preposition, 
and the noun after the preposition

       example: 
       why?

       join board as director

answer 

       because almost all the information needed to 
classify a prepositional phrase   s attachment as 
high or low is contained in these four features.
       furthermore, using only these tuples of four 
features allows for a consistent and scaleable 
approach.

       the linguistics (and psycholinguistics) literature 
offers competitive explanations for attachment. 
       one theory (kimball 1973) favors the so-called right association rule. it 
says that, given a new phrase and two choices for attachment, people tend 
to attach the new phrase with the more recent (   rightmost    within the 
sentence) of the candidate nodes, resulting in low attachment. 
attachment that results in the syntax tree having fewer additional syntactic 
nodes (in this case, favoring high attachment). 
explain the high prevalence of both types of attachment.

       alternatively, the minimal attachment principle (frazier 1978) favors an 

       as one can see from the statistics, none of these methods alone can

       some observations can be made using statistical 

analysis of the training set. 
       the standard corpus used for this sort of analyses comes from (rrr 1994) 

       this data representation makes the assumption that additional context is only 

and includes 27,937 prepositional phrases extracted from the id32 
(marcus et al. 1993), divided into three groups (20,801 training, 4039 
development, and 3097  test). 
marginally more useful for classification purposes compared to the four 
features in the table (verb, noun1, preposition, and noun2). 
       for comparison, the sentence matching the data point    bring attention to 
problem    is actually    although preliminary findings were reported more than a 
year ago, the latest results appear in today's new england journal of medicine, 
a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem.    it is unlikely that the 
information in the first    of the sentence will affect the classification of the 
prepositional phrase    to the problem   .
