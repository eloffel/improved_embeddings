many different ways. for example,    the plane leaves at 12pm    vs 
   the flight departs at noon

    text similarity is a key component of natural language 

    if the user is looking for information about cats, we may want 

    if the user is looking for information about    fruit dessert   , we 

the nlp system to return documents that mention kittens even if 
the word    cat    is not in them. 
want the nlp system to return documents about    peach tart    or 
   apple cobbler   .
difference between similar sounding words like the    dulles    and 
   dallas    airports.

    a id103 system should be able to tell the

types of text similarity

    many types of text similarity exist:
    morphological similarity (e.g., respect-respectful)
    spelling similarity (e.g., theater-theatre)
    synonymy (e.g., talkative-chatty)
    homophony (e.g., raise-raze-rays)
    semantic similarity (e.g., cat-tabby)
    sentence similarity (e.g., paraphrases)
    document similarity (e.g., two news stories on the same 

event)
