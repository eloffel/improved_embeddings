text similarity

the vector space model

vectors and matrices
    x = <x1, x2,    , xn>: a vector of n dimensions. 
    x1,    , xn can take either binary values {0, 1}, or real values
    vectors and matrices provide a natural way to represent the 
occurrence of words in a document/query. 
    in text analysis, n is usually the size of the vocabulary, so each 
    x can be used to represent a document, or a query, or    
    so xi indicates either    whether the i-th word in the vocabulary 
appears    (binary value), or    how many times does the i-th word 
appear    (real value). 

dimension corresponds to a unique word

    the entire collection is thus represented as a matrix. 

    how?

document similarity

    used in information retrieval to 

determine which document (d1 or 
d2) is more similar to a given query 
q.
    documents and queries are 
represented in the same space.
    angle (or cosine) is a proxy for 
similarity between two vectors

based on distance/similarity measures

distance/similarity calculation
    the similarity/relevance of two vectors can be calculated 
    s: x, y    (0, 1)
    x: <x1, x2,    , xn>
    y: <y1, y2,    , yn>
    s(x, y) = ?

    the more dimensions in common, the larger the similarity
    what about real values?

    what is the cosine similarity between:

    d=    cat,dog,dog    = <1,2,0>

quiz

    given three documents

d1 = <1,3>
d2 = <10,30>
d3 = <3,1>

  (d1,d2) 
  (d1,d3)

    compute the cosine scores

    what do the numbers tell you?

answers to the quiz

  (d1,d2) = 1
  (d1,d3) = 0.6

one of the two documents is a scaled version of the other

swapping the two dimensions results in a lower similarity

quiz

    what is the range of values that the cosine scores 

can take?

answer to the quiz

    mathematically, the cosine function has a  
range of [-1,1]
    however, when the two vectors are both in the 
first quadrant (since all word counts are non-
negative), the range is [0,1]
(since the values don   t have to be non-
negative)

    for id27s, the range is [-1,1]
