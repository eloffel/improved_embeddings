representing meaning

    capturing the meaning of linguistic utterances using formal 

notation

    goal
    linguistic meaning
       it is 8 pm   
    pragmatic meaning
       it is time to leave   
    semantic analysis: 
    assign each word a meaning
    combine the meanings of words into sentences
    x,y: buying(x) ^ buyer(speaker,x) ^ boughtitem(y,x) ^ book(y)
buying (buyer=speaker, boughtitem=book)

    i bought a book:

representing and understanding 

meaning

understanding meaning
if an agent hears a sentence and can act 
accordingly, the agent is said to understand it

   
    example
    understanding may involve id136
    and pragmatics
    so, understanding may involve a procedure

    maybe the book is wrapped in paper?

    leave the book on the table

    which book? which table?

properties

    can a statement be verified against a knowledge base (kb)
    example: does my cat martin have whiskers?

    verifiability

    unambiguousness
    give me the book
    which book?
    canonical form
    expressiveness

    can the formalism express temporal relations, beliefs,    ?
    is it domain-independent?
id136

   

representing meaning

    one traditional approach

    use logic representations, e.g., fol (first order 

logic)

    id136

    one can then use theorem proving (id136) to 
determine whether one statement entails another

syntax of id118

    the simplest type of logic
    the proposition symbols p1, p2,     are sentences

    if s is a sentence,   s is a sentence (negation)
    if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1    s2 is a sentence 
    if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1    s2 is a sentence 
    if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1    s2 is a sentence 
    if s1 and s2 are sentences, s1    s2 is a sentence 

(conjunction)
(disjunction)
(implication)
(biconditional)

translating propositions to english

    a = today is a holiday.
b = we are going to the park.
   
a     b 
   
if today is a holiday, we are going to the park.
a        b 
   
today is a holiday, and we are not going to the park.
       a        b
if today is not a holiday, then we are not going to the park.
       b        a
if we are not going to the park, then today is not a holiday.
b     a
   
if we are going to the park, then today is a holiday.

semantics of id118

  s

is true iff  s is false  
is true iff  s1 is true and s2 is true
is true iff  s1is true or
s2 is true
is true iff s1 is false or s2 is true
i.e.s1    s2 is false iff s1 is true and s2 is false

   
    s1    s2
    s1    s2
    s1    s2
   
    s1    s2
is true iff s1  s2 is true and s2  s1 is true
    recursively, one can compute the truth value of longer
