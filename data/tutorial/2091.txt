isa relation
   
    isa (martin,cat)

semantics of fol

    fol sentences can be assigned a value of trueor 

false.
isa(milo,cat) = true

    milo is younger than martin

<(ageof(milo),ageof(martin)) = true
=(ageof(milo),ageof(martin)) = false

examples with quantifiers

    all cats eat fish

"x:isa(x,cat)  eatfish(x)

representing events

    martin ate
    martin ate in the morning
    martin ate fish
    martin ate fish in the morning

one possible representation

    fol representations
    eating1(martin)
    eating2(martin,morning)
    eating3(martin,fish)
    eating4(martin,fish,morning)
    meaning postulates

    eating4(x,y,z) -> eating3(x,y)
    eating4(x,y,z) -> eating2(x,z)
    eating4(x,y,z) -> eating1(x)

example from jurafsky and martin

second possible representation

    eating4(x,y,z)
    problems

    with some arguments unspecified

    too many commitments
    hard to combine eating4(martin,fish,z) with 
eating4(martin,y,morning)

example from jurafsky and martin

third possible representation

    reification

        e: isa(e,eating)     eater(e,martin)     eaten(e,fish) 

example from jurafsky and martin

representing time

    example

   
    fluents

(e,yard)

    martin went from the kitchen to the yard
    isa(e,going) ^ goer(e,martin) ^ origin (e,kitchen) ^ target

    use of tenses

    we fly from san francisco to boston at 10.
    flight 1390 will be at the gate an hour now.
    flight 1902 arrived late.
    flight 1902 had arrived late.
    when mary   s flight departed, i ate lunch
    when mary   s flight departed, i had eaten lunch

       similar    tenses

    reference point

example from jurafsky and martin

aspect

    i know my departure gate
    john is flying

    stative
    activity
    accomplishment 
    achievement 
    figuring out statives:

(no particular end point)
    sally booked her flight

    she found her gate
    i am needing the cheapest fare.
    i am wanting to go today.
    need the cheapest fare!

(natural end point and result in a particular state)

example from jurafsky and martin

representing beliefs

    example
    milo believes that martin ate fish
    one possible representation

isa(b,believing)     believer(b,milo)     believed(b,e)

        e,b: isa(e,eating)     eater(e,martin)     eaten(e,fish)    
    however this implies (by dropping some of the 
terms) that    martin ate fish    (without the belief 
event)
    possibility, temporal logic, belief logic

    modal logic

representing beliefs

    want, believe, imagine, know - all introduce 
   
    reified example:

hypothetical worlds
i believe that mary ate british food.
        u,v: isa(u,believing)     isa(v,eating)     believer (u,speaker)    
believedprop(u,v)     eater(v,mary)     eaten(v,britishfood)
however this implies also:
        u,v: isa(v,eating)     eater(v,mary)     eaten(v,britishfood)
    believing(speaker,eating(mary,britishfood))    -not fopc!    
    believes(speaker,     v: isa(v,eating)     eater(v,mary)    

predicates in fopc hold between objects, not between relations.
eaten(v,britishfood))
