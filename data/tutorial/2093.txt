id29

id29

    converting natural language to a logical form
    example:

    e.g., executable code for a specific application

    airline reservations
    geographical query systems

stages of id29

input
    sentence

   
    syntactic analysis
    syntactic structure
    semantic analysis

    semantic representation

id152

    add semantic attachments to id18 rules
    id152

    parse the sentence syntactically
    associate some semantics to each word
    combine the semantics of words and non-terminals 
    until the root of the sentence

recursively

example

input
   
    javier likes pizza
    output

    like(javier, pizza)

example

s  -> np vp   {vp.sem(np.sem)}    t
vp -> v np    {v.sem(np.sem)}     <e,t>
np -> n       {n.sem}             e
v  -> likes 
n  -> javier  {javier}            e
n  -> pizza   {pizza}             e

{   x,y likes(x,y)   <e,<e,t>>

id29

    associate a semantic expression with each node

s: likes(javier, pizza)

n: javier

vp:   x likes(x,pizza)

javier

v:    x,y likes(x,y)

n: pizza

likes

pizza

grammar with semantic attachments

example from jurafsky and martin

using id35 (steedman 1996)

    id35 representations for semantics

    adj:   x.tall(x)
    (s\np)/adj :   f.  x.f(x)
    np: yaoming

yaoming

is                  tall
np       (s\np)/adj      adj

yaoming

  f.  x.f(x)       x.tall(x)
>

s\np
  x.tall(x)

<

s

tall (yaoming)

framenet

    events, relations, states, entities

    represents
    1,195 semantic frames
    example: absorb_heat

    an entity (generally food) is exposed to a heat_source whose 

temperature may also be specified. generally, the entity undergoes 
some sort of change as a result of this process.

    single structure that includes:

    predicate-argument structure
    id39
    coreference resolution
    wikification

status of amr

    amr currently lacks

    multilingual consideration
    quantifier scope
    co-references across sentences
    grammatical number, tense, aspect, quotation marks
    many noun-noun or noun-adjective relations
    many detailed frames, e.g. earthquake (with roles for 

magnitude, epicenter, casualties, etc)
