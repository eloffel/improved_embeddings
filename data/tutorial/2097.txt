    i have to study for the bar
    bring me a chocolate bar
    may i come in?
    let   s meet again in may

    task

id51
    given a word
    and its context
    determine which sense it is
    useful for machine translation
    e.g., translate    play    into spanish
    play the violin = tocar el viol  n
    play tennis = jugar al tenis
    document retrieval (jaguar)
    accent restoration (cote)
    text to speech generation (lead)
    id147 (aid/aide)
    capitalization restoration (turkey)

    other uses

dictionary method (lesk)

    match sentences to dictionary definitions
    examples of plant (m-w.com):

    examples of leaf

flowers, and needs sun and water to survive

    plant1 = a living thing that grows in the ground, usually has leaves or 
    plant2 = a building or factory where something is made
    leaf1 = a lateral outgrowth from a plant stem that is typically a 

flattened expanded variably shaped greenish organ, constitutes a 
unit of the foliage, and functions primarily in food manufacture by 
photosynthesis
    leaf2 = a part of a book or folded sheet containing a page on each 
side 
    find the pair of meanings that have the most overlapping 
definitions
       the leafis the food making factory of green plants.   

decision lists (yarowsky)

    method introduced by yarowsky (1994)
    two senses per word
    ordered rules: 

    collocation -> sense

    formula log	    (                    *|                                            2)
    (                    4|                                            2)

decision lists (yarowsky)

    fish within window -> bass1
    striped bass-> bass1
    guitarwithin window -> bass2
    bass player -> bass2
    play/v bass -> bass2

na  ve bayes

    e.g., work by bill gale

    correct sense = argmaxi p(sensei|context)
    p(context|sensei)    pj p(wordj|sensei)
    example: 
    bar-legalnear {lawyer, trial, judge, exam}
    bar-restaurantnear {drink, tab, beer}

classification features

    adjacent words (collocations)

    e.g., chocolate bar, bar exam, bar stool, bar fight, foreign aid, 

    e.g., plant pesticide vs. pesticide plant

presidential aide

    position
    adjacent parts of speech
    nearby words
    e.g., within 10 words
    syntactic information
    e.g., object of the verb    play   
    topic of the text

classification methods

    k-nearest neighbor (memory-based)
    using euclidean distance
    find the k most similar examples and return the 
majority class for them
    see lecture on classification

id64

    start with two senses and seeds for each sense 
    use these seeds to label the data using a 
    add some of the newly labeled examples to the 
    repeat until no more examples can be labeled

    e.g., plant1:leaf, plant2:factory
supervised classifier (decision list)
training data

id64

    two principles:

    one sense per collocation
    one sense per discourse (e.g., document)

training data for wsd

    senseval/semcor

    234,000 words tagged with id138 senses
    http://www.senseval.org/senseval3
    two tasks: lexical sample and all words
    available for many languages

    pseudo-words
    multilingual corpora

    e.g., banana/door

    aligned at the sentence level
    use the translations as an indication of sense

wsd evaluation

    extrinsic (task-based)

    e.g., using machine translation or information retrieval
intrinsic
   
    sense accuracy
    baseline

    most frequent sense

senseval-1 evaluation

    metric

    results

    a = number of assigned senses
    c = number of words assigned correct senses
    t = total number of test words
    precision = c/a; recall = c/t

    best recall around 77p/77r
    human lexicographer 97p/96r (for binary classification)
    most common sense 57p/50r (decent but depends on 

    but only 75% for humans on id138 senses
domain)

notes

    there hasn   t been enough evidence that wsd 
    id165s (e.g.,    bar exam   ) are enough.

helps downstream applications such as mt.
