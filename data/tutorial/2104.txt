mani/bloedorn (1997, 1999) 

       graph-based method for 
identifying similarities and 
differences between 
documents
events
relations (edges)
       same, adjacent, alpha 
(id138, netowl), coref

       single event or sequence of 
       content entities (nodes) and 
       relation types

       spreading activation

mr. kenny is the person that invented the anesthetic machine which uses micro-computers to 
control the rate at which an anesthetic is pumped into the blood. such machines are nothing 
new. but his device uses two micro-computers to achieve much closer monitoring of the pump 
feeding the anesthetic into the patient.  

barzilay and m. elhadad (1997) 

       id138-based
       three types of relations:
       extra-strong (repetitions)
       strong (id138 relations)
       medium-strong (link between synsets is longer 
than one + some additional constraints)

barzilay and m. elhadad (1997) 

       scoring chains:

       length
       homogeneity index:   

= 1     (# distinct words in chain, divided by length)   
score = length * homogeneity   
score > average + 2 * st.dev.
