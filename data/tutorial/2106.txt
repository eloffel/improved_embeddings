summarization evaluation 

evaluation criteria 

       appropriate length
       fidelity
       salience
       grammaticality
       non-redundancy
       referential well-formedness
       structure and coherence

ideal evaluation 

c = compression ratio = 

 information content 
|s| 
|d| 
i (s)

r = retention ratio = 

r>c 

types of evaluation methods 

       extrinsic techniques (task-based)

       can you make the same decision using the 
summary as with the full text, but in less time

       intrinsic techniques

       comparing summaries against gold standards

       characteristics

       variants

examples

       based on papineni et al.   s id7 (used for machine translation)
       r stands for recall
       correlated with manual evaluations when averaged over many 
       very convenient for prototyping
       id8-n is a measure of id165 overlap between a summary 
       id8-l uses longest common subsequence instead of n-

and a set of reference summaries
gram overlap
       disadvantage

       it can be easily gamed

subsumption and equivalence 

       subsumption: if the information content of 
sentence a (denoted as i(a)) is contained within 
sentence b, then a becomes informationally 
redundant and the content of b is said to 
subsume that of a:   

 i(a)     i(b)

       equivalence: if i(a)     i(b)     i(b)     i(a)

subsumption 

(1) john doe was found guilty of the murder.
(2) the court found john doe guilty of the murder 
of jane doe last august and sentenced him to 
life.
