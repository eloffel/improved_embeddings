   good    compared to what?
    ok, but

    idea #1: a human translation. 
    good translations can be very dissimilar
    we   d need to find hidden features (e.g. alignments)

    idea #2: other top ntranslations (the    n-

best list   ). 
    better in practice, but

    many entries in n-best list are the same apart from hidden 

links

    compare with a id168 l

    0/1: wrong or right; equal to reference or not
    task-specific metrics (word error rate, id7,    )
