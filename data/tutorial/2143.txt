fqa as a classification task

    a predefined set of answers, say 10 answers
    given a question, pick the best one out of 10.

qanta assignment

    get id33 of the question
    build id56 over dependency tree
    train this id56 over training 
    use this id56 as a feature 
    train a id28 classifier over the 

data
extractor
features from the id56 as our 
predictor

dependency-tree

id56s

    unlike constituent parses, words reside at nodes 
    need to combine word vector of node with 

other than leaves
   hidden    vectors of children
