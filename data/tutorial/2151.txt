glove-python

   [88]circle ci

   a toy python implementation of [89]glove.

   glove produces dense vector embeddings of words, where words that occur
   together are close in the resulting vector space.

   while this produces embeddings which are similar to [90]id97 (which
   has a great python implementation in [91]gensim), the method is
   different: glove produces embeddings by factorizing the logarithm of
   the corpus word co-occurrence matrix.

   the code uses asynchronous stochastic id119, and is
   implemented in cython. most likely, it contains a tremendous amount of
   bugs.

installation

   install from pypi using pip: pip install glove_python.

   note for osx users: due to its use of openmp, glove-python does not
   compile under clang. to install it, you will need a reasonably recent
   version of gcc (from homebrew for instance). this should be picked up
   by setup.py; if it is not, please open an issue.

   building with the default python distribution included in osx is also
   not supported; please try the version from homebrew or anaconda.

usage

   producing the embeddings is a two-step process: creating a
   co-occurrence matrix from the corpus, and then using it to produce the
   embeddings. the corpus class helps in constructing a corpus from an
   interable of tokens; the glove class trains the embeddings (with a
   sklearn-esque api).

   there is also support for rudimentary pagragraph vectors. a paragraph
   vector (in this case) is an embedding of a paragraph (a multi-word
   piece of text) in the word vector space in such a way that the
   paragraph representation is close to the words it contains, adjusted
   for the frequency of words in the corpus (in a manner similar to tf-idf
   weighting). these can be obtained after having trained id27s
   by calling the transform_paragraph method on the trained model.

examples

   example.py has some example code for running simple training scripts:
   ipython -i -- examples/example.py -c my_corpus.txt -t 10 should process
   your corpus, run 10 training epochs of glove, and drop you into an
   ipython shell where glove.most_similar('physics') should produce a list
   of similar words.

   if you want to process a wikipedia corpus, you can pass file from
   [92]here into the example.py script using the -w flag. running make
   all-wiki should download a small wikipedia dump file, process it, and
   train the embeddings. building the cooccurrence matrix will take some
   time; training the vectors can be speeded up by increasing the training
   parallelism to match the number of physical cpu cores available.

   running this on my machine yields roughly the following results:

development

   pull requests are welcome.

   when making changes to the .pyx extension files, you'll need to run
   python setup.py cythonize in order to produce the extension .c and .cpp
   files before running pip install -e ..
