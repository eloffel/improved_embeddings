the semantic vectors package

   [59]semanticvectors creates semantic [60]wordspace models from free
   natural language text. such models are designed to represent words and
   documents in terms of underlying concepts. they can be used for many
   semantic (concept-aware) matching tasks such as automatic thesaurus
   generation, id99, and concept matching. these are
   described more thoroughly in the [61]usecases page. if you have a
   question about how to use the package or whether a new use-case can be
   supported, please look through these wiki pages and archives of the
   [62]user group.

getting started

   see [63]gettingstarted and the [64]maven semanticvectors artifact. more
   installation help can be found in the [65]installationinstructions.

   java api documentation is at
   [66]http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/semanticvectors/se
   manticvectors/blob/gh-pages/apidocs/index.html.

   there are a range of [67]searchoptions, and help on using
   [68]semanticvectors for [69]documentsearch. some proposed research and
   development suggestions are on the [70]ideas page.

   ##algorithms and techniques the models are created by applying concept
   mapping algorithms to term-document matrices created using apache
   lucene. the concept mapping algorithms supported by the package include
   random projection, latent semantic analysis (lsa) and reflective random
   indexing.

   random projection is the most scalable technique in practice, because
   it does not rely on the use of computationally intensive matrix
   decomposition algorithms. the application of random projection for
   natural language processing (nlp) is descended from pentti kanerva's
   work on sparse distributed memory, which in semantic analysis and text
   mining, this method has also been called random indexing. singular
   value decomposition is also popular because it is better known, and has
   in some cases given better results on smaller datasets.

   links to more [71]relatedresearch and lots of other topics can be found
   in the wiki pages.

contributors and projects

   the package was created as part of a project by the university of
   pittsburgh office of technology management, and has been developed and
   maintained by contributors from the university of texas, queensland
   university of technology, the austrian research institute for
   artificial intelligence, google inc., and other institutions and
   individuals. contributions are welcome (and reasonably frequent).

   there are many ways to get involved, as an end user and a contributor.

   issues and bugs. issues and bugs can be posted using the issues tab
   above.

   user group. more general questions and discussions may be posted at the
   group webpage, [72]http://groups.google.com/group/semanticvectors.

   developer contributions. for development, see [73]howtocontribute. for
   suggestions on what to contribute, you could start with the [74]ideas
   page.

   gui. there is a gui (graphic user interface) for semantic vectors, made
   by michael ruepp, available at
   [75]https://bitbucket.org/mruepp/semantic-analysis/overview. (thanks a
   lot, michael!)

   projects using semantic vectors. there is an old list of
   [76]projectsusingsemanticvectors. please visit this page and leave
   comments if you know of any.
