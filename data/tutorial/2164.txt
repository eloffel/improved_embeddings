                            eigenword resource page

   an eigenword is an real-valued vector "embedding" associated with a
   word that captures its meaning in the sense that distributionally
   similar words have similar eigenwords. this page contains links to
   several sets of eigenwords they are computed as the singular vectors of
   the matrix of co-occurrence of words and their contexts, and used in a
   variety of [1]spectral nlp methods and applications. see our [2]naacl
   tutorial on id106

eigenword collections

     * [3]eigenwords for many languages and code for computing them

   note that the "words" include punctuation, and so will confuse some
   software.

   coming soon: [4]eigencontexts

software for plotting eigenwords

     * matlab/octave plotting code
          + [5]plot_eigenwords.m which calls [6]pick_words_csv.py and
            [7]read_word_name.m
     * r/python plotting code
          + [8]plot_eigenwords.r which calls [9]pick_words.py
