beginners guide to id96 in python

   [98]shivam bansal, august 24, 2016

introduction

   analytics industry is all about obtaining the    information    from the
   data. with the growing amount of data in recent years, that too mostly
   unstructured, it   s difficult to obtain the relevant and desired
   information. but, technology has developed some powerful methods which
   can be used to mine through the data and fetch the information that we
   are looking for.

   one such technique in the field of id111 is topic modelling. as
   the name suggests, it is a process to automatically identify topics
   present in a text object and to derive hidden patterns exhibited by a
   text corpus. thus, assisting better decision making.

   topic modelling is different from rule-based id111 approaches
   that use id157 or dictionary based keyword searching
   techniques. it is an unsupervised approach used for finding and
   observing the bunch of words (called    topics   ) in large clusters of
   texts.

   topics can be defined as    a repeating pattern of co-occurring terms in
   a corpus   . a good topic model should result in        health   ,    doctor   ,
      patient   ,    hospital    for a topic     healthcare, and    farm   ,    crops   ,
      wheat    for a topic        farming   .

   topic models are very useful for the purpose for document id91,
   organizing large blocks of textual data, information retrieval from
   unstructured text and feature selection. for example     new york times
   are using topic models to boost their user     article recommendation
   engines. various professionals are using topic models for recruitment
   industries where they aim to extract latent features of job
   descriptions and map them to right candidates. they are being used to
   organize large datasets of emails, customer reviews, and user social
   media profiles.

   so, if you aren   t sure about the complete process of id96,
   this guide would introduce you to various concepts followed by its
   implementation in python.

id44 for id96

   there are many approaches for obtaining topics from a text such as    
   term frequency and inverse document frequency. nonnegative matrix
   factorization techniques. id44 is the most
   popular id96 technique and in this article, we will discuss
   the same.

   lda assumes documents are produced from a mixture of topics. those
   topics then generate words based on their id203 distribution.
   given a dataset of documents, lda backtracks and tries to figure out
   what topics would create those documents in the first place.

   lda is a id105 technique. in vector space, any corpus
   (collection of documents) can be represented as a document-term matrix.
   the following matrix shows a corpus of n documents d1, d2, d3     dn and
   vocabulary size of m words w1,w2 .. wn. the value of i,j cell gives the
   frequency count of word wj in document di.

   [100]modeling2

   lda converts this document-term matrix into two lower dimensional
   matrices     m1 and m2.
   m1 is a document-topics matrix and m2 is a topic     terms matrix with
   dimensions (n,  k) and (k, m) respectively, where n is the number of
   documents, k is the number of topics and m is the vocabulary size.

   [101]modeling3

   [102]modeling4

   notice that these two matrices already provides topic word and document
   topic distributions, however, these distribution needs to be improved,
   which is the main aim of lda. lda makes use of sampling techniques in
   order to improve these matrices.

   it iterates through each word    w    for each document    d    and tries to
   adjust the current topic     word assignment with a new assignment. a new
   topic    k    is assigned to word    w    with a id203 p which is a
   product of two probabilities p1 and p2.

   for every topic, two probabilities p1 and p2 are calculated. p1    
   p(topic t / document d) = the proportion of words in document d that
   are currently assigned to topic t. p2     p(word w / topic t) = the
   proportion of assignments to topic t over all documents that come from
   this word w.

   the current topic     word assignment is updated with a new topic with
   the id203, product of p1 and p2 . in this step, the model assumes
   that all the existing word     topic assignments except the current word
   are correct. this is essentially the id203 that topic t generated
   word w, so it makes sense to adjust the current word   s topic with new
   id203.

   after a number of iterations, a steady state is achieved where the
   document topic and topic term distributions are fairly good. this is
   the convergence point of lda.


parameters of lda

   alpha and beta hyperparameters     alpha represents document-topic
   density and beta represents topic-word density. higher the value of
   alpha, documents are composed of more topics and lower the value of
   alpha, documents contain fewer topics. on the other hand, higher the
   beta, topics are composed of a large number of words in the corpus, and
   with the lower value of beta, they are composed of few words.

   number of topics     number of topics to be extracted from the corpus.
   researchers have developed approaches to obtain an optimal number of
   topics by using kullback leibler divergence score. i will not discuss
   this in detail, as it is too mathematical. for understanding, one can
   refer to this^[1] original paper on the use of kl divergence.

   number of topic terms     number of terms composed in a single topic. it
   is generally decided according to the requirement. if the problem
   statement talks about extracting themes or concepts, it is recommended
   to choose a higher number, if problem statement talks about extracting
   features or terms, a low number is recommended.

   number of iterations / passes     maximum number of iterations allowed to
   lda algorithm for convergence.

running in python

preparing documents

   here are the sample documents combining together to form a corpus.

   doc1 = "sugar is bad to consume. my sister likes to have sugar, but not
   my father."
   doc2 = "my father spends a lot of time driving my sister around to
   dance practice."
   doc3 = "doctors suggest that driving may cause increased stress and
   blood pressure."
   doc4 = "sometimes i feel pressure to perform well at school, but my
   father never seems to drive my sister to do better."
   doc5 = "health experts say that sugar is not good for your lifestyle."

   # compile documents
   doc_complete = [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4, doc5]


cleaning and preprocessing

   cleaning is an important step before any id111 task, in this
   step, we will remove the punctuations, stopwords and normalize the
   corpus.

   ```
   from nltk.corpus import stopwords
   from nltk.stem.id138 import id138lemmatizer
   import string
   stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))
   exclude = set(string.punctuation)
   lemma = id138lemmatizer()
   def clean(doc):
       stop_free = " ".join([i for i in doc.lower().split() if i not in
   stop])
       punc_free = ''.join(ch for ch in stop_free if ch not in exclude)
       normalized = " ".join(lemma.lemmatize(word) for word in
   punc_free.split())
       return normalized

   doc_clean = [clean(doc).split() for doc in doc_complete]
   ```


preparing document-term matrix

   all the text documents combined is known as the corpus. to run any
   mathematical model on text corpus, it is a good practice to convert it
   into a matrix representation. lda model looks for repeating term
   patterns in the entire dt matrix. python provides many great libraries
   for id111 practices,    gensim    is one such clean and beautiful
   library to handle text data. it is scalable, robust and efficient.
   following code shows how to convert a corpus into a document-term
   matrix.

   ```
   # importing gensim
   import gensim
   from gensim import corpora
   # creating the term dictionary of our courpus, where every unique term
   is assigned an index. dictionary = corpora.dictionary(doc_clean)
   # converting list of documents (corpus) into document term matrix using
   dictionary prepared above.
   doc_term_matrix = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in doc_clean]
   ```


running lda model

   next step is to create an object for lda model and train it on
   document-term matrix. the training also requires few parameters as
   input which are explained in the above section. the gensim module
   allows both lda model estimation from a training corpus and id136
   of topic distribution on new, unseen documents.

   ```
   # creating the object for lda model using gensim library
   lda = gensim.models.ldamodel.ldamodel
   # running and trainign lda model on the document term matrix.
   ldamodel = lda(doc_term_matrix, num_topics=3,  word = dictionary,
   passes=50)

   ```


results


   ```
   print(ldamodel.print_topics(num_topics=3, num_words=3))
   ['0.168*health + 0.083*sugar + 0.072*bad,
   '0.061*consume + 0.050*drive + 0.050*sister,
   '0.049*pressur + 0.049*father + 0.049*sister]
   ```

   each line is a topic with individual topic terms and weights. topic1
   can be termed as bad health, and topic3 can be termed as family.

tips to improve results of id96

   the results of topic models are completely dependent on the features
   (terms) present in the corpus. the corpus is represented as document
   term matrix, which in general is very sparse in nature. reducing the
   dimensionality of the matrix can improve the results of topic
   modelling. based on my practical experience, there are few approaches
   which do the trick.

   1. frequency filter     arrange every term according to its frequency.
   terms with higher frequencies are more likely to appear in the results
   as compared ones with low frequency. the low frequency terms are
   essentially weak features of the corpus, hence it is a good practice to
   get rid of all those weak features. an exploratory analysis of terms
   and their frequency can help to decide what frequency value should be
   considered as the threshold.

   [104]modeling5

   2. part of speech tag filter     pos tag filter is more about the context
   of the features than frequencies of features. topic modelling tries to
   map out the recurring patterns of terms into topics. however, every
   term might not be equally important contextually. for example, pos tag
   in contain terms such as        within   ,    upon   ,    except   .    cd    contains    
      one   ,   two   ,    hundred    etc.    md    contains    may   ,    must    etc. these
   terms are the supporting words of a language and can be removed by
   studying their post tags.
   [105]modeling6
   3. batch wise lda    in order to retrieve most important topic terms, a
   corpus can be divided into batches of fixed sizes. running lda multiple
   times on these batches will provide different results, however, the
   best topic terms will be the intersection of all batches.

   note: we also have a [106]video based course on nlp, covering topic
   modelling and its implementation in python.

topic modelling for feature selection

   sometimes lda can also be used as feature selection technique. take an
   example of text classification problem where the training data contain
   category wise documents. if lda is running on sets of category wise
   documents. followed by removing common topic terms across the results
   of different categories will give the best features for a category.


endnotes

   with this, we come to this end of tutorial on id96. i hope

       nice tutorial. but i think it will be more helpful if you explained
       what the code is doing specifically. especially the following
       sections:
           preparing document term matrix
           running lda model

       hi,
       thanks for this wonderful post. i just wish to know how to print
       the two matrices m1 and m2 mentioned in this post. i wanted to
       analyse the id203 values. could you please let me know how to
       do that in python for the code you have mentioned in the post.
       any help in this regard is highly appreciated.

       very nice and intuitive description!! i   ve been looking for
       something like this for lda for a long time.
       i   m curious how sparsity is enforced during the sampling if that
       makes sense. not sure if i   m asking the right question, have to do
       more reading on the subject.
       anyway, thanks a lot for the writeup and code

       hi shivam,
       i ran the code that you have published in this article but the
       results i get is different from yours.
       this is a sample output i received:
       [(0,    0.076*   sugar    + 0.075*   say    + 0.075*   lifestyle      ), (1,
          0.076*   father    + 0.076*   sister    + 0.076*   sugar      ), (2,
          0.079*   driving    + 0.045*   stress    + 0.045*   blood      )]
       infact i get different result at each run. we kindly request you to
       explain why this happens.

            there are some random effects when we use lda. if you run
            several the code provided by shivam you could   nt have the same
            result each time.
            if you want the same result each time you should include a cod
            like thate : randome-state=1998 (no matter for the number)

       very nice article!! describing the whole process step by step.
       though, i am bit confused about the    frequency filter    for document
       term corpus. it says to ignore low frequency terms. doesn   t we use
       tfidfvectorizor() for giving more weigh to uncommon terms , correct

       can you suggest a hassle free method to install gensim. ?when i
       installed via pip, it tried upgrading scipy (0.18.1 to 0.19.1 ) and
       created lot of problems. i had to uninstall scipy and re install
       again.
