attention-based summarization

   tensorflow implementation of [79]a neural attention model for
   abstractive summarization. the original code of author can be found
   [80]here.

   [81]model_demo

prerequisites

     * python 2.7 or python 3.3+
     * [82]tensorflow
     * [83]gensim

usage

   to train a model with duc2013 dataset:
$ python main.py --dataset duc2013

   to test an existing model:
$ python main.py --dataset duc2014 --forward_only true

   (this is still in progress and currently have no access to
   summarization dataset)
