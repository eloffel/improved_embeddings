                            [8]introducing keras 1.0

   mon 11 april 2016


    by [9]francois chollet

   in [10]news.

   keras was initially released a year ago, late march 2015. it has made
   tremendous progress since, both on the development front, and as a
   community.

   but continuous improvement isn't enough. a year of developing keras,
   using keras, and getting feedback from thousands of users has taught us
   a lot. to the point that we are now able to redesign it better than we
   could have the first time around.

   and so today we are releasing keras 1.0. it isn't a patch on top of the
   previous version, it is actually a re-writing of keras nearly from
   scratch. it maintains backwards compatibility while introducing a
   series of major features, made possible by a better design under the
   hood.

   simplicity and accessibility have always been the targets guiding the
   keras development efforts. the purpose of keras is to make deep
   learning accessible to as many people as possible, by providing a set
   of "lego blocks" for building deep learning models in a fast and simple
   way. keras 1.0 pushes even further in that same direction.

   the most significant feature introduced today is the functional api, a
   new way to define your keras models. get started with the functional
   api with [11]this short guide. if you are new to keras, first read the
   [12]"30 seconds to keras" introduction, then read [13]this overview of
   the sequential model.

new features

     * the functional api: a simpler and more powerful way to define
       complex deep learning models.
     * better performance. compilation times are lower. all id56s now come
       in 2 different implementations to choose from, allowing you to get
       maximum performance across widely different tasks and setups. and
       theano id56s can now be unrolled, yielding up to a 25% speed-up.
     * modular metrics. you can know monitor arbitrary lists of metrics on
       arbitrary endpoints of your keras models.
     * an even better user experience. the code has been rewritten from
       scratch with the end user in mind at all stages. a great library ux
       has two components: simple, intuitive apis (the kind that are easy
       to memorize), and the ability to return sensible, easy to grok
       error messages whenever faced with a user error.
     * improved lambda layers.

   ...and much more.

installation

   you can install the new version from pypi:
pip install keras --upgrade

   or from the master branch on github:
git clone https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git
cd keras
python setup.py install

porting custom keras layers

   because the keras internals have changed, custom keras layers will not
   work with the new version. however you can port them to the new version
   in just a minute. simply follow the instructions in [14]this guide.
