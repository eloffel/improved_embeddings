   a small collection of introductory scikit-learn and python stack
   tutorials for those with an existing understanding of machine learning
   looking to jump right into using a new set of tools.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [37]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.
   are you a newcomer to machine learning or to [38]scikit-learn, the de
   facto official general purpose machine learning library in use in the
   python ecosystem? while the following tutorials will not be of much use
   to seasoned machine learning practitioners experienced in scikit-learn,
   they will undoubtedly by a solid introduction to individuals with an
   understanding of machine learning, either theory or practice in a
   different environment, looking for a quick overview of the basics in
   scikit-learn and the python ecosystem.
   these tutorials cover only some of the basics of scikit-learn, but they
   do get to fitting models in a no-nonsense straight-away manner. there
   are also (obviously) numerous other tutorials on the subject, including
   many others that have been highlighted on kdnuggets, but different
   perspectives are never a bad thing.
   the material is contained in ipython notebooks and shared via github.

   1. [39]abridged scikit-learn official beginner tutorials
   this is an abridged, to-the-point, implementation of the official
   [40]scikit-learn tutorials. if you are familiar with both python and
   machine learning, this may be a quicker way to get through the
   material, as it lacks the verbose explanations quite often pertaining
   to introductory machine learning concepts. there are a few minor
   changes to the original material (i believe), but it follows the
   original quite faithfully.
   as such, all credit goes to the creator(s) of the original material. i
   make no claim of ownership or innovation; my role was simply peeling
   away what i felt to be unnecessary information for those beginners to
   scikit-learn who are not, otherwise, beginners to machine learning.
   classifiers
   2. [41]introduction to implementing scikit-learn classifiers
   this tutorial is meant to serve as a demonstration of implementing
   several machine learning classifiers. it draws inspiration from other
   excellent related works, such as [42]randal olson's an example machine
   learning notebook and this [43]common machine learning algorithms cheat
   sheet. it also draws from [44]the official scikit-learn documentation
   and some of the various referenced tutorials included in [45]this
   kdnuggets python machine learning guide.
   using example datasets, models are built using a number of machine
   learning classification algorithms, including id28,
   id90, and id166s (among others). separate testing and training
   datasets and k-fold cross-validation are both used as model evaluation
   methods. some simple data investigation methods are used as well.
