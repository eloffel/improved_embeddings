introduction to implementing scikit-learn classifiers

   [64]scikit-learn

   this tutorial is meant to serve as a demonstration of several machine
   learning classifiers, and { is inspired by | references | incoporates
   techniques from } the following excellent works:
     * randal olson's [65]an example machine learning notebook
     * analytics vidhya's [66]common machine learning algorithms cheat
       sheet
     * scikit-learn's official [67]cross-validation documentation
     * scikit-learn's official [68]iris dataset documentation
     * likely includes influence of the various referenced tutorials
       included in this [69]kdnuggets python machine learning article i
       recently wrote

   we will use the well-known [70]iris and [71]digits datasets to build
   models with the following machine learning [72]classification
   algorithms:
     * [73]id28
     * [74]decision tree
     * [75]support vector machine
     * [76]naive bayes
     * [77]k-nearest neighbors
     * [78]id79s

   we also use different strategies for evaluating models:
     * [79]separate testing and training datasets
     * [80]k-fold cross-validation

   some simple data investigation methods and tools will be undertaken as
   well, including:
     * plotting data with [81]matplotlib
     * building and data via [82]pandas dataframes
     * constructing and operating on multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
       with [83]numpy

   this tutorial is brief, non-verbose, and to the point. please [84]alert
   me if you find inaccuracies. also, if you find it at all useful, and
   believe it to be worth doing so, please feel free to share it far and
   wide.
