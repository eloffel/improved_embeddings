   here we discuss about the visual id53 problem, and i   ll
   also present neural network based approaches for same.

   by [35]avi singh, iit.

   an year or so ago, a chatbot named [36]eugene goostman made it to the
   mainstream [37]news, after having been reported as the first computer
   program to have passed the famed [38]turing test in an event organized
   at the university of reading. while the organizers hailed it as a
   historical achievement, most of the scientific community wasn   t
   impressed. this leads us to the question: is the turing test, in its
   original form, a suitable test for ai in the modern day?

   in the last couple of years, a number of papers (like [39]this paper
   from jhu/brown, and [40]this one from mpi) have suggested that the task
   of visual id53 (vqa, for short) can be used as an
   alternative turing test. the task involves answering an open-ended
   question (or a series of questions) about an image. an example is shown
   below:

image from visualqa.org

   visual qa

   the ai system needs to solve a number of sub-problems in natural
   language processing and id161, in addition to being able to
   perform some kind of    common-sense    reasoning. it needs to localize the
   subject being referenced (the woman   s face, and more specifically the
   region around her lips), needs to detect objects (the banana), and
   should also have some common-sense knowledge that the word mustache is
   often used to refer to markings or objects on the face that are not
   actually mustaches (like milk mustaches). since the problem cuts
   through two two very different modalities (vision and text), and
   requires high-level understanding of the scene, it appears to be an
   ideal candidate for a true turing test. the problem also has real world
   applications, like helping the [41]visually impaired.

   a few days ago, the [42]visual qa challenge was launched, and along
   with it came a large dataset (~750k questions on ~250k images). after
   the [43]ms coco image captioning challenge sparked a lot of interest in
   problem of [44]image captioning (or was it the interest that led to the
   challenge?), the time seems ripe to move onto a much harder problem at
   the intersection of nlp and vision.

   this post will present ways to model this problem using neural
   networks, exploring both feedforward neural networks, and the much more
   exciting recurrent neural networks (lstms, to be specific). if you do
   not know much about neural networks, then i encourage you to check
   these two awesome blogs: [45]colah   s blog and [46]karpathy   s blog.
   specifically, check out the posts on recurrent neural nets,
   convolutional neural nets and lstm nets. the models in this post take
   inspiration from [47]this iccv 2015 paper, [48]this iccv 2015 paper,
   and [49]this nips 2015 paper.

generating answers

   an important aspect of solving this problem is to have a system that
   can generate new answers. while most of the answers in the vqa dataset
   are short (1-3 words), we would still like to a have a system that can
   generate arbitrarily long answers, keeping up with our spirit of the
   turing test. we can perhaps take inspiration from papers on
   [50]sequence to sequence learning using id56s, that solve a similar
   problem when generating translations of arbitrary length.
   [51]multi-word methods have been presented for vqa too. however, for
   the purpose of this blog post, we will ignore this aspect of the
   problem. we will select the 1000 most frequent answers in the vqa
   training dataset, and solve the problem in a multi-class classification
   setting. these top 1000 answers cover over 80% of the answers in the
   vqa training set, so we can still expect to get reasonable results.

the feedforward neural model

   [52]the mlp model

   to get started, let   s first try to model the problem using a
   [53]multilayer id88. an mlp is a simple feedforward neural net
   that maps a feature vector (of fixed length) to an appropriate output.
   in our problem, this output will be a id203 distribution over the
   set of possible answers. we will be using [54]keras, an awesome deep
   learning library based on [55]theano, and written in python. setting up
   keras is fairly easy, just have a look at their [56]readme to get
   started.

   in order to use the mlp model, we need to map all our input questions
   and images to a feature vector of fixed length. we perform the
   following operations to achieve this:
    1. for the question, we transform each word to its [57]word vector,
       and sum up all the vectors. the length of this feature vector will
       be same as the length of a single word vector, and the word vectors
       (also called embeddings) that we use have a length of 300.
    2. for the image, we pass it through a deep convolutional neural
       network (the well-known [58]vgg architecture), and extract the
       activation from the second last layer (before the softmax layer,
       that is). size of this feature vector is 4096.
