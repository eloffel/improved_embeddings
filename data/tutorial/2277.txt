defgen

   train a reverse dictionary and/or general knowledge crossword question
   answerer.

   example usage:

   to train a model:

   clone the repo, generate your training data and use a command like the
   following -

   theano_flags='floatx=float32, device=gpu' python train_model.py -m
   your_name_for_the_trained_model.npz -da your_data_files.pkl -di
   your_dictionary_file.pkl -edim 500
    1. if you don't have a gpu, remove "device=gpu"
    2. -m: the model will be saved as a .npz file with the name in the -m
       argument
    3. -da: the data that the model learns from. this must be saved in a
       pickle (.pkl) file, to which two objects are dumped (in order). the
       first object is a (python) list of (numpy) arrays, which contain
       the target (e.g. id97) id27s. the second object is a
       (python) list of (python) lists, representing the definitions. each
       of these lists should contain integers, which are indices from the
       total training vocabulary, and encode a particular definition. both
       objects should have the same length and be aligned (so that the
       n-th embedding corresponds to the n-th definition).
    4. -di: this should point to another pickle file to which a python
       dictionary is dumped. the dictionary should map word types (as
       keys) from the total set of training definitions, to unique
       integers (as values). this should correspond to the encoding used
       in the second file dumped into the data file -da.
    5. -edim: this should be an integer stating the length of the target
       (e.g. id97) embeddings used in the model. it should be equal to
       the length of the numpy arrays in the first object dumped to -da.

   some scripts that may be useful for pre-processing the data into this
   format can be found in the subdirectory useful scripts

   to query a model:

   ensure that an options file (your_model.npz.pkl) is saved in the same
   directory as your_model.npz - this should happen automatically when
   training as above.

   python generate_embs.py -m your_model.npz -e your_embeddings.pkl -dic
   your_dictionary.pkl -sl optional_shortlist.txt

   optional_shortlist.txt is a text file containing a list of words (each
   on a new line). these should be a subset of the keys of embeddings.pkl,
   and will restrict the possible answers returned by the model.
