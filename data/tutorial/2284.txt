   a2a'd ...

   i'm going to try to use simple language ... basically i'm just going to
   try to summarize these two papers:

   [14]http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinto...
   [15]http://machinelearning.wustl.edu...

   first, why is deep learning different from the other methods you
   mentioned?

   "normal" neural networks usually have one to two hidden layers and are
   used for supervised prediction or classification.

   id166s are typically used for binary classification, but occasionally for
   other supervised learning tasks.

   deep learning neural network architectures differ from "normal" neural
   networks because they have more hidden layers. deep learning networks
   differ from "normal" neural networks and id166s because they can be
   trained in an unsupervised or supervised manner for both unsupervised
   and supervised learning tasks.

   moreover, people often talk about training a deep network in an
   unsupervised manner, before training the network in a supervised
   manner.

   ---

   how do you train an unsupervised neural network?

   usually, with a supervised neural network you try to predict a target
   vector y, from a matrix of inputs, x. but when you train an
   unsupervised neural network, you try to predict the matrix x using the
   very same matrix x as the inputs. in doing this, the network can learn
   something intrinsic about the data without the help of a target or
   label vector that is often created by humans. the learned information
   is stored as the weights of the network.

   another consequence of unsupervised training is that the network will
   have the same number of input units as target units, because there are
   the same number of columns in the input x matrix as in the target x
   matrix. this leads to the hourglass shape that is common when training
   unsupervised, deep neural networks.

   in the diagram below, there are the same number of input units as
   target units, and each of these units represents a pixel in a small
   picture of a digit.
   [main-qimg-37dadcc45bf5929aa98265406cdf3ebe]

   you might think it sounds easy to predict x from x. sometimes it is too
   easy, and the network becomes over trained on the x matrix, so people
   typically add some noise, or random numbers, into x to prevent over
   training.

   one of the fancy names for this kind of architecture is: "stacked
   denoising autoencoder". you might also hear "restricted boltzmann
   machine".

   ---

   why so many layers?

   deep learning works because of the architecture of the network and the
   optimization routine applied to that architecture.

   the network is a directed graph, meaning that each hidden unit is
   connected to many other hidden units below it. so each hidden layer
   going further into the network is a non-linear combination of the
   layers below it, because of all the combining and recombining of the
   outputs from all the previous units in combination with their
   id180.

   when the optimization routine is applied to the network, each hidden
   layer then becomes an optimally weighted, non-linear combination of the
   layer below it.

   when each sequential hidden layer has less units than the one below it,
   each hidden layer becomes a lower dimensional projection of the layer
   below it as well. so the information from the layer below is nicely
   summarized by a non-linear, optimally weighted, lower dimensional
   projection in each subsequent layer of the deep network.

   in the picture above, the outputs from the small middle hidden layer
   are a two dimensional, optimal, non-linear projection of the input
   columns (i.e .pixels) in the input matrix (i.e. set of pictures). figs.
   3a and 3b in the hinton paper above actually plot similar outputs.
   notice that the network has basically clustered the digits 0 through 9
   without a label vector. so, the unsupervised training process has
   resulted in unsupervised learning.

   ---

   how do you make predictions?

   that's the easy part. one approach is to break the hourglass network in
   half, and swap x as the target matrix with y, where y is some more
   typical target vector or label vector.

   in the picture above, you could throw away all the layers above the
   middle layer, and put a single target unit for y right above the middle
   hidden layer.

   what you are really using from the bottom half of the hourglass network
   is the weights from the unsupervised training phase. remember, the
   weights represent what was learned during unsupervised training. they
   will now become the initial starting points for the supervised training
   optimization routine using the target vector y. (in the case of the
   digit pictures, y contains the label 0-9 of the digit.) so, the
   supervised training phase basically just refines the weights from the
   unsupervised training phase to best predict y. since we have changed
   the architecture of the network to a more "normal" supervised network,
   the actual mechanism of prediction is similar to a "normal" neural
   network.

   update: (11/15/16): i recently got into an argument with someone about
   deep learning, and when i asked where they got their information they
   pointed to this answer :)

   please keep in mind deep learning has evolved quite a bit since i
   originally answered this question a few years ago. the methods
   described here are representative of some of the important early work
   in deep learning, but not really representative of the field today.

   an excellent more recent reference is:
