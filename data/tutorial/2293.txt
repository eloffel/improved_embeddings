   dive into the world of convolution neural networks (id98), learn how
   they work, how to apply them for nlp, and how to tune id98
   hyperparameters for best performance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [37]denny britz, wildml.

   when we hear about convolutional neural network (id98s), we typically
   think of id161. id98s were responsible for major breakthroughs
   in image classification and are the core of most id161
   systems today, from facebook   s automated photo tagging to self-driving
   cars.

   more recently we   ve also started to apply id98s to problems in natural
   language processing and gotten some interesting results. in this post
   i   ll try to summarize what id98s are, and how they   re used in nlp. the
   intuitions behind id98s are somewhat easier to understand for
   the id161 use case, so i   ll start there, and then slowly move
   towards nlp.

what is convolution?

   the for me easiest way to understand a convolution is by thinking of it
   as a sliding window function applied to a matrix. that   s a mouthful,
   but it becomes quite clear looking at a visualization:

   fig.1 convolution with 3  3 filter. source:
   http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/feature_extraction_usin
   g_convolution

   imagine that the matrix on the left represents an black and white
   image. each entry corresponds to one pixel, 0 for black and 1 for white
   (typically it   s between 0 and 255 for grayscale images). the sliding
   window is called a kernel, filter, or feature detector. here we use a
   3  3 filter, multiply its values element-wise with the original matrix,
   then sum them up. to get the full convolution we do this for each
   element by sliding the filter over the whole matrix.

   you may be wondering wonder what you can actually do with this. here
   are some intuitive examples.

averaging each pixel with its neighboring values blurs an image:



taking the difference between a pixel and its neighbors detects edges:

   (to understand this one intuitively, think about what happens in parts
   of the image that are smooth, where a pixel color equals that of its
   neighbors: the additions cancel and the resulting value is 0, or black.
   if there   s a sharp edge in intensity, a transition from white to black
   for example, you get a large difference and a resulting white value)



   the[38] gimp manual has a few other examples. to understand more about
   how convolutions work i also recommend checking out [39]chris olah   s
   post on the topic.

what are convolutional neural networks?

   now you know what convolutions are. but what about id98s? id98s are
   basically just several layers of convolutions with nonlinear activation
   functions like [40]relu or [41]tanh applied to the results. in a
   traditional feedforward neural network we connect each input neuron to
   each output neuron in the next layer. that   s also called a fully
   connected layer, or affine layer. in id98s we don   t do that. instead, we
   use convolutions over the input layer to compute the output. this
   results in local connections, where each region of the input is
   connected to a neuron in the output.each layer applies different
   filters, typically hundreds or thousands like the ones showed above,
   and combines their results. there   s also something something called
   pooling (subsampling) layers, but i   ll get into that later. during the
   training phase, a id98 automatically learns the values of its
   filtersbased on the task you want to perform. for example, in image
   classification a id98 may learn to detect edges from raw pixels in the
   first layer, then use the edges to detect simple shapes in the second
   layer, and then use these shapes to deter higher-level features, such
   as facial shapes in higher layers. the last layer is then a classifier
   that uses these high-level features.

   convolutional neural network (clarifai)

   there are two aspects of this computation worth paying attention to:
   location invariance and compositionality. let   s say you want to
   classify whether or not there   s an elephant in an image. because you
   are sliding your filters over the whole image you don   t really care
   where the elephant occurs. in practice,  pooling also gives
   you invariance to translation, rotation and scaling, but more on that
   later. the second key aspect is (local) compositionality. each filter
   composes a local patch of lower-level features into higher-level
   representation. that   s why id98s are so powerful in id161. it
   makes intuitive sense that you build edges from pixels, shapes from
   edges, and more complex objects from shapes.
