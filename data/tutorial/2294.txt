   convnetjs is a javascript library for training deep learning models
   (neural networks) entirely in your browser. open a tab and you're
   training. no software requirements, no compilers, no installations, no
   gpus, no sweat.

description

   the library allows you to formulate and solve neural networks in
   javascript, and was originally written by [10]@karpathy (i am a phd
   student at stanford). however, the library has since been extended by
   contributions from the community and more are warmly welcome. current
   support includes:
     * common neural network modules (fully connected layers,
       non-linearities)
     * classification (id166/softmax) and regression (l2) cost functions
     * ability to specify and train convolutional networks that process
       images
     * an experimental id23 module, based on deep q
       learning.

   head over to [11]getting started for a tutorial that lets you get up
   and running quickly, and discuss [12]documentation for all specifics.

code

   the code is available on [13]github under mit license and i warmly
   welcome pull requests for new features / layers / demos and
   miscellaneous improvements. the library is also available on npm for
   use in [14]nodejs, under name convnetjs.
