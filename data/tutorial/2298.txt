   this post discusses using some tricks to peek inside of the neural
   network, and to visualize what the individual units in a layer detect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by audun m.   ygard, schibsted media group.

   convolutional neural networks are used extensively for a number of
   image related tasks these days. despite being very successful, they're
   mostly seen as "black box" models, since it's hard to understand what
   happens inside the network. there are however methods to "peek inside"
   the convnets, and thus understand a bit more about how they work.

                                    image

   in a [36]previous blogpost i showed how you could use gradient ascent,
   with some special tricks, to make a convolutional network visualize the
   classes it's learnt to classify. in this post i'll show that the same
   technique can also be used to "peek inside the network" by visualizing
   what the individual units in a layer detect. to give you an idea of the
   results, here's some highlights of visualizations of individual units
   from convolutional layer 5 in the [37]vgg-s network:

    visualization of filter 10 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 334 in
                                    vgg-s
     visualization of filter 345 in vgg-s visualization of filter 425 in
                                    vgg-s
    visualization of units 10,334,425 and 435 in convolutional layer 5 in
                                   vgg-s.

   from top left we can pretty clearly see the head of a cocker
   spaniel-type dog, the head of some kind of bird, the ears of a canine,
   and a seaside coastline. not all unit vizualisations are as clearly
   defined as these, but most nevertheless give us some interesting
   insights into what the individual units detect.

   earlier methods for figuring out what the units detect (e.g.
   in [38]zeiler & fergus) have been to find images which maximally
   activate the individual units. here's an example of the images (sampled
   from numerous crops of 100 000 images in the id163 validation
   dataset) which give maximal activations for a specific unit in layer 5
   of vgg-s:

   [39]images maximally activating filter 5 in vgg-s

          image crops maximally activating unit 5 in layer 5 vgg-s

   while this gives us an idea of what the unit is detecting, by
   visualizing the same unit we can see explicitly the details the unit is
   focusing on. applying this technique to the same unit as above, we can
   see that the unit seems to focus on the characteristic pattern on the
   muzzle of the dog, seemingly ignoring most other details in the image.

                     visualization of filter 5 in vgg-s
          visualization of unit 5 in convolutional layer 5 in vgg-s

   we can use our visualization technique to get an overview of what all
   the different units in a typical layer detects. here we've focused on
   convolutional layer 5 in vgg-s, which is the final convolutional layer
   in that specific network. seemingly there are a large number of units
   that detect very specific features, such as (from top left below)
   forests/bushes in the background, buildings with pitched roofs,
   individual trees, clouds, collars, brass instruments, ship masts,
   bottle/jug tops, and seemingly the shoulders of people:

    visualization of filter 94 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 159 in
                                    vgg-s
     visualization of filter 201 in vgg-s visualization of filter 432 in
                                    vgg-s
     visualization of filter 258 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 7 in
                                    vgg-s
    visualization of filter 136 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 88 in
                                    vgg-s
                    visualization of filter 449 in vgg-s
   visualization of (from top left) unit 94,159,201,432,258,7,136,88 & 449
                      in convolutional layer 5 in vgg-s

   what is interesting to notice, is that the network doesn't seem to have
   learned detailed representations of faces. in e.g. the visualization
   featuring the collar, the face looks more like a spooky flesh-colored
   blob than a face. this might be an artifact of the visualization
   process, but it's not entirely unlikely that the network have either
   not found it necessary to learn the details, or not had the capacity to
   learn them.

   there also are a surprisingly large number of units that detect
   dog-related features. i counted somewhere around 50, out of 512 units
   in the layer in total, which means a surprising 10% of the network may
   be dedicated solely to dogs. here's a small sample of these:

    visualization of filter 249 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 468 in
                                    vgg-s
    visualization of filter 170 in vgg-s   visualization of filter 75 in
                                    vgg-s
   visualization of (from top left) unit 249,468,170 & 75 in convolutional
                              layer 5 in vgg-s

   on the other hand i could only find a single unit that clearly detected
   cat features (!):

                    visualization of filter 484 in vgg-s
         visualization of unit 484 in convolutional layer 5 in vgg-s
