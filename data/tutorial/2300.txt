   deep learning-powered image recognition is now performing better than
   human vision on many tasks. we examine how human and id161
   extracts features from raw pixels, and explain how deep convolutional
   neural networks work so well.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by nikhil buduma (mit). the human sense of vision is unbelievably
   advanced. within fractions of seconds, we can identify objects within
   our field of view, without thought or hesitation. but not only can we
   name objects we are looking at, we can also perceive their depth,
   perfectly distinguish their contours, and separate the objects from
   their backgrounds. somehow our eyes take in raw voxels of color data,
   but our brain transforms that information into more meaningful
   primitives     lines, curves, and shapes     that might indicate, for
   example, that we   re looking at a can of coke. coke can - human vision
   programming machines to replicate human vision has huge implications,
   from facebook   s facial recognition algorithms to google   s self-driving
   cars to futuristic biomedical diagnostics. but it turns out this is a
   pretty difficult problem. why? because where we automatically see
   lines, contours, and objects, computers just see large matrices of
   numbers. vision grey square to tackle this problem of learning more
   complex features out of raw pixel values, we   re going to use a special
   kind of neural network called a convolutional network. convolutional
   neural networks, popularized by yann lecun and others in 1998 with
   [38]lenet are behind many of the successes of deep learning that have
   been reported recently in image and id103 and are a very
   hot topic. convolutional neural networks use two major constructs as
   primitives: 1) filters(also called feature detectors) and 2) feature
   maps as we will see later, we can express these primitives as
   specialized groups of neurons, which enables us to build neural
   networks to represent them. id161 filters let   s say we have
   an image (shown on the left in the diagram above), and our goal is to
   detect horizontal and vertical edges. to do so, we can create what   s
   called a filter (drawn in green). a filter is essentially a small
   matrix that represents a feature that we want to find in the original
   image. the filter on the top attempts to discover the parts of the
   original image with vertical lines, while the filter on the bottom
   tries to discover parts of the image with horizontal lines.
