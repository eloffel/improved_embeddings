introduction


   convolutional neural networks. sounds like a weird combination of
   biology and math with a little cs sprinkled in, but these networks have
   been some of the most influential innovations in the field of computer
   vision. 2012 was the first year that neural nets grew to prominence as
   alex krizhevsky used them to win that year   s id163 competition
   (basically, the annual olympics of id161), dropping the
   classification error record from 26% to 15%, an astounding improvement
   at the time.ever since then, a host of companies have been using deep
   learning at the core of their services. facebook uses neural nets for
   their automatic tagging algorithms, google for their photo search,
   amazon for their product recommendations, pinterest for their home feed
   personalization, and instagram for their search infrastructure.

   companies

   however, the classic, and arguably most popular, use case of these
   networks is for image processing. within image processing, let   s take a
   look at how to use these id98s for image classification.

the problem space


   image classification is the task of taking an input image and
   outputting a class (a cat, dog, etc) or a id203 of classes that
   best describes the image. for humans, this task of recognition is one
   of the first skills we learn from the moment we are born and is one
   that comes naturally and effortlessly as adults. without even thinking
   twice, we   re able to quickly and seaid113ssly identify the environment we
   are in as well as the objects that surround us. when we see an image or
   just when we look at the world around us, most of the time we are able
   to immediately characterize the scene and give each object a label, all
   without even consciously noticing. these skills of being able to
   quickly recognize patterns, generalize from prior knowledge, and adapt
   to different image environments are ones that we do not share with our
   fellow machines.

inputs and outputs


   when a computer sees an image (takes an image as input), it will see an
   array of pixel values. depending on the resolution and size of the
   image, it will see a 32 x 32 x 3 array of numbers (the 3 refers to rgb
   values). just to drive home the point, let's say we have a color image
   in jpg form and its size is 480 x 480. the representative array will be
   480 x 480 x 3. each of these numbers is given a value from 0 to 255
   which describes the pixel intensity at that point. these numbers, while
   meaningless to us when we perform image classification, are the only
   inputs available to the computer.  the idea is that you give the
   computer this array of numbers and it will output numbers that describe
   the id203 of the image being a certain class (.80 for cat, .15
   for dog, .05 for bird, etc).

what we want the computer to do


   now that we know the problem as well as the inputs and outputs, let   s
   think about how to approach this. what we want the computer to do is to
   be able to differentiate between all the images it   s given and figure
   out the unique features that make a dog a dog or that make a cat a cat.
   this is the process that goes on in our minds subconsciously as well.
   when we look at a picture of a dog, we can classify it as such if the
   picture has identifiable features such as paws or 4 legs. in a similar
   way, the computer is able perform image classification by looking for
   low level features such as edges and curves, and then building up to
   more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers. this
   is a general overview of what a id98 does. let   s get into the specifics.

biological connection


   but first, a little background. when you first heard of the term
   convolutional neural networks, you may have thought of something
   related to neuroscience or biology, and you would be right. sort of.
   id98s do take a biological inspiration from the visual cortex. the
   visual cortex has small regions of cells that are sensitive to specific
   regions of the visual field. this idea was expanded upon by a
   fascinating experiment by hubel and wiesel in 1962 ([38]video) where
   they showed that some individual neuronal cells in the brain responded
   (or fired) only in the presence of edges of a certain orientation. for
   example, some neurons fired when exposed to vertical edges and some
   when shown horizontal or diagonal edges. hubel and wiesel found out
   that all of these neurons were organized in a columnar architecture and
   that together, they were able to produce visual perception. this idea
   of specialized components inside of a system having specific tasks (the
   neuronal cells in the visual cortex looking for specific
   characteristics) is one that machines use as well, and is the basis
   behind id98s.

structure


   back to the specifics. a more detailed overview of what id98s do would
   be that you take the image, pass it through a series of convolutional,
   nonlinear, pooling (downsampling), and fully connected layers, and get
   an output. as we said earlier, the output can be a single class or a
   id203 of classes that best describes the image. now, the hard
   part is understanding what each of these layers do. so let   s get into
   the most important one.

first layer     math part


   the first layer in a id98 is always a convolutional layer. first thing
   to make sure you remember is what the input to this conv (i   ll be using
   that abbreviation a lot) layer is. like we mentioned before, the input
   is a 32 x 32 x 3 array of pixel values. now, the best way to explain a
   conv layer is to imagine a flashlight that is shining over the top left
   of the image. let   s say that the light this flashlight shines covers a
   5 x 5 area. and now, let   s imagine this flashlight sliding across all
   the areas of the input image. in machine learning terms, this
   flashlight is called a filter(or sometimes referred to as a neuron or
   a kernel) and the region that it is shining over is called
   the receptive field. now this filter is also an array of numbers (the
   numbers are called weights orparameters). a very important note is that
   the depth of this filter has to be the same as the depth of the input
   (this makes sure that the math works out), so the dimensions of this
   filter is 5 x 5 x 3. now, let   s take the first position the filter is
   in for example.  it would be the top left corner. as the filter is
   sliding, or convolving, around the input image, it is multiplying the
   values in the filter with the original pixel values of the image (aka
   computing element wise multiplications). these multiplications are all
   summed up (mathematically speaking, this would be 75 multiplications in
   total). so now you have a single number. remember, this number is just
   representative of when the filter is at the top left of the image. now,
   we repeat this process for every location on the input volume. (next
   step would be moving the filter to the right by 1 unit, then right
   again by 1, and so on). every unique location on the input volume
   produces a number. after sliding the filter over all the locations, you
   will find out that what you   re left with is a 28 x 28 x 1 array of
   numbers, which we call an activation map or feature map. the reason you
   get a 28 x 28 array is that there are 784 different locations that a 5
   x 5 filter can fit on a 32 x 32 input image. these 784 numbers are
   mapped to a 28 x 28 array.

   activation map

   (quick note: some of the images, including the one above, i used came
   from this terrific book, [39]"neural networks and deep learning" by
   michael nielsen. strongly recommend.)

   let   s say now we use two 5 x 5 x 3 filters instead of one. then our
   output volume would be 28 x 28 x 2. by using more filters, we are able
   to preserve the spatial dimensions better. mathematically, this is
   what   s going on in a convolutional layer.

first layer     high level perspective


   however, let   s talk about what this convolution is actually doing from
   a high level. each of these filters can be thought of as feature
   identifiers. when i say features, i   m talking about things like
   straight edges, simple colors, and curves. think about the simplest
   characteristics that all images have in common with each other. let   s
   say our first filter is 7 x 7 x 3 and is going to be a curve detector.
   (in this section, let   s ignore the fact that the filter is 3 units deep
   and only consider the top depth slice of the filter and the image, for
   simplicity.)as a curve detector, the filter will have a pixel structure
   in which there will be higher numerical values along the area that is a
   shape of a curve (remember, these filters that we   re talking about as
   just numbers!).

   filter

   now, let   s go back to visualizing this mathematically. when we have
   this filter at the top left corner of the input volume, it is computing
   multiplications between the filter and pixel values at that region. now
   let   s take an example of an image that we want to classify, and let   s
   put our filter at the top left corner.

   original and filter

   remember, what we have to do is multiply the values in the filter with
   the original pixel values of the image.

   first pixel multiplication

   basically, in the input image, if there is a shape that generally
   resembles the curve that this filter is representing, then all of the
   multiplications summed together will result in a large value! now let   s
   see what happens when we move our filter.

   second multiplication

   the value is much lower! this is because there wasn   t anything in the
   image section that responded to the curve detector filter. remember,
   the output of this conv layer is an activation map. so, in the simple
   case of a one filter convolution (and if that filter is a curve
   detector), the activation map will show the areas in which there at
   mostly likely to be curves in the picture. in this example, the top
   left value of our 28 x 28 x 1 activation map will be 6600. this high
   value means that it is likely that there is some sort of curve in the
   input volume that caused the filter to activate. the top right value in
   our activation map will be 0 because there wasn   t anything in the input
   volume that caused the filter to activate (or more simply said, there
   wasn   t a curve in that region of the original image). remember, this is
   just for one filter. this is just a filter that is going to detect
   lines that curve outward and to the right. we can have other filters
   for lines that curve to the left or for straight edges. the more
   filters, the greater the depth of the activation map, and the more
   information we have about the input volume.

   disclaimer: the filter i described in this section was simplistic for
   the main purpose of describing the math that goes on during a
   convolution. in the picture below, you   ll see some examples of actual
   visualizations of the filters of the first conv layer of a trained
   network. nonetheless, the main argument remains the same. the filters
   on the first layer convolve around the input image and    activate    (or
   compute high values) when the specific feature it is looking for is in
   the input volume.

   first layers

   (quick note: the above image came from stanford's [40]cs 231n
   course taught by andrej karpathy and justin johnson. recommend for
   anyone looking for a deeper understanding of id98s.)
