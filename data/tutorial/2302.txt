   this is the second part of a thorough introductory treatment of
   convolutional neural networks. have a look after reading the first
   part.

     editor's note: you may want to check out [39]part 1 of this tutorial
     before reading on.

introduction


   in this post, we   ll go into a lot more of the specifics of
   convnets. disclaimer: now, i do realize that some of these topics are
   quite complex and could be made in whole posts by themselves. in an
   effort to remain concise yet retain comprehensiveness, i will provide
   links to research papers where the topic is explained in more detail.

stride and padding


   alright, let   s look back at our good old conv layers. remember the
   filters, the receptive fields, the convolving? good. now, there are 2
   main parameters that we can change to modify the behavior of each
   layer. after we choose the filter size, we also have to choose
   the stride and the padding.

   stride controls how the filter convolves around the input volume. in
   the example we had in part 1, the filter convolves around the input
   volume by shifting one unit at a time. the amount by which the filter
   shifts is the stride. in that case, the stride was implicitly set at 1.
   stride is normally set in a way so that the output volume is an integer
   and not a fraction. let   s look at an example. let   s imagine a 7 x 7
   input volume, a 3 x 3 filter (disregard the 3rd dimension for
   simplicity), and a stride of 1. this is the case that we   re accustomed
   to.

   stride 1

   same old, same old, right? see if you can try to guess what will happen
   to the output volume as the stride increases to 2.

   stride 2

   so, as you can see, the receptive field is shifting by 2 units now and
   the output volume shrinks as well. notice that if we tried to set our
   stride to 3, then we   d have issues with spacing and making sure the
   receptive fields fit on the input volume. normally, programmers will
   increase the stride if they want receptive fields to overlap less and
   if they want smaller spatial dimensions.

   now, let   s take a look at padding. before getting into that, let   s
   think about a scenario. what happens when you apply three 5 x 5 x 3
   filters to a 32 x 32 x 3 input volume? the output volume would be 28 x
   28 x 3. notice that the spatial dimensions decrease. as we keep
   applying conv layers, the size of the volume will decrease faster than
   we would like. in the early layers of our network, we want to preserve
   as much information about the original input volume so that we can
   extract those low level features. let   s say we want to apply the same
   conv layer but we want the output volume to remain 32 x 32 x 3. to do
   this, we can apply a zero padding of size 2 to that layer. zero padding
   pads the input volume with zeros around the border. if we think about a
   zero padding of two, then this would result in a 36 x 36 x 3 input
   volume.

   pad

   if you have a stride of 1 and if you set the size of zero padding to

   zero pad

   where k is the filter size, then the input and output volume will
   always have the same spatial dimensions.

   the formula for calculating the output size for any given conv layer is

   output

   where o is the output height/length, w is the input height/length, k is
   the filter size, p is the padding, and s is the stride.

choosing hyperparameters


   how do we know how many layers to use, how many conv layers, what are
   the filter sizes, or the values for stride and padding? these are not
   trivial questions and there isn   t a set standard that is used by all
   researchers. this is because the network will largely depend on the
   type of data that you have. data can vary by size, complexity of the
   image, type of image processing task, and more. when looking at your
   dataset, one way to think about how to choose the hyperparameters is to
   find the right combination that creates abstractions of the image at a
   proper scale.

relu (rectified linear units) layers


   after each conv layer, it is convention to apply a nonlinear layer
   (or activation layer) immediately afterward.the purpose of this layer
   is to introduce nonlinearity to a system that basically has just been
   computing linear operations during the conv layers (just element wise
   multiplications and summations).in the past, nonlinear functions like
   tanh and sigmoid were used, but researchers found out that relu
   layers work far better because the network is able to train a lot
   faster (because of the computational efficiency) without making a
   significant difference to the accuracy. it also helps to alleviate the
   vanishing gradient problem, which is the issue where the lower layers
   of the network train very slowly because the gradient decreases
   exponentially through the layers (explaining this might be out of the
   scope of this post, but see [40]here and [41]here for good
   descriptions). the relu layer applies the function f(x) = max(0, x) to
   all of the values in the input volume. in basic terms, this layer just
   changes all the negative activations to 0.this layer increases the
   nonlinear properties of the model and the overall network without
   affecting the receptive fields of the conv layer.

   learning).
