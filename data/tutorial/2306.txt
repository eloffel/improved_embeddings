   this article provides a easy to understand introduction to what
   convolutional neural networks are and how they work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [38]ujjwal karn.

   what are convolutional neural networks and why are they important?

   convolutional neural networks (convnets or id98s) are a category of
   neural networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image
   recognition and classification. convnets have been successful in
   identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision
   in robots and self driving cars.

   in figure 1 above, a convnet is able to recognize scenes and the system
   is able to suggest relevant tags such as    bridge   ,    railway    and
      tennis    while figure 2 shows an example of convnets being used
   for recognizing everyday objects, humans and animals. lately,
   convnets have been effective in several natural language processing
   tasks (such as sentence classification) as well.

   convnets, therefore, are an important tool for most machine learning
   practitioners today. however, understanding convnets and learning to
   use them for the first time can sometimes be an intimidating
   experience. the primary purpose of this blog post is to develop an
   understanding of how convolutional neural networks work on images.

   if you are new to neural networks in general, i would recommend reading
   [39]this short tutorial on multi layer id88s to get an idea about
   how they work, before proceeding. multi layer id88s are referred
   to as    fully connected layers    in this post.

the lenet architecture (1990s)

   lenet was one of the very first convolutional neural networks
   which helped propel the field of deep learning. this pioneering work by
   yann lecun was named [40]lenet5 after many previous successful
   iterations since the year 1988 [3]. at that time the lenet architecture
   was used mainly for character recognition tasks such as reading zip
   codes, digits, etc.

   below, we will develop an intuition of how the lenet architecture
   learns to recognize images. there have been several new architectures
   proposed in the recent years which are improvements over the lenet, but
   they all use the main concepts from the lenet and relatively easier to
   understand if you have a clear understanding of the former.

figure 3: a simple convnet. source [5]

   the convolutional neural network in figure 3 is similar in architecture
   to the original lenet and classifies an input image into
   four categories: dog, cat, boat or bird (the original lenet was used
   mainly for character recognition tasks). as evident from the figure
   above, on receiving a boat image as input, the network correctly
   assigns the highest id203 for boat (0.94) among all
   four categories. the sum of all probabilities in the output layer
   should be one (explained later in this post).

   there are four main operations in the convnet shown in figure 3 above:
    1. convolution
    2. non linearity (relu)
    3. pooling or sub sampling
    4. classification (fully connected layer)

   these operations are the basic building blocks of every convolutional
   neural network, so understanding how these work is an important step to
   developing a sound understanding of convnets. we will try to understand
   the intuition behind each of these operations below.

images are a matrix of pixel values

   essentially, every image can be represented as a matrix of pixel
   values.

   8-gif.gif

figure 4: every image is a matrix of pixel values. source [6]

   [41]channel is a conventional term used to refer to a certain component
   of an image. an image from a standard digital camera will have three
   channels     red, green and blue     you can imagine those as
   three 2d-matrices stacked over each other (one for each color), each
   having pixel values in the range 0 to 255.

   a [42]grayscale image, on the other hand, has just one channel. for the
   purpose of this post, we will only consider grayscale images, so we
   will have a single 2d matrix representing an image. the value of each
   pixel in the matrix will range from 0 to 255     zero indicating
   black and 255 indicating white.

the convolution step

   convnets derive their name from the [43]   convolution    operator. the
   primary purpose of convolution in case of a convnet is to extract
   features from the input image. convolution preserves the spatial
   relationship between pixels by learning image features using small
   squares of input data. we will not go into the mathematical details of
   convolution here, but will try to understand how it works over images.

   as we discussed above, every image can be considered as a matrix of
   pixel values. consider a 5 x 5 image whose pixel values are only 0 and
   1 (note that for a grayscale image, pixel values range from 0 to 255,
   the green matrix below is a special case where pixel values are only 0
   and 1):

   screen shot 2016-07-24 at 11.25.13 pm

   also, consider another 3 x 3 matrix as shown below:

   screen shot 2016-07-24 at 11.25.24 pm

   then, the convolution of the 5 x 5 image and the 3 x 3 matrix can be
   computed as shown in the animation in figure 5 below:
   convolution_schematic

figure 5: the convolution operation. the output matrix is called convolved
feature or feature map. source [7]

   take a moment to understand how the computation above is being done.
   we slide the orange matrix over our original image (green) by 1
   pixel (also called    stride   ) and for every position, we compute element
   wise multiplication (between the two matrices) and add the
   multiplication outputs to get the final integer which forms a single
   element of the output matrix (pink). note that the 3  3 matrix    sees   
   only a part of the input image in each stride.

   in id98 terminology, the 3  3 matrix is called a    filter    or    kernel    or
      feature detector    and the matrix formed by sliding the filter over the
   image and computing the dot product is called the    convolved feature   
   or    activation map    or the    feature map   . it is important to note that
   filters acts as feature detectors from the original input image.

   it is evident from the animation above that different values of the
   filter matrix will produce different feature maps for the same input
   image. as an example, consider the following input image:

   111.png

   in the table below, we can see the effects of convolution of the above
   image with different filters. as shown, we can perform operations such
   as edge detection, sharpen and blur just by changing the numeric values
   of our filter matrix before the convolution operation [8]     this means
   that different filters can detect different features from an image, for
   example edges, curves etc. more such examples are available in section
   8.2.4 [44]here.
