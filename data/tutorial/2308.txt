readme.md

   [79]this code belongs to the "implementing a id98 for text
   classification in tensorflow" blog post.

   it is slightly simplified implementation of kim's [80]convolutional
   neural networks for sentence classification paper in tensorflow.

requirements

     * python 3
     * tensorflow > 0.12

   train:
./train.py

evaluating

./eval.py --eval_train --checkpoint_dir="./runs/1459637919/checkpoints/"

   replace the checkpoint dir with the output from the training. to use
   your own data, change the eval.py script to load your data.
