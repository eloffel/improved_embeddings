convolutional neural networks for sentence classification

   code for the paper [73]convolutional neural networks for sentence
   classification (emnlp 2014).

   runs the model on pang and lee's movie review dataset (mr in the
   paper). please cite the original paper when using the data.

requirements

   code is written in python (2.7) and requires theano (0.7).

   using the pre-trained id97 vectors will also require downloading
   the binary file from [74]https://code.google.com/p/id97/

id174

   to process the raw data, run
python process_data.py path

   where path points to the id97 binary file (i.e.
   googlenews-vectors-negative300.bin file). this will create a pickle
   object called mr.p in the same folder, which contains the dataset in
   the right format.

   note: this will create the dataset with different fold-assignments than
   was used in the paper. you should still be getting a cv score of >81%
   with id98-nonstatic model, though.

running the models (cpu)

   example commands:
theano_flags=mode=fast_run,device=cpu,floatx=float32 python conv_net_sentence.py
 -nonstatic -rand
theano_flags=mode=fast_run,device=cpu,floatx=float32 python conv_net_sentence.py
 -static -id97
theano_flags=mode=fast_run,device=cpu,floatx=float32 python conv_net_sentence.py
 -nonstatic -id97

   this will run the id98-rand, id98-static, and id98-nonstatic models
   respectively in the paper.

using the gpu

   gpu will result in a good 10x to 20x speed-up, so it is highly
   recommended. to use the gpu, simply change device=cpu to device=gpu (or
   whichever gpu you are using). for example:
theano_flags=mode=fast_run,device=gpu,floatx=float32 python conv_net_sentence.py
 -nonstatic -id97

example output

   cpu output:
epoch: 1, training time: 219.72 secs, train perf: 81.79 %, val perf: 79.26 %
epoch: 2, training time: 219.55 secs, train perf: 82.64 %, val perf: 76.84 %
epoch: 3, training time: 219.54 secs, train perf: 92.06 %, val perf: 80.95 %

   gpu output:
epoch: 1, training time: 16.49 secs, train perf: 81.80 %, val perf: 78.32 %
epoch: 2, training time: 16.12 secs, train perf: 82.53 %, val perf: 76.74 %
epoch: 3, training time: 16.16 secs, train perf: 91.87 %, val perf: 81.37 %

other implementations

tensorflow

   [75]denny britz has an implementation of the model in tensorflow:

   [76]https://github.com/dennybritz/id98-text-classification-tf

   he also wrote a [77]nice tutorial on it, as well as a general tutorial
   on [78]id98s for nlp.

torch

   [79]harvardnlp group has an implementation in torch.

   [80]https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-conv-torch

hyperparameters

   at the time of my original experiments i did not have access to a gpu
   so i could not run a lot of different experiments. hence the paper is
   missing a lot of things like ablation studies and variance in
   performance, and some of the conclusions were premature (e.g.
   id173 does not always seem to help).

   ye zhang has written a [81]very nice paper doing an extensive analysis
   of model variants (e.g. filter widths, k-max pooling, id97 vs
   glove, etc.) and their effect on performance.
