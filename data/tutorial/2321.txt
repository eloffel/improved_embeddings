why take this course?

arti   cial intelligence is one of the most interesting    elds of

research today, and language is the most compelling manifestation

of intelligence.

prerequisites

maths

    id202,
    calculus,
    id203.

machine learning

(train/validation/test split, cross validation etc.),

    evaluating ml models
    over   tting, generalisation, and regularisation,
    optimisation
(objective functions, stochastic id119),
    id75 and classi   cation, neural networks
(common non-linearities, id26s etc.).

programming

knowledge of, or ability to learn quickly, a nn toolkit
(e.g. torch, tensorflow, theano, dynet etc.)

what this course is, and is not, about

this course will survey the use of deep learning techniques for a
range of natural language processing applications.

this is not a general course on nlp. there is a lot more to
language and computational linguistics, and many interesting
paradigms beyond deep learning, than we will cover.

id98 article:

document the bbc producer allegedly struck by
jeremy clarkson will not press charges
against the    top gear    host, his lawyer
said friday. clarkson, who hosted one of
the most-watched television shows in the
world, was dropped by the bbc wednesday
after an internal investigation by the
british broadcaster found he had subjected
producer oisin tymon    to an unprovoked
physical and verbal attack.    . . .

query who does the article say will not press

charges against jeremy clarkson?

answer oisin tymon
