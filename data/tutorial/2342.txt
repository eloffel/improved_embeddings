problem definition

    given a bi-partite graph, and k, l

    divide it into k row groups and l row groups

    (also applicable to uni-partite graph)

co-id91

    given data matrix and the number of row 

and column groups k and l

    simultaneously

    cluster rows into k disjoint groups

co-id91

    let x and y be discrete random variables 

    x  and y  take values in {1, 2,    , m} and {1, 2,    , n}

    p(x, y)  denotes the joint id203 distribution   if 

not known, it is often estimated based on co-occurrence
data

    application areas: id111, market-basket analysis, 

analysis of browsing behavior, etc. 

    key obstacles in id91 contingency tables 

    high dimensionality, sparsity, noise

    need for robust and scalable algorithms
