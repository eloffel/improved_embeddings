virus propagation

    how do viruses/rumors  propagate?

    blog influence?

    will a flu-like virus linger, or will it 

become extinct soon?

    compute its epidemic threshold

networks

formula includes older results as special cases: 

    homogeneous networks [kephart+white]

      1,a = <k>;    = 1/<k> (<k> : avg degree)

    star networks (d = degree of center)

      1,a = sqrt(d);    = 1/ sqrt(d)

    infinite power-law networks
