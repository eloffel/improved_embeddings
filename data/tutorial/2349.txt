observations        laws    of real graphs

    observation #1: small and shrinking 

diameter

    observation #2: power law / skewed degree 

distributions

    observation #3: power laws in several 

aspects

    observation #4: communities

observation 1     diameter

    small diameter        six degrees   

        and the diameter shrinks as the graph 

grows (!)

observation 1     diameter

    small diameter        six degrees   

        and the diameter shrinks as the graph 

grows (!)

practical implication: bfs may die:

    3-step-away neighbors => half of the graph!

observations  2     degree distribution

skewed degree distribution

    most nodes have degree 1 or 2

        but they probably have a neighbor with 

degree 100,000 or so (!)

observation 2     degree distributions

skewed degree distribution

    most nodes have degree 1 or 2

        but they probably have a neighbor with degree 

100,000 or so (!)

practical implications:

    may need to delete/ignore those high degree nodes

    could probably also trim the 1-degree nodes, 

saving significant space and time

observation 3     power laws

power-laws / skewed distributions in 

everything:

    most pairs: within 2-3 steps; but, some pair: 

~20 or more steps away

    triangles: power laws[tsourakakis   08]

    # of cliques: ditto [du+   09]

    weight vs degree: ditto [mcglohon+   08]

observation 4     communities

       negative dimensionality    paradox 

[chakrabarti+   04]

practical implication:

    graphs may have no good cuts

conclusions

0) graphs appear in numerous settings

1) singular / eigenvalue analysis: valuable

    fixed points     id93     importance

    eigenvalue and epidemic threshold

    laplacians -> communities

conclusions     cont   d

2) id93 -> proximity

    recommendations, auto-captioning, etc

    fast algo   s, through sherman-morrison

3) tera-byte scale graphs: hadoop

4) beware: counter-intuitive properties

    small diameters; power-laws; possible lack of 

good cuts
