constructicon

    a repertoire of syntactic constructions, structures whose recognition, 
treatment and interpretation are key for natural language processing 

    starting with 2 types of constructions: 

    para + in   nitive  

    multiword quanti   ers as example of constructions 

    comp. ling. "multiword expression" = cog. ling. "construction"? 

    clear division between work of lexicon and work of construction 

    full integration of both in parsing, nlp

north korea also allegedly provided more than 10 scientists to work on the libyan missile program .

       the giving frame is central to the idea of resource exchange; however, a frame search for 
giving with no hops does not find any relevant results, so the recall and precision metrics
