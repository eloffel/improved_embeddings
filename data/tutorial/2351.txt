    frame semantics across languages

frame semantics

    the central idea of frame 

semantics is that word 
meanings must be described 
in relation to semantic frames     
schematic representations of 
the conceptual structures and 
patterns of beliefs, practices, 
institutions, images, etc. that 
provide a foundation for 
meaningful interaction in a 
given speech community. 
(fillmore et al. 2003) 

    meanings are relativized to 

frames. (fillmore 1977)

framenet in two slides (1)

    1,195 semantic frames 
    frame elements (fes) (roles) ~12/frame, some ``core'' fes 
    12,989 lexical units (lus), connections between one 
lemma+pos and one frame 
    198,932 manual annotations of corpus examples 
    1,774 frame-to-frame relations: inheritance, using, 
perspective on, ... 
    (and closely-related fe-to-fe relations)

framenet in two slides (2)
    multiple inheritance, forms a lattice (valverde-
albacete 2008) 
    constructed bottom-up, quasi-ontology 
    semantic type labels: animate, human, 
positive_judgement, ... 
    assumes construction grammar (   the 
constructicon   ) 
    metaphor and metonymy: sometimes even marked

8

is framenet an ontology?

    not intended as a formal ontology 

    linguistically motivated, bottom up 

    we have made non-lexical frames as needed to connect 

the nodes in certain cases (e.g. placing,  filling) 

    some non-lexical frames could be eliminated if we had a 

new frame-frame relation, entailment. 

    cross-linguistic differences are to be expected: e.g. 

commercial_transaction vs. criminal_process

9

nlp needs frame semantics

    frames provide generalizations about lexical units at a 
useful level of abstraction, e.g. operate vehicle covers 
drive.v,    y.v, paddle.v, sail.v, etc. useful for paraphrase 

    roles (frame elements) are also more meaningful than 
traditional semantic role labels, e.g. driver in operate 
vehicle for all the types of vehicle tells us more than 
just agent.!

    frames represent conceptual gestalts--more than just 

the sum of their parts 

10

nlp and framenet

    automatic id14 (asrl)-- long 
history, beginning with gildea and jurafsky 2002, 
through dipanjan das et al. 2010 and ff. 

    id29, joint id136 (das et al. acl 

2013) 

    automatic frame induction (hermann et al.  acl 2014) 

    controlled crowd-sourcing of annotation (current work 

with google, in nancy chang et al. law 2015)

id138 : framenet

    q: why would you use 

framenet when you have 
id138? 

    a: the lexical information each 

contains is different, and in 
many ways complementary: 

    fn has little to say about 
common nouns; wn noun 
hierarchies are usually good 

    wn has little syntagmatic 
information, fn has a lot

structural differences:!
    wn: separate hierarchies for n, v, adj, and adv., (only)!
    each fn frame can cover words of any pos 
     wn: hyper-/hyponymy relations between synsets (i.e. between lus that are roughly 
synonymous)!
     fn: no lu relations per se, but several types of frame relations 
    content differences:!
    fn: annotated examples showing syntax and semantics of each lu. 
    fn describes roles (frame elements) for each frame 
    fn frame hierarchy often provides better generalizations than wn synset hierarchy

propbank : framenet

    proposition bank (palmer et al. 2005 cl) began with labeling verbs and 

their arguments (and adjuncts) in wsj 

    uses penn pos tags, id32 parse structures 

    later added nouns and the roles from associated verbs 

    substantial work on chinese, korean, arabic, hindi, biomedical domain 

    ef   cient id14 systems available 

    no equivalent of frames: two levels of role labels:  

1. completely general, arg0-arg5, argm-time, argm-loc, etc. 

2. speci   c to lexical unit (word sense)

representation

(banarescu et al., law 2013)

a graph-based representation of lexical concepts and typed relations 
between those concepts that are denoted by an english sentence.

amr integrates several aspects of lexical/relational meaning   

abstracting away from the grammatical details   in a single structure 
designed to support rapid corpus annotation and data-driven nlp.

objectives: 
    to link a number of existing free lexical resources, both in-
house and external, both modern and historical,  into an 
integrated lexical macro-resource 

    to create a full-scale swedish framenet with at least 

50,000 lexical units and fully integrated into the macro-
resource 

    to develop methodologies and work   ows which make 

maximal use of lt tools and large text corpora in order to 
minimize the human effort needed in the work.
