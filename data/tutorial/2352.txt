outline (easy to hard)

    lexicographic annotation

    corpus extraction
    sentence selection
    labels
    diversity checking

    frame creation
    related frames
    fes
    lus

    crowd sourcing and automation(?)

 

 

background: what is fn?

    map from form to natural meanings

    lemma, in context, to frames (via lu and anno)
    particular gfs and pts to fes (via annotation)

    criteria for correct annotation and frame def.:

    same lu, same fe allows paraphrase
    common background assumptions across frame

    must be checked in real, corpus exx. 

 

 

corpus extraction

    too many examples of lu
    subselecting, keeping relevant diversity
    strategies (e.g. finding a direct object):

    wordsketch-based search:     obj
    rule-based search: t np:ground
    low-level grep-like search (cqp): 

@[lemma=   in   &pos=   in   ] []{0,4} [pos=   n.*   ];

 

 

annotation

    select a good sentence
    apply fe/gf/pt
    mark other contextual info:  supports, relative 

clauses, aspectual markers, metaphor...

    check that diversity is captured; iterate if not

    check against other lus of the frame
    check against intuition

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

frame creation

    initial brainstorming of wordlists

    our own brains
    thesauruses
    id138, propbank, etc.

    checking shared fes and entailments for lus

    imagined sentences
    initial corpus searches

    not confirmed until annotation complete!

 

 

example: color

    possible lus:

    what to include?
    wide net first, then find differences

    fes 

    example sentences?
    fe hypotheses
    test with all lus
    test against corpus for completeness

 

 

color lu brainstorming

    red, green, blue, black, white, yellow, purple, 

pink, brown, orange, gray

    puce, chartreuse
    burnt umber; cherry blossom pink?
    midnight?, forest?; dark blue?, light green?, 

greenish blue?

    reddened?, green-colored?

 

 

lu answers 1

    basic color terms are obviously in

    gray includes    grey    and    gray   

    other dedicated color terms included as they 

occur in the corpus
    puce
    burnt umber is a dedicated color word, found in the 

corpus 22 times, enough to be useful

       cherry blossom pink    isn   t found in bnc, and is 
compositional, from    pink    and    cherry blossom   

 

 

lu answers 2

    midnight? one unambiguous bnc ex., + a few maybes:

    the more i thought of that {midnight} face , the more intelligent and 
charming it became ; and it seemed too to have had a breeding , a 
fastidiousness , a delicacy , that attracted me as fatally as the local 
fishermen 's lamps attracted fish on moonless nights .

    he turned slightly in the seat , the light from a street-lamp gilding 
the carved tanned planes of his face , turning the thickness of his 
hair to {midnight} silk , so that despite herself fran felt a tiny ripple 
of appreciation for his male beauty .

    peter scott provides the geese tastefully disappearing into a 

background of {midnight} green .

    the rainbow tie showed up well against the {midnight} blue of the 

shirt .

 

 

lu answers 3

    compositional items not included
       dark blue   , etc., from    dark    +    blue   
       fire engine red    from    fire engine    +    red   

       reddened   , etc., from redden.v, belonging to a 

different frame, not in fn yet
    different relationship to time fe
    inherits from event, not state
       reddened           red    

 

 

fe brainstorming

    the entity that is colored: entity
    the color: color
    comparand:

    the green of a leaf; leaf green
    degree: very, somewhat, etc.
    color_qualifier: dark, bright, etc.

 

 

fes found in annotation

    attribute:

    red in color

    cause: 

    red with embarrassment

    subregion: 

    red in the face

    descriptor: 

    a beautiful red

    type: 
    red 5

 

 

can anno be done faster?

    automatic id14

    several systems, most recently semafor from cmu
    reasonable, but variable, performance
    dependent on hand annotation

    machine assisted

    tried pre-labeled annotation at fn, often worse than zero

    crowd-sourcing

    most recently, collaboration btw fn and google
    check it out at the law workshop workshop!

 

 

can frames be made faster?

    automation

    many efforts (e.g., borin et al. 2010)
    using other resources plus corpus (green & dorr 2004)
    using parallel corpora (pad   & lapata 2005)

    machine assistance

    tool under development at google under abhijit 

prahabal... stay tuned!

    crowd sourcing?

    no serious testing of this idea so far.

 

 

conclusion

    framenet frames capture natural categories
    we spend a lot of time making that happen

    annotation is a vital part of accurately making frames

    there are possibilities for speeding things up

    id104
    machine assisted creation
    machine created frames and annotation

    still large qualitative difference between hand-curated 

data and other sources

 

 

thanks!
