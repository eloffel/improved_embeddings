   (button) [1]ufldl tutorial

welcome to the deep learning tutorial!

   description: this tutorial will teach you the main ideas of
   unsupervised id171 and deep learning. by working through it,
   you will also get to implement several id171/deep learning
   algorithms, get to see them work for yourself, and learn how to
   apply/adapt these ideas to new problems.
   this tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of machine learning
   (specifically, familiarity with the ideas of supervised learning,
   id28, id119). if you are not familiar with
   these ideas, we suggest you go to this machine learning course and
   complete sections ii, iii, iv (up to id28) first.
