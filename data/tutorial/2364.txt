   a scientific computing framework for luajit
   [9]get started

what is torch?

   torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine
   learning algorithms that puts gpus first. it is easy to use and
   efficient, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language, luajit, and
   an underlying c/cuda implementation.

   a summary of core features:
     * a powerful n-dimensional array
     * lots of routines for indexing, slicing, transposing,    
     * amazing interface to c, via luajit
     * id202 routines
     * neural network, and energy-based models
     * numeric optimization routines
     * fast and efficient gpu support
     * embeddable, with ports to ios and android backends

why torch?

   the goal of torch is to have maximum flexibility and speed in building
   your scientific algorithms while making the process extremely simple.
   torch comes with a [10]large ecosystem of community-driven packages in
   machine learning, id161, signal processing, parallel
   processing, image, video, audio and networking among others, and builds
   on top of the lua community.

   at the heart of torch are the popular neural network and optimization
   libraries which are simple to use, while having maximum flexibility in
   implementing complex neural network topologies. you can build arbitrary
   graphs of neural networks, and parallelize them over cpus and gpus in
   an efficient manner.

using torch

   start with our [11]getting started guide to download and try torch
   yourself. torch is open-source, so you can also start with the code on
   the [12]github repo.

   torch is constantly evolving: it is already used within facebook,
   google, twitter, nyu, idiap, purdue and several other companies and
   research labs.
