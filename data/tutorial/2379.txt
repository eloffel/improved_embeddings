distributed

   dl4j takes advantage of the latest distributed computing frameworks
   including apache spark and hadoop to accelerate training. on
   multi-gpus, it is equal to caffe in performance.

open source

   the libraries are completely open-source, apache 2.0, and maintained by
   the developer community and skymind team.

jvm/python/c++

   deeplearning4j is written in java and is compatible with any jvm
   language, such as scala, clojure or kotlin. the underlying computations
   are written in c, c++ and cuda. keras will serve as the python api.

what is eclipse deeplearning4j?

   eclipse deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade, open-source,
   distributed deep-learning library written for java and scala.
   integrated with hadoop and apache spark, dl4j brings ai to business
   environments for use on distributed gpus and cpus.

what's included?

   deep neural nets are capable of record-breaking accuracy. for a quick
   neural net introduction, please visit our overview page. in a nutshell,
   deeplearning4j lets you compose deep neural nets from various shallow
   nets, each of which form a so-called `layer`. this flexibility lets you
   combine id5, sequence-to-sequence autoencoders,
   convolutional nets or recurrent nets as needed in a distributed,
   production-grade framework that works with spark and hadoop on top of
   distributed cpus or gpus.

   there are a lot of parameters to adjust when you're training a
   deep-learning network. we've done our best to explain them, so that
   deeplearning4j can serve as a diy tool for java, scala, clojure and
   kotlin programmers.
