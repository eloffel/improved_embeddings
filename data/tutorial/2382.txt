   features in machine learning, prediction, face recognition, image
   processing, id103 etc. check out where these apis are put
   into use!

   apis-logos

machine learning and prediction

     * [43]alchemyapi: offers artificial intelligence as a service. use in
       transforming unstructured data into structured especially in social
       media monitoring, business intelligence, content recommendations,
       financial trading and targeted advertising.
     * [44]alina: machine learning as an intelligence-as-a-service
       provider. a live mashup that consumes alina demonstrates the api's
       ability to use id107 and id158s to
       analyze historical bitcoin price fluctuations to predict and
       automate future trading.
     * [45]amazon machine learning: to find patterns in data. example uses
       of this api are applications for fraud detection, forecasting
       demand, targeted marketing, and click prediction
     * [46]bigml: bigml is a service for cloud-hosted machine learning and
       data analysis. users can set up a data source, create a dataset,
       create a model from the dataset, and then make predictions based on
       the data.
     * [47]ersatz : a web-based machine learning program that can automate
       recognition tasks that previously required human interaction. the
       ersatz platform can be used or model & data visualization, team
       collaboration, and gpu computing, all from within a browser.
     * [48]google prediction: brings the power of machine learning to
       anyone. upload your data and build a model to train the system by
       showing it the right answer for known items. when the system is
       trained, you can have it make predictions.
     * [49]guesswork: guesswork predicts customer intent accurately using
       a semantic rules engine that runs on top of the google prediction
       api.
     * [50]hutoma: ais are powered by a deep learning network and can be
       trained to understand specific topics by simply submitting a text
       file containing examples of conversations. creates & deploys siri
       like interfaces.
     * [51]ibm watson: select group of partner developers are exploring
       the cognitive capabilities or human-like capacity of watson in
       areas like image recognition, language processing and reasoning
       services. noted examples are "medical diagnostic apps" that read
       through millions of research papers and "ibm watson engagement
       advisor" a learning app to help veterans answer complex questions.
     * [52]ibm watson retrieve and rank: uses machine learning to enhance
       information retrieval by looking for "signals" in a given
       collection of data. developers can load their data into the
       service, use known relevant results to train a machine learning
       model
     * [53]imagga: an image recognition platform-as-a-service providing
       image tagging apis for developers & businesses to build scalable,
       image intensive cloud apps.
     * [54]indico: turns raw text and image data into human
       insights. the indico api is free to use, and no training data is
       required
     * [55]nupic : the nupic api allows developers to work with the raw
       algorithms, string together multiple regions (including
       hierarchies), and utilize other platform functions.
     * [56]predicsis: use predicsis to upload a dataset, create a
       dictionary of variables, and design your predictive model.
     * [57]predictionio: predictionio is an open-source machine learning
       server. example api methods include creating and managing users and
       user records, retrieving items and content, and creating and
       managing recommendations based on the user.
     * [58]predictions: provides long-range predictions for travel and
       hospitality. it is powered by algorithms that ingest big data,
       compare all destinations at once and identify where the best
       conditions for vacations, sports and activities are, anywhere in
       the world, with months in advance.
     * [59]rxnlp - cluster sentences and short texts: a id111 and
       natural language processing service.  one of rxnlp's api's, the
       clustersentences api, can group sentences (such as sentences from
       multiple news articles) or short texts (such as posts from twitter
       or facebook status updates) into logical groups.
     * [60]sightcorp f.a.c.e. : a web service which allows 3rd party
       applications to develop smarter and interactive applications using
       the face analysis technologies from sightcorp. the technology may
       be used to better understand user behavior and retrieve relevant
       face analytics like their age, gender, facial expressions, head
       pose or ethnicity.
     * [61]windows azure machine learning recommendations: the azure
       machine learning recommendations service provides solutions based
       on predictive analysis. by additionally offering data to consume,
       the api features models, catalogs, features, usage data, and
       notifications with the purpose to build machine learning solutions
       on the cloud.
     * [62]wise.io: helps developers to integrate handwritten digit
       recognition, spam filtration, political party affiliation
       recognition, and activity recognition with sensor data as mentioned
       in the examples of the website.
