   machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without
   being explicitly programmed. in the past decade, machine learning has
   given us self-driving cars, practical id103, effective web
   search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
   machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens
   of times a day without knowing it. many researchers also think it is
   the best way to make progress towards human-level ai. in this class,
   you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques,
   and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for
   yourself. more importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical
   underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed
   to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems.
   finally, you'll learn about some of silicon valley's best practices in
   innovation as it pertains to machine learning and ai. this course
   provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
   statistical pattern recognition. topics include: (i) supervised
   learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector
   machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) unsupervised learning
   (id91, id84, recommender systems, deep
   learning). (iii) best practices in machine learning (bias/variance
   theory; innovation process in machine learning and ai). the course will
   also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll
   also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots
   (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam),
   id161, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other
   areas.

neural networks: representation

   neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. it is
   widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and
   understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is
   helping to understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines
   that automatically read the digits also use neural networks. ...

   everything is taught from basics, which makes this course very
   accessible- still requires effort, however will leave you with real
   confidence and understanding of subjects covered. great teacher too..

   it's a good introduction - not too complicated and covers a wide range
   of topics. the programming exercises are well put together and
   significantly help understanding. the free matlab license is nice.
