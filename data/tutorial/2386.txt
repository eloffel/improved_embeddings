   open source is the heart of innovation and rapid evolution of
   technologies, these days. this article presents you top 20 python
   machine learning open source projects of 2016 along with very
   interesting insights and trends found during the analysis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [38]prasad pore.

   continuing analysis from last year: [39]top 20 python machine learning
   open source projects, this year kdnuggets bring you latest top 20
   python machine learning open source projects on github. strangely, some
   of the most active projects of last year have become stagnant and also
   some lost their position from top 20 (considering contributions and
   commits), whereas new 13 projects have entered into top 20.

       analysis (graph centrality and visualization).
       commits: 943, contributors: 20  , github url: [89]pattern

   we can see in the following chart that pymvpa has highest contribution
   rate compare to all top projects in the list. surprisingly,
   scikit-learn has low contribution rate, despite maximum no. of
   contributors compare to other projects. reason behind this could be
   that, as pymvpa is a new project and going through early phases of
   development, leading to many commits because of new ideas/features
   development, defect fixing, refactoring etc. whereas, scikit-learn is
   old and stable project leading to less no. of improvements or defect
   fixing.

   [90]python-top20-2016-commitspercontributor

   when we compare 2016 and 2015 projects which are part of both top 20
   list, we can see pattern, pybrain and pylearn2 have no major
   contribution as well as no new contributors. also, one prominent
   correlation can be seen in no. of contributors and no. of commits.
   increase in contributors may cause increase in commits and i think
   that   s the magic of open source projects and community; it leads to
   brainstorming, new ideas and better software tools.

   [91]python-top20-2016-comparison

   this was the analysis of top 20 python machine learning open source
   projects 2016, based on no. of. contributors and no. of commits, by
   kdnuggets team      prasad and gregory.

   happy open sourcing and knowledge sharing!
