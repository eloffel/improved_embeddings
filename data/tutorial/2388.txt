   machine learning apis make it easy for developers to develop predictive
   applications. here we review 5 important machine learning apis: ibm
   watson, microsoft azure machine learning, google prediction api, amazon
   machine learning api, and bigml.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by khushbu shah ([41]dezyre).

   big data is streaming into businesses all over the internet from
   various data sources like sensors, social media data, excel
   spreadsheets, reviews, customer data, etc. there are many companies
   like google, ibm, amazon, and microsoft helping businesses process big
   data by building machine learning apis so that organizations can make
   the best use of the machine learning technology.

   machine learning is the big frontier in big data innovation but it is
   daunting for people who are not tech geeks or data science domain
   experts.similar to how standard apis help developers create
   applications, machine learning apis make machine learning easy to use,
   for everyone. machine learning apis abstract the complexities involved
   in creating and deploying machine learning models so that developers
   can focus on data munging, user experience, design, experimenting and
   delivering insights from data.

   in the early days, machine learning algorithms and technologies were
   mostly used by scientists, tech geeks or domain experts. however,
   several organizations are now using machine learning apis to make these
   technologies available to the masses. machine learning apis make it
   easy for developers to apply machine learning to a dataset so as to add
   predictive features to their applications. machine learning apis
   provide an abstraction layer for developers to integrate machine
   learning in real world applications without having to worry about
   scaling the algorithms on their infrastructure and getting into the
   details of the machine learning algorithms. machine learning apis
   require developers to focus on the two important aspects-
     * developers can concentrate on querying predictions by integrating
       machine learning apis into their applications.
     * developers can track events on their applications to collect usage
       data.

   machine learning apis provide businesses with the ability to bring
   together predictive analytics so that they can get to know their
   customers better, understand their requirements and deliver products or
   services based on the past data trends, thereby initiating the selling
   process.there is an increasing percentage of real time consumer
   interactions through machine learning apis     making them an ideal
   option for exposing real time predictive analytics to app developers.

   application developers always look for various ways to ease the lives
   of their users by introducing novel and innovative features that can
   help users save time. this is the reason for the popularity of machine
   learning apis in app developers. some standard examples of these apis
   include smart tagging, product recommendations, priority filtering, and
   spam filtering.

   challenges associated with using machine learning apis

   machine-learning-api-challenges

   the most time consuming and important part of using machine learning
   apis is identifying the business problem that needs to be solved and
   building meaningful datasets. this implies-
     * machine learning practitioners have to ensure that they are clear
       on what they need to predict or classify. every problem cannot be
       solved with machine learning apis so it is important to decide on
       whether the scenario fits or not.
     * machine learning practitioners should gather as much data as they
       can around a given context devoid of making several assumptions.
       this is important because [42]data scientists or analysts will
       frequently find out unpredictable correlations between the input
       data and the column that they are trying to predict or classify
       i.e. the target value

   top machine learning apis for machine learning practitioners

   the latest trend in machine learning to be commoditized into a service
   which will develop into the mainstream as commoditized visualization
   and storage. here are some of the best machine learning apis that
   provide commoditized machine learning as a service (mlaas) to business
   analysts and developers for application integration-

   machine-learning-api

   1) ibm watson

   for machine learning practitioners who are crunching at the moment to
   use ibm watson   s machine intelligence service, within their mobile or
   web applications, need gnaw no longer. ibm watson api is a cognitive
   service that simplifies the process of preparing data and makes it
   easier to run predictive analysis. it also provides the usage of visual
   storytelling tools such as infographics, maps or graphs to exemplify
   analysis results. ibm watson is available for public use through ibm   s
   bluemix cloud services platform.

   ibm   s watson is listening, watching, talking and understanding with the
   expanded set of tools, machine learning technologies and cognitive apis
   to make itself more human. developers can create products, services or
   applications with more cognitive skills by embedding with ibm watson to
   understand how humans interact and react with their applications. ibm
   watson has evolved in just 2 years with more than 25 apis that are
   powered by approximately 50 technologies. some of the best services
   provided by ibm watson api for building cognitive apps    
     * machine translation-helps translate text in different language
       pairs.
     * message resonance    to find out the popularity of a phrase or word
       with predetermined audience.
     * question and answers-this service provides direct answers to the
       queries that are triggered by primary document sources.
     * user modelling    to make predictions about social characteristics of
       someone from given text.

   2) microsoft azure machine learning api

   azure machine learning api helps data scientists publish in minutes
   which once used to take days after they had developed a feasible model.
   azure machine learning makes it easy for data scientists to use
   predictive models in iot applications by providing apis for fraud
   detection, text analytics, id126s and several other
   business scenarios. the api is built on the machine learning abilities
   that are available in microsoft products like bing and xbox.

   azure machine learning api provides various features like    
     * ability to create a customized configurable r module so that data
       analysts or data scientists can incorporate their own[43] r
       language code to train or predict tasks.
     * azure allows data scientists or analysts to include their own
       [44]python scripts using various python libraries for data science
       like scipy, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, etc. popular tools like
       ipython notebook and various other python tools for visual studio
       can also be used with the azure machine learning api.

      we have added python, which is a big favourite of data scientists.
   there is a huge ecosystem for this. this capability will be powerful
   for data scientists. we made a lot of improvements and adding python
   was part of that. azure machine learning is the platform. you can copy
   a bit of python code and plug it into the studio and create an api.   -
   said joseph sirosh, corporate vice-president at microsoft
     * analysts or data scientists can train petabytes of data using one
       class id166 for anomaly detection or by using pca or    learning with
       counts   .
     * azure machine learning api also supports [45]spark and [46]hadoop
       for big data processing making it an ideal choice irrespective of
       the platform.
