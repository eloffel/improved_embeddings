automatically generate headlines to short articles

   [82]twitter followers

   this project attempts to reproduce the results in the paper:
   [83]generating news headlines with recurrent neural networks

how to run

software

     * the code is running with [84]jupyter notebook
     * install [85]keras
     * pip install python-levenshtein

data

   it is assumed that you already have training and test data. the data is
   made from many examples (i'm using 684k examples), each example is made
   from the text from the start of the article, which i call description
   (or desc), and the text of the original headline (or head). the texts
   should be already tokenized and the tokens separated by spaces.

   once you have the data ready save it in a python pickle file as a
   tuple: (heads, descs, keywords) were heads is a list of all the head
   strings, descs is a list of all the article strings in the same order
   and length as heads. i ignore the keywords information so you can place
   none.

build a vocabulary of words

   the [86]vocabulary-embedding notebook describes how a dictionary is
   built for the tokens and how an initial embedding matrix is built from
   [87]glove

train a model

   [88]train notebook describes how a model is trained on the data using
   [89]keras

use model to generate new headlines

   [90]predict generate headlines by the trained model and showes the
   attention weights used to pick words from the description. the text
   generation includes a feature which was not described in the original
   paper, it allows for words that are outside the training vocabulary to
   be copied from the description to the generated headline.
