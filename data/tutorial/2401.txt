   [68]carmel
   carmel is a finite-state transducer package written by jonathan graehl
   at usc/isi. carmel includes code for handling finite-state acceptors
   and transducers, weighted transitions, empty transitions on input and
   output, composition, k-most likely input/output strings, and both
   bayesian (id150) and em (forward-backward) training.

   [69]tiburon
   tiburon is a tree transducer package written by jonathan may at
   usc/isi. tiburon is designed to handle weighted regular tree grammars,
   context-free grammars, and both tree-to-tree and tree-to-string
   transducers, and can perform composition, intersection, application,
   determinization, inside/outside training, pruning, return k-most likely
   trees, viterbi derivations, and other useful things.

   [70]arx and phoebus: information extraction from unstructured and
   ungrammatical text on web
   the project presents two implementations for performing information
   extraction from unstructured, ungrammatical text on the web such as
   classified ads, auction listings, and forum posting titles. the arx
   system is an automatic approach to exploiting reference sets for this
   extraction. the phoebus system presents a machine learning approach
   exploiting reference sets.

   [71]bsl: a system for learning blocking schemes
   record linkage is the problem of determining the matches between two
   data sources. however, as data sources become larger and larger, this
   task becomes difficult and expensive. to aid in this process, blocking
   is the efficient generation of candidate matches which can then be
   examined in detail later to determine whether or not they are true
   matches. so, blocking is a preprocessing step to make record linkage a
   more scalable process.

   [72]eidos: efficiently inducing definitions for online sources
   the internet is full of information sources providing various types of
   data from weather forecasts to travel deals. these sources can be
   accessed via web-forms, web services or rss feeds. in order to make
   automated use of these sources, one needs to first model them
   semantically. writing semantic descriptions for web sources is both
   tedious and error prone.

   [73]digg 2009
   this anonymized data set consists of the voting records for 3553
   stories promoted to the front page over a period of a month in 2009.
   the voting record for each story contains id of the voter and time
   stamp of the vote. in addition, data about friendship links of voters
   was collected from digg.
