                         web search query log downloads

   query logs from real search engines are hard to find. here are ones
   that i've downloaded before without too much difficulty. keep in mind
   nearly all contain a license you need to agree upon before downloading,
   and are for non-commercial uses only.

english search engines

    1. [2]aol query logs (2006) [36m queries]: includes anonymized user
       ids and click data. the queries are unfiltered. if you're using
       this for a research publication, be aware that some reviewers will
       be unhappy about the controversy surrounding the release of these
       logs. [3][backup mirror]
    2. [4]msn query logs (2006 and 2007) [14m and 100m]: includes session
       ids (no user ids) and click data. you will have to ask for this
       dataset from microsoft (evelyne viegas or nick craswell are
       appropriate contacts).

non-english search engines

    1. [5]sogou query logs (2008) [44m]: queries from a chinese search
       engine. includes anonymized user ids and click data. porn and
       "illegal" queries are filtered out. also seems to filter out
       queries without clicks. to get this dataset, go to the link and
       download (link at the bottom); you will be asked to register, and
       then be provided an ftp link where you will need to prepend your
       username/password to get.
    2. [6]yandex query logs (2009) [341m]: from the most popular russian
       search engine. query text is anonymized as ids so it's not useful
       for any query processing. includes session ids and click data (but
       anonymized). commerical queries removed. to get this dataset, go to
       the link and register; you will be sent a download link.

   if you know of more resources, please let me know and i will add them
   to the list.
