   tags: [33]deep learning, [34]neural networks

   this post is a concise overview of a few of the more interesting
   popular deep learning models to have appeared over the past year. get
   up to speed and try a few of the models out for yourself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by jason toy, founder of [35]somatic.

   in the financial services industry, deep learning models are being used
   for "predictive analytics," which have helped improve forecasting,
   recommendations, and risk analysis. hr departments are using ai-based
   tools to help streamline the process of talent acquisition and
   management. facebook has just developed a bot store to help businesses
   take advantage of id70 that can act as customer service
   representatives for sales or with simple troubleshooting. as deep
   learning algorithms become increasingly prevalent across industries,
   deep learning models are also becoming more accessible to people
   outside of mathematics, engineering and robotics. we hope this showcase
   can inspire you to see what is possible.

neural talk


   neural talk is a vision-to language model that analyzes the contents of
   an image and outputs an english sentence describing what it    sees.    in
   the example above, we can see that the model was able to come up with a
   pretty accurate description of what    the don    is doing.

                               [36]neural talk
     computer sees: a man in a suit and tie standing in front of a wall

   this model was trained using pictures from flickr and captions that
   were generated by crowdsourcers on amazon   s mechanical turk. the model
   looks for related images in its training data and examines the captions
   to synthesize what is occurring in the input image. try the demo
   [37]here.

neural style


   if you have ever used instagram or snapchat, you are familiar with
   using filters that alter the brightness, saturation, contrast, and so
   on of your images. neural style, a deep learning algorithm, goes beyond
   filters and allows you to transpose the style of one image, perhaps van
   gogh   s    starry night,    and apply that style onto any other image. in
   the example above, we see the style of a pencil sketch applied to the
   selfie of a young man. you can play around with the demo [38]here.

                                    [39]
                                neural style

                       style + content = comicbook you

   neural style is one of the first id158s (anns) to
   provide an algorithm for the creation of artistic imagery. this
   exciting technology could be used as a valuable tool for creative
   professionals to test new ideas and concepts, saving a great deal of
   time and maximizing efficiency.

inception


   inception is a model that allows you to see what it looks like when a
   computer    dreams    (they seem to have a lot of nightmares!) the model   s
   hierarchy structure can be customized and flipped upside down so that
   the computer is    tricked    into believing that there are hundreds of a
   particular object inside of an image. then, the model enhances all of
   those objects in the image. the result looks something like a bad acid
   trip. play around with inception [40]here.

   bio: [41]jason toy is a serial entrepreneur and engineer, who founded
   socmetrics, truelens, and is the former ceo of filepicker and cto of
   backchannelmedia. he builds machine learning models, researches
   artificial intelligence, and starts companies. he is the founder of
   somatic.

   about: [42]somatic is a deep learning platform that aims to bring deep
   learning to the masses. they offer pretrained artificial intelligence
   models so that you can easily integrate them into your existing mobile
   apps, web applications, or anywhere else.
