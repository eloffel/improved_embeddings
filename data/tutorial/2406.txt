   an overview of 12 important machine learning concepts, presented in a
   no frills, straightforward definition style.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [40]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   there are many posts on kdnuggets covering the explanation of key terms
   and concepts in the areas of data science, machine learning, deep
   learning, big data, etc. (see [41]here, [42]here, and [43]here). in
   fact, it's one of the tasks that kdnuggets takes quite seriously:
   introducing and clarifying concepts in the minds of new and seasoned
   practitioners alike. in many of these posts, concepts and terminology
   are often expounded upon and fit into the big picture, sometimes miring
   down the key concept in exchange for defining some greater notion.

   this is the first in a series of such posts on kdnuggets which will
   offer concise explanations of a related set of terms (machine learning,
   in this case), specifically taking a no-frills approach for those
   looking to isolate and define. after some thought, it was determined
   that these foundational-yet-informative types of posts have not been
   given enough exposure in the past, with future iterations likely to
   include:
     * [44]deep learning
     * [45]natural language processing
     * [46]data mining and [47]data science
     * other interesting topics we can think of :)

   not enough information provided in these definitions for you? no
   worries, since each term listed links to related posts on kdnuggets for
   further investigation.

                                ml wordcloud

   so, let's start with a look at machine learning and related topics.

   1. [48]machine learning

   [49]according to mitchell, machine learning is "concerned with the
   question of how to construct computer programs that automatically
   improve with experience." machine learning is interdisciplinary in
   nature, and employs techniques from the fields of computer science,
   statistics, and artificial intelligence, among others. the main
   artefacts of machine learning research are algorithms which facilitate
   this automatic improvement from experience, algorithms which can be
   applied in such diverse fields as id161, artificial
   intelligence, and data mining.

   2. [50]classification

   classification is concerned with building models that separate data
   into distinct classes. these models are built by inputting a set of
   training data for which the classes are pre-labelled in order for the
   algorithm to learn from. the model is then used by inputting a
   different dataset for which the classes are withheld, allowing the
   model to predict their class membership based on what it has learned
   from the training set. well-known classification schemes include
   id90 and support vector machines. as this type of algorithm
   requires explicit class labelling, classification is a form of
   supervised learning.

   3. [51]regression

   regression is very closely related to classification. while
   classification is concerned with the prediction of discrete classes,
   regression is applied when the "class" to be predicted is made up of
   continuous numerical values. id75 is an example of a
   regression technique.

   4. [52]id91

   id91 is used for analyzing data which does not include
   pre-labeled classes, or even a class attribute at all. data instances
   are grouped together using the concept of "maximizing the intraclass
   similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity," as concisely
   described by [53]han, kamber & pei. this translates to the id91
   algorithm identifying and grouping instances which are very similar, as
   opposed to ungrouped instances which are much less-similar to one
   another. id116 id91 is perhaps the most well-known example of a
   id91 algorithm. as id91 does not require the pre-labeling
   of instance classes, it is a form of unsupervised learning, meaning
   that it learns by observation as opposed to learning by example.

                                  clusters

   5. [54]association

   association is most easily explained by introducing market basket
   analysis, a typical task for which it is well-known. market basket
   analysis attempts to identify associations between the various items
   that have been chosen by a particular shopper and placed in their
   market basket, be it real or virtual, and assigns support and
   confidence measures for comparison. the value of this lies in
   cross-marketing and customer behavior analysis. association is a
   generalization of market basket analysis, and is similar to
   classification except that any attribute can be predicted in
   association. apriori enjoys success as the most well-known example of
   an association algorithm. association is another example of
   unsupervised learning.
