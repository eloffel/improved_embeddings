   tags: [33]academics, [34]jurgen schmidhuber, [35]neural networks

   this post summarizes schmidhuber's now-classic (and still relevant) 35
   page summary of 900 deep learning papers, giving an overview of the
   state of deep learning as of 2014. a great introduction to a great
   paper!

   [37]deep learning in neural networks: an overview     schmidhuber 2014

   what a wonderful treasure trove this paper is! schmidhuber provides all
   the background you need to gain an overview of deep learning (as of
   2014) and how we got there through the preceding decades.

     starting from recent dl results, i tried to trace back the origins
     of relevant ideas through the past half century and beyond.

   the main part of the paper runs to 35 pages, and then there are 53
   pages of references. as a rough guess, that   s somewhere around 900
   referenced works. now, i know that many of you think i read a lot of
   papers     just over 200 a year on this blog     but if i did nothing but
   review these key works in the development of deep learning it would
   take me about 4.5 years to get through them at that rate! and when i   d
   finished i   d still be about 6 years behind the then current state of
   the art! my guess is most of you would like a little more variety in
   the subject matter than that too :) . it   s a good reminder of how vast
   the cs body of knowledge is that we   ve built up over the last
   half-century and more.

   i shall now attempt to condense a 35-page summary of 900 papers into a
   single blog post! needless to say, there   s a lot more detail in the
   full paper and references than i can cover here. we   ll look at the
   following topics: credit assignment paths and the question of how deep
   is deep?; key themes of deep learning; highlights in the development of
   supervised and unsupervised learning methods, id23;
   and a short look at where things might be heading.

   neural network layers

   how deep is deep?

   we don   t know, but    10    is very deep   

     which modifiable components of a learning system are responsible for
     its success or failure? what changes to them help improve
     performance? this has been called the fundamental credit assignment
     problem (minsky, 1963)   . the present survey will focus on the
     narrower, but now commercially important, subfield of deep learning
     (dl) in id158s (nns)    learning or credit
     assignment is about finding weights that make the nn exhibit desired
     behaviour     such as driving a car. depending on the problem and how
     the neurons are connected, such behaviour may require long causal
     chains of computational stages, where each stage transforms (often
     in a non-linear way) the aggregate activation of the network. deep
     learning is about accurately assigning credit across many such
     stages.

   feedforward neural networks (fnns) are acyclic, recurrent neural
   networks (id56s) are cyclic.    in a sense, id56s are the deepest of all
   nns    in principle they can create and process memories of arbitrary
   sequences of input patterns.

     to measure whether credit assignment in a given nn application is of
     the deep or shallow type, i introduce the concept of credit
     assignment paths or caps, which are chains of possibly causal links
     between events    e.g. from input through hidden to output layers in
     fnns, or through transformations over time in id56s.

   if a credit assignment path (a path through the graph starting with an
   input) is of the form (   , k, t,    , q), where k and t are the first
   successive elements withmodifiable weights (it   s possible that t = q),
   then the length of the suffix list t   q is the path   s depth.

     this depth limits how far backwards credit assignment can move down
     the causal chain to find a modifiable weight    the depth of the
     deepest cap within an event sequence is called the solution depth   
     given some fixed nn topology, the smallest depth of anysolution is
     called the problem depth. sometimes we also speak of the depth of an
     architecture: supervised learning fnns with fixed topology imply a
     problem-independent maximal problem depth bounded by the number of
     non-input layers    in general, id56s may learn to solve problems of
     potenitally unlimited depth.

   so where does shallow learning end, and_deep learning_ begin?
      discussions with dl experts have not yet yielded a conclusive response
   to this question!   

     instead of committing myself to a precise answer, let me just define
     for the purposes of this overview: problems of depth > 10
     require very deep learning.

   key themes

   several themes recur across the different types of deep learning:
     * id145 can help to facilitate credit assignment. in
       supervised learning id26 itself can be viewed as a
       id145-derived method. id145 can also
       help to reduce problem depth in traditional id23,
       and id145 algorithms are essential for systems that
       combine concepts of nns ad id114, such as hidden markov
       models (id48s).
     * unsupervised learning can facilitate both supervised and
       id23 by first encoding essential features of
       inputs in a way that describes the original data in a less
       redundant or more compact way. these codes become the new inputs
       for supervised or id23.
     * many methods learn hierarchies of more and more abstract data
       representations     continuously learning concepts by combining
       previously learnt concepts.
     *    in the nn case, the minimum description length principle suggest
       that a low nn weight complexity corresponds to high nn id203
       in the bayesian view, and to high generalization performance,
       without overfitting the training data. many methods have been
       proposed for regularizing nns, that is, searching for
       solution-computing but simple, low-complexity supervised learning
       nns.   
     * gpus! gpus excel at the fast matrix and vector multiplications
       required for nn training, where they can speed up learning by a
       factor of 50 and more.
