   want to make a career change to data science using python? well
   learning anything on your own can be a challenge & a little guidance
   could be a great help, that is exactly what this article will provide
   you with.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [37]martijn theuwissen, datacamp.

   python is widely used for data analysis and you might have considered
   learning it yourself (if not, or if you   re still looking for that bit
   of extra motivation to get started, see why you should be learning
   python below). of course, learning on your own can be a challenge and
   some guidance is always helpful. guidance to learn python for working
   with data is exactly what this article will provide you with.

   we will discuss steps you should take for learning python accompanied
   with some essential resources, such as the free [38]python for data
   analysis courses and tutorials from datacamp as well as reading and
   learning materials.

   step 0: reasons to learn python

   why learn python as a data analytics tool?
     * it   s a popular data analysis tool: firstly, by itself python is one
       of the most [39]popular tools for data analysis. with 35% of data
       scientists using python, it is ahead of sql and sas, and behind
       only r.
     * general purpose programming: despite there being other very popular
       and great computing tools used for analyzing data (e.g. r, sas),
       python is the only true general purpose programming language. check
       out this [40]infographic for a more thorough comparison.
     * popular programming language: in addition, python is one the
       [41]most popular programming languages, when compared with other
       general purpose languages (e.g. java, c++, php).
     * if that   s not enough, python is also the [42]language of choice for
       teaching computer science in top u.s. universities.

   as a side note: as described in [43]   r or python? consider learning
   both    we don   t recommend that you only learn python and forget about
   the rest. however, learning python is one of the best things you can do
   for your career. there are good reasons why python is being adopted so
   widely by computer scientists, and why it   s a data analysis tool of
   choice for so many, the main one being the ease of learning and using
   python. nonetheless, it can be challenging to set a learning path, so
   that   s what we will do now.

   python

   step 1: setting up your python environment for data analysis
     * download python from continuum analytics: [44]anaconda
     * optional (download rodeo from yhat): [45]rodeo ide

   setting up your python environment for performing data analysis is
   relatively simple. the most convenient way to go about this is to
   download the free [46]anaconda package from continuum analytics, as it
   contains the core python language, as well as all of the essential
   libraries including numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and ipython. by
   using the graphical installer, downloading python is as easy as
   downloading any computer program.

   after installing, you will get a launcher containing a number of
   programs. the most important one is the ipython notebook, which is also
   called [47]jupyter notebook. once  you launch the notebook, the
   terminal is opened and a notebook is opened in your browser. don   t get
   confused here! you don   t need internet connection to create or use the
   notebooks. simply, the browser is used instead of a separate program
   and serves as your environment,where you can code.

   however, you are not limited to using the browser based jupyter
   notebooks. if you prefer an ide, a great option for data analysis is
   [48]rodeo from yhat. if you are familiar with [49]rstudio for r, rodeo
   is something very similar for python. be sure to try out both
   alternatives, as, ultimately, the python environment you use will
   depend on your personal preference.

   step 2: learning the basics and fundamentals

   now you are ready to begin learning to code with python. there are a
   couple of good ways to go about this. given your interest to learn
   python for data analysis, your best option is the [50]introduction for
   python for data science from datacamp. this free course consist of
   video tutorials and interactive in browser exercises and is a great way
   to learn by doing, as opposed to simply reading concepts and looking at
   examples. you wouldn   t begin learning how to paint by reading a book
   about it. you would pick up a brush and start painting. that   s the way
   we would suggest for you to start learning python! in addition to the
   introductory course, datacamp offers an[51] intermediate python for
   data science course which takes you even further.

   another quite useful resource is the python course from [52]codecademy.
   while this course is not about data, but rather programming with
   python, it is a great way to both practice with python syntax and gain
   exposure to programming concepts that will be useful to you when
   working with data.

   step 3: python packages for data analysis

   python is a general purpose language and is often used for things other
   than data analysis and data science. what makes python extremely useful
   for working with data, however, are the libraries that give users the
   necessary functionality. below are the major python libraries that are
   used for working with data. you should take some time to familiarize
   yourself with the basic purposes of these packages.
     * [53]numpy and [54]scipy     fundamental scientific computing.
     * [55]pandas     data manipulation and analysis.
     * [56]matplotlib     plotting and visualization.
     * [57]scikit-learn     machine learning and data mining.
     * [58]statsmodels     statistical modeling, testing, and analysis.
