   a pocket guide overview of how to get started doing data science, with
   a focus on the practical, and with concrete steps to take to get moving
   right away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [36]brandon rohrer, facebook.

   in a previous post i advised data scientists in training to [37]build
   stuff. this post gets more specific. here's what i mean when i say i'm
   doing data science.

   data science flow circle

                              1. get more data

   the raw stuff of data science is a collection of numbers and names.
   measurements, prices, dates, times, products, titles,
   actions   everything is fair game. you can use images, text, audio, video
   and other complex data too, as long as you have a way to reduce it to
   numbers and names.

   the mechanics of getting data can be quite complex. data engineers are
   ninjas. but this guide is focused on the data science, so i   ll leave
   that topic for another time.

                           2. ask a sharp question

   data science is the process of using names and numbers to answer a
   question. the more precisely you ask your question the better chance
   you have of finding an answer you are satisfied with. when choosing
   your question, imagine that you are approaching an oracle that can tell
   you anything in the universe, as long as the answer is a number or a
   name. it   s a mischievous oracle, and its answer will be as vague and
   confusing as it can get away with. you want to pin it down with a
   question so airtight that the oracle can   t help but tell you what you
   want to know. examples of poor questions are    what can my data tell me
   about my business?   ,    what should i do?    or    how can i increase my
   profits?    these leave wiggle room for useless answers. in contrast,
   clear answers to questions like    how many model q gizmos will i sell in
   montreal during the third quarter?    or    which car in my fleet is going
   to fail first?    are impossible to avoid.

   now that you have a question, check to see whether you have examples of
   the answer in your data. if your question is    what will my stock   s sale
   price be next week?    then make sure your data includes your stock   s
   price history. if your question is    how many hours until a model 88
   aircraft engine fails?    then make sure your data includes failure times
   of several model 88 engines. these examples of answers are called your
   target. your target is the quantity or category that you want to
   predict or assign in the future. if you don   t have any target data, go
   back to step 1 and get more data. you won   t be able to answer your
   question without it.

   a very useful table

                         3. put the data in a table

   most machine learning algorithms assume your data is in a table. each
   row is one event or item or instance. each column is one feature or
   attribute of all those rows. a data set describing american football
   might have each row represent a game with columns for home_team,
   visiting_team, home_team   s_score, visiting_team   s_score, date,
   start_time, attendance and so on. the columns can be arbitrarily
   detailed and there can be as many as you like. the football data set
   could even include a column as detailed as
   yards_rushed_by_the_home_team_during_the_final_two_minutes
   _of_the_first_half.

   choose your rows

   there are lots of ways to break a data set into rows, but only one way
   will help you answer your question: each row needs to have one and only
   one instance of your target. consider data gathered from a retail
   store. it could be condensed to one transaction per row, one day per
   row, one store per row, one customer per row, and many other row
   representations. if your question is    will a customer return for a
   second visit?    then one customer per row is the right way for you to
   organize it. your target, whether_the_customer_returned, applies once
   and only once to each individual and will be present on each row. that
   wouldn   t happen if there were one store per row or one day per row. if
   you end up with a single target column across all your rows, then you
   know you chose the right row representation.

   you may have to roll some data up to get it to fit. for instance, if
   your question is    how many lattes will i sell per day?    then you   ll
   want one day per row in your table, with a target column of
   number_of_lattes_sold. but your data may be recorded as a list of latte
   sales transaction with the time and date of each. in order to fit this
   into a one-day-per-row format, it is first necessary to roll up the
   data, that is, to combine a bunch of measurements into a single one. in
   this case, it means counting up the number of lattes sold on each date.
   other information, such as the time each latte was sold, is lost in
   this process, but that   s ok. that data wasn   t going to help you answer
   your question.

                            4. check for quality

   inspection

   the next step is to take a careful walk through the data. this has two
   purposes. the first is to spot any poor data and fix or remove it. the
   other is to become intimately familiar with each row and column. you
   cannot skip this step and expect to get the most out of your data. if
   you show your data love, it will love you back.

   look at just one column of data. what is it labeled? do the values fit
   the label? does the label mean anything to you? is there documentation
   on what the column means? on how it was measured? on who measured it?
   if you   re lucky enough to know the person who recorded it, take them
   out for a donut and ask them how they measured it. ask them for funny
   stories about what went wrong. your investment in pastry will be repaid
   many times over.

   now plot the column as a histogram. does the distribution fit what you
   know about the feature? are there an unusual number of outliers? do the
   outliers make physical sense? if you are looking at longitude of
   agricultural plots, do some of them lie in the pacific ocean? if you
   are looking at test scores, is there a cluster at one percent? ten
   thousand percent? use everything you know about where the data came
   from and subject the values to a sniff test. if they seem a little off
   in any way, find out why.

   correction

   while walking through the columns, you may find that the labels and
   documentation were misleading or incorrect. make sure to write down
   what you learned about them. at this point you probably know the data
   better than anyone except the person that recorded it. share your
   knowledge.

   you may also find that some of the values are just wrong. the value may
   be outside the range of possibilities, such as a person 72 meters tall,
   or it might be highly unlikely, like an address of    7777777777 main
   st   . when this occurs, you have three choices. you can try to correct
   the value, if the correction seems obvious (for instance, converting 72
   meters of height to 72 inches). if the correction isn   t obvious, you
   can delete the value and leave it as missing. alternatively, if the
   value is a critical piece of information, you can remove the entire row
   or column. this will keep you from training a model on erroneous data.
   wrong data is far more damaging than missing data.

   there can be a temptation here to remove values or rows that are
   undesirable. they might be surprising or may not support your favorite
   theory. don   t do this. it   s unethical and, worse, it will get you the
   wrong answer.

   replacing missing values

   in almost every data set there are missing values. sometimes they were
   found to be erroneous and deleted. sometimes you start measuring a new
   variable halfway through the experiment. sometimes the data came from
   different sources that measured different things. whatever the case,
   most machine learning algorithms either require that data have no
   missing values, or else they fill in any missing values in a na  ve way.
   you can do better than them, because you understand your data.

   there are lots of methods for replacing missing values. if you   d like
   to see a sampling check out [38]this azure machine learning experiment.
   the bottom line is that the best thing to do will depend on what each
   column means and what it means when one of those values is missing. it
   will be a little different for every data set.

   after you   ve replaced all your missing values, your data is
      connected   . every data point has a value for every feature. it is
   clean and ready to go to work on. occasionally you may discover that
   after cleaning, you have little or no data left. this is a good thing.
   you just saved yourself the pain of building a model with bad data,
   getting a wrong result, getting laughed at by your customers and
   disgruntling your boss. go back to step 1 and get more data.
