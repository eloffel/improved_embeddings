   my very-high level overview of deep learning for delta sky magazine,
   including neurons, a conspiracy, games, amazing feats of superhuman
   ability, and more - appropriate for reading at 30,000 feet.

   if you fly in april on delta, be sure to check [36]delta sky magazine
   for an article on deep learning!
   i was recently contacted by joseph flaherty, a writer, who asked me for
   a brief overview of deep learning. here is his article, which quotes me
   a few times, published in delta sky magazine april 2016 issue, on pages
   [37]52, [38]54, and [39]56.
   delta sky april 2016
   see below a really high-level overview i wrote, appropriate for reading
   at 30,000 feet.

deep learning from 30,000 feet

   deep learning is probably the most important technical development
   since the invention of the web in 1990s.
   it was partly inspired by the way the brain works - some of the deep
   learning pioneers like geoff hinton have studied and sought to emulate
   brain processes. however, just like the airplane flight was inspired by
   birds, but flies very differently, so deep learning works quite
   differently from the brain.
   id26 neural network
   deep learning uses multiple layers of neural networks, where each layer
   has many artificial "neurons" - simple units that have many inputs and
   one output. neural networks learns from experience - they take inputs,
   combine it inside neurons with different weights, and give outputs,
   which can go to the next layer to be final output, for example, yes/no,
   dog/cat, or how to move your character in a video game.
   neural networks learn by id26 - the output they generate is
   compared to correct one, and errors are propagated back to change the
   weights so that next time the same inputs give output closer to correct
   one.
   neural network methods have been tried back in 1960s, but one-layer
   methods were limited in their ability, and multiple-layer methods took
   so long to train that they were considered impractical. work on neural
   networks was very unfashionable for many years, and in 2000s was mainly
   sustained by 3 researchers: [40]geoff hinton in toronto, [41]yann lecun
   at bell labs, and [42]yoshua bengio in montreal.
   their work was mainly supported by canadian government. they called
   themselves a "canadian conspiracy" and introduced a term "deep
   learning" to get away from unfashionable "neural networks."
   the big breakthrough in deep learning happened around 2012, powered by
   very large datasets, very powerful processors (mainly gpus), and some
   very clever algorithms, dl methods started to win image recognition and
   machine learning competitions, and then started to approach and in many
   cases exceed human performance levels in many areas, for example
     * image recognition (dl is used to scan every image uploaded to
       facebook for face and object recognition),
     * automatic id134, see image below
     * id103 (google now, siri, baidu). if you spoke to your
       smartphone recently, you probably noticed the very high quality of
       id103
     * machine translation - just try google translate or amazing
       real-time speech translation in skype
     * games: deepmind exceeded human-level in many atari video games,
       defeated a european go champion in 2015 and in march 2016 google
       alphago program defeated a world champion in go.

   deep learning: woman in white dress with tennis racket
   deep learning methods automatically generated a caption for this image:
   woman in white dress standing with tennis racket; two people in green
   behind her
   more than that, dl also highlights areas on the screen corresponding to
   words.
   see more amazing examples at
   [43]cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/
   here is another example of dl success.
   atari breakout this screenshot, taken from google deepmind program that
   played atari breakout shows where the magic happened:
   [44]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1eynij0rnk
   the program discovered an optimal strategy of digging a "tunnel"
   through the wall.
   one difference with human learning is that humans can learn from few or
   just one example.
   deep learning methods currently require a lot of data (think of
   billions of images that were used to obtain image caption above), but
   researchers are working on methods for integrating real-world knowledge
   and for transferring learning from one domain to another.
   stay tuned for more progress!
