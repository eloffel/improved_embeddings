   with the rise of neural network in data science, the demand for
   computationally extensive machines lead to gpus. learn how you can get
   started with gpus & algorithms which could leverage them.

basics of gpu computing for data scientists

   gpu   s have become the new core for image analytics. more and more data
   scientists are looking into using gpu for image processing. in this
   article i review the basics of gpu   s that are needed for a data
   scientist and list a frame work discussed in [39]literature for
   suitability of gpu for an algorithm.

lets start with what is a gpu?

   graphics processing unit (gpu) were originally created for rendering
   graphics. however due to their high performance and low cost they have
   become the new standard of image processing. their application areas
   include image restoration, segmentation (labeling), de-noising,
   filtering, interpolation and reconstruction. a web search on what is a
   gpu would result to :    a graphics processing unit (gpu) is a computer
   chip that performs rapid mathematical calculations, primarily for the
   purpose of rendering images.   

what is gpu computing?

   [40]nvidia   s blog defines gpu computing is the use of a graphics
   processing unit (gpu) together with a cpu to accelerate scientific,
   analytics, engineering, consumer, and enterprise applications. [41]they
   also say if cpu is the brain then gpu is soul of the computer.

   gpu   s used for general-purpose computations have a highly data parallel
   architecture. they are composed of a number of cores. each of these
   cores have a number of functional units, such as arithmetic and logic
   units (alus) etc. one or more of these functional units are used to
   process each thread of execution. these group of functional units that
   help the thread are called    thread processors   . all thread processors
   in a core of gpu perform the same instructions, as they share the same
   control unit. this means that gpus can perform the same instruction on
   each pixel of an image in parallel. gpu architectures are complex and
   differ from manufacture to manufacture. the two main players in gpu
   market are nvidia and amd. nvidia calls thread processors as cuda
   (compute unified device architecture) cores, amd calls them as stream
   processors (sp) .

   the main difference between a thread processor and a cpu core is that
   each cpu core can perform different instructions on different data in
   parallel because each cpu core has separate control unit.
   [42]researchers have defined core as a processing unit with an
   independent flow of control. based on this definition, [43]scientists
   are referring to a group of thread processors that share the same
   control unit as cores. gpu   s are constructed to fit many thread
   processors on a chip while cpu   s are focused on advanced control units
   and large caches.

   there are 2 main frameworks for gpu programming         [44]opencl and cuda.
   cuda programming language can be used with nvidia only where as opencl
   is an open standard for parallel computing on different devices
   including gpus, cpus and fpgas. there are a few image processing
   libraries that provide gpu implementation         opencv,arrayfire, nvidia
   performance primities (npp), cuvlib, intel integrated performance
   primitivies, opencl integrated performance primitives and the insight
   took kit (itk). out of these the larger ones are opencv (supports cuda
   and opencl) and itk (supports only opencl).

algorithm suitability for gpu usage

   [45]erik smistad et.al. discuss 5 factors that define the suitability
   of an algorithm towards a gpu implementation. these are         data
   parallelism, thread count, branch divergence, memory usage and
   synchronization. i have created this mapping table for easy reference
   using the framework.

   ng   >gpu suitability decision for your algorithm

   as a data scientist knowing this will help you selecting the
   suitability of gpu for your algorithm. nvidia cuda is more popular
   since most apple laptops have them but others are getting steam as
   well. let me know if you have questions and comments.
