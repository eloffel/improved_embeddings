   an in-depth, informative overview of tree kernels, both theoretical and
   practical. includes a use case and some code after the discussion.

   a network or graph is a type of structured data in the form of nodes,
   with relationships between them described by links, or edges. nodes and
   edges in a graph may have several attributes that may be numerical or
   categorical, or even more complex.

   today, a massive amount of data is available in the form of networks or
   graphs. for example, the world wide web, with its web pages and
   hyperlinks, social networks, semantic networks, biological networks,
   id191 for scientific literature, and so on.

   a tree is a special type of graph, and is naturally suited to represent
   many types of data. the analysis of trees is an important field in
   computer and data science. in this article, we will look at the
   analysis of the link structure in trees. in particular, we will focus
   on tree kernels, a method for comparing tree graphs to each other,
   allowing us to get quantifiable measurements of their similarities or
   differences. this an important process for many modern applications
   such as [36]classification and [37]data analysis.

   building a graph

   unsupervised classification of structured data

   classification is an important component [38]machine learning and
   [39]data analysis. in general, classification can either be supervised
   or unsupervised. in supervised classification, the classes are already
   known, and a classification model is constructed from training data in
   which the correct classes are already given. unsupervised
   classification, by contrast, attempts to identify classes where none
   are known, grouping data into categories based on some measure of their
   similarity.

   unsupervised classification can be combined with id207 to
   identify groups of similar tree networks. tree data structures are
   employed to model objects from several domains. in natural language
   processing (nlp), for example, parse trees are modelled as ordered,
   labelled trees. in automated reasoning, many problems are solved by
   searching, where the search space is represented as a tree whose
   vertices are associated with search states, and edges represent
   id136 steps. also, [40]semistructured data, such as html and xml
   documents, can be modelled as ordered, labelled trees.

   these domains can be usefully analysed through unsupervised
   classification techniques. in nlp, classification can be used to
   automatically group a set of sentences into questions, commands, and
   statements. likewise, groups of similar websites can be identified by
   applying classification methods to their html source. in each of these
   cases, all we need is a way to measure how    similar    two trees are to
   each other.

   the curse of dimensionality

   most classification algorithms require that data be transformed into a
   [41]vectorized form, representing the values of the data   s features in
   the feature space, so that the data can by analyzed in the feature
   space using id202. in structured or semistructured data, like
   trees, the dimensionality of the resultant vectors (that is, the number
   of features in the feature space) might be quite high, since the
   feature space must preserve information about the structure.

   this may be a significant drawback, considering that many
   classification techniques are not able to scale effectively with the
   dimensionality of the input. in other words, their classification power
   decreases with an increase in the dimensionality of the input. this
   problem is known as the [42]curse of dimensionality.

   to get an idea of the reason for this degradation of performance,
   consider a space x of dimension d. suppose that x contains a set of
   points uniformly distributed. if the number of dimensions of x
   increases, the number of points necessary to keep the same density must
   increase exponentially. in other words, the more the dimensions of the
   input, the more likely that that data is sparse. in general, a sparse
   dataset does not give enough information to build a good classifier
   because correlations between data elements are too weak for algorithms
   to detect.

   curse of dimensionality
   each feature space above contains eight data points. on the
   one-dimensional space, it   s easy to identify a group of five points on
   the left, and three on the right. stretching these points over higher
   numbers of features (i.e. dimensions) makes it more difficult to find
   these groups. in real applications, feature spaces can easily have
   hundreds of dimensions.

   a vectorized representation for structured data is appropriate when
   information about the domain can be effectively used to select a
   manageable set of features. when such information is not available,
   it   s desirable to make use of techniques that can handle structured
   data directly, without performing operations in the vector space.
