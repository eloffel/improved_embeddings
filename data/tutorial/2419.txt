   we have made tremendous progress in the field of data analysis and on
   the other, our technology is getting smart. ibm has taken a solid
   stride in the direction of artificial intelligence by unveiling its
   supercomputer ibm watson, learn what it can do, its adopters and what
   it holds for the future.

   by khushbu shah, [37]dezyre

   artificial intelligence (ai) has intrigued us for decades and with each
   passing year, we are getting closer than ever to getting that one
   machine that can interact like humans. on one hand, we have made
   tremendous progress in the field of data analysis and on the other, our
   technology is getting smart enough to recognize our questions and
   respond in the language in which we ask questions.

   [38]artificial intelligence is a complex field which requires
   unprecedented coordination between analytics, machine learning, neural
   networks, id103 and big data     to name a few. modern
   smartphone operating systems come loaded with speech based virtual
   assistants that demonstrate ai at an elementary stage by supporting
   voice search and talking back the results to us in mechanized english.
   while that seems good enough for the time being, there is still a lot
   of work to be done.

   ibm has always been at the forefront of innovation. it has taken a
   solid stride in the direction of artificial intelligence by unveiling
   its supercomputer ibm watson (named after ibm founder thomas j.
   watson).

what is ibm watson?

   it is a    id53 (qa)    machine (occupying space that is
   sufficient to house 10 refrigerators). ibm watson has the ability to
   scan through huge data volumes to    learn    about the subject and then
   interpret and answer questions just as humans would. it aims to
   replicate (or even surpass) an intelligent human being   s ability to
   understand questions and provide answers.

   for those who are into numbers, ibm watson has the processing power of
   80 teraflops, i.e. trillion floating point operations per second. to be
   able to understand, analyze and answer questions like a high
   functioning human brain, watson digs through over 200 million pages of
   information spread across 90 servers. this data is then run through six
   million logic rules to come up with relevant answers.

                           ibm-watson-applications

what separates ibm watson from a search engine?

   search engines often spit out mechanical responses to questions. they
   don   t have the ability to interpret the order in which words appear in
   a sentence. they look out for the searched phrase and provide answers
   without considering the    context    in which that phrase appears. what
   this means is once watson is properly trained, putting queries to it
   would be like talking to an actual human being that has the cognizance
   to respond in the context rather than mechanically showing results.

ibm watson applications

   it was in 2011 when watson proved its claims of cognitive computing by
   competing on jeopardy! against former winners brad rutter and ken
   jennings. it ended up winning the $1 million first prize. through this
   competition, the research team led by principal investigator david
   ferrucci was able to establish the changing face of artificial
   intelligence. about four years later, watson   s computing power has been
   effectively channeled by various sectors of industry to solve real life
   problems. in this section we list out the sectors that have
   successfully employed ibm watson   s cognitive processing capabilities.

usaa: helping military members transition to civilian life

   u.s. bureau of labor statistics states that about 155,000 military
   members transition to civilian life each year. during the process, they
   have a number of questions related to veteran   s compensation benefits,
   post-9/11 gi bill, etc. relevant information is scattered across
   hundreds of thousands of document pages. ibm watson has consumed the
   knowledge that is documented in over 3,000 documents on topics
   specifically related to military transitions, which empowers it to
   satisfactorily answer the queries of military members. as a knowledge
   base of 3000+ documents would require hundreds of human beings to read
   through and then organize their observations, before framing the
   answers, the cost saving achieved by ibm watson can very well be
   imagined.

anz global wealth

   financial sector has huge collection of specific numbers and processing
   them correctly to generate the best financial planning advice is
   critical to business success. more than 400 financial planners of anz
   global wealth (the private banking arm of australia and new zealand
   global banking group) use ibm watson engagement advisor to help them
   improve the financial advice process. it aims to reduce the times it
   takes customers to receive an advice statement from several days to
   just one session.

md anderson cancer center

   the university of texas, md anderson cancer center has on-boarded ibm
   watson in its mission to fight cancer. on the prescription side,
   oncology expert advisor is able to channel watson   s cognitive computing
   power to integrate the vast knowledge base of md anderson   s
   researchers. on the other hand, it plays a key role in collecting and
   analyzing huge amount of unstructured data pertaining to patients   
   medical history. once these two are linked, clinicians get valuable
   information which would have either taken them long time to gather or
   might have gotten skipped.

what does the future hold for ibm watson?

   as mentioned, watson   s application spans many industries. if your
   business requires consuming large amount of data, learning from it and
   producing advice beyond number crunching, here is how you can
   drastically reduce the cycle time for the entire process:

ibm watson will make your travel plans stress free.

   there is no dearth of websites that help you discover the    best price   
   for your travel tickets. in a competition to be the    fastest    online
   portal/app to get you this information, businesses often forget the
   human aspect of travel, which is to create experience for a lifetime.
   watson is capable of consuming travel related documentation from around
   the world, analyze it and get ready with specific answers to questions
   like,    where do i go for a romantic beach vacation with my wife in
   april?    while answering this question, watson takes into account the
   fact that all beach destinations are not romantic and the have
   different    best months to travel   .  a customer would not have the time
   to scan thousands of reviews and then make up his mind. imagine the
   efficiency a travel website could attain with watson in this situation,
   when the query gets answered in plain english in a matter of seconds!

ibm watson is set to make shopping easier.

   imagine walking into a shop for buying stuff related to camping. what
   we usually do is to look up the internet, ask friends and prepare a
   list of goods we would need and then buy them. what if there was a
   supercomputer you could simply ask all this and it would return you a
   comprehensive list with additional information about weather, best time
   and places to camp at and information about other things to do in the
   neighborhood? ibm watson   s development platform is being used by fluid
   inc. to disrupt the buying experience of shoppers by doing something
   very similar.

ibm watson to make cooking, a master chef experience for you.

   watson is capable of learning anything and it is not restricted to
   hypothesis, events and technology. its creativity can be harnessed in
   creating novel recipes. as would be the case in any other application,
   it needs to be trained in cooking. once a large enough knowledge base
   has been built, it can be called upon at any time to deliver recipes
   suited to the user   s needs. once sufficient amount of training has been
   imparted, a user can [40]ask watson

   to suggest an italian, vegetarian dish which is cooked in a particular
   manner (roasted, boiled, air fried, to name a few) and it would walk
   him through the possible ingredients, duration of cooking and
   proportions in no time.these are just a few applications from our daily
   lives which would make our life simpler and better. there is no end to
   what watson   s computing power can achieve in fields of agriculture,
   fraud detection, risk determination, entertainment and even space
   exploration. so the next time you hear someone talking to a machine and
   getting an accurate, creative response in a remarkably similar human
   tone, you might be around one of the applications using ibm watson.
