   learn how to code a neural network, by taking advantage of someone
   else's experiences learning how to code a neural network.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by per harald borgen, xeneta.

   this is the second post in a series of me trying to learn something new
   over a short period of time. the first time consisted of learning how
   to do [37]machine learning in a week.

   this time i   ve tried to learn neural networks. while i didn   t manage to
   do it within a week, due to various reasons, i did get a basic
   understanding of it throughout the summer and autumn of 2015.

   by basic understanding, i mean that i finally know how to code
   [38]simple neural networks from scratch on my own.

   in this post, i   ll give a few explanations and guide you to the
   resources i   ve used, in case you   re interested in doing this yourself.

   step 1: neurons and forward propagation

   so what is a neural network? let   s wait with the network part and start
   off with one single neuron.

   a neuron is like a function; it takes a few inputs and calculates an
   output.

   the circle below illustrates an artificial neuron. its input is 5 and
   its output is 1. the input is the sum of the three synapses connecting
   to the neuron (the three arrows at the left).

   artificial neuron

   at the far left we see two input values plus a bias value. the input
   values are 1 and 0 (the green numbers), while the bias holds a value of
   -2 (the brown number).

     the inputs here might be numerical representations of two different
     features. if we   re building a spam filter, it could be whether or
     not the email contains more than one capitalized word and whether or
     not it contains the word    viagra   .

   the two inputs are then multiplied by their so called weights, which
   are 7 and 3 (the blue numbers).

   finally we add it up with the bias and end up with a number, in this
   case: 5 (the red number). this is the input for our artificial neuron.

   neural network bias calculations

   the neuron then performs some kind of computation on this number         in
   our case the sigmoid function, and then spits out an output. this
   happens to be 1, as sigmoid of 5 equals to 1, if we round the number up
   (more info on the sigmoid function follows later).

     if this was a spam filter, the fact that we   re outputting 1 (as
     opposed to 0) probably means that the neuron has labeled the text as
        spam   .

   neural network illustration
   a neural network illustration from [39]wikipedia.

   if you connect a network of these neurons together, you have a neural
   network, which propagates forward         from input output, via neurons
   which are connected to each other through synapses, like on the image
   to the left.

   i can strongly recommend the [40]welch labs videos on youtube for
   getting a better intuitive explanation of this process.

   step 2: understanding the sigmoid function

   after you   ve seen the welch labs videos, its a good idea to spend some
   time watching [41]week 4 of the coursera   s machine learning course,
   which covers neural networks, as it   ll give you more intuition of how
   they work.

   the course is fairly mathematical, and its based around octave, while i
   prefer python. because of this, i did not do the programming exercises.
   instead, i used the videos to help me understand what i needed to
   learn.

   the first thing i realized i needed to investigate further was the
   sigmoid function, as this seemed to be a critical part of many neural
   networks. i knew a little bit about the function, as it was also
   covered in week 3 of [42]the same course. so i went back and watched
   these videos again.

   the sigmoid function
   the sigmoid function simply maps your value (along the horizontal axis)
   to a value between 0 and 1.

   but watching videos won   t get you all the way. to really understand it,
   i felt i needed to code it from the ground up.

   so i started to code a id28 algorithm from scratch
   (which happened to use the sigmoid function).

   it took a whole day, and it   s probably not a very good implementation
   of id28. but that doesn   t matter, as i finally
   understood how it works. check the code [43]here.

   you don   t need to perform this entire exercise yourself, as it requires
   some knowledge about and cost functions and id119, which you
   might not have at this point.

   but make sure you understand how the sigmoid function works.
