   there are many deep learning resources freely available online, but it
   can be confusing knowing where to begin. go from vague understanding of
   deep neural networks to knowledgeable practitioner in 7 steps!
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [41]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   deep learning is a branch of machine learning, employing numerous
   similar, yet distinct, deep neural network architectures to solve
   various problems in natural language processing, id161, and
   bioinformatics, among other fields. deep learning has experienced a
   tremendous recent research resurgence, and has been shown to deliver
   state of the art results in numerous applications.

   in essence, deep learning is the implementation of neural networks with
   more than a single hidden layer of neurons. this is, however, a very
   simplistic view of deep learning, and not one that is unanimously
   agreed upon. these "deep" architectures also vary quite considerably,
   with different implementations being optimized for different tasks or
   goals. the vast research being produced at such a constant rate is
   revealing new and innovative deep learning models at an ever-increasing
   pace.

                               neural network
                       the layers of neural networks.

   currently a white hot research topic, deep learning seems to be
   impacting all areas of machine learning and, by extension, data
   science. a look over [42]recent papers in the relevant arxiv categories
   makes it easy to see that a large amount of what is being published is
   deep learning-related. given the impressive results being produced,
   many researchers, practitioners, and laypeople alike are wondering if
   deep learning is the edge of "true" artificial intelligence.

   this collection of reading materials and tutorials aims to provide a
   path for a deep neural networks newcomer to gain some understanding of
   this vast and complex topic. though i do not assume any real
   understanding of neural networks or deep learning, i will assume your
   familiarity with general machine learning theory and practice to some
   degree. to overcome any deficiency you may have in the general areas of
   machine learning theory or practice you can consult the recent
   kdnuggets post [43]7 steps to mastering machine learning with python.
   since we will also see examples implemented in python, some familiarity
   with the language will be useful. introductory and review resources are
   also available in the [44]previously mentioned post.

   this post will utilize freely-available materials from around the web
   in a cohesive order to first gain some understanding of deep neural
   networks at a theoretical level, and then move on to some practical
   implementations. as such, credit for the materials referenced lie
   solely with the creators, who will be noted alongside the resources. if
   you see that someone has not been properly credited for their work,
   please [45]alert me to the oversight so that i may swiftly rectify it.

   a stark and honest disclaimer: deep learning is a complex and
   quickly-evolving field of both breadth and depth (pun unintended?), and
   as such this post does not claim to be an all-inclusive manual to
   becoming a deep learning expert; such a transformation would take
   greater time, many additional resources, and lots of practice building
   and testing models. i do, however, believe that utilizing the resources
   herein could help get you started on just such a path.

step 1: introducing deep learning


   if you are reading this and interested in the topic, then you are
   probably already familiar with what deep neural networks are, if even
   at a basic level. neural networks have a [46]storied history, but we
   won't be getting into that. we do, however, want a common high level of
   understanding to begin with.

   first, have a look at the fantastic introductory videos from
   [47]deeplearning.tv. at the time of this writing there are 14 videos;
   watch them all if you like, but definitely watch the first 5, covering
   the basics of neural nets and some of the more common architectures.

   next, read over the [48]nips 2015 deep learning tutorial by geoff
   hinton, yoshua bengio, and yann lecun for an introduction at a slightly
   lower level.

   to round out our first step, read [49]the first chapter of neural
   networks and deep learning, the fantastic, evolving online book by
   michael nielsen, which goes a step further but still keeps things
   fairly light.

step 2: getting technical


   deep neural nets rely on a mathematical foundation of algebra and
   calculus. while this post will not produce any theoretical
   mathematicians, gaining some understanding of the basics before moving
   on would be helpful.

   first, watch andrew ng's [50]id202 review videos. while not
   absolutely necessary, for those finding they want something deeper on
   this subject, consult the [51]id202 review and reference from
   ng's stanford course, written by zico kolter and chuong do.

   then look at this [52]introduction to the derivative of a function
   video by [53]professor leonard. the video is succinct, the examples are
   clear, and it provides some understanding of what is actually going on
   during id26 from a mathematical standpoint. more on that
   soon.

   next have a quick read over the wikipedia entry for the [54]sigmoid
   function, a bounded differentiable function often employed by
   individual neurons in a neural network.

   finally, take a break from the maths and read this [55]deep learning
   tutorial by google research scientist [56]quoc le.

                              id119
                        id119, visualized.

step 3: id26 and id119


   an important part of neural networks, including modern deep
   architectures, is the backward propagation of errors through a network
   in order to update the weights used by neurons closer to the input.
   this is, quite bluntly, from where neural networks derive their
   "power," for lack of better term. id26 for short (or even
   "backprop"), is paired with an optimization method which acts to
   minimize the weights that are subsequently distributed (via
   id26), in order to minimize the [57]id168. a common
   optimization method in deep neural networks is id119.

   first, [58]read these introductory notes on id119 by
   [59]marc toussaint of the university of stuttgart.

   next, have a look at [60]this step by step example of id26
   in action written by [61]matt mazur.

   moving on, read [62]jeremy kun's informative blog post on [63]coding
   id26 in python. having a look over [64]the complete code is
   also suggested, as is attempting to replicate it yourself.

   finally, read the second part of the [65]deep learning tutorial by
   [66]quoc le, in order to get introduced to some specific common deep
   architectures and their uses.
