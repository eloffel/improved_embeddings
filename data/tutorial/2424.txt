   how do neural networks learn?
   neural networks are generating a lot of excitement, as they are quickly
   proving to be a promising and practical form of machine intelligence.
   at fast forward labs, we just finished a project researching and
   building systems that use neural networks for image analysis, as shown
   in our toy application [36]pictograph. our companion deep learning
   report explains this technology in depth and explores applications and
   opportunities across industries.
   as we built pictograph, we came to appreciate just how challenging it
   is to understand how neural networks work. even research teams at large
   companies like google and facebook are struggling to understand how
   neural network layers interact and how the algorithms    learn,    or
   improve their performance on a task over time. you can learn more about
   this on their [37]research blog and [38]explanatory videos.
   to help understand how neural networks learn, i built a visualization
   of a network at the neuron level, including animations that show how it
   learns. if you   re familiar with neural networks or want to follow the
   rest of the post with a visual cue, please see the interactive
   visualization [39]here.
   a neural network
   here are snapshots from the visualization. neural-nets-viz1

   basics
   first, some deep learning basics. neural networks are composed of
   layers of computational units (neurons), with connections among the
   neurons in different layers. these networks transform data     like the
   pixels in an image or the words in a document     until they can classify
   it as an output, such as naming an object in an image or tagging
   unstructured text data.
   each neuron in a network transforms data using a series of
   computations: a neuron multiplies an initial value by some weight, sums
   results with other values coming into the same neuron, adjusts the
   resulting number by the neuron   s bias, and then normalizes the output
   with an activation function. the bias is a neuron-specific number that
   adjusts the neuron   s value once all the connections are processed, and
   the activation function ensures values that are passed on lie within a
   tunable, expected range. this process is repeated until the final
   output layer can provide scores or predictions related to the
   classification task at hand, e.g., the likelihood that a dog is in an
   image.
   neural networks generally perform supervised learning tasks, building
   knowledge from data sets where the right answer is provided in advance.
   the networks then learn by tuning themselves to find the right answer
   on their own, increasing the accuracy of their predictions.
   to do this, the network compares initial outputs with a provided
   correct answer, or target. a technique called a cost function is used
   to modify initial outputs based on the degree to which they differed
   from the target values. finally, cost function results are then pushed
   back across all neurons and connections to adjust the biases and
   weights.
   this push-back method is called id26 - and it is the key to
   how a neural network learns a particular task.
   details of the visualization
   play with the visualization to see how these components work. notice
   how you can adjust the inputs. each connection has the value of its
   weight hovering nearby; each neuron has its bias (b) below and the
   result of its activation function (  ) above.
   click `forward` to compare the final layer   s guesses with the target
   values. click `backprop` to watch the values adjust. click `forward`
   again to see the output layer improve slightly in comparison to the
   targets.
   this visualization is designed to be as simple as possible to highlight
   the fundamentals. it uses a [40]softmax function to compute cost and a
   [41]sigmoid function for activation. other aspects of normal training,
   like id173, dropout, and mini-batching, are ignored.
   interpreting learning
   one powerful idea this visualization communicates is that, even in this
   simple network, changes made to a single value do not tell us much
   about the behavior of the network. this is one reason why neural
   networks are hard to interpret: discrete points provide little to no
   insight into the overall dynamics, even though id26
   technically can be reduced down to tweaking individual parameters.
   for this reason, we must think about neural networks as complex systems
   that exhibit emergent behavior: it is the interactions among the
   neurons, rather than the neurons themselves, that enable the network to
   learn. in a [42]prior post, we visualized this with the metaphor of a
   bee swarm. conway   s [43]game of life provides another illustration,
   where complicated structures emerge from turning cells in a grid on and
   off according to a few basic rules.
   as thinkers dating back to [44]john stuart mill have hypothesized that
   consciousness emerges from brain matter, we may be tempted to infer
   another reason why neural networks function like brains. but brains are
   much more plastic and flexible than id158s. neural
   networks are trained to perform a specific singular task; humans learn
   by switching contexts and redefining tasks as they encounter new
   information.
   still, the brain metaphor can help conceptualize how neural networks
   learn. like brains, neural networks accept and process new input (   feed
   information forward   ), determine the correct response to new input
   (   evaluate a cost function   ), and reflect on errors to improve future
   performance (   backpropagate   ).
   it   s still unclear what kind of intelligence will emerge from neural
   networks in the coming years, but it   s important we understand how
   learning actually works to refine our conceptions of what   s possible.
   hopefully [45]our visualization helps to explain what learning means in
   this context. grasping new ai systems is a difficult task, but an
   important for one for education, public communication, and choices
   about how to engineer systems with realistic expectations.
