   unveiling the hidden layers of deep learning

   in a recent scientific american article entitled    [28]springtime for
   ai: the rise of deep learning,    computer scientist [29]yoshua bengio
   explains why complex neural networks are the key to true artificial
   intelligence as people have long envisioned it. it seems logical that
   the way to make computers as smart as humans is to program them to
   behave like human brains. however, given how little we know of how the
   brain functions, this task seems more than a little daunting. so how
   does deep learning work?

   this visualization by [30]jen christiansen explains the basic structure
   and function of neural networks.

   evidently, these so-called    hidden layers    play a key role in breaking
   down visual components to decode the image as a whole. and we know
   there is an order to how the layers act: from input to output, each
   layer handles increasingly complex information. but beyond that, the
   hidden layers   as their name suggests   are shrouded in mystery.

   as part of a recent collaborative project called [31]tensor flow,
   daniel smilkov and shan carter created a [32]neural network playground,
   which aims to demystify the hidden layers by allowing users to interact
   and experiment with them.

   there is a lot going on in this visualization, and i was recently
   fortunate enough to hear [33]fernanda vi  gas and martin wattenberg
   break some of it down in their keynote talk at [34]openvisconf.
   (fernanda and martin were part of the team behind tensor flow, which is
   a much more complex, open-source tool for using neural networks in
   real-world applications.)

   rather than something as complicated as faces, the neural network
   playground uses blue and orange points scattered within a field to
      teach    the machine how to find and echo patterns. the user can select
   different dot-arrangements of varying degrees of complexity, and
   manipulate the learning system by adding new hidden layers, as well as
   new neurons within each layer. then, each time the user hits the    play   
   button, she can watch as the background color gradient shifts to
   approximate the arrangement of blue and orange dots. as the pattern
   becomes more complex, additional neurons and layers help the machine to
   complete the task more successfully.
   the machine easily solves this straightforward arrangement of dots,
   using only one hidden layer with two neurons. the machine struggles to
   decode this more complex spiral pattern.

   besides the neuron layers, the machine has other meaningful features,
   such as the connections among the neurons. the connections appear as
   either blue or orange lines, blue being positive   that is, the output
   for each neuron is the same as its content   and orange being
   negative   meaning the output is the opposite of each neuron   s values.
   additionally, the thickness and opacity of the connection lines
   indicate the confidence of the prediction each neuron is making, much
   like the connections in our brains strengthen as we advance through a
   learning process.

   interestingly, as we get better at building neural networks for
   machines, we may end up revealing new information about how our own
   brains work. visualizing and playing with the hidden layers seems like
   a great way to facilitate this process while also making the concept of
   deep learning accessible to a wider audience.
