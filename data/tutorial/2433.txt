why does deep learning work?

   tags: [33]deep learning, [34]deep neural network, [35]neural networks

   many researchers recently trying to open the    black-box    of the deep
   learning. here we summarize these efforts of how neural nets of deep
   learning are evolve and how spin funnel and deep learning are related.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                                            c [36]comments

   by [37]charles h martin, phd (calculation consulting).

   this is the big question on everyone   s mind these days. c   mon we all
   know the answer already:

      the long-term behavior of certain neural network models are governed
   by the statistical mechanism of infinite-range ising spin-glass
   hamiltonians    [1]   in other words,

   multilayer neural networks are just spin glasses?  right?

   this is kinda true   depending on what you mean by a spin glass.

   in a recent paper by lecun, he attempts to extend our understanding of
   training neural networks by studying the sgd approach to solving the
   multilayer neural network optimization problem [1].   furthermore, he
   claims

   none of these works however make the attempt to explain the paradigm of
   optimizing the highly non-convex neural network objective function
   through the prism of spin-glass theory and thus in this respect our
   approach is very novel. and, again, this is kinda true

   but here   s the thing   we already have a good idea of what the energy
   landscape of multiscale spin glass models* look like   from early
   theoretical protein folding work (by wolynes, dill, etc [2,3,4]).  in
   fact, here is a typical surface:
   energy landscape of multiscale spin glass model

   *[technically these are ising spin models with multi-spin interactions]

   let us consider the nodes, which above represent partially folded
   states, as nodes in a multiscale spin glass   or , say, a multilayer
   neural network.  immediately we see the analogy and the appearance of
   the    energy funnel    in fact, researchers have studied these    folding
   funnels    of spin glass models over 20 years ago [2,3,4].  and we knew
   then that

   as we increase the network size, the funnel gets sharper
   3d energy landscape of the folding funnel of a spin glass

   note: the wolynes protein-folding spin-glass model is significantly
   different from the p-spin hopfield model that lecun discusses because
   it contains multi-scale, multi-spin interactions.  these details
   matter.

   spin glasses and spin funnels are quite different.  spin glasses are
   highly non-convex with lots of local minima, saddle points, etc.  spin
   funnels, however, are designed to find the spin glass of
   minimal-frustration, and have a convex, funnel shaped, energy
   landscape.

   this seemed to be necessary to resolve one of the great mysteries of
   protein folding: [38]levinthal   s paradox [5].  if nature just
   used statistical sampling to fold a protein, it would take longer
   than [39]the    known    lifetime of the universe.  it is
   why machine learning is not just statistics.
   spin funnels and spin glasses spin funnels (dfm) vs spin glasses (sg)
   [4]

   deep learning networks are (probably) spin funnels

   so with a surface like this, it is not so surprising that an sgd method
   might be able to find the energy minima (called the native state in
   protein folding theory). we just need to jump around until we reach the
   top of the funnel, and then it is a straight shot down.  this, in fact,
   defines a so-called    folding funnel   [4]

   so is not surprising at all that sgd may work.

   recent research at google and stanford confirms that the deep learning
   energy landscapes appear to be quite smooth and generally convex! [6]

   note that a real theory of protein folding, which would actually be
   able to fold a protein correctly (i.e. freed   s approach [7]), would be
   a lot more detailed than a simple spin glass model.  likewise, real
   deep learning systems are going to have a lot more engineering
   details   to avoid overtraining (dropout, pooling, momentum) than a
   theoretical spin funnel.

   it is not that deep learning is non-convex   is that we need to avoid
   over-training

   still, hopefully we can learn something using the techniques developed
   to study the energy landscape of   multi-scale spin glass/ spin
   funnels models. [8,9], thereby utilizing methods  theoretical chemistry
   and condensed matter physics.

   indeed, i believe this is the first conjecture that supervised deep
   learning is related to a spin funnel.   in the next post, i will
   examine the relationship between unsupervised deep learning and the
   variational reid172 group [10].
