   recent restrictions to facebook api has made it difficult to visualize
   it readily. but, here you can find a complete pipeline from collecting
   data, storing it and finally visualizing it as network graph.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by[37] jean villedieu, co-founder at linkurious.

   facebook knows the social network of more than a billion persons. if
   you are a [38]facebook user though, you have little tools to explore
   your own social network. we are going to see how, with a few scraping
   tools, a neo4j graph database and linkurious, we can visualize our
   facebook network.

   there is no easy solution to visualize your facebook network. facebook
   is restricting access to its api. as a result, netvizz, an application
   to visualize one   s facebook network, was recently [39]discontinued.
   visualizing your facebook network has become hard.

   [40]herv   piedcoq, data analyst and osint expert is going to show you a
   method to 1) collect, 2) store and 3) visualize your facebook network.

collecting the data to build your facebook network

1st step : download your friends    list

   we will use [41]outwit hub, a powerful yet easy to use scraper, based
   on mozilla and xul. it has built-in functionalities such as table and
   list detection, an extractor engine based on the source code of a web
   page, macros and job tools.

   we could, of course, use python or other languages to a scrape
   facebook, but outwit hub is clearly non-programmer oriented and
   immediately operational.

   connect to your account via outwit hub and display the complete list of
   your friends.

   visualizing your friends via outwit-hub.

   outwit hub uses the source code of the webpage to scrape the data. the
   problem is that facebook uses a lot of javascript that pollutes the
   code and really makes it hard to analyze.

   a good way to avoid this issue, is to save this webpage in html on your
   hard disk and open it as a static page in outwit hub.

   on the left panel, click on    links    (   liens    in french), to grab all
   the links present on this page.

   outwit-with-data

   extract the links.

   filter these links using this regex in the bottom left corner box : now
   export the selection to a csv file. simply replace the values in the
   column url source, with your profile id, and rename it    source   . rename
   url page as    target   .

   at this point, if you imported this file in a graph visualizer of your
   choice, you would obtain something like that :

   this graph is nice, as you get an instant view on the list of your
   friends, but not really interesting in terms of social network
   analysis. what is lacking is the relationships between your friends.

2nd step: clean your list and export it to html

   for this part, we are going to use [42]openrefine in order to clean up
   a little bit the urls. your data should look like this:
