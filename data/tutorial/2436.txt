   an recent interview from the talking machine podcast with three deep
   learning experts. they talked about the neural network winter and its
   renewal.

   by [40]ran bi, nyu.

   the [41]talking machine is a series of podcasts about machine learning
   by katherine gorman, a journalist and ryan adams who is an assistant
   professor of computer science at harvard. the most recent ones are
   interview with three pillars of deep learning community, geoffrey
   hinton, yoshua bengio, and yann lecun at nips 2014, to talk about the
   history and future of deep learning.

   neural network        the three of us all knew that it would be the
   ultimate answer.   

   although the idea of neural network was proposed long time ago, the
   interest in it was not sparked until the 2000s.

   in the 1980s, a number of groups were working on id26
   algorithm, including yann. they had some impressive results with
   written handwriting characters and id103.    but it was a
   disappointment overall since we couldn   t learn lots of less features.
   the whole idea of deep learning is to learn less features.    geoffrey
   said.

   although system of handwriting characters recognition developed by yann
   at university of toronto and later at at&t worked well and was used
   widely, it was not enough to keep people interested. in the 1990s,
   other machine learning methods which are easy to apply did as well as
   or better than neural network on many problems.

   in late 90s and early 2000s, it was very difficult to do research in
   neural nets. yoshua talked about his own experience.    in my own lab, i
   had to twist my students    arms to do work in neural networks. my
   students were afraid of seeing their paper rejected, which did happen
   quite a bit.    

      we were struggling with so many methods to make neural network better.
   all of us were convinced it was going to work in the end. it   s just a
   question of time.   , geoffrey said.

   unsupervised learning     "the future belongs to unsupervised learning."

   the way that the community got interested in neural nets again is
   through unsupervised learning in early 2000.    all of us are doing
   unsupervised learning from then. but it is true that the commercial
   success of deep learning has been mostly with supervised learning
   backprop   , yann said.

   the first method which makes many breakthroughs is unsupervised
   learning with less features.    you learn one layer of features. then you
   treat the learned features as data and learn another layer of
   features.    it started working by 2005 with better results on small
   datasets.

   however, the papers still could not convince the community,
   particularly in id161 and id103. yann told the
   story from his perspective.    all three of us have the same philosophy
   about unsupervised learning, but we have different methods. geoffrey
   was working on id82s. yoshua had a lot of ideas and try
   everything. i was trying to tell the world that convnets (convolutional
   neural networks) are working.    

      the results ware impressive. however, the paper is rejected from
   id161 conference on 2011 because the reviewers didn   t know
   convnets and they thought learning was not good since we couldn   t
   understand what   s working inside of learning. id171 is
   against the philosophy of id161 where a lot of people build
   their careers around the idea of building features.   

   "in a workshop on the future of id161 at mit in 2011, i gave
   a talk with the topic    in five years, all of you will be learning your
   features   . i was wrong. it only takes three years."

   in 2012, yann   s technique is applied in geoffrey   s lab and the result
   is so overwhelming.    more like overnight, the senior id161
   researchers began to use deep learning. now people are trying on
   everything.    geoffrey said.
