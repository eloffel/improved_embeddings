   key ideas from a podcast with deep learning gurus geoff hinton, yoshua
   bengio, and yann lecun, where they explain the power of distributed
   representation and also propose a new open paper review process.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [39]ran bi, nyu.

   see also the [40]first part of this blog. this is the second part

   the [41]talking machine is a series of podcasts about machine learning
   made by katherine gorman (a journalist) and ryan adams (an expert in
   machine learning and an assistant professor of cs at harvard). a recent
   podcast featured an interview made at nips 2014 with three pillars of
   deep learning community     geoffrey hinton, yoshua bengio, and yann
   lecun     where they talked about the history and future of deep
   learning.

   deep learning

   they first shared stories during the renewal of neural networks (see
   [42]part 1). when talking about unsupervised learning, they all
   expressed confidence in it.

      the importance of unsupervised learning is going to grow in the future
   as we try to apply our methods to much larger datasets as most of which
   human won   t have time to manually label   , yoshua said.

      we all have the sense that the future belongs to unsupervised
   learning. and we are seeing this right now in natural language
   processing, such as embedding words and text. now it is the rage.
   everybody is using id27.   

   (if you want to have a quick idea about id27, [43]here is a
   very nice blog. )

   distributed representation

   geoffrey first gave some explanation of distributed representation.
      the idea is that you have a large number of neurons, each representing
   some tiny aspect. between them, they represent the whole thing. it is
   very different from symbol, where symbols are either identical or not
   to another symbol; while the distributed representation has the
   properties to make them related to another distributed representation.
   you only need a whole bunch of connection strings instead of explicit
   rules.    

   yann said,    the power of the concept can be seen in how to find certain
   vector representation for words, texts in various languages, images,
   videos. finding the embedding is a very interesting thing. there are
   lots of different methods doing this.    geoffrey and yann are also
   working separately on matrix learning applied on images, which facebook
   is using for face recognition.

   geoffrey commented more on it.    my belief is that we can get recurrent
   neural network to translate from one language to another. we can do
   that with nothing looks like symbol or symbol rules. they are just
   vectors insides. it works very well in google and also yoshua   s lab and
   is developing very fast.   

   why distributed representation is so powerful?

   yoshua said:    one way to think about the vectors is that they are
   attributes learned by the machine. words, images or concepts are going
   to be associated with these attributes. note that the attributes here
   are learned and the learning system discovers all the attributes to do
   the good job.

   the important notion here is notion of composition. some computer
   scientists thought neural nets cannot do composition. actually
   composition is at the heart of why deep learning works. in the case of
   attributes and distributed representation, there are so many
   configurations of these attributes that can be composed and these
   representations are so powerful. when you consider multiple levels of
   representation, which deep learning is about, you get next level of
   composition come in and allow representing even more abstract things.   

   more   

   as yoshua said in the interview,    from historic perspective, it   s not
   easy to go against the fashion and stick to your idea.     they all went
   through a hard time when convincing the community to buy their ideas.

   during the interview, yann proposed a new publication mode to avoid
   rejecting brand new ideas. he and yoshua co-founded international
   conference on learning representations (iclr) which adopted a open
   review process. people put their papers on the arxiv, and will be
   reviewed by official reviewers. review will be published and everybody
   can comment on the papers. although it is against a ingrained
   point-counting reviews, yann wishes the mode can be adopted by other
   conferences.
