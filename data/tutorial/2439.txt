deep learning, the curse of dimensionality, and autoencoders

   autoencoders are an extremely exciting new approach to unsupervised
   learning and for many machine learning tasks they have already
   surpassed the decades of progress made by researchers handpicking
   features.

   by nikhil buduma.

   let's say you're working on a cool image processing project, and your
   goal is to build an algorithm that analyzes faces for emotions. it
   takes in a 256 pixel by 256 pixel greyscale image as its input and
   spits out an emotion as an answer. for example, if you passed in the
   following image, you'd expect the algorithm to label it as "happy."
   happy man a greyscale input image of a happy man

   now this is all well and good, but before we're satisfied with this
   approach, let's take a step back and think about what this really
   means. a 256 by 256 greyscale image corresponds to an input vector of
   over 65,000 dimensions! in other words, we're trying to solve a problem
   in a 65,000-dimensional space. that's not a particularly easy thing to
   do, even for a computer! not only are large inputs annoying to store,
   move around, and compute with, but they also give rise to some pretty
   serious tractability concerns.

dimensionality is exponentially worse

   let's get a rough idea of how the difficulty of a machine learning
   problem increases as the dimensionality increases. according to a
   [39]study by c.j. stone in 1982, the time it takes to fit a model
   (specifically a nonparametric regression) to your data is at best
   proportional to m^{-p/(2p+d)}, where m is the number of data points, d
   is the dimensionality of the data, and p is a parameter that depends on
   the model we are using (specifically, we are assuming that the
   regression function is p times differentiable). in a nutshell, this
   relation implies that we need exponentially more training examples was
   we increase the dimensionality of our inputs.

   we can observe this graphically by considering a simple example,
   borrowed from gutierrez-osuna. our learning algorithm divides the
   feature space uniformly into bins and plot all of our training
   examples. we then assign each bin a label based on the predominant
   class that's found in that bin. finally, for each new example that we
   want to classify, we just need to figure out the bin the example falls
   into and the label associated with that bin!

   in our toy problem, we begin by choosing a single feature
   (one-dimensional inputs) and divide the space into 3 simple bins:
   feature-3bins, 1d example
   a simple example involving one-dimensional inputs
