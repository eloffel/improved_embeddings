   j  rgen schmidhuber, pioneer in innovating deep neural networks, answers
   questions on open code, general problem solvers, quantum computing, phd
   students, online courses, and the neural network research community in
   this reddit ama.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by grant marshall.
   juergen schmidhuber j  rgen schmidhuber, director at the swiss ai lab
   idsia, has worked on improving algorithms for deep learning since 1991.
   he began answering questions on his [42]/r/machinelearning ama on march
   4th, and there were certainly some interesting questions and even more
   interesting answers. below we look at and discuss the top questions by
   upvotes.
   [43]1. why doesn't your group post its code online for reproducing the
   results of competitions you've won, such as the isbi brain segmentation
   contest?
   in response to this question, dr. schmidhuber first links the
   substantial amounts of open code from his lab like [44]pybrain and
   [45]id56lib, much of which arose from competitions he and other members
   of his lab participated in. beyond this, dr. schmidhuber explains that
   some code ends up involved in industrial projects, making it more
   difficult to release. in the near future, though, he says there are
   plans to release even more code for id56s to act as a successor to
   pybrain. that will certainly be exciting!
   [46]2. what is something that's true, but almost nobody agrees with you
   on?
   this question is almost assured to lead to interesting discussion, and
   in this case, it did. here are 2 items given as answer.

     many think that intelligence is this awesome, infinitely complex
     thing. i think it is just the product of a few principles that will
     be considered very simple in hindsight, so simple that even kids
     will be able to understand and build intelligent, continually
     learning, more and more general problem solvers. partial
     justification of this belief:
     (a) there already exist blueprints of universal problem solvers
     developed in my lab, in the new millennium, which are theoretically
     optimal in some abstract sense although they consist of just a few
     formulas ( [47]unilearn.html, [48]goedelmachine.html).
     (b) the principles of our less universal, but still rather general,
     very practical, program-learning recurrent neural networks can also
     be described by just a few lines of pseudo-code, e.g., [49]id56.html,
     [50]compressednetworksearch.html.
     general purpose quantum computation won   t work (my prediction of 15
     years ago is still standing). related: the universe is
     deterministic, and the most efficient program that computes its
     entire history is short and fast, which means there is little room
     for true randomness, which is very expensive to compute. what looks
     random must be pseudorandom, like the decimal expansion of pi, which
     is computable by a short program. many physicists disagree, but
     einstein was right: no dice. there is no physical evidence to the
     contrary [51]randomness.html.
     for example, bell   s theorem does not contradict this. and any
     efficient search in program space for the solution to a sufficiently
     complex problem will create many deterministic universes like ours
     as a by-product. think about this. more here
     [52]computeruniverse.html and [53]here.

   [54]3. how do you recognize a promising machine learning phd student?
   this is definitely a challenging question. he points out that it's
   often not possible to recognize someone's brilliance immediately
   because everyone has their own unique strengths. but in general, he
   sees tenacity and willingness to keep attacking a problem as the one
   unifying factor for all successful students.
   [55]4. do you plan on delivering an online course (e.g. on coursera)
   for id56s?
   this is something i would be interested in seeing. dr. schmidhuber
   states that he's wanted to for years, but doesn't have the time.
   interestingly, this question was also asked of geoffrey hinton in
   [56]his ama. if he does find the time, i'm sure it would be
   well-received!
   [57]5. why is there not much interaction and collaboration between the
   researchers of recurrent nns and the rest of the nn community,
   particularly convolutional nns (e.g. hinton, lecun, bengio)?
   dr. schmidhuber responds to this question by pointing out the
   compatibility of id98s and id56s. he also links to recent research that
   integrates the two types of networks in particular applications, such
   as [58]image id134. he further addresses the perceived
   differences in the two communities by pointing out that they are mostly
   geographical differences, not differences in methodologies or
   philosophies.
   conclusion
   this post covered some of the top questions in the ama, but it
   certainly didn't cover them all. if you're interested in seeing the
   rest of the questions and his responses, you can go see them [59]here.
   at the time of this writing, he is also revisiting the ama
   occasionally, so you may still have a chance to have a question
   answered!
