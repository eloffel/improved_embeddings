   statistical modeling is a lot like engineering.
   statistics1 in engineering, there are various ways to build a key-value
   storage, and each design makes a different set of assumptions about the
   usage pattern. in statistical modeling, there are various algorithms to
   build a classifier, and each algorithm makes a different set of
   assumptions about the data.
   when dealing with small amounts of data, it   s reasonable to try as many
   algorithms as possible and to pick the best one since the cost of
   experimentation is low. but as we hit    big data   , it pays off to
   analyze the data upfront and then design the modeling pipeline
   (pre-processing, modeling, optimization algorithm, evaluation,
   productionization) accordingly.
   as pointed out in my previous [39]post, there are dozens of ways to
   solve a given modeling problem. each model assumes something different,
   and it   s not obvious how to navigate and identify which assumptions are
   reasonable. in industry, most practitioners pick the modeling algorithm
   they are most familiar with rather than pick the one which best suits
   the data. in this post, i would like to share some common mistakes (the
   don't-s). i   ll save some of the best practices (the do-s) in a future
   post.
   1. take default id168 for granted
   many practitioners train and pick the best model using the default loss
   function (e.g., squared error). in practice, off-the-shelf loss
   function rarely aligns with the business objective. take fraud
   detection as an example. when trying to detect fraudulent transactions,
   the business objective is to minimize the fraud loss. the off-the-shelf
   id168 of binary classifiers weighs false positives and false
   negatives equally. to align with the business objective, the loss
   function should not only penalize false negatives more than false
   positives, but also penalize each false negative in proportion to the
   dollar amount. also, data sets in fraud detection usually contain
   highly imbalanced labels. in these cases, bias the id168 in
   favor of the rare case (e.g., through up/down sampling).
   2. use plain linear models for non-linear interaction
   when building a binary classifier, many practitioners immediately jump
   to id28 because it   s simple. but, many also forget that
   id28 is a linear model and the non-linear interaction
   among predictors need to be encoded manually. returning to fraud
   detection, high order interaction features like "billing address =
   shipping address and transaction amount < $50" are required for good
   model performance. so one should prefer non-linear models like id166 with
   kernel or tree based classifiers that bake in higher-order interaction
   features.
   3. forget about outliers
   outliers are interesting. depending on the context, they either deserve
   special attention or should be completely ignored. take the example of
   revenue forecasting. if unusual spikes of revenue are observed, it's
   probably a good idea to pay extra attention to them and figure out what
   caused the spike. but if the outliers are due to mechanical error,
   measurement error or anything else that   s not generalizable, it   s a
   good idea to filter out these outliers before feeding the data to the
   modeling algorithm.
   statistics-bars some models are more sensitive to outliers than others.
   for instance, adaboost might treat those outliers as "hard" cases and
   put tremendous weights on outliers while decision tree might simply
   count each outlier as one false classification. if the data set
   contains a fair amount of outliers, it's important to either use
   modeling algorithm robust against outliers or filter the outliers out.
