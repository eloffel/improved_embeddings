   while microsoft and ibm rush to bring data science and visualization to
   the masses, metamind follows another path, offering deep learning as a
   service.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [39]zachary chase lipton, ucsd.

                                                            c [40]comments

   last month i wrote [41]an article describing the interfaces and
   capabilities of microsoft and ibm's new cloud data science products. i
   observed that azure ml presents a user-friendly drag and drop data
   mining app for businesses, while watson analytics focuses on natural
   language queries but is still too nascent for use. a google search for
   "azure machine learning" unearths 830,000 documents. a similar query
   for "ibm watson analytics" turns up 730,000 documents. amid the deluge
   of coverage on both services, one could lose sight of the many upstart
   companies offering cloud machine learning services. however, new
   product categories are typically pioneered by startups. over a few
   posts, i'd like to take a look at some of the emerging competition,
   starting with metamind.

   metamind
   logo for metamind, new deep learning startup

   founded by recent stanford phd graduate and incoming princeton
   professor richard socher, [42]metamind recently raised $8 million
   dollars from khosla ventures and marc benioff. the company is built
   atop the deep learning technology that socher developed as a doctoral
   student under the advisorship of andrew ng and chris manning. metamind
   focuses on deep learning, a burgeoning new field that leverages the
   power of gpus, distributed systems and new training techniques to
   construct many-layered id158s which have recently
   set records on tasks in id103 and id161. another
   web application developed by richard socher, called [43]etcml, was
   covered in kdnuggets in 2014.

   unlike azure ml and watson analytics, which aim for an extreme
   democratization of the machine learning and statistical tools that are
   already fairly ubiquitous in the data science community, metamind is
   focused on the state of the art, taking a technology that is currently
   only in the grasp of a small number of companies and research groups
   and making it available to a wider range of companies and developers.
   they offer ai as a software service, performing image classification,
   text id31 and other tasks via an api.
   deep learning startup metamind

   while not all advertised services are live, the metamind website does
   contain several active demos. they include on-line tools for text
   id31, object recognition, and semantic similarity. a live
   demonstration takes any twitter hashtag and breaks down the sentiment
   into "positive", "negative" and "neutral" posts, displaying examples of
   each. putting aside philosophical concerns with this sort of analysis
   (what does "positive" really mean?), the ease of use suggests their
   technology could be adopted even by relatively non-technical users. the
   site also features placeholders suggesting upcoming services for text
   summarization and id53. a final tab invites visitors to
   the website to contact their nlp team if their task is not represented
   among their services.

   given socher's output as a graduate student, the range of work is not
   surprising. in some of his most cited papers, he introduced an
   influential model of natural language using recursive auto-encoders to
   perform id31 and paraphrase detection. each word in the
   model is associated with a unit norm meaning vector in some high
   dimensional space (d ~= 100). each sentence is parsed into a binary
   tree where the value taken by each node in the tree is a function of
   its two children. effectively, the root is a fixed length d-dimensional
   representation of the content of the sentence. encoding and decoding
   matrices are learned to calculate the meaning vector of each node in
   the tree, with the goal of minimizing the distance between the original
   tree and the decoded tree. intuitively, if a model offers low
   reconstruction error, the root's meaning vector captures most of the
   information needed to describe the entire sentence. later in his phd,
   socher also produced some leading research combining natural language
   modeling with convolutional neural networks.
   richard socher, incoming princeton professor and founder of metamind

   as compared to microsoft azure machine learning and ibm watson
   analytics, metamind's product appears targeted towards the higher end
   of the market. it's hard to imagine a local business using metamind to
   visualize data or train linear models. however, metamind may bring the
   seemingly magical capabilities that have in recent years enabled
   facebook to perform facial recognition and google to identify products
   from photographs to nearly any developer who can write an api call.
   zachary chase lipton [44]zachary chase lipton is a phd student in the
   computer science engineering department at the university of
   california, san diego. funded by the [45]division of biomedical
   informatics, he is interested in both theoretical foundations and
   applications of machine learning. in addition to his work at ucsd, he
   has interned at microsoft research labs.
