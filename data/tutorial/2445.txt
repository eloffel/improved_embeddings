   by ajay ohri, may 2014.
   over the past few years, as the buzz and apparently the demand for data
   scientists has continued to grow, people are eager to learn how to
   join, learn, advance and thrive in this seemingly lucrative profession.
   as someone who writes on analytics and occasionally teaches it, i am
   often asked - how do i become a data scientist?
   adding to the complexity of my answer is data science seems to be a
   multi-disciplinary field, while the university departments of
   statistics, computer science and management deal with data quite
   differently.
   but to cut the marketing created jargon aside, a data scientist is
   simply a person who can write code in a few languages (primarily r,
   python and sql) for data querying, manipulation , aggregation, and
   visualization using enough statistical knowledge to give back
   actionable insights to the business for making decisions.
   since this rather practical definition of a data scientist is
   reinforced by the accompanying words on a job website for    data
   scientists    , ergo, here are some tools for learning the primary
   languages in data science- python, r and sql. a cheat sheet or
   reference card is a compilation of mostly used commands to help you
   learn that language   s syntax at a faster rate.
   the inclusion of sql may lead to some to feel surprised (isn   t this the
   nosql era?) , but it is there for a logical reason. both pig and hive
   query language are closely associated with sql- the original structured
   query language. in addition one can solely use the sqldf package within
   r (and the less widely used python-sql or python-sqlparse libraries for
   pythonic data scientists) or even the proc sql commands within the old
   champion language sas, and do most of what a data scientist is expected
   to do (at least in data munging).
   python cheat sheets for python, this is a rather partial list given the
   fact that python, the most general purpose language within the data
   scientist quiver, can be used for many things. but for the data
   scientist, the packages of numpy, scipy , pandas and scikit-learn seem
   the most pertinent.
   do all the thousands of r packages have useful interest to the aspiring
   data scientist? no.
   accordingly we chose the appropriate cheat sheets for you. note that
   this is a curated list of lists. if there is anything that can be
   assumed in the field of data science, it should be that the null
   hypothesis is that the data scientist is intelligent enough to make his
   own decisions based on data and it   s context. 3 printouts is all it
   takes to speed up the aspiring data scientist   s journey.
   please add additional cheat sheets in comments below.
