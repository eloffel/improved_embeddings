cheatsheet     python & r codes for common machine learning algorithms

   [99]analytics vidhya content team, september 14, 2015

introduction

   in his famous book     think and grow rich, napolean hill narrates story
   of darby, who after digging for a gold vein for a few years walks away
   from it when he was three feet away from it!

   now, i don   t know whether the story is true or false. but, i surely
   know of a few data darby around me. these people understand the purpose
   of machine learning, its execution and use just a set 2     3 algorithms
   on whatever problem they are working on. they don   t update themselves
   with better algorithms or techniques, because they are too tough or
   they are time consuming.

   like darby, they are surely missing from a lot of action after reaching
   this close! in the end, they give up on machine learning by saying it
   is very computation heavy or it is very difficult or i can   t improve my
   models above a threshold     what   s the point? have you heard them?

   today   s cheat sheet aims to change a few data darby   s to machine
   learning advocates. here   s a collection of 10 most commonly used
   machine learning algorithms with their codes in python and r.
   considering the rising usage of machine learning in building models,
   this cheat sheet is good to act as a code guide to help you bring these
   machine learning algorithms to use. good luck!

for the super lazy data darbies, we will make your life even easier. you can
download the [100]pdf version of the cheat sheet here and copy paste the
codes from it directly.

   [101]machine learning algorithms, data science infographics

keep this cheat sheet handy when you work on data sets. download the complete
cheat sheet here: [102]pdf version

       thanks for sharing this in both r and python. very helpful. it
       would be nice to have datasets to accompany this code for those who
       are just starting out   .

       this is good stuff. my only commentary is the following: i could
       not find anything in the code that deals with validation. this is a
       must in all models and their evaluation(i.e. how well the model
       performs in a holdout group). evaluating the model based on its
       predicted output to observed output in the training data can be
       misleading because certain techniques have a tendency to
       overfit(i.e. neural nets) where holdout groups are essential in
       effectively evaluating model performance .

       for knn in r, the package knn is no longer available. the function
       knn can be found in the    class    package, but i don   t think it takes
       the arguments the way you specified. i guess you can also use caret
       for that.

       can i simply just say what a comfort to uncover somebody that
       actually understands what they are discussing on the
       net. you certainly understand how to bring an issue to light and
       make it important.
       more people ought to read this and understand this side
       of your story. i was surprised that you aren   t more popular given
       that you
       surely possess the gift.
