welcome to pybrain

   pybrain is a modular machine learning library for python. its goal is
   to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms for
   machine learning tasks and a variety of predefined environments to test
   and compare your algorithms.

   pybrain is short for python-based id23, artificial
   intelligence and neural network library. in fact, we came up with the
   name first and later reverse-engineered this quite descriptive
   "backronym".

how is pybrain different?

   while there are a few machine learning libraries out there, pybrain
   aims to be a very easy-to-use modular library that can be used by
   entry-level students but still offers the flexibility and algorithms
   for state-of-the-art research. we are constantly working on more and
   faster algorithms, developing new environments and improving usability.

what pybrain can do

   pybrain, as its written-out name already suggests, contains algorithms
   for neural networks, for id23 (and the combination of
   the two), for unsupervised learning, and evolution. since most of the
   current problems deal with continuous state and action spaces, function
   approximators (like neural networks) must be used to cope with the
   large dimensionality. our library is built around neural networks in
   the kernel and all of the training methods accept a neural network as
   the to-be-trained instance. this makes pybrain a powerful tool for
   real-life tasks.

using pybrain

   pybrain is open source and free to use for everyone (it is licensed
   under the [13]bsd software licence). just download it and start using
   the algorithms and modules in your own project or have a look at the
   provided tutorials and examples. if you use pybrain for your research,
   we kindly ask you to cite us in your publications. use the reference
   below or import this [14]bibtex reference.
