topic

   [16]data sources  /  [17]comments, [18]reddit

   there   s been all sorts of weird stuff going on at reddit lately, but
   who   s got time for that when you can [19]download 1.6 billion comments
   left on reddit, since 2007 through may 2015?

     this is an archive of reddit comments from october of 2007 until may
     of 2015 (complete month). this reflects 14 months of work and a lot
     of api calls. this dataset includes nearly every publicly available
     reddit comment. approximately 350,000 comments out of ~1.65 billion
     were unavailable due to reddit api issues.

   timestamp, comment ids, controversiality score, and of course the
   comment text. it   s 5 gigabytes compressed and available over torrent.

   git er done.
