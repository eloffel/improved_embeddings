    plot summary

   in 1936, archaeologist indiana jones braves an ancient peruvian temple
   filled with booby traps to retrieve a golden idol. upon fleeing the
   temple, indiana is confronted by rival archaeologist ren   belloq and
   the indigenous hovitos. surrounded and outnumbered, indiana is forced
   to surrender the idol to belloq and escapes aboard a waiting waco
   seaplane, in the process revealing his fear of snakes. shortly after
   returning to the college in the united states where he teaches
   archaeology, indiana is interviewed by two army intelligence agents.
   they inform him that the nazis, in their quest for occult power, are
   searching for his old mentor, abner ravenwood, who is the leading
   expert on the ancient egyptian city of tanis and possesses the
   headpiece of an artifact called the staff of ra. indiana deduces that
   the nazis are searching for tanis because it is believed to be the
   location of the ark of the covenant, the biblical chest built by the
   israelites to contain the fragments of the ten commandments; the nazis
   believe that if they acquire it, their armies will become invincible.
   the staff of ra, meanwhile, is the key to finding the well of souls, a
   secret chamber in which the ark is buried. the agents subsequently
   authorize indiana to recover the ark before the nazis. indiana travels
   to nepal, only to find that ravenwood has died and that the headpiece
   is in the possession of his daughter, marion, indiana's embittered
   former lover. indiana offers to buy the headpiece for three thousand
   dollars, plus two thousand more when they return to the united states.
   marion's tavern is suddenly raided by a group of thugs commanded by
   nazi agent toht. the tavern is burned down in the ensuing fight, during
   which toht burns his hand on the searing hot headpiece as he tries to
   grab it. indiana and marion escape with the headpiece, with marion
   declaring she will accompany indiana in his search for the ark so he
   can repay his debt. they travel to cairo where they learn from
   indiana's friend sallah, a skilled excavator, that belloq and the
   nazis, led by colonel dietrich, are currently digging for the well of
   souls with a replica of the headpiece modeled after the scar on toht's
   hand. in a bazaar, nazi operatives attempt to kidnap marion and as
   indiana chases after them it appears that she dies in an explosion.
   while deciphering the markings on the headpiece, indiana and sallah
   realize that the nazis have miscalculated the location of the well of
   souls. using this to their advantage, they infiltrate the nazi dig and
   use the staff of ra to determine the location correctly and uncover the
   well of souls, which is filled with snakes. indiana fends off the
   snakes and acquires the ark, but belloq, dietrich and the nazis arrive
   to take it. they toss marion into the well with indiana and seal them
   in, but they manage to escape. after a fistfight with a giant nazi
   mechanic, blowing up a flying wing on the airstrip, and chasing down a
   convoy of trucks, indiana takes back the ark before it can be shipped
   to berlin. indiana and marion leave cairo to escort the ark to england
   on board a tramp steamer. the next morning, their boat is boarded by
   belloq, dietrich and the nazis, who once again steal the ark and kidnap
   marion. indiana stows away on their u-boat and follows them to an
   isolated island in the aegean sea where belloq plans to test the power
   of the ark before presenting it to hitler. indiana reveals himself and
   threatens to destroy the ark with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher,
   but belloq calls his bluff, knowing indy cannot bear to eradicate an
   important historical artifact. indiana surrenders and is tied to a post
   with marion as belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the ark, which
   appears to contain nothing but sand. suddenly, spirits resembling old
   testament seraphim emerge from the ark. aware of the supernatural
   danger of looking at the opened ark, indiana warns marion to close her
   eyes. the apparitions suddenly morph into "angels of death", and
   lightning bolts begin flying out of the ark, gruesomely killing the
   nazi soldiers, while belloq, dietrich and toht meet even more gruesome
   fates. the fires rise into the sky, then fall back down to earth and
   the ark closes with a crack of thunder. back in washington, d.c., the
   army intelligence agents tell a suspicious indiana and brody that the
   ark "is someplace safe" to be studied by "top men". in reality, the ark
   is sealed in a wooden crate labeled "top secret" and stored in a giant
   government warehouse filled with countless similar crates.
