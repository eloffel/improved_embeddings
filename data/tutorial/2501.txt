crown: the community-enriched open id138

   crown is a semantic network and ontology built on top of [67]id138
   and is directly compatible with all id138-based software libraries
   and algorithms. crown is built using state-of-the-art machine learning
   to automatically enrich id138's existing network with new lemmas and
   senses from resources such as [68]wiktionary.

   this repository hosts the source code for building crown from scratch,
   all documentation for the project, and the issue tracker for bugs and
   feature requests.

why use crown?

     * significantly-expanded vocabulary that includes many missing terms
       in id138 --especially slang, idioms, and domain-specific
       terminology
     * seaid113ss compatibility as a drop in replacement for id138
     * regularly updated with new content

quick installation

   crown is distributed as stand-alone dictionaries in the id138 format,
   just like id138 3.1, from our [69]downloads site. see our
   [70]releases page for full details.

   if you use id138 on the command line, installation is easy! the
   software provided with id138 lets you seaid113ssly change the
   dictionary directory used by the software with the wnsearchdir
   environment variable. simply download the crown data release archive
   and unpack it. this should create a directory called dict containing
   crown. then set your wnsearchdir environment variable to the location
   of this directory, e.g.,
export wnsearchdir=/path/to/crown/dict

   for a more permanent installation, simply replace the id138 dict
   directory in the directory where id138 is installed (e.g.,
   /opt/local/share/id138-3.0/) with the crown dict.

   if you use libraries to interface with id138, crown can be used by
   providing the path to the crown dict directory instead of the usual
   id138 directory. see the id138 page for [71]related projects for
   library options in your language of choice.

documentation

   see our [72]project page for full details of the project. the
   [73]installation page has additional for detailed instructions on how
   to install crown on systems and how to integrate the resource with
   commonly-used software libraries. also, see our [74]frequently asked
   questions for additional details documentation.

   crown is also not possible without the extensive effort by the
   [77]id138 team in creating the resource and the wiktionary community
   in creating and maintaining a community-constructed dictionary.
