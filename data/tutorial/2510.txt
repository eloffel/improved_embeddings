baseline

   version [109]1.x

   baseline is a library for reproducible deep learning research and fast
   model development for nlp. the library provides easily extensible
   abstractions and implementations for data loading, model development,
   training and export of deep learning architectures. it also provides
   implementations for simple, high-performance, deep learning models for
   various nlp tasks, against which newly developed models can be
   compared. deep learning experiments are hard to reproduce, baseline
   provides functionalities to track them. the goal is to allow a
   researcher to focus on model development, delegating the repetitive
   tasks to the library.

   it has three components:
     * [110]baseline-core: an object-oriented python library for rapid
       development of deep learning algorithms. the library provides
       extensible base classes for common components in a deep learning
       architecture (data loading, model development, training,
       evaluation, and export) in tensorflow, pytorch and dynet. in
       addition, it provides strong, deep learning baselines for four
       fundamental nlp tasks -- [111]classification, [112]sequence
       tagging, [113]sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoders and
       [114]id38. many nlp problems can be seen as variants
       of these tasks. for example, part of speech (pos) tagging, named
       entity recognition (ner) and slot-filling are all sequence tagging
       tasks, id4 (id4) is typically modeled as an
       encoder-decoder task. an end-user can easily implement a new model
       and delegate the rest to the library.
     * [115]mead: a library built on for fast modeling, experimentation
       and development. it contains driver programs to run experiments
       from json configuration files to completely control the reader,
       trainer, model, and hyper-parameters.
     * [116]xpctl: a command-line interface to track experimental results
       and provide access to a global leaderboard. after running an
       experiment through mead, the results and the logs are committed to
       a database. several commands are provided to show the best
       experimental results under various constraints.

   the workflow for developing a deep learning model using baseline is
   simple:
    1. map the problem to one of the existing tasks using a <$task,
       dataset$> tuple, eg., ner on conll 2003 dataset is a <tagger task,
       conll>.
    2. use the existing implementations in baseline or extend the base
       model class to create a new architecture.
    3. define a configuration file in mead and run an experiment.
    4. use xpctl to compare the result with the previous experiments,
       commit the results to the leaderboard database and the model files
       to a persistent storage if desired.

   additionally, the base models provided by the library can be
   [117]exported from saved checkpoints directly into [118]tensorflow
   serving for deployment in a production environment. [119]the framework
   can be run within a docker container to reduce the installation
   complexity and to isolate experiment configurations and variants. it is
   actively maintained by a team of core developers and accepts public
   contributions.

installation

   baseline can be installed as a python package with the command
   ./install_dev.sh baseline.

   currently xpctl depends on baseline but baseline is not on pypi so you
   need to install baseline before you install xpctl with ./install_dev.sh
   xpctl

a note about versions

   deep learning frameworks are evolving quickly, and changes are not
   always backwards compatible. we recommend recent versions of each
   framework. baseline is known to work on most versions of tensorflow,
   and is currently being run on versions between 1.5 and 1.12. pytorch
   requires a version that is at least 0.4.
