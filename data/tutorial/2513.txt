100+ interesting data sets for statistics

   may 29, 2014 by [10]robb seaton

   [11]5-statistical-sins edit: hey guys! this has proved to be one of the
   most popular articles on the site, so i   ve created a supplemental
   download on the 5 biggest statistics mistakes beginners make and how to
   avoid them. enter your email below (or on any of the forms scattered
   around the site), and i   ll send it to you, along with ~2 emails per
   week on research backed techniques for achieving anything.

   here   s the form:

     if we have data, let   s look at data. if all we have are opinions,
     let   s go with mine.
        jim barksdale

   i   m not too fond of the phrase    information age.    it sounds like
   someone sat down and was like,    hey, there   s a ton of information
   today    what should we call it? how about the information age?   

   first of all, that   s just lazy and, second of all, it doesn   t capture
   how overwhelming it all is, the sort of angst and helplessness you feel
   when confronted with    everything. just all of it.

   a phrase that captures it a bit better is    drinking from the firehose.   
   i haven   t ever tried to drink from an actual firehose, but the metaphor
   certainly seems apt.

   [12]firehose
   maybe instead of information age, we could call it the saturation age,
   you know, because our brains are full to bursting. or maybe just the
   overload age. or how about the age of inundation?

   one thing is certain, anyways. some of us are drowning in data, most of
   us are oblivious, and some lucky few are surfing on it.  we can do
   things that we couldn   t in the past (e.g. without project gutenberg,
   neither of my [13]two [14]analyses of the [15]relationship between
   creativity and compression would have been possible.)

   and that got me wondering: just what other interesting data sets are
   out there? as part of my research, i decided to put together this sort
   of guided tour, a curated list if you will     adding a bit of structure
   to the firehose   s deluge.

   here   s my attempt at making it all just a bit more manageable.

interesting data sets

   [16]interesting-data-sets-for-statistics
   * if, tomorrow, you get an email congratulating you on your new status
   as future jeopardy contestant, how are you going to prepare? well, one
   approach might be to download [17]this archive of 216,930 past jeopardy
   questions and plug them into [18]your favorite spaced repetition
   system. combine that with reading up on jeopardy betting strategies,
   and you   re well on your way to becoming the next [19]arthur chu (except
   [20]hopefully nicer).
     * ever get a morbid curiosity about what it   s like to be on death
       row? (yeah, me neither.) but in case you ever have, texas has
       graciously placed the [21]last words of every inmate executed since
       1984 online. so    id31, anyone? (   how upbeat are death
       row inmates days before execution? with a little help from some
       data, we found out!   )
     * speaking of prison, there   s more data on prisoners, including
       information about    their current offense and sentence, criminal
       history, family background and personal characteristics, prior drug
       and alcohol use and treatment programs, gun possession and use, and
       prison activities, programs, and services    available [22]here.
     * how about reading other people   s emails? ever wanted to do that,
       but can   t be bothered to train l33t hacking skills (and never mind
       the legality of it)? (okay, this one i have thought about.) well,
       i   ve got you covered. check out [23]the enron corpus. it contains
       more than half a million emails from about 150 users, mostly senior
       management of enron, organized into folders. wikipedia calls it
          unique in that it is one of the only publicly available mass
       collections of    real    emails easily available for study.    business
       idea: figure out what sort of information gets leaked in the emails
       that will later harm the execs at trial or whatever, then build a
       software system to automatically mine those out of real email.
       either sell it to law enforcement or to corporate executives as the
       finest cover-your-ass email system.
     * wondering what the internet really cares about? well, i don   t know
       about that, but you could answer an easier question: what does
       reddit care about? someone has scraped the top 2.5 million reddit
       posts and then [24]placed them on github. now you can figure out
       (with data!) just how much redditors love cats. or how about a data
       backed equivalent of r/circlejerk? (the original use case was
       determining [25]what domains are the most popular.)
     * speaking of cats, here are [26]10,000 annotated images of cats.
       this ought to come in handy whenever i get around to training a
       robot to exterminate all non-cat lifeforms. (or, if you   re google,
       you could just train a cat recognition algorithm and then send
       those users cat-specific advertising.)

   [27]bad-dalek-drawing
     * if you   re interested in building financial algorithms or, really,
       just predicting arbitrage opportunities for one of america   s
       largest cash crops, check out [28]this data set, which tracks the
       price of marijuana from september 2nd, 2010 until about the
       present.
     * [29]who   s using what drugs and how often?
     * the earliest recorded chess match dates back to the 10th century,
       played between a historian from baghdad and a student. since then,
       it   s become a tradition for moves to be recorded     especially if a
       game has some significance, like a showdown between two strong
       players. as a consequence, today, students of the game benefit from
       one of the richest data sets of any game or sport. perhaps the best
       freely available data set of games is known as the    million base,   
       boasting some 2.2 million matches. you can download it [30]here. i
       can imagine an app that calculates your chess fingerprint, letting
       you know what grandmaster your play is most similar to, or an
       analysis of how play style has changed over time.
     * on the topic of games, for soccer fans, i recently came across this
       [31]freely available data set of soccer games, players, teams,
       goals, and more. if that   s not enough, you can grab even more data
       via this [32]soccermetrics api python wrapper. i imagine that this
       could come in handy for coaches attempting to get an edge over
       opponent teams and, more generally, for that cross-section between
       geeks and gamblers attempting to build analytic models to make
       better bets.
     * google has put made all their google books id165 data freely
       available. an id165 is an n word phrase, and the data set includes
       1-grams through 5-grams. the data set is    based originally on 5.2
       million books published between 1500 and 2008.    i can imagine using
       it to determine the most overused, cliche phrases, and those
       phrases that are in danger of becoming cliched. (quick! someone
       register the domain clichealert.com!)
     * amazon has a number of [33]freely available data sets (although i
       think you need to run your analysis on top of their cloud, aws),
       including more than 2.8 billion webpages courtesy [34]common crawl.
       the possibilities are endless, but an old business idea i had:
       analyze the common crawl data and determine cheap or
       not-currently-registered domains which are, for whatever reason,
       linked to buy many websites. buy these up and then resell them to
       people involved in seo. (or you could, you know, try to build the
       next google.)
     * how well do minorities do on the computer science advanced
       placement exam? you can [35]find out and tell me.
     * there   s the million song data set, which contains information about
       a million different songs, including a metric    danceability.    might
       be nice to pair that with a media player specialized for parties    
       start with    conversation    music, and slowly shift to more danceable
       stuff as the night drags on. the data could also be used for a
       id91 algorithm (automatic genre detection, maybe), but i   m
       not sure how useful that   d be. a number of people have tried to
       build recommendation algorithms based on the data, including
       [36]kagglers and [37]a team from cornell. one possible use:
       analyzing music by year     how danceable, fast, etc. were the 70s?
       80s? 90s? (or how about looking for a follow-the-leader effect. if
       one song goes viral with a unique style, do a bunch of copycats
       follow?)
     * speaking of music data sets, last.fm has music data available.
       collected from ~360,000 users, it   s in the form of    user, artists,
       ## of plays   . this would be good for id91 algorithms that
       automatically determine label genre or recommender systems. (even a
          this artist is most similar to    thing would be sorta cool.)
     * when i think geeks, i think math and computer geeks, but there are
       many more. terry pratchett geeks (dated one!), whovians, anime
       geeks, theater geeks and, with some relevance to this next data
       set, comic book geeks. cesc rossell  , ricardo alberich, and joe
       miro have put together [38]a    social graph    of the marvel universe,
       and the data is freely available. ideas for use: maybe it could be
       overlaid on facebook   s social graph to produce a new take on the
          what superhero are you?    quiz.
     * yelp has a [39]freely available subset of their data, including
       restaurant rankings and reviews. one business idea: use tweets to
       predict restaurant star ratings. this would enable you to build out
       a yelp competitor without requiring an active user base     you could
       just mine twitter for data!
     * if you   re interested in data about data (metadata!), j  rgen
       schw  rzler, a statistician from google   s public data team, has put
       together a [40]list of the most frequently searched for data. the
       top 5 are school comparisons, unemployment, population, sales tax,
       and salaries. i was surprised that school comparisons were number 1
       but, then again, i don   t have any brats running around (yet?). this
       list would be a good first step in researching what sort of data
       comparisons people actually care about.
     * some of my readers are, no doubt, evil geniuses. others want to
       save the world. there   s a subset of both of these groups who are
       interested in superintelligent robots. but to build such a robot,
       you   re going to have to teach it facts. all the things we take for
       granted, like that every person has one father. it would be a pain
       to insert those 10 million facts by hand (and, at a fact a minute,
       take more than 19 years). thankfully, freebase has [41]done part of
       the job for you, making more than 1.9 billion facts freely
       available.
     * maybe your plans are slightly less ambitious. you don   t want to
       build a superintelligent machine, just one smarter than your run of
       the mill mathematician. if that   s the case, you   re going to need to
       teach your machine a lot about mathematics, probably in the form of
       proofs and theorems. in that case, check out the [42]mizar project,
       which has formalized more than 9400 definitions and 49000 theorems.
     * and let   s say you build this mathematician and, sure, it can help
       you with proofs, but so what? you long for someone you can connect
       with on a deeper level. someone who can summarize any topic
       imaginable. in that case, you might want to feed your robot on
       wikipedia data. while all of wikipedia is [43]freely available,
       [44]dbpedia is an attempt to synthesize it into a more structured
       format.
     * now, you get tired of mathematics and wikipedia. it turns out that
       proofs don   t pay the bills, so instead you decide to become a
       software engineer. somehow, though, you   ve managed to build these
       machines without ever a rudimentary understanding of programming,
       and you want a machine that will teach it to you. but where to find
       the data for such a thing? you might start with downloading all
       [45]7.3 million stackoverflow questions. (actually, all the
       stackexchange data is freely available, so you could feed it more
       math information from both mathoverflow and the other math
       stackexchange. plus statistics from cross validated, and so on.)
     * ever wanted to study true friendship? (c   mon! free your inner
       <s>child</s> social scientist.) y   know, genuine, platonic love,
       like the kind embodied by dolphins? well, now you can! all thanks
       to your humble author and mark newman, who   s placed a network of
       [46]   frequent associations between 62 dolphins in a community
       living off doubtful sound, new zealand.    business idea: flippr.
       it   s like facebook, but for dolphins, with plans to expand into
       emerging whale and sea turtle markets. most revenue will come from
       sardine sales.
     * do left-leaning blogs more often link to other left-leaning blogs
       than right-leaning ones? well, i don   t know, but it sounds
       reasonable. and, thanks to permission from lada adamic, you can
       download [47]her network of hyperlinks between weblogs on us
       politics, recorded in 2005. (or you could just [48]read her paper.
       spoilers: conservatives more freely link to other conservatives
       than liberals link to liberals so, if you   re interested in link
       building, maybe you should register republican.<a
       href=   #citation-1   ><sup>1</sup></a>
       )
     * who   s friendlier: the average jazz musician or the average dolphin?
       you could find out by combining the dolphin data set mentioned
       earlier with pablo m. gleiser and leon danon   s [49]jazz musicians
       network data set.
     * what about 1930s southern women or prisoners? who   s friendlier? how
       about fraternity members or ham radio operators? all this and more
       can be figured out with [50]these network data sets.
     * how about dolphins [51]or slashdotters?
     * web 2.0 websites (like reddit) are sometimes gamed by    voting
       rings,    which are groups of people that intentionally vote up each
       other   s content, regardless of quality. i   ve often wondered if the
       same thing happens in academic circles. like, you know, one night
       during your first year in grad school, you   re kidnapped in the
       middle of the night and made to swear a blood oath that you   ll cite
       every other member of the club. or something. well, stanford has
       put online [52]arxiv   s high energy physics paper citation network,
       so you could find out.
     * you read this blog, so you   re pretty smart, right? and maybe you   d
       like to be rich, you know, so you can found the next bill and
       melinda gates foundation and save the world. (because that   s why
       you want to be rich, right?) well, then maybe you ought to develop
       some new-fangled trading algorithm and pick up like a trillion
       pennies from in front of the metaphorical steam-roller that is the
       market. (quantitative finance!) but, in such a case, you   d better
       at least test your strategy on historical market data. market data
       which you can get [53]here.
     * the [54]open product data website aims to make barcode data
       available for every brand for free. business idea: a specialty
       tattoo parlor that only does barcode tattoos, but lets customers
       pick whatever product they want. think about it:    what   s your
       tattoo mean?       it   s a twinkie barcode, because twinkies last
       forever, man, just like my faith.   
     * the european center for medium-range weather forecasts has [55]an
       impressive looking collection of weather data. why, you ask, does
       the weather matter? the economic incentives for predicting the
       weather are absurd. when should you plant crops? plan a big event?
       launch a space shuttle? go deep sea fishing? but i want to talk
       about the most fun application of weather data i   m aware of: the
       financial industry. i have a lot of respect for finance, mostly
       because of the crazy stuff they do. the only practical application
       of neutrinos i   ve heard of, for instance, is    [56]because finance.   
       should your algorithm buy indonesian sesame seed futures? with
       weather data, it might know.

   [57]complaints-about-weather
   * if you need nutrition data about food, the usda [58]has you covered.
   business idea: a phone application called,    am i allergic to that?   
   then, lobby for your state to pass some law regulating each school into
   buying a license of it for every student.
     * for a wordsmith, a good dictionary is indispensable, and when it
       comes to word data, you could do a lot worse than check out the
       freely available [59]id138. id138 has significant advantages
       over your run of the mill dictionary as it focuses on the structure
       of language, grouping words into    sets of cognitive synonyms
       (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.    it also has some
       information about relationships, such as    a chair has legs.   
     * we   ve already established that some of you are evil geniuses, in
       which case, where are you going to build your secret lair? i mean,
       a volcano is pretty cool, but is it evil and genius enough for
       competing in today   s modern world? you know what the other evil
       geniuses don   t have? a secret base on a planet outside of the solar
       system. with [60]nasa   s list, you can get busy commissioning
       someone to build you a base on koi-3284.01.<a
       href=   #citation-2   ><sup>2</sup></a>
     * the federal railroad administration keeps [61]a list of    railroad
       safety information including accidents and incidents, inventory and
       highway-rail crossing data.    someone (like the ny times) could
       overlay this on a map of the united states and figure out if people
       in poor regions are more likely to be hit by trains or something.
     * if you need a database of comprehensive book data, perhaps to build
       a competitor to goodreads or an online digital library, the open
       library allows people to [62]freely download their entire database.
     * who is the united states killing with drones? if you   re content
       with pakistan specific data, there is a [63]list of drone strikes
       available here.
     * if you   re interested in building a papers2 competitor with support
       for automatically importing citation data (please do this),
       crossref metadata search might be [64]a good place to check out.
     * mnemosyne is a virtual flash card program that takes advantage of
       spaced repetition to maximize learning. (as you might recall, i   m a
       [65]big fan of spaced repetition.) the project has been collecting
       user data for years, and gwern has [66]graciously agreed to freely
       host the data for a few months. perhaps one could run some sort of
       unsupervised learning algorithm over it and try to discover
       heretofore unknown information about human memory.
     * how much would it cost to hire justin bieber to play at your
       wedding? the fine lads at priceconomics have figured out [67]how
       much it would cost to hire your favorite band. you could take this
       data and calculate some sort of popularity to price ratio     what   s
       the most fame for your buck?
     * i   ve mentioned in a few of the other data sets just how lucrative
       it is to be able to better predict the stock market than everyone
       else. in 2011, researchers found that they could [68]use data from
       twitter to do just that: they went through tweets, found one   s
       related to publicly traded companies, and then calculated a mood
       score. with this they write,     we find an accuracy of 86.7% in
       predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of
       the djia.    a number of twitter data sets are freely available
       [69]here.
     * a [70]2014 paper by clifford winston and fred mannering reports
       that vehicle traffic costs the united states 100 billion dollars
       each year.<a href=   #citation-3   ><sup>3</sup></a> there   s money to
       be made, then, in routing traffic more efficiently. one way to do
       this would be to feed an algorithm historical traffic data and then
       use that to predict hotspots, which you would route people around.
       lots of that data is available on [71]data.gov.
     * on the other hand, if you were building an app to track current
       traffic data, you   ll need a [72]different data source.
     * if you want to launch a spam-fighting service, or maybe just
       analyze what type of emails spammers are sending, you   ll need data.
       [73]uc irvine has you covered.
     * but maybe you want to extend your spam-fighting service to text
       messages. [74]still got you covered.
     * there is a wealth of data sets available for r and all you have to
       do is install a package. [75]ecdat is one of those packages,
       containing gobs of econometric data. how about an analysis of how
       math levels correlate with number of cigarettes smoked? i   d read
       that.

   [76]the-erdos-peak
   * ever wondered about how one person will be on the board of directors
   of several companies and it   s like, hey, maybe condoleezza rice with
   her ties to government surveillance isn   t the best choice for dropbox?
   what if you could analyze those connections? well, with [77]this data
   set, you can. but only for norway     it   s a network of the board members
   of public companies in norway.
     * ever seen a tv show where a government determines that someone is a
       terrorist based on their social ties? i always figured that data
       would be locked down tight somewhere, y   know, classified. but it
       turns out it isn   t. you, too, can [78]analyze the social networks
       of terrorists.
     * there   s been a fair bit of controversy around all the bureaucracy
       of wikipedia. but how does one become a bona fide wikipedia big
       shot? who   s the ideal wikipedia administrator? well, they   re voted
       for, and [79]the data is available for download.
     * harvard has opened up [80]its set of    over 12 million bibliographic
       records for materials held by the harvard library, including books,
       journals, electronic resources, manuscripts, archival materials,
       scores, audio, video and other materials.   
     * if you need small data sets for students, check out [81]dasl. one
       at random: [82]does sterilizing dominant males in a wild mustang
       population reduce the population?
     * get-evidence has put up public genomes [83]for download. i think
       steven pinker   s data is in there someone. maybe you could make
       yourself a clone?
     * oh, and speaking of genomes, the 1000 genomes project has made ~260
       terabytes of genome data downloadable.
     * in what is the smallest data set on this list, the [84]survival
       rates of men and women on the titanic. female passengers were ~4x
       times more likely to survive than male passengers.
     * want an super specific breakdown of the contents of your food?
       [85]you   re in luck. (thanks canada!)
     * there   s a similar database of the [86]metabolites in the human
       body. i   m not sure what you could do with it, but it might come in
       handy in some sort of dystopian future where humans are raised like
       cattle for their nutrients. (maybe someone could use this to build
       a viral marketing campaign along the lines of,    how nutritious is
       your mom?   )

   [87]calories-in-a-human * the reference energy disaggregation data set
   has [88]about 500 gb of compressed data on home energy use. obvious use
   candidates: improving home efficiency or creating a visualization of
   just where people   s energy bills are going.
     * invented a new image compression algorithm (pied piper, anyone?)
       and need data to test it on? look no further than the csail   s
       [89]tiny image data set.
     * or maybe tiny images are too tiny. in that case, try the
       [90]id163 database, which is structured around the id138
       hierarchy. so if you want to teach an algorithm what a narwhal
       looks like, this would be a good place to start. (this coming from
       someone who   s sister thought narwhals were mythical until the age
       of 18.)
     * still not enough? how about [91]all the wikipedia images?
     * let   s say you   re [92]building the next generation of book reader,
       and you want to automatically associate phrases with the relevant
       wikipedia article. how? stanford in association with google
       research has you covered with their
       [93]english-phrase-to-associated-wikipedia-article database. the
       research paper can be downloaded [94]here.
     * yandex, the russian search engine, has [95]made a bunch of search
       data available. namely, if someone searches for something, what do
       they click on? downsides: it   s a russian search engine with russian
       search results.
     * just what kind of edits do people usually make on wikipedia? i
       don   t know, but [96]you can figure it out with this data set.
     * did you know that google has [97]a search engine for data sets?
     * pew research has many free data sets, including [98]their    global
       attitudes project    archive. questions this data could answer: is
       the world becoming more progressive over time? how have attitudes
       towards religion shifted over time?
     * speaking of public attitudes over time, you can download a [99]set
       of the general social survey from 1972 until about 2012, which
       should answer both of those questions.
     * there   s a fun math problem called the celebrity problem, which asks
       you to find the person who everyone knows, but who knows nobody.
       but what about the real life celebrity problem? try yahoo   s
       [100]collection of celebrity faces.
     * need a billion webpages from february 2009? maybe to train a never
       ending language learner named [101]nell? [102]yup, it   s available.

   [103]computer-declares-war
   * did you know that you can download [104]all the pdfs on arxiv? once
   we manage to teach machines natural language, we can just have a
   computer read it all and give us the cliff notes (and the scientific
   breakthroughs).
     * if you need economic census data on any industry, check out
       census.gov   s [105]industry statistics portal. if finance is really
       evil, you ought to be able to find something damning in the data.
     * for those unfamiliar with usenet, it   s sort of like a huge,
       text-only forum. it was much more popular before the rise of the
       world wide web. anyways, you can download a huge data set of
       postings to usenet [106]here. it might be pretty good for some kind
       of textual analysis project or training a machine learning
       algorithm (maybe a spellchecker?) you could use the data to build
       out a google groups competitor, too.
     * nick bostrom has a very interesting paper called [107]   existential
       risk prevention as global priority.    the basic intuition is that
       preventing even small risks of human extinction is worthwhile if we
       consider all the human generations it would save. one way to start
       saving all those future lives might be by digging into this data
       set of [108]every recorded meteor impact on earth from 2500 bce to
       2012.
     * how do gender and mental illness affect crime? [109]this data set
       was collected explicitly with that question in mind.
     * speaking of mental health, if you   re interested in how it affects
       minorities specifically, try [110]this.
     * there are a lot of lonely men and women out there, and some of
       those lonely men and women have excellent analytical skills. for
       those lonely people, i suggest using [111]this data set, which
          surveyed how americans met their spouses and romantic partners,
       and compared traditional to non-traditional couples    to determine
       the best way to meet that special someone.

   [112]drawing-of-world-news-tonight
     * tons of data on what is called    adolescent health    available
       [113]here, but is actually more, including a bunch of relationship
       data and biomarkers. (not creatine levels, unfortunately.)
     * here   s a question: are modern jobs worse than those of the past? my
       grandparents built tires at firestone. today, people rarely have
       that level of control and visceral experience of the finished
       product of their work. this [114]set of five surveys regarding how
       different groups experience employment could answer that question.
       i can see the article now        is everything getting slightly worse?
       we found out.   
     * stanford has [115]35 million amazon reviews available for download.
       lot   s of stuff you could do with this: use it to improve
       recommendation algorithms, figure out whether or not there   s a
       follow-the-leader effect with reviews (i.e. do early positive
       reviews beget more positive reviews?)
     * based on some of my research prior to writing this, the google
       keyword    data sets on serial killers    is 1) really specific and 2)
       weirdly popular, but i guess there   s no accounting for taste. and,
       of course, we   ve [116]got data for that, thanks to the serial
       killer information center.<a href=   #citation-4   ><sup>4</sup></a>
     * in this gruesome vein, the university of maryland has a    global
       terrorism database,    which is a set of more than 113,000 terror
       incidents. you can download it [117]after filling out a form. ideas
       for use: visualization of terror incidents by location over time,
       predicting and preventing terror attacks, and creating early alert
       systems for vulnerable areas.
     * the [118]mnist database is a classic in the field of machine
       learning. it   s a set of labeled hand-written characters, which are
       necessary for ocr algorithms. today, some algorithms are actually
       more accurate than human judges! this would have been nice to have
       back when i was in grade school. i distinctly recall once arguing
       with a teacher over missing a question because she insisted that i
       had written the letter j when it was clearly a d. in the future,
       we   ll let the machines decide.
     * uci has a [119]poker hand data set available. my poker-fu is fairly
       weak, but i   m sure there   s some interesting analysis to be done
       there. i   ve heard second hand that humans still maintain some
       advantage over machines when it comes to poker, but i   m unable to
       verify that via google. machines have won in [120]at least one
       tournament.
     * another data set from uci: [121]images labeled as either
       advertisements or non-advertisements. this is good for building up
       classification algorithms that decide whether or not a new image is
       an ad or not, which might be good for, say, automatic ad blocking
       or spam detection. or maybe a google glass application that filters
       out real life advertisements. that   d be cool. look at a billboard
       and instead see a virtual extension of the natural landscape.
     * remember the whole star wars kid debacle? wikipedia informs me that
       attack of the show rated it the number 1 viral video of all time.
       andy baio, one of the guys who was in on it before it was cool and
       coined the phrase    star wars kid    has made [122]his server logs
       from the time publicly available. someone could take this data and
       produce a visualization of who saw it when via maps, along with
       annotations of where the traffic was coming from.
     * who   s linking to who (and what) on wordpress? (tidbit: most of the
       links to this site come from wordpress blogs.) with [123]this
       wordpress crawl, you can find out. visualizing the network might be
       sorta cool, but it   d be cooler still to uncover some information
       about    supernodes    that either are linked to often or put out a lot
       of links (or maybe both). or maybe id91 people by interest.
     * is obama in bed with big oil? or extremist environmentalists? or
       the corn lobbies? and who was backing that herman cain dude,
       anyways? the [124]2012 presidential campaign finance data is
       available for download. it would be neat to see an analysis of what
       industries prefer what candidates.
     * [125]which private colleges are the best value?
     * [126]which public colleges are the best value?
     * [127]cigarette data by state. kentucky smokes the most, with west
       virginia as a close second. given the [128]massive social harm of
       tobacco, a good analysis could very well save a lot of lives.

   [129]superhero * [130]on december 5th of 2008, what was being
   downloaded from the pirate bay?
     * want to build a reddit recommendation engine? (or, better yet, how
       about just a filter for the stupid-but-popular opinions?) well,
       here   s [131]the data a redditor is using to do just that. the
       recommendation engine, i mean.
     * [132]global health data. this would be great for identifying
       high-impact ways to improve world health, like the schistosomiasis
       control initiative, which is one of givewell   s [133]top rated
       charities.
     * [134]united states crime from 1960 to 2012. i   d like to see a graph
       of rape per capita over time (which, from a brief peek at the data,
       is dropping.) and then add the data for prison rape, which is
       morally repugnant but apparently a-okay to joke about on
       television.
     * how about launching a [135]yelp-for-bathrooms?
     * did you know that the best-selling item in canadian grocery stores
       is kraft dinner (aka macaroni and cheese)? i wonder how it sells in
       belgium or taiwan. here   s some [136]supermarket data from there.
     * [137]data on usage of the firefox web browser. records things like
       number of tabs used, time active, number of private tabs opened.
       while that last point might allow for some titillating finds
       (private browsing is for porn!), it might be neat to see how
       accurate self-reports of time on internet compare to the actual
       data.
     * this one is super cool: mozilla has put together [138]a data set of
       the more than 200,000 bugs found in mozilla and eclipse. i would
       love to see a breakdown of what bugs are the most common and how
       they can be prevented. software solutions would be worth a lot of
       money. programming languages could be designed around them.
     * if you   re interested in the design of scheduling algorithms (i
       am!), google has [139]released a data set of the sort of jobs that
       they   re running on their clusters. developing algorithms against
       this data set might help future proof your discoveries. after all,
       tomorrow   s desktop might look a lot like today   s data center.
     * techcrunch released a [140]data set with more than 400,000 company,
       investor, and entrepreneur profiles, along with an additional
       45,000 investment rounds. this might be a good way to reverse
       engineer what the market   s looking for and what investors are
       funding.
     * [141]1.25 million delicious.com bookmarks.
     * [142]where are the united states   s major military installations
       located?
     * [143]who receives h1-b visas? might be interesting to know if some
       countries are more likely to get into the program or which
       companies    consume    the majority of the visas.
     * the [144]twitter users most likely to be followed by users of
       hacker news.
     * here   s [145]all the earthquakes between 1000 and 1903. feeding them
       to a neural net and seeing what kind of predictions you get out
       might be neat. (and, hey, if you develop something better than the
       status quo, you can sell it and save lives!)
     * i   ve often wondered if the people who take personality tests online
       are more neurotic than the population at large. there   s a lot of
       data from a series of online personality tests available [146]here,
       so you could compare their answers to those from the population at
       large, find out, and then send me an email.
     * and, finally, something i would have loved as a kid: [147]the list
       to end all lists of naughty words.

     * if you   re interested in building predictive models, max kuhn   s
       [148]applied predictive modeling is awesome and i highly recommend
       it. if you   re interested in visualizations, i   ve heard good things
       about tufte   s [149]the visual display of quantitative information,
       but i haven   t read it myself. (edit: commenter divm recommends
       [150]visualize this and [151]the functional art over tufte.)
     * i   ve written [152]two [153]posts that use project gutenberg data to
       examine the [154]link between creativity and compression.
     * for building visualizations, excel 2013 has a [155]new    power map   
       feature, which looks dead simple.
