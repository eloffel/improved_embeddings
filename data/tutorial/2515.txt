groundhog by lisa-groundhog

   warning: groundhog development is over. please consider using
   [81]blocks instead. for an example of machine translation using blocks
   please see [82]blocks-examples repository

   groundhog is a python framework on top of theano
   ([83]http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) that aims to provide a
   flexible, yet efficient way of implementing complex recurrent neural
   network models. it supports a variety of recurrent layers, such as
   dt-id56, dot-id56, id56 with gated hidden units and lstm. furthermore, it
   enables the flexible combination of various layers, for instance, to
   build a neural translation model.

   this is a version forked from the original groundhog
   ([84]https://github.com/pascanur/groundhog) developed by razvan
   pascanu, caglar gulcehre and kyunghyun cho. this fork will be the
   version developed and maintained by the members of the lisa lab at the
   university of montreal. the main contributors and maintainers of this
   fork are currently dzmitry bahdanau and kyunghyun cho.

   most of the library documentation is still work in progress, but check
   the files containing tut (in tutorials) for a quick tutorial on how to
   use the library.

   the library is under the 3-clause bsd license, so it may be used for
   commercial purposes.

installation

   to install groundhog in a multi-user setting (such as the lisa lab)

   python setup.py develop --user

   for general installation, simply use

   python setup.py develop

   note: this will install the development version of theano, if theano is
   not currently installed.
