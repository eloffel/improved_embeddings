[32]lecture 6, jan. 26th, 2015: training neural networks

   in this lecture we continue with our introduction to neural networks.
   specifically we will discuss how to train neural networks: i.e. the
   id26 algorithm

   please study the following material in preparation for the class:
     * [33]hugo larochelle   s video lectures 2.1 to 2.7.
     * [34]chapters 6 of the deep learning textbook  (section 6.3)

[37]lecture 5, jan. 22, 2015. pylearn2 primer

   we will cover how to install pylearn2 on a machine which already meets
   the requirements. for information on how to install prerequisites,
   refer to your platform-specific documentation.

requirements

     * theano (bleeding-edge installation) and its dependencies
     * pyyaml
     * pil (for some image-related functionalities
     * [38]setuptools or [39]distribute

   more information available [40]here.

lecture material

   slides and code presented at this lecture can be found at vincent   s
   [41]class repository.

   the easiest way to follow along, given that you have pylearn2
   installed, is to clone the whole repo and change directory
   into lectures/2015_01_22.

[43]lecture 4, jan. 19, 2015

   lecture 4 will start with the end of vincent   s theano tutorial from
   lecture 3 (15-20 min).

   then we will have our first discussion session (i.e. flipped
   class). please study the following material in preparation for the
   discussion:
     * [44]hugo larochelle   s video lectures 1.1 to 1.6.
     * [45]chapters 6 of the deep learning textbook  (sections 6.1 and
       6.2)

   please post questions for the discussion (we will cover all comments to
   lectures 1-4). also, we can also cover background material (by
   request):
     * chapters 1-5 of a book draft on [46]deep learning,  by yoshua
       bengio, ian goodfellow and aaron courville.

[48]lecture 3, jan. 15, 2015

   what will be covered:
     * solution to the numpy + mnist + mlp assignment
     * git primer
     * theano primer
     * porting numpy + mnist + mlp to theano

   slides can be found [49]here. you can bring your laptop to follow along
   if you   d like to.

   if you haven   t already, it would be a very good idea to create a github
   account for the lecture.

update

   a student pointed out that the batch version of the outer product used
   in the solution could be implemented using a dot product:
v_grad = (h[:, :, none] * (y - t)[:, none, :]).mean(axis=0)

   becomes
v_grad = numpy.dot(h.t, y - t) / h.shape[0]

   for instance. not only is it simpler to write and understand, but it
   also greatly speeds up computation. the assignment solution has been
   updated accordingly.

   thanks for the intervention!

   detailed review of neural networks.

   please study the following material in preparation for the lecture:
     * [52]hugo larochelle   s video lectures 1.1 to 1.6.
     * [53]chapter 6 of the deep learning textbook  (sections 6.1 and 6.2)

   do not forget to leave questions / comments / answers.

   addition reference material:
     * [54]hinton   s coursera lecture 1, videos 1 to 5.
