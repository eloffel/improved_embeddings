ibm watson machine learns the art of writing a good headline

   the team behind ibm's natural language processing and machine learning
   engine create a deep learning-based system whose document summaries
   rival those written by humans.
   [watsoncomputer.jpg]
   video: ibm watson ... in less than two minutes ibm watson does more
   than just win at jeopardy. find out what it's capable of ... in less
   than two minutes!

   ibm watson's ability to answer questions is being put to good use in
   [60]fields ranging from healthcare to finance.

   watson's natural language processing and machine learning engine
   underpins a suite of language recognition, id161 and data
   analytics services offered by ibm, and behind the scenes researchers
   continue to refine the smart system's capabilities.

       changed the world

   the [65]latest breakthrough by the team working on watson's question
   and answering algorithms is to create a "state-of-the-art" system for
   automatically summarising documents.

   the team used a deep learning approach, previously used for machine
   translation and to automatically caption videos, to produce short
   summaries of [66]millions of english newswire reports.

   "in this work, we focus on the task of text summarization, which can
   also be naturally thought of as mapping an input sequence of words in a
   source document to a target sequence of words called summary," write
   ibm us researchers ramesh nallapati, bing xiang and bowen zhou in the
   [67]paper.

   the deep learning-based sequence-to-sequence approach they used is more
   commonly used for machine translation. the team writes that summarising
   text is significantly different in that the summary is typically short
   and doesn't heavily depend on the length of the document and that,
   unlikely machine translation, it's acceptable to omit all but the key
   concepts in the source material.

   despite these differences this approach, of using an attentional
   encoder-decoder [68]recurrent neural network to summarise text,
   "significantly outperforms" the recent [69]state-of-the art model used
   by facebook to generate summaries.

   "they are surprisingly good and would easily pass muster for a human
   generated summary in most cases," write the ibm team.

   "our results strongly demonstrate that the sequence-to-sequence models
   are extremely promising for summarization."

   the team's future work will focus on investigating ways to effectively
   generate rare words in the summary, which they say "appears to be a
   glaring weakness in the existing models".

   creating machines that can summarise a text in a way that captures its
   core meaning is important if we want computers to begin to gain a
   human-like understanding of language. demand for automated summaries
   and computer-generated reports is also growing as technology advances
   to the point where it can output competent write ups. recently
   narrative science, which offers automated report writing service quill,
   [70]said its revenues are doubling each year.

   as well as offering watson services to developers to build third party
   apps, ibm ceo ginni rometty recently [71]said that ibm is "investing
   aggressively in new opportunities like watson health, watson internet
   of things" as the technology giant attempts to counter declines in its
   traditional business areas.

   this focus on new technologies such as watson is, according to credit
   suisse analyst kulbinder garcha, part of a [72]"painful multi-year
   turnaround", as ibm attempts to reduce its reliance on earnings from
   its hardware, operating systems and traditional services businesses,
   which are being squeezed by a gradual shift to cloud computing.
