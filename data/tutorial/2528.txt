facebook   s artificial intelligence research lab releases open source fasttext
on github

   every day, billions of pieces of content are shared on [7]facebook . to
   keep up with the data, facebook has been using a variety of tools to
   classify text. traditional methods of classification, like deep neural
   networks are accurate, but have serious training requirements.

   in an effort to classify both accurately and easily,
   facebook   s artificial intelligence research (fair) lab developed
   fasttext. today, fasttext is going open source so developers can
   implement its libraries anywhere.

   fasttext supports both text classification and learning word vector
   representations through techniques like bag of words [8]and subword
   information. based on the skip-gram model, words are represented as bag
   of character id165s with vectors representing each character id165.

      in order to be efficient on datasets with a very large number of
   categories, fasttext uses a hierarchical classifier, in which the
   different categories are organized in a tree, instead of a flat
   structure (think binary tree instead of list),    said facebook
   authors armand joulin, edouard grave, piotr bojanowski, and tomas
   mikolov in a post.

   for those less artificially intelligent, the bag of words process is
   fast because it essentially ignores word order and instead focuses on
   the occurrences of a word.    words    [9]are represented in a
   multidimensional space and id202 is used to calculate the
   relationship between a query and a categorized set of words. remember
   that when we feed a computer text, we are starting from scratch. to
   adults, grammar is intuitive     we know what words are, where they end
   and where they begin. computers can handle the most complex
   computational challenges, but can struggle to differentiate    i love
   techcrunch    from    crunchlove itech.    methods like this essentially
   take a qualitative analysis problem and force it to be quantitative
   through the addition of statistics.

   these techniques enable fasttext to be faster than traditional deep
   learning methods. facebook created this nifty comparison chart to show
   us side-by-side accuracy.

   fasttext is not restricted to english and can work with other languages
   including german, spanish, french, and czech.

   earlier this month, facebook [10]implemented an anti-clickbait
   algorithm into its newsfeed. while the algo is quite complicated and
   focuses on both behavioral identifiers and language, fasttext enables
   developers to create similar tools themselves.

   not to brag, but facebook says that the new open source technology can
   be    trained on more than 1 billion words in less than 10 minutes using
   a standard multicore cpu. fasttext can also classify a half-million
   sentences among more than 300,000 categories in less than five
   minutes.    #humblebrag

   starting today, facebook   s fasttext will be available [11]from their
   github.
