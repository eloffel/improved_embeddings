introduction

   the etymological id138 project provides information about how words
   in different languages are etymologically related. the information is
   for the most part mined from [2]wiktionary. the semi-structured data is
   turned into a machine-readable etymological database that also
   incorporates some additional manually added etymological relationships.

browse online

   a very basic interface to (an older version of) the data is provided at
   [3]lexvo.com. a more advanced browsing interface will be available
   later.

   who would have thought that the english word "muscular" and the german
   word for the animal "bat" share the same origins?
