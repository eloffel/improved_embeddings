implementation of algorithms in pid18

what is it

   implementation of the expectation maximation algorithm to calculate
   probabilities of rules in context-free grammar (id18) in order to create
   probabilistic context-free grammar (pid18). it also generates new
   sentences in that grammar using a pid18 (.gen file).

what do you need to run it

     * .id18 file

   a file with a context-free grammar in chomsky normal form, but with "#"
   instead of an arrow (no spaces around).

   rule example:
s#npa viadv

     * .train file

   a text file with .train extension with sentences you want to train your
   grammar on. sentences should be in separate lines.

how to run it

   in the command line, type:
python train.py [your_grammar_file].id18 [your_train_file].train

   you can use some examples in the test folder, or try your own.
