implementation of the brown hierarchical word id91 algorithm.
percy liang
release 1.3
2012.07.24

input: a sequence of words separated by whitespace (see input.txt for an example
).
output: for each word type, its cluster (see output.txt for an example).
        in particular, each line is:
  <cluster represented as a bit string> <word> <number of times word occurs in i
nput>

runs in $o(n c^2)$, where $n$ is the number of word types and $c$
is the number of clusters.

run:

  # clusters input.txt into 50 clusters:
