tan-id91

   hierarchical word id91, following "brown id91" (brown et
   al., 1992).

   author: michael heilman ([67]mheilman@ets.org, [68]mheilman@cs.cmu.edu)

   see the docstrings in the scripts for further information.

   i developed the code for python 3.2.3, but it seems to work fine with
   python 2.7 and pypy 2.0.

usage example

   python pmi_cluster.py example_input.txt example_output.txt

   and then (optionally) sort by the bitstrings for easier browsing...
   sort -k 2 example_output.txt > example_output_sorted.txt
