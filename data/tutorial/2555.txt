fanfiction, graphs, and id95

   posted on july 6, 2014

   [5]math, [6]fanfiction, [7]graphs, [8]visualization

   on a website called fanfiction.net, users write millions of stories
   about their favorite stories. they have diverse opinions about them.
   they love some stories, and hate others. the opinions are noisy, and
   it   s hard to see the big picture.

   with tools from mathematics and some helpful software, however, we can
   visualize the underlying structure.

   in the following post, we will visualize the harry potter, naruto and
   twilight fandoms on fanfiction.net. we will also use google   s id95
   algorithm to rank stories, and perform id185 to make
   story recommendations to top fanfiction.net users.

   if you   re not interested in the details, you can skip to the following:

   interactive graphs: [9]harry potter, [10]naruto, [11]twilight

   story rankings: [12]harry potter, [13]naruto, [14]twilight

   story recommendations: [15]harry potter, [16]naruto, [17]twilight

   and of course, you might skim below to see the pretty pictures!

introduction

   fanfiction is a wide-spread phenomenon where fans of different works
   write derivative stories. this ranges from young children writing their
   first stories about their favorite fictional characters, to
   professional-quality stories written by aspiring novelists. many such
   stories are posted to websites where they are read by a large audience
   and commented on. the largest such website is [18]fanficiton.net.

   the sheer amount of fanfiction out there is rather staggering. the
   total number of stories on fanfiction.net exceeds six million. harry
   potter stories account for around 14% of these, followed by naruto
   (around 7%) and twilight (around 4%) ([19]ffn research). the majority
   of these stories have very little in the way of readership, but popular
   stories can have a large number of readers.

   some research was done into the demographics of fanfiction.net users
   and other topics by [20]ffn research. they found that 78% of
   fanfiction.net authors who joined in 2010 identified as female.
   further, around 80% of users who report their age are between 13 and
   17.

   a lot of other interesting research and analysis has been done on the
   blogs [21]destination: toast! and [22]toastystats.

basic methods

   in addition to allowing users to post stories they write,
   fanfiction.net allows authors to    favorite    stories they like. looking
   at which stories tend to be favorited by the same users gives us a way
   to understand connections between stories.

   in order to analyze this, we must collect a large amount of metadata
   from fanfiction.net (   scraping   ). we note that we don   t actually
   collect any significant content, just a lot of data about relationships
   between pieces of content. fanfiction.net   s terms of service, as the
   author understands them, allow this with some restrictions:

     4(e) you agree not to use or launch any automated system, including
     without limitation,    robots,       spiders,    or    offline readers,    that
     accesses the website in a manner that sends more request messages to
     the fanfiction.net servers in a given period of time than a human
     can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional
     on-line web browser. notwithstanding the foregoing, fanfiction.net
     grants the operators of public search engines permission to use
     spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and
     solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available
     searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of
     such materials   

   in order to ensure compliance with these terms, the author
   intentionally built significant rate limiting into the scraper and took
   care to minimize the load put on fanfiction.net. while the issue of
   academic analysis was not mentioned, it was not excluded and
   fanfiction.net   s operators have not previously objected to similar
   academic work. further, this work could be the preliminary research
   needed for someone to build a good fanficiton search engine.

   another section of the terms of service prohibits collecting personally
   identifiable information, which they define to include usernames. as
   such, i have deliberately discarded all such information and don   t use
   it. (though, i note that several search engines do     try searching for
   an authors name on any major search engine.) i do refer to some
   usernames in this post, but that was done entirely by hand.

   in collecting data, since we are only looking at a subset of users, it
   is important to be wary of sampling bias. for example, if we sampled
   authors starting from the favorites of a particular author, or from
   those who had contributed stories to a community, we might get a very
   skewed perspective of the stories on fanfiction.net. the author
   considered a number of approaches, but concluded the fairest approach
   would be to use the authors of the most reviewed stories on
   fanfiction.net. this is a bias, but it should bias us towards the most
   interesting and important parts of the graph.

graph construction

   a [23]graph, in the context of mathematics, is a collection of objects
   called vertices joined by connections called edges. for example, cities
   can be thought of as the vertices a graph connected by different
   highways and roads (the edges).
   an example of a graph (from wikipedia)

   a weighted graph is a graph where some edges are    stronger    than
   others. for example, some cities are connected by giant 6-lane
   highways, while others are connected by gravel roads. larger weights
   represent stronger connections and smaller weights represent weaker
   ones. a weight of zero is the same thing as having no connection at
   all.

   we will be interpreting fanfiction as a weighted graph, where edges
   represent a    connection    between stories. we will be using as our
   weights for edges the id203 that someone will like both stories,
   given that they like one. that is, \(w_{a, b} = \frac{|f_a \cap
   f_b|}{|f_a \cup f_b|}\) where \(f_s\) is the users who favorited the
   story \(s\).

   there are lots of other possibilities, some resulting in directed
   graphs:
     * (directed) the id203 that someone who favorites \(a\) will
       favorite \(b\): \(w_{a\to b} = \frac{|f_a \cap f_b|}{|f_a|}\)
     * the id203 that someone who favorites \(a\) favorites \(b\)
       times the id203 that someone who favorites \(b\) favorites
       \(a\): \(w_{a,b} = \frac{|f_a \cap f_b|^2}{|f_a| * |f_b|}\)
     * the lesser of the id203 that someone who favorites \(a\)
       favorites \(b\) and the id203 that someone who favorites
       \(b\) favorites \(a\): \(w_{a,b} = \min\left(\frac{|f_a \cap
       f_b|}{|f_a|}, \frac{|f_a \cap f_b|}{|f_b|} \right)\)

   our experience was that it didn   t matter too much for the results, for
   large graphs.

   (it   s worth noting that many of these could easily generalize to
   higher-dimensional edges for a weighted hyper-graph.)

   in our selected weight definition, \(w_{a, b} = \frac{|f_a \cap
   f_b|}{|f_a \cup f_b|}\), we give equal weight to the preferences of all
   users. but there   s a lot of variance between users: some favorite
   everything under the sun, while others very selectively favorite
   stories they really like. if we give the users who favorite thousands
   of stories the same weight as users who favorite ten, the users who
   favorite thousands dominate everything (and aren   t a very good signal).

   instead, we give each user \(u\) a weight of \(\frac{1}{20+n(u)}\)
   where \(n(u)\) denotes the number of stories \(u\) has favorited. this
   results in a measure on the space of users, \(\mu(s) = \sum_{u \in s}
   \frac{1}{20+n(u)}\), and the equation for our weights becomes \(w_{a,
   b} = \frac{\mu(f_a \cap f_b)}{\mu(f_a \cup f_b)}\).

   applying these techniques to a couple of the top harry potter stories,
   we get the following graph (using [24]graphviz):
   small labeled graph of top harry potter stories
   small labeled graph of top harry potter stories

   with a small amount of investigation, it   s easy to understand a lot of
   the graph   s structure. for example, on the lower right hand side,
   there   s a triangular clique.

   a quick google search reveals that this triangular clique consists of
   the    dark prince trilogy    by kurinoone. the stories are more strongly
   linked to their immediate predecessor/successor than the pair separated
   by a story are to eachother.

large graph visualizations for harry potter

   if we use different tools, we can visualize much larger graphs.

   we consider the top 2,000 most reviewed harry potter stories and their
   authors. based on the author   s favorite lists, we construct a weighted
   graph, with the stories as nodes (edge weights are calculated as
   above).

   we then prune the graph   s edges, keeping the top 8,000 most strongly
   weighted edges. we also prune the nodes, keeping only those with at
   least one edge. this leaves us with a graph of 1,623 nodes and 8,000
   edges.

   we then load this graph into the graph visualization tool [25]gephi. we
   layout the graph using the openord and forceatlas2 layout algorithms.
   (openord was particularly good at extracting clusters. beyond that,
   this was largely a matter of aesthetic taste.)
   graph of harry potter fanfiction (top 1,623 stories)

   we can see lots of interesting structure in this graph: there are lots
   of clusters, some more connected than others.

   a first hypothesis might be that some of these clusters are caused by
   language. as it turns out, this is the case:
   graph of harry potter fanfiction, colored by language

   another cause of clusters may be the    ship    (romantic pairing of the
   story). many readers have a strong loyalty to a particular ship     for
   example, they might feel very strongly that harry and hermione should
   be together.
   graph of harry potter fanfiction, colored by ship

   (note: ships are inferred from tags story summaries. hp = harry potter,
   hg = hermione granger, gw = ginny weasley, dm = draco malfoy, ss =
   severus snape and lv = lord voldemort.)

   one interesting point is that by far the most diffused ship is hp/gw.
   it seems likely that this is because it is the ship we see in cannon
   harry potter, and so many stories not focused on romance default to it
   and unaligned readers are more tolerant of it.

   one striking pattern in fanfiction is that a massive fraction of
   stories are male/male pairings. such stories are frequently referred to
   as    slash.   
   graph of harry potter fanfiction, colored by slash

   many stories include a slash tag in the summary. some other stories tag
   themselves as    no-slash.   

   one interesting pattern is that stories tagged    no-slash    concentrate
   around parts of the border of slash stories. one possible reason may be
   that authors writing stories that might, from a glance at the summary
   or characters list, look like slash (for example, a story about snape
   mentoring harry, or draco and harry as friends) feel the need to
   explicitly signal that that is not the topic of their story.

   the predisposition of the french cluster towards slash stories is
   interesting, but the cluster is so small i am hesitant to read anything
   into it.

   you can also explore an [26]interactive graph of harry potter
   fanfiction.

large graph visualizations for other fandoms

   of course, we can apply the exact same tricks to other fandoms.

   naruto

   for example, naruto is the second biggest fandom. here   s a graph of it:
   graph of top naruto fanfiction (1,123 nodes and 4,000 edges)

   we can look at languages again:
   graph of top naruto fanfiction, colored by language

   and also for ships:
   graph of top naruto fanfiction, colored by ship

   twilight

   and again, we can graph the top twilight stories:
   graph of top twilight fanfiction (1,031 nodes, 5,00 edges)

   we can color it by language:
   graph of top twilight fanfiction, colored by language

   and by ship:
   graph of top twilight fanfiction, colored by ship

   one thing that seems pretty surprising, without inside knowledge of the
   fandom, is the lack of stories where the pairing involves jacob. on
   further inspection, we find that there are stories like that on
   fanfiction.net, but they aren   t amongst the most highly reviewed.
   perhaps this pairing prefers other websites? i   d love comments from
   anyone with insight into this.

   you can also explore an [27]interactive graph of naruto fanfiction and
   of [28]twilight fanfiction.

id95

   what are the best fanfics on fanfiction.net? how can we identify them?

   a naive approach would be to select the most favorited or reviewed
   stories. but people   s quality of taste varies. a more sophisticated
   approach is google   s id95 algorithm which is used to determine
   which web pages are of high quality.

   in a normal vote gives equal weight to every voter. but some voters are
   better qualified to decide than others. in id95, we recalculate the
   votes again and again, giving each    person   s    vote a weight based on
   how many votes they received in the previous step.

   in the case of the internet, we interpret a website linking to another
   website as that website voting for the one it links to. similarly, we
   can apply it to fanfiction by interpreting story a as    voting    for a
   story b with a weight of the id203 that a user who likes a also
   likes b.

   harry potter top stories by id95:
    1. [29]realizations (16.4)
    2. [30]harry potter and the nightmares of futures past (15.7)
    3. [31]make a wish (14.0)
    4. [32]poison pen (11.7)
    5. [33]to shape and change (11.5)
    6. [34]more

   naruto top stories by id95:
    1. [35]team 8 (11.1)
    2. [36]naruto: myoushuu no fuuin (6.42)
    3. [37]it   s for a good cause, i swear! (5.57)
    4. [38]the sealed kunai (5.24)
    5. [39]chunin exam day (5.14)
    6. [40]more

   twilight top stories by id95:
    1. [41]the blessing and the curse (18.6)
    2. [42]tropic of virgo (15.0)
    3. [43]a rough start (12.7)
    4. [44]creature of habit (12.6)
    5. [45]the plan (10.2)
    6. [46]more

   one neat thing we can do is give nodes on our graphs a size based on
   their id95. (we can also color nodes based on the first three
   components of the singular value decomposition of the adjacency
   matrix.)

story recommendation

   there   s something that   s just begging to be done, at this point: story
   recommendations. given our knowledge of what stories many users like,
   can we recommend other stories that they   re probable to like?

   this problem is called id185, and is a
   well-established area. unfortunately, it isn   t something i   m terribly
   knowledgeable about, so i took a relatively naive approach: sum over
   the preferences of all users, weighted by how similar their preferences
   are to the user you are trying to predict.

   specifically, we give each story, \(s\), a rank \(r_u(s)\), for a user
   \(u\). if the rank is high, we think \(u\) is likely to like \(s\).

   \[r_u(s) = \sum_{v\in f_s \setminus \{u\}} \left(\frac{|s(u)\cap
   s(v)|}{20+|s(v)|}\right)^2\]

   where \(f_s\) is the set of users who favorited \(s\) and \(s(u)\) is
   the stories favorited by the user \(u\).

   for example, we can make recommendations for s   tarkan, the author of
   the most favorited harry potter story on fanfiction.net:
     * *[47]learning to breathe (1.459)
     * *[48]taking control (1.383)
     * *[49]backwards compatible (1.381)
     * *[50]harry potter and the nightmares of futures past (1.377)
     * *[51]harry potter and fate   s debt (1.218)
     *    

   a * denotes that this is already one of the users favorite stories or
   one of their own stories. we can exclude their favorite stories, and
   their own stories:
     * [52]make a wish (0.949)
     * [53]a black comedy (0.750)
     * [54]oh god not again! (0.679)
     * [55]realizations (0.642)
     * [56]lord of caer azkaban (0.635)
     *    

   these are all very popular stories. it   s not very useful to s   tarkan if
   we recommend them extremely popular stories that they   ve almost
   certainly seen before. as such, it is interesting to penalize the
   popularity of stories.

   consider \(\frac{r_u(s)}{|f_s|^k}\). when \(k = 0\), it   s our original
   rank. when \(k = 1\), it full normalizes stories against popularity.
   and in between, it penalizes popularity to varying degrees. if we set k
   = 0.7, we get these recommendations:
     * [57]insanity (0.034)
     * [58]shadow of the serpent (0.032)
     * [59]the bargain (0.031)
     * [60]sinners (0.029)
     * [61]harry potter and the order of the phoenix (0.029)
     *    

   you can think of these as stories that are unexpectedly popular amongst
   similar users. similar users like them a lot more than random users
   like them. (though, perhaps 0.7 is a bit too extreme.)

   curious about what this algorithm would recommend for you? if you   re a
   popular fanfiction author, you may be in my recommendations for top
   users for [62]harry potter, [63]naruto or [64]twilight.

   since my scripts can   t look at your author name while complying with
   fanfiction.net   s terms of service, you will need to know your author
   id. to get it, go to your fanfiction.net profile page and look at the
   url. it will be of the form: http://fanfiction.net/u/author_id/....
   then search for your author id in the file!

   i   m certain one could do much better if they wanted to put a bit more
   effort into it. :)

conclusion

   in light of all this, i   d like to reflect on a few things.

   big data: a year ago, i was very dismissive of    big data    as a
   buzzword. primarily, it seems to be thrown around by business people
   who don   t really understand much. but one thing i   ve learned in
   explorations of data like this one and working in machine learning, is
   that there is something very powerful about larger amounts of data.
   there   s something very qualitatively different. the fanfiction data i
   used was actually quite small, only a few hundred users, because of how
   i limited the amount i downloaded, but i think it still demonstrates
   the sorts of things that become possible as you have larger amounts of
   data. (to be honest, a much more compelling example is the progress
   that   s been made in id161 using id163    but this still
   influenced my views.)

   digital humanities: digital humanities also seems to be a bit of a
   buzzword. but i hope this provides a simple example of the power that
   can come from applying a little bit of math and computer science to
   humanities problems.

   metadata and privacy: in this essay, we analyzed stories by looking at
   whether they were favorited by the same users. there   s a natural    dual   
   to this: analyzing users by looking at whether they favorited the same
   stories. this would give us a graph of connections between users and
   allow us to find clusters of users. but what if you use other forms of
   metadata? for example, we now know that the us government has metadata
   on who phones who. it seems very likely that many companies and
   governments have information on where your cellphone is as a function
   of time. all this can construct a graph of society. i can   t really
   fathom how much one must be able to learn about someone from that. (and
   how easy it would be to misinterpret.)

   fanfiction websites: i think there   s a lot of potential for fanfiction
   websites to better serve their users based on the techniques outlined
   here. i   d be really thrilled to see fanfiction.net or archive of our
   own adopt some of these ideas. imagine being able to list a handful of
   stories in some category you   re interested in and discover others? or
   get good recommendations? the ideas are all pretty straightforward once
   you think of them. i   d be very happy to talk to the groups behind
   different fanfiction websites and provide some help or share example
   code.

   deep learning and nlp: recently, there   s been some really cool results
   in applying deep learning to natural language processing. one would
   need a lot more data than i collected, and it would take more effort,
   but i bet one could do some really interesting things here.

   id167: [65]t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, is an algorithm
   for visualizing the structure of high-dimensional data. it would be a
   much simpler approach to understanding the structure of fanfiction than
   the graph based one i used here, and probably give much better results.
   if i was starting again, i would use it.

   resources: in principle, i   d really like to share my code and make it
   easy for people to replicate the work i described here. however, i
   think that would be really rude to fanfiction.net because it could
   result in lots of people scraping their website, and it seems likely
   many would remove my rate limiter. an alternative would be to share my
   extracted metadata, but, again, i think it would be really rude to do
   that without fanfiction.net   s permission, and possibly a violation of
   their terms of service. so, in the end, i   m not sharing any resources.
   that said, all of this can be done pretty easily.

   (this post is a fun experiment done primarily for amusement. i would be
   delighted to hear your comments and thoughts: you can comment inline or
