   $\begingroup$

   i'm trying to figure out how to calculate the rand index of a cluster
   algorithm, but i'm stuck at the point how to calculate the true and
   false negatives.

   at the moment i'm using the example from the book an introduction into
   information retrieval (manning, raghavan & sch  tze, 2009). at page 359
   they talk about how to calculate the rand index. for this example they
   use three clusters and the clusters contains the following objects.
    1. a a a a a b
    2. a b b b b c
    3. a a c c c

   i replace the object (orginal signs to letters, but the idea and count
   stay the same). i'll give the exact words from the book in order to see
   what they are talking about:

     we first compute tp +fp. the three clusters contain 6, 6, and 5
     points, respectively, so the total number of    positives    or pairs of
     documents that are in the same cluster is:

   tp + fp = ${6 \choose 2}$ + ${6 \choose 2}$ + ${5 \choose 2}$ = 15 +
   15+ 10 = 40

     of these, the a pairs in cluster 1, the b pairs in cluster 2, the c
     pairs in cluster 3, and the a pair in cluster 3 are true positives:

   tp = ${5 \choose 2}$ + ${4 \choose 2}$ + ${3 \choose 2}$ + ${2 \choose
   2}$ = 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 20

     thus, fp = 40     20 = 20.

   till here there calculations are clear, and if i take other examples i
   get the same results, but when i want to calculate the false negative
   and true negative manning et al. state the following:

     fn and tn are computed similarly, resulting in the following
     contingency table:

   the contingency table looks as follows:
+--------+--------+
| tp: 20 | fn: 24 |
+--------+--------+
| fp: 20 | tn: 72 |
+--------+--------+

   the sentence: "fn and tn are computed similarly" is not clear to my and
   i don't understand which numbers i need to calculate the tn and fn. i
   can calculate the right side of the table by doing the following:

   tp + fp + fn + tn = ${n \choose 2}$ = ${17 \choose 2}$ = 136

   source: [31]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rand_index

   thus, fn + tn = 136 - tp + fp = 136 - 40 = 96, but this doesn't really
   help my in figuring out how to calculate the variables separately.
   especially when the authors say: "fn and tn are computed similarly". i
   don't see how. also when i look at other examples they calculate each
   cell of the contingency table by looking at each pair.

   for example:
   [32]http://www.otlet-institute.org/wikics/id91_problems.html#toc-
   subsection-4.1

   my first question, based on the example of manning et al (2009), is it
   possible to calculate the tn and fn if you only know the tp & np? and
   if so, how does the similar calculation looks like based of the given
   example?

   i was pondering about the same, and i solved it like this. suppose you
   have a co-occurrence matrix/contingency table where the rows are the
   ground truth clusters, and the columns are the clusters found by the
   id91 algorithm.

   so, for the example in the book, it would look like:
  | 1 | 2 | 3
--+---+---+---
x | 5 | 1 | 2
--+---+---+---
o | 1 | 4 | 0
--+---+---+---
    | 0 | 1 | 3

   now, you can very easily compute the tp + fp by taking the sum per
   column and 'choose 2' over all those values. so the sums are [6, 6, 5]
   and you do '6 choose 2' + '6 choose 2' + '5 choose 2'.

   now, indeed, similarly, you can get tp + fn by taking the sum over the
   rows (so, that is [8, 5, 4] in the example above), apply 'choose 2'
   over all those values, and take the sum of that.

   the tp's themselves can be calculated by applying 'choose 2' to every
   cell in the matrix and taking the sum of everything (assuming that '1
   choose 2' is 0).

   in fact, here is some python code that does exactly that:
import numpy as np
from scipy.misc import comb

# there is a comb function for python which does 'n choose k'

# only you can't apply it to an array right away

# so here we vectorize it...

def mycomb(a,b):
  return comb(a,b,exact=true)

vcomb = np.vectorize(mycomb)

def get_tp_fp_tn_fn(cooccurrence_matrix):
  tp_plus_fp = vcomb(cooccurrence_matrix.sum(0, dtype=int),2).sum()
  tp_plus_fn = vcomb(cooccurrence_matrix.sum(1, dtype=int),2).sum()
  tp = vcomb(cooccurrence_matrix.astype(int), 2).sum()
  fp = tp_plus_fp - tp
  fn = tp_plus_fn - tp
  tn = comb(cooccurrence_matrix.sum(), 2) - tp - fp - fn

  return [tp, fp, tn, fn]

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # the co-occurrence matrix from example from

  # an introduction into information retrieval (manning, raghavan & schutze, 200
9)
  # also available on:

  # http://nlp.stanford.edu/ir-book/html/htid113dition/evaluation-of-id91-1.
html
  #

  cooccurrence_matrix = np.array([[ 5,  1,  2], [ 1,  4,  0], [ 0,  1,  3]])

  # get the stats

  tp, fp, tn, fn = get_tp_fp_tn_fn(cooccurrence_matrix)

  print "tp: %d, fp: %d, tn: %d, fn: %d" % (tp, fp, tn, fn)

  # print the measures:

  print "rand index: %f" % (float(tp + tn) / (tp + fp + fn + tn))

  precision = float(tp) / (tp + fp)
  recall = float(tp) / (tp + fn)

  print "precision : %f" % precision
  print "recall    : %f" % recall
  print "f1        : %f" % ((2.0 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall))

   if i run it i get:
$ python testcode.py
tp: 20, fp: 20, tn: 72, fn: 24
rand index: 0.676471
precision : 0.500000
recall    : 0.454545
f1        : 0.476190

   i actually didn't check any other examples than this one, so i hope i
   did it right.... ;-)

   after having studied the other answers in this thread, here is my
   python implementation, which takes arrays as inputs, sklearn-style:
import numpy as np
from scipy.misc import comb

def rand_index_score(clusters, classes):

    tp_plus_fp = comb(np.bincount(clusters), 2).sum()
    tp_plus_fn = comb(np.bincount(classes), 2).sum()
    a = np.c_[(clusters, classes)]
    tp = sum(comb(np.bincount(a[a[:, 0] == i, 1]), 2).sum()
             for i in set(clusters))
    fp = tp_plus_fp - tp
    fn = tp_plus_fn - tp
    tn = comb(len(a), 2) - tp - fp - fn
    return (tp + tn) / (tp + fp + fn + tn)

   i am not quite sure myself, but this is how i did the tn value:
   tn=(7 2) (10 2) (4 2)

   (7 2)     cluster 1     test says    x   , so count those that are not x (and
   are correctly clustered in clusters 2 & 3)

   i.e. 4    o   s + 3    d   s (diamonds) =(7 2)

   (10 2)     cluster 2, count those that are not    o   s and correctly
   clustered in clusters 1 and 3,

   i.e. 5    x    +(2   x   + 3   d   ) = (10 2)

   (4 2)     cluster 3, count those that are not    x    and not    d   (diamond
   shaped element)s that are correctly clustered in clusters 1& 2.

   i.e. 4 'o's in cluster 2. =(4 2)

   tn = (7 2) + (10 2) + (4 2) =72.

   then fn is :

   fn = (17 2) - (tp+fp) - tn = 136 - 40 -72 = 24. ---> (17= total number
   of documents)

   taking the example of another question:
  | 1 | 2 | 3
--+---+---+---
x | 5 | 1 | 2
--+---+---+---
o | 1 | 4 | 0
--+---+---+---
    | 0 | 1 | 3

   the reasonable answer for fn:
fn = (c(8,2)-c(5,2)-c(2,2))+(c(5,2)-c(4,2))+(c(4,2)-c(3,2))=24

   explanation:
     * (c(8,2)-c(5,2)-c(2,2))
       choose 2 from 8 for 'x'(a) the combination of same class in same
       clusters ( c(5,2) for cluster 1 and c(2,2) for cluster 3 ),
     * (c(5,2)-c(4,2))
       choose 2 from 5 'o'(b) minus the combination of same class in same
       clusters ( c(4,2) for cluster 2 )
     * (c(4,2)-c(3,2)
       choose 2 from 4 for '   '(c) minus the combination of same class in
       same clusters ( c(3,2) for cluster 3 )

   i derived it like this.

   i have an implementation of this in r which i will explain:

   tp (a in the code) is the sum of every cell choose 2. as per the
   original question (0 or 1 choose 2 equating to 0)

   fn (b) is the sum of each row choose 2, all summed, less tp. where each
   row sum represents the number of documents in each true class.

   the sum of this is all documents that are similar and in the same
   cluster (tp) plus all documents that are similar and are not in the
   same cluster (fn).

   so this is (tp + fn) - tp = fn

   fp (c) is calculated similarly. the sum of each column choose 2, all
   summed, less tp. in this case each column sum represents the number of
   documents in each cluster.

   so the sum of this is all documents that are similar and in the same
   cluster (tp) plus all documents that are not similar and are in the
   same cluster (fp).

   so this is (tp + fp) - tp = fp

   with these 3 calculated the remaining calculation of tn is straight
   forward. the sum of the table choose 2, less tp, fp & fn = tn (d)

   the only query i have with this method is it's definition of tp. using
   the terminology in this question, i don't understand why the 2 a's in
   cluster 3 are considered tp. i have found this both here and in the
   related textbook. however i do understand their calculation with the
   assumption that their tp calculation is correct.

   hope this helps
fmeasure = function (x, y, beta)
{
  x <- as.vector(x)
  y <- as.vector(y)
  if (length(x) != length(y))
    stop("arguments must be vectors of the same length")
  tab <- table(x, y)
  if (all(dim(tab) == c(1, 1)))
    return(1)
  a <- sum(choose(tab, 2))
  b <- sum(choose(rowsums(tab), 2)) - a
  c <- sum(choose(colsums(tab), 2)) - a
  d <- choose(sum(tab), 2) - a - b - c
  ## precision
  p = a / (a + c)
  ## recall
  r = a / (a + b)
  ##f-measure
  fm <- (beta^2 + 1) * p * r / (beta^2*p + r)
  return(fm)

   you can compute tn and fn the same way.

   just switch the roles of labels and clusters.
a) 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 3
b) 1 2 2 2 2
c) 2 3 3 3 3

   ... then perform the same computations.

   i think i've reverse engineered the false negative (fn) out of it. for
   the true positives, you made 4 groups that were positive. in cluster 1,
   you had the five a's; in cluster 2, you had the 4 b's; in cluster 3 you
   had the 3 c's and the 2 a's.

   so for the false negative.
    1. start with the a's in cluster 1; there are 5 correctly placed a's
       in cluster 1. you have 1 false a in cluster 2, and two false a's in
       cluster 3. that gives (5 1) and (5 2).
    2. then for the b's. there are 4 correctly placed b's you calculated
       earlier. you have one false b in cluster 1, and that's it. that
       gives you (4 1) for the b's.
    3. then for the c's. you have one false c in cluster 2, with three
       correct ones in cluster 3, so there's (3 1).
    4. after that, we can't forget about that pair of a's in cluster 3
       that we called a true positive. so with respect to that, we have 1
       false a in cluster 2. even though there are other a's in cluster 1,
       we can't call them false a's because there are so many.

   therefore, you have (5 1) + (5 2) + (4 1) + (3 1) + (2 1) which equals
   5 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 24. that's where the 24 comes from, then just
   subtract that from the 136 you already found to get the true neg (tn).

   here is how to calculate every metric for rand index without
   subtracting

   side notes for easier understanding:

   1) rand index is based on comparing pairs of elements. theory suggests,
   that similar pairs of elements should be placed in the same cluster,
   while dissimilar pairs of elements should be placed in separate
   clusters.

   2) ri doesn't care about difference in number of clusters. it just
   cares about true/false pairs of elements.

   based on this assumption, rand index, is calculated

   [79]enter image description here

   ok, let's dive in here is our example:
  | 1 | 2 | 3
--+---+---+---
x | 5 | 1 | 2
--+---+---+---
o | 1 | 4 | 0
--+---+---+---
    | 0 | 1 | 3

   in denominator, we have total possible pairs, which is (17 2) = 136

   now lets calculate every metric for better understanding:

   a) let's start with easy a, (true positives or correct similar)

   it means, you need to find all possible pairs of elements, where
   prediction and true label were placed together. on grid example it
   means get sum of possible pairs within each cell.
a = (5 2) + (1 2) + (2 2) + (1 2) + (4 2) + (0 2) + (0 2) + (1 2) + (3 2) =
  = 10 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 20

   c) now, let's do c ( false positives or incorrect dissimilar)

   it means, find all pairs, that we placed together, but which should be
   in different clusters. on grid example it means, find all possible
   pairs between any 2 horizontal cells
c = 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 +
  + 1*4 + 1*0 + 4*0 +
  + 0*1 + 0*3 + 1*3 =
  = 5 + 10 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 24

   d) calculating d (false negative or incorrect similar) it means, find
   all pairs that we placed in different clusters, but which should be
   together. on grid example, find all possible pairs between any 2
   vertical cells
d = 5*1 + 5*0 + 1*0 +
  + 1*4 + 1*1 + 4*1 +
  + 2*0 + 2*3 + 0*3 =
  = 5 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 20

   b) and, finally let's do b (true negatives or correct dissimilar)

   it means, find all pairs that we placed in different clusters, which
   also should be in different clusters. on grid, it means find all
   possible pairs between any 2 non-vertical and non-horizontal cells

   here is which numbers should be multiplied, to get better understanding
   what i meant:
d = x1*o2 + x1*o3 + x1*   2 + x1*   3 +
  + x2*o1 + x2*o3 + x2*   1 + x2*   3 +
  + x3*o1 + x3*o2 + x3*   1 + x3*   2 +
  + o1*   2 + o1*   3 +
  + o2*   1 + o2*   3 +
  + o3*   1 + o3*   2

   in numbers:
d = 5*4 + 5*0 + 5*1 + 5*3 +
  + 1*1 + 1*0 + 1*0 + 1*3 +
  + 2*1 + 2*4 + 2*0 + 2*1 +
  + 1*1 + 1*3 +
  + 4*0 + 4*3 = 72

   and at the end rand index is equal: (20 + 72) / 136 = 0.676
