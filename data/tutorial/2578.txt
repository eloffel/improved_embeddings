deep learning for nlp - tutorial

   hands-on tutorial on deep learning with a special focus on natural
   language processing (nlp).

   this git repository accompanies the ukp lectures and seminars on deep
   learning for natural language processing. in contrast to other
   tutorials, this tutorial focuses on the usage of deep learning methods.

deep learning for nlp - seminar - july 2017

   in july 2017 i updated the slides to the most recent python and keras
   version. the slides as well as the source code is available in the
   folder [77]2017-07_seminar. the code in the folder can be run with
   either python 2.7 or python 3.6, with keras 2.0.5 and with theano
   (0.9.0) or tensorflow (1.2.1) as backend.

   four different deep learning models for nlp are covered in the folder:
    1. feed forward architecture for sequence classification (e.g. pos,
       ner, chunking)
    2. convolutional neural network for sentence / text classification
       (e.g. sentiment classification)
    3. convolutional neural network for id36 (e.g. semantic
       relation extration)
    4. long-short-term-memory (lstm)-networks for sequence classificaiton

deep learning for nlp - seminar - nov. 2016

   in november 2016 i gave a seminar at the university of duisburg-essen.
   the slides as well as the source code is available in the folder
   [78]2016-11_seminar. in the seminar i use python 2.7, theano 0.8.2, and
   keras 1.1.1 to model four different deep learning models for nlp:
    1. feed forward architecture for sequence classification (e.g. pos,
       ner, chunking)
    2. convolutional neural network for sentence / text classification
       (e.g. sentiment classification)
    3. convolutional neural network for id36 (e.g. semantic
       relation extration)
    4. long-short-term-memory (lstm)-networks for sequence classificaiton

deep learning for nlp - lecture - oct. 2015

   in october 2015 i gave a lecture for the ukp department at the
   technical university of darmstadt. the lecture is structured in six
   parts and covers the basics about deep learning. in the lecture i use
   python 2.7, theano 0.6.0 and keras 0.3.0 to model different
   applications of deep learning for nlp. the slides, the source code, and
   video recordings are available in the folder [79]2015-10_lecture.
