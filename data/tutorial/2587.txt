   update (10/19/15): a much larger dataset that contains 20,407 questions
   about 2,347 answers has been released [6]here (31 mb). this dataset
   includes questions about various categories (not just history and
   literature). for each answer in the dataset, we have also provided its
   corresponding wikipedia page.

   abstract: we introduce a id56 model that is able to
   correctly answer paragraph-length factoid questions from a trivia
   competition called quiz bowl. our model is able to succeed where
   traditional approaches fail, particularly when questions contain very
   few words (e.g., named entities) indicative of the answer. we apply our
   model, qanta, to a dataset of questions from a trivia competition
   called quiz bowl. the model outperforms multiple baselines and, when
   combined with information retrieval methods, rivals the best human
   players.
   code / data: code for training and evaluating qanta, along with two
   datasets^1 that each contain around 2,000 question/answer pairs
   (~10,000 sentences), can be downloaded [7]here (50 mb). see the
   provided readme for usage instructions.
   please email any questions about the code and/or data to
   miyyer@umd.edu.
   ^1proprietary data from [8]naqt are excluded.

   example:
   question:
   he left unfinished a novel whose title character forges his father's
   signature to get out of school and avoids the draft by feigning desire
   to join. a more famous work by this author tells of the rise and fall
   of the composer adrian leverk  hn. another of his novels features the
   jesuit naptha and his opponent settembrini, while his most famous work
   depicts the aging writer gustav von aschenbach. name this german author
   of the magic mountain and death in venice.
   answer: thomas mann

   the first sentence in this question contains no named entities or other
   words that are indicative of the answer by themselves. nevertheless,
   qanta is able to model the compositionality of the sentence in order to
   make the correct prediction. below is a heatmap of the top five answers
   for the first sentence as scored by qanta. note how strongly indicative
   the plot description associated with the "novel" node is of the answer.
   another interesting observation is that three of the top five answers
   are authors with well-known unfinished novels, which suggests that
   qanta is able to learn information about the answer type without any
   manually-defined rules.

   vector space visualization:
   below is a id167 visualization of the 451 answers in our history
   dataset. the vector space is divided into six general clusters, and
   zooming in on each one in turn reveals interesting patterns. for
   example, the blue cluster is predominantly populated by u.s.
   presidents, and the zoomed plot depicts temporal id91: presidents
   who were in office during the same time period occur closer together in
   the vector space.
