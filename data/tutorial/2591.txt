   google has recently launched a new beta product     google cloud natural
   language api. as a  rule, any new product by google makes the company   s
   rivals get in a slight panic. what major  players are to expect in the
   natural language area? does it mean the end of free competition in  the
   linguistic api market and dictatorship by    the good corporation   ?

   however, if we are to compose a list of other players in this sphere, a
   fear for google   s  dominance will disappear. apart from major players,
   this top also features small companies  that are notable for their
   flexibility and attention to customers    needs. let   s take a look at
   major  api providers and mull over their peculiarities.

   1) [7]alchemy ibm. alchemyapi's text analysis service started its
   existence in 2009.  alchemylanguage provides for several api servers
   that analyze texts and define meta-data,  including entities,
   sentiments, keywords, concepts, and relations between sentence
   components (nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, etc.), authors, and more.
   beside english, alchemy  ibm supports other 7 languages (german,
   spanish, french, italian, portuguese, swedish, and  russian).

   this academy seems kind of an incubator for young and promising
   projects. many companies  started functioning after getting free access
   to this api within the watson development  platform. nevertheless, a
   high price for its usage in commercial projects push many customers  to
   search for alternative apis.

   2) [8]microsoft cognitive services based on project oxford and bing and
   launched in march, 2016,  offer a range of apis for text analysis,
   including id31 (english, spanish, french,  and
   portuguese), key phrases extraction (english, german, spanish, and
   japanese), detection of  topics for a list of submitted text records
   (minimum 100) and language recognition.

   3) [9]google natural language api. a beta version of this api service
   became available in july,  2016. for now, users can only relish basic
   tools: id31 (english), entity recognition,  and syntax
   analysis (english, spanish, and japanese). the service is already
   available on the paid  basis.

   4) [10]intellexer api is a recently launched cloud semantic server
   (january, 2016). [11]effectivesoft  - software company (based in san
   diego, usa, and minsk, belarus) has been dealing with elaborating
   semantic tools (intellexer sdk) and custom solutions since 2003. for
   today, intellexer offers a full range of tools to analyze english
   texts. the features intellexer provides for can be checked via
   [12]user-friendly demos. except the api, another semantic product,
   intellexer summarizer, is available in the user   s account. intellexer
   also is available in form of sdk and some desktop and mobile apps.

    5) [13]textrazor (created in london, uk, in 2011) is a text
   analytics/natural language processing  api that offers entity
   recognition/linking, relation/property extraction, automatic
   categorization  and topic tagging. this api supports entity
   recognition, disambiguation, linking and topic  detection for texts in
   english, dutch, french, german, italian, polish, portuguese, russian,
   spanish, and swedish. textrazor   s peculiarity consists in linking
   entities to [14]dbpedia and  wikipedia.

   6) [15]aylien (dublin, ireland) has been also functioning since 2011.
   its api can boast sentiment  analysis (both aspect-based and
   document-level), entity and concept extraction, document
   summarization, classification by taxonomy (using pre-defined
   taxonomies), semantic labeling,  language detection, text extraction,
   related phrases suggestion, etc.  furthermore, aylien api  supports
   english, french, german, italian, portuguese, and spanish.

   7) another company   s api worth mentioning is [16]semantria lexalytics
   (boston, usa). the  organization launched a cloud text-analyzing api in
   2012. its [17]key text analysis features involve  entity extraction,
   categorization, summarization, id31, etc. the api
   supports 22  languages, including arabic, japanese, chinese, and
   turkish.

   8) the top-5 is closed by [18]indico (boston, usa). this startup was
   established in 2013, coming out  of [19]techstars boston. they call
   themselves a group of innovators whose aim is to revolutionize
   software through machine learning. indico text analysis comprises
   id31 at the  document level (demo supports only english),
   topic detection, keyword extraction, named  entity recognition.

   9) [20]haven on demand is a service developed by hewlett packard
   enterprise in 2014. it supplies  a number of apis, including apis for
   text analysis, i.e. document classification, concept and  entity
   extraction, document categorization, id46, sentiment
   analysis, etc.

   10) [21]meaning cloud is a service launched by a spanish company
   daedalus in february, 2015; it   s a continuation of the previous
   company   s product     textalytics. it supports text analysing in 5
   languages: english, spanish,  french, portuguese, and italian.

  conclusion

   [:0]

   as we can see, linguistic apis by google   s rivals have no serious
   reasons to worry, as the  corporation has just presented the product
   first version that doesn   t differ much against the  background of other
   technologies.

   all in all, users are those who win in this case. at their disposal
   there are various competing  products, so they can relish affordable
   prices and high-quality tools.

   this table highlights semantic apis possibilities by different
   companies and features their prices.
