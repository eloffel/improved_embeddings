scalanlp is a suite of machine learning and numerical computing libraries.

   scalanlp is the umbrella project for several libraries, including
   breeze and epic. [12]breeze is a set of libraries for machine learning
   and numerical computing. [13]epic is a high-performance statistical
   parser and id170 library.
   [14]get started with breeze!

breeze

   [15][breeze.png]

   [16]breeze is the core set of libraries for scalanlp, including linear
   algebra, numerical computing and optimization. it enables a generic,
   powerful yet still efficient approach to machine learning.

epic

   [17][epic-man.png]

   [18]epic is a powerful, state-of-the-art, statistical parser for eight
   languages backed by a generic framework for building complex systems
   using id170.

puck

   [19][puck.png] [20]puck is an insanely fast gpu-powered parser, built
   on the same grammars produced by the [21]berkeley parser. on a
   mid-range nvidia gtx 680, it can parse over 400 sentences a second, or
   over half a million words per minute.
