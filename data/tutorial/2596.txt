   an important step in machine learning is creating or finding suitable
   data for training and testing an algorithm. working with a good data
   set will help you to avoid or notice errors in your algorithm and
   improve the results of your application. as creating your own dataset
   is a very time consuming task in most cases, in this article i will
   present you with some useful sets for text classification and image
   classification problems.

[9]text classification

     * [10]spam - non spam
     * [11]id31
     * [12]classification by subject

[13]image classification

     * [14]numbers and letters
     * [15]faces
     * [16]animals
     * [17]various objects

text classification

   in the following sections you will find datasets that can be used for
   common text classification tasks such as the detection of spam
   messages, id31 and the classification by the subject of a
   document.

    spam - non spam

   the task of spam filtering is very common in text classification.
   therefore, a lot of datasets can be found for this purpose.

   sms spam corpus
   the [18]sms spam corpus consists of text messages belonging to one of
   two classes. each element is either labeled as spam or ham. the set can
   be downloaded as big (1002 ham, 322 spam) or small (1002 spam, 82 spam)
   version.

   enron dataset
   if you want to have a look at spam filtering in emails instead, you
   might be interested in the [19]enron dataset, which provides a
   collection of thousands of mails, classified as spam or ham. it can be
   downloaded in a raw or preprocessed version.

   other datasets for spam classification in mails that might be
   interesting for you are [20]spamassassin public mail corpus, [21]trec
   public spam corpus or the [22]spambase data set.

    id31

   another task that can be solved by machine learning is sentiment
   analysis of texts. an example for this task would be finding out if a
   text states a positive or negative opinion about a certain subject.

   twitter id31 training corpus
   in case you're interested in tweet sentiment classification, the
   [23]twitter id31 training corpus might be the dataset
   you're looking for. it consists of more then 1 million tweets in a .csv
   file. each element is labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0).

   movie review data
   more complex texts can be found in the [24]movie review data, which
   provides a collection of 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative movie
   comments. the comments are available as unprocessed .html files and as
   processed texts. part of this dataset is also a collection of sentences
   labeled as subjective or objective.

   a list of more useful datasets for sentiment classification was put
   together in [25]this blog post by kavita ganesan.

    classification by subject

   classifying documents by their subject is a complex problem. depending
   on the kinds of documents you want to work with, you will need an
   appropriate dataset for that exact case. an often investigated case is
   the classification of newspaper articles.

   20 newsgroups
   the [26]20 newsproups dataset contains around 20,000 documents which
   are almost evenly distributed over 20 categories. the data is split
   into a train and test set. some of the newsgroups are closely related,
   while others have nothing to do with each other. the groups in the
   dataset are the following:

   reuters-21578
   a dataset that is often used for evaluating text classification
   algorithms is the [27]reuters-21578 dataset. it consists of texts that
   appeared in the reuters newswire in 1987 and was put together by
   reuters ltd. staff. often only subsets of this dataset are used as the
   documents are not evenly distributed over the categories. in many cases
   only the 10 or 90 categories with the most documents are used.

   a very helpful collection of single labeled text datasets is provided
   on [28]ana cardoso cachopo's homepage. not only will you find an
   overview of useful data, but also human readable and preprocessed
   versions of the datasets, which might save you a lot of time and
   trouble.

image classification

   in the following sections we will introduce some datasets that you
   might find useful if you want to use machine learning for image
   classification. the listed datasets range from simple handwritten
   numbers to images of complex objects and might be useful for getting
   started with image classification or testing your algorithm.

    numbers and letters

   mnist
   the mnist data set is a commonly used set for getting started with
   image classification. it contains thousands of labeled small binary
   images of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9, split up in a training and
   test set. the set can be downloaded from [29]yann lecun   s website in
   the idx file format. if you want to work with the data as images in the
   png format, you can find a converted version [30]here.

   chars74k
   another task that can be solved by machine learning is character
   recognition. for this purpose the [31]chars74k dataset can be used for
   testing and training. it contains more than 74,000 images of letters
   and numbers which are categorized into 64 different classes. the
   characters are handwritten, obtained from natural images or taken from
   computer fonts. due to the bigger amount of classes and the fact that
   the data is available as color images, this dataset is a lot more
   complex than the mnist set.

    faces

   frontal face images
   the dataset for frontal face images was created for evaluating
   applications for frontal face recognition in images. it contains images
   of humans and information about the location of their faces in the
   pictures given by the x and y coordinates. you can download the set
   [32]here.

   frontal faces in the wild dataset

   examples from the frontal faces dataset

   labeled faces in the wild
   a commonly used set for face detection is the [33]labeled faces in the
   wild dataset. it holds more then 13,000 images that were collected from
   the web. many of the people in the set are represented by more than one
   picture, which is useful for face recognition evaluation.

    animals

   oxford-iiit pet dataset
   if you are looking for an extensive cats-and-dogs dataset, you might
   want to check out [34]the oxford-iiit pet dataset. it covers 37
   categories of different cat and dog races with 200 images per category.
   unlike a lot of other datasets, the pictures included are not the same
   size. the cool thing about this dataset is that not only the images are
   provided, but also information about the position of the animal's face
   and about the fore- and background of the image (see image below).

   examples from the oxford-iiit pet dataset

   kth-animals
   in case you are looking for a more general animal dataset, the
   [35]kth-animals dataset might be worth a look. it can be downloaded
   [36]here and provides images for 19 different classes. each class is
   represented by around 100 pictures of different sizes. as in the
   oxford-iiit pet dataset, there is also information provided about the
   fore- and background.

    various objects

   cifar-10 and cifar-100
   for more advanced image classification applications, you might be
   interested in the cifar sets. these sets contain coloured images with
   the size of 32x32pixels and can be downloaded from [37]alex
   krizhevsky's website.
   the cifar-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images, equally distributed
   over 10 categories. in case you are looking for a more complex set with
   more categories, you can use the cifar-100 dataset, which provides
   pictures from 100 classes and 20 superclasses.

   excerpt of the cifar-10 dataset

   excerpt of the cifar-10 dataset, source:
   https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

   both cifar sets can be downloaded for python, matlab or as binary
   version. if you prefer to work with the data as png images, you can use
   [38]this tool to convert the dataset.

   stl-10
   the images provided in the cifar datasets are very small, so if you
   want to work with higher resolution pictures, the [39]stl-10 dataset
   could be interesting for you. the dataset contains labeled pictures of
   10 classes and is similar to the cifar-10 dataset, but the images have
   the size of 96x96 pixels. there are also fewer labeled examples per
   class, but the set has a large collection of unlabeled images that can
   be used for unsupervised training.
