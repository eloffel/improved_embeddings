19 data science and machine learning tools for people who don   t know
programming

   [98]aarshay jain, may 16, 2018

   this article was originally published on 5 may, 2016 and updated with
   the latest tools on may 16, 2018.

introduction

   programming is an integral part of data science. among other things, it
   is acknowledged that a person who understands programming logic, loops
   and functions has a higher chance of becoming a successful data
   scientist. but, what about those folks who never studied programming in
   their school or college days?

   is there no way for them to become a data scientist then?

   with the recent boom in data science, a lot of people are interested in
   getting into this domain. but don   t have the slightest idea about
   coding. in fact, i too was a member of your non-programming league
   until i joined my first job. therefore, i understand how terrible it
   feels when something you have never learned haunts you at every step.

   data science tools for non programmers

   the good news is that there is a way for you to become a data
   scientist, regardless of your programming skills! there are tools that
   typically obviate the programming aspect and provide user-friendly gui
   (graphical user interface) so that anyone with minimal knowledge of
   [99]algorithms can simply use them to build high quality machine
   learning models.

   many companies (especially startups) have recently launched gui driven
   data science tools. i have tried to cover a few important ones in this
   article and provided videos as well, wherever possible.

   note: all the information provided is gather from open-source
   information sources. we are just presenting some facts and not
   opinions. in no manner do we intent to promote/advertise any of the
   products/services.

   rapidminer (rm) was originally started in 2006 as an open-source
   stand-alone software named rapid-i. over the years, they have given it
   the name of rapidminer and also attained ~35mn usd in funding. the
   tool is open-source for old version (below v6) but the latest versions
   come in a 14-day trial period and licensed after that.

   rm covers the entire life-cycle of prediction modeling, starting from
   data preparation to model building and finally validation and
   deployment. the gui is based on a block-diagram approach, something
   very similar to matlab simulink. there are predefined blocks which act
   as plug and play devices. you just have to connect them in the right
   manner and a large variety of algorithms can be run without a single
   line of code. on top of this, they allow custom r and python scripts to
   be integrated into the system.

   there current product offerings include the following:
    1. rapidminer studio: a stand-alone software which can be used for
       data preparation, visualization and statistical modeling
    2. rapidminer server: it is an enterprise-grade environment with

   bigml provides a good gui which takes the user through 6 steps as
   following:
     * sources: use various sources of information
     * datasets: use the defined sources to create a dataset
     * models: make predictive models
     * predictions: generate predictions based on the model
     * ensembles: create ensemble of various models
     * evaluation: very model against validation sets

   these processes will obviously iterate in different orders. the bigml
   platform provides nice visualizations of results and has algorithms for
   solving classification, regression, id91, anomaly
   detection and association discovery problems. they offer several
   packages bundled together in monthly, quarterly and yearly
   subscriptions. they even offer a free package but the size of the

   it is an ms excel-like application that is easy to use. it also
   provides visual guidance making it easy to bring together data, find
   and fix dirty or missing data, and share and re-use data projects
   across teams. like the other tools mentioned in this article, paxata
   eliminates coding or scripting, hence overcoming technical barriers
   involved in handling data.

   paxata platform follows the following process:
    1. add data: use a wide range of sources to acquire data
    2. explore: perform data exploration using powerful visuals allowing
       the user to easily identify gaps in data
    3. clean+change: perform data cleaning using steps like imputation,
       id172 of similar values using nlp, detecting duplicates
    4. shape: make pivots on data, perform grouping and aggregation
    5. share+govern: allows sharing and collaborating across teams with
       strong authentication and authorization in place
    6. combine: a proprietary technology called smartfusion allows
       combining data frames with 1 click as it automatically detects the
       best combination possible; multiple data sets can be combined into
       a single answerset

       unlimited users. ideal for big organizations

   trifacta offers a very intuitive gui for performing data cleaning. it
   takes data as input and provides a summary with various statistics by
   column. also, for each column it automatically recommends some
   transformations which can be selected using a single click. various
   transformations can be performed on the data using some
   pre-defined functions which can be called easily in the interface.

   trifacta platform uses the following steps of data preparation:
    1. discovering: this involves getting a first look at the data and
       distributions to get a quick sense of what you have
    2. structure: this involves assigning proper shape and variable
       types to the data and resolving anomalies
    3. cleaning: this step includes processes like imputation, text
       standardization, etc. which are required to make the data model
       ready
    4. enriching: this step helps in improving the quality of analysis
       that can be done by either adding data from more sources or
       performing some feature engineering on existing data
    5. validating: this step performs final sense checks on the data
    6. publishing: finally the data is exported for further use

   trifacta is primarily used in the financial, life sciences and
   telecommunication industries.

       so the question to be asked here is that why are companies still
       asking for only r & sas or python skills. why are they not using
       the gui tools?

            i agree the penetration is less. i don   t think these tools are
            meant for the it industry. these will infiltrate into domains
            like heathcare, finance which are still dominated by domain
            experts.
            another thing is although the tools are there, but they have
            not reached their ultimate potential. i have downloaded the
            free versions wherever possible and found that this is lot of
            scope for improvement. but the thing is some of these are
            backed by big funding and they can grow over time and enhance
            their scope.

                 that   s actually a very good question. my guess is that it
                 has more to do with reluctance to adopt any technologies
                 (read software) and be more open to the general concept
                 and what it can do. my experience in silicon valley is
                 that most people are still fumbling around and trying out
                 new new things. dust has not yet settled, and when it
                 settles it python will still be around and    few    of these
                 software tools.

                 even in domain intensive fields like quantitative
                 finance, python is heavily used in pricing and risk
                 calculation apis for highly customized financial
                 products. these flexibility are not available in the drag
                 and drop tools.
                 as far sas is concerned, it has 200+ horizontal and
                 vertical solutions which requires no programming. for
                 example customer intelligence, cyber security, credit
                 risk, aml, ect. also sas has several drag and drop tools

       compliments the kind of research you have done to compile this

       day programming. so i was fascinated to use at least one of those
       top ten. please let me know what is the use of these tools in
       indian job scenario. i know data analysis is the sexiest job of the
       decade starting 2016.
       appreciate the future of start ups to come up with various types of
       data analysis tools which does not require programming skills. is
       there any training requirement to learn and use these tools?

       gosh, should i still stick to r ?
       i know the tools are scattered all over the industry, do you have a
       chart that shows the 4 quadrants on leadership products ?
       honestly each tool seems to duplicate the functions used across
       them, each trying to out bid each other ?
       perhaps we should stick to the big names that can fund products
       like google and microsoft ?

            i   m sorry i don   t have such a chart. i however have some
            thoughts,
            1. i would not recommend leaving r. r would provide a good
            base and then using these tools will be just a matter of time.
            2. all tools are not exactly same. some are differentiated on
            specific use cases. some are more prominent in few particular
            industries. so unless you are focussed on an industry and you
            are confident that a particular tool is being used there, i
            don   t think learning any 1 tool would help.
            3. i have downloaded the free versions of rapidminer and
            trifacta. my general perception is that these have a learning
            curve involved. you   ve to get used to the interface and
            identify its merits and demerits.
            hope this helps!

                 exactly.
                 leaving r will be suicidal, considering that r is the
                    lingua franca    of data science. it has only grown and
                 will keep evolving and retain its position as the
                 standard tool for data science. python has just entered
                 the realm, but it will never replace r at least because
                 of its general programming purpose.
                 as far as the gui tools are concerned, they have very
                 limited usage but are enjoyable to use. so i   m in
                 agreement with aarshay here. they might see very easy to
                 use, but when you start getting deep inside, gui
                 programmes can become quite difficult. spss was one such
                 case when i actually found r to be more clean and
                 straightforward to use, honestly.

                      by the way aarshay, i would provide rcommander as an
                      addition but only for those who are experienced in
                      r. it gives a fresh new usage to the otherwise 100%
                      command line option for r users. it looks somewhat
                      like excel and the best part is, executing every
                      command in rcommander provides the user with the
                      exact code that involves. so its a really nice way
                      to learn r   s nuts and bolts.

            though ibm spss is a big brand, but i think the new tools are
            comparable and work as mlaas (ml as a service). so they would
            be much more competitive in terms of price and might give a
            tough competition in near future.

       thanks for the excellent review, aarshay.
       we   re happy to be included, but had to smile at the title of your
       post.
       saying datarobot is for people who aren   t so good at programming is
       like saying spreadsheets are for people who aren   t so good at
       calculators.
       most of our users are excellent programmers, in fact, many, like
       @twiecki say    (these models) could be done using scikit-learn, but
       (datarobot) it is a huge time saver and produced results better
       than my own humble attempts.    see thomas    full comments here:
       [198]https://www.datarobot.com/blog/using-machine-learning-to-predi
       ct-out-of-sample-performance-of-trading-algorithms/
       the platform does accelerate the work of both business analysts and
       expert data scientists by automating many routine math and coding
       tasks, but more importantly it takes data science to a new level by
       applying massive compute power to build and test thousands of
       models in parallel to very quickly discover and deploy the optimal
       model for each specific data science problem.
       doing that simply isn   t possible manually    anymore than calculating
       the results of each cell on a spreadsheet would be    no matter how
       good you are at reverse polish notation. ;-))

            hi kirby,
            thanks for sharing your thoughts. i totally agree with you. i
            think i did a bad job at putting forward my thoughts in the
            title statement.
            i would like to clarify that when i say    tools for people not
            so good at programming   , i meant it as an advantage.
            programming experts can definitely use both types of tools,
            ones which require that skill or others which don   t. but tools
            like datarobot empower the non-programmers as well to be at
            par with expert coders. like you said, similar tasks can be
            done using scikit-learn, but one needs to know python
            programming to do that. datarobot is actually empowering
            someone who doesn   t know python to make the same level of
            models in a few clicks, if not more.
            i hope this thought process is aligned with the ideology
            behind datarobot. i don   t have a first-hand experience at
            using datarobot, but i really appreciate your efforts towards
            automating some aspects of data science and i would definitely
            use your platform whenever i get an opportunity.     
            thanks,

       aarshay,
       you   re correct     data savvy business people can definitely use
       datarobot, it   s not just for advanced data scientists.
       the process is dead simple: 1) upload data, 2) specify what you
       want to predict, and 3) press go. after that, you can explore
       features of the data, observe various models competing on the
       leaderboard, and a (very) short time later explore the leading
       models, choose one, and deploy it into production. i am no data
       scientist, and even i can get enormous value out of the platform.
       people who are good at math and programming can get even more value
       out of it, and perhaps can appreciate even more how difficult it
       would be to try to replicate this process using more traditional
       approaches.
       i hope you get a chance to try datarobot soon, virtually everyone i
       know who   s experienced it first hand has become an instant fan.

       the thing about some of these tolls is that really blackbox: you
       put data in and it spits predictions out. this sounds miraculous
       but in my experience it   s hard to put into production and leads to
       operational teams who don   t understand where your scores come from
       so they won   t use them.
       have you heard of dataiku though? [full disclosure, i work there].
       we believe that it   s important to keep control of your data and
       understand what happens to it. so our tool has a gui that allows
       people with no coding experience to click along and clean data, and
       deploy models (we integrate scikitlearn and mllib algorithms). it
       also allows    clickers    to collaborate with coders who work in
       python, r, sql, hive, pyspark etc, so you have a project that   s
       production ready. that way you can track all the different steps of
       the process, iterate on them, understand where your scoring come
       from, and monitor it.
       check it out and let me know what you think:

       revolution analytics actually had a partnership with alteryx where
       all the data blending/data exploration etc would be seaid113ssly
       integrated right out of their drag and drop workflow and the heavy
       work load would be done by revolution analytics on the background
       with all the r libraries and scripts available out of the box
       without manually requiring to write r codes. sadly, i believe this
       partnership had stopped after microsoft took over revolution
       analytics.

       great thread, so much information, just saying thanks. i just
       started a graduate school program in data science and was assured
       to learn that the r programming i am learning is not just yet
       another tool, but worth the effort to master.

       hi aarshay, thanks for a great article.
       9 predictions that would decide the future of java programming
       in this article, we will focus our attention on the predictions
       related to the world of programming. obviously, our attention will
       be on java predictions. to learn java programming, take the help
       ofjava programming course in pune.
       guess what?
       these predictions are well made and almost certain to come out
       true!
       so, let us begin with them   .
       1. smartphones will do all but voice calls:
       2. javascript will rule:
       3.bosses will turn ruthless:
       4. databases will grow in size:
       5. video curbs the html star:
       6. binary protocols would emerge:
       7. rest continues to rule:
       8. php will fight against node.js:
       9. almost all would have programming knowledge:
       keeping these predictions in mind, look for best java training
       institutes in pune.
