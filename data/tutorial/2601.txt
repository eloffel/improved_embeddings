free must read books on statistics & mathematics for data science

   [98]analytics vidhya content team, february 17, 2016

introduction

   the selection process of data scientists at google gives higher
   priority to candidates with strong background in statistics and
   mathematics. not just google, other top companies (amazon, airbnb, uber
   etc) in the world also prefer candidates with strong fundamentals
   rather than mere know-how in data science.

   if you too aspire to work for such top companies in future, it is
   essential for you to develop a mathematical understanding of data
   science. data science is simply the evolved version of statistics and
   mathematics, combined with programming and business logic. i   ve met
   many data scientists who struggle to explain predictive models
   statistically.

   more than just deriving accuracy, understanding & interpreting every
   metric, calculation behind that accuracy is important. remember, every
   single    variable    has a story to tell. so, if not anything else, try
   to become a great story explorer!

   in this article, i   ve compiled a list of must read books on statistics
   and mathematics. i understand, mathematics has no extreme. hence, i   ve
   enlist only those books which will help you to connect with data
   science better.

   note: books which are made free to access by the registered authorities
   have been mentioned in this article. if not, a link to amazon bookstore
   is provided.

       almost 3.6 years exp as database developer and much interest in
       data related works. . but my background qualification is b.a
       general then 3 years diploma in (software engineering) , microsoft

            hi ravi
            i understand your trouble and would like to help you in this
            regards.
            your education qualification is not at all a problem
            considering your experience in it. may be, your organization
            might have put a selection filter but other big data courses
            don   t do that. here is a list of top certifications in big
            data in 2016

            -16/#seven
            completing any of these certification will surely add to your
            skills and job possibilities.

       awesome list, manish. the first two books on statistical learning
       are goldmines of knowledge. the book by devroye et al looks
       extremely rigorous and challenging although it could be used by
       anyone with [really] strong mathematical foundations in real
       analysis, (measure theoretic) id203 and related subjects.
       thanks for recommending this book, it may probably be the next book
       on my    to-study    list. would you mind if i recommend a few
       foundations books so that people who wanna study these books have a
       good background?

       hi manish,
       nice collection, one more best book which i can suggest for data
       science newbies is    an introduction to data science    by jeffrey
       stanton, syracuse university & robert w. de graaf. i hope we can
       learn basic statistics and r programming at a time with this book.

       and college level statistics. i aspire to become a data scientist.
       i need encouragement to take up this profession.

       i noticed that the kreyszig book is mentioned which is a standard
       in engineering degrees at least in india. another cheap option, and
       the books are extremely good, are from n. e. piskunov. however, the
       coverage is a little tougher.
       here are some other books (free) in case you want to dive into
       individual topics:
       single and multivariable calculus

       partial differential equations

       bayesian statistics

       signals and systems
       [223]http://www.eng.ucy.ac.cy/cpitris/courses/ece623/notes/signalsa
       ndsystems.pdf
       i included a book on signals and systems because i think fourier
       analysis is also very important in data science/machine learning.
       some great courses are mentioned in:
