tutorial     getting started with graphlab for machine learning in python

   [97]sunil ray, december 3, 2015

introduction

   graphlab came as an unexpected breakthrough on my learning plan. after
   all,     good things happen when you expect them least to happen   . it all
   started with the end of [98]black friday data hack. out of 1200
   participants, we got our winners and their interesting [99]solutions.

   i read and analyzed them. i realized that i had missed on an incredible
   machine learning tool. a quick exploration told me that this tool has
   immense potential to reduce our machine learning modeling pains. so, i
   decided to explore it further. i now have dedicated a few days to
   understand its science and logical methods of usage. to my surprise, it
   wasn   t difficult to understand.

   were you trying to improve your machine learning model ? but failed
   mostly? try this advanced machine learning tool. a month trial is free
   and 1 year subscription is available for free for academic use. then,
   you can purchase subscription for following years.

   to get you started quickly, here is a beginners guide on graphlab in
   python. for ease of understanding, i   ve tried to explain these concepts
   in simplest possible manner.


topics covered

    1. how it all started ?
    2. what is graphlab ?
    3. benefits and limitations of graphlab
    4. how to install graphlab ?
    5. getting started with graphlab


how it all started ?

   graphlab has an interesting story of its inception. let me tell you in
   brief.

   graphlab, known as dato is founded by [100]carlos guestrin. carlos
   holds ph.d in computer science from stanford university.  it happened
   around 7 years back. carlos was a professor at carnegie mellon
   university. two of his students were working on large scale distributed
   machine learning algorithms. they ran their model on top of hadoop and
   found it took quite long to compute. situations didn   t even improve
   after using [101]mpi (high performance computing library).

   so, they decided to build a system to write more papers quickly. with
   this, graphlab came into existence.

   p.s     graphlab create is a commercial software by graphlab. graphlab
   create is accessed in python using    graphlab    library. hence, in this
   article,    graphlab    connotes graphlab create. don   t get confused.


what is graphlab?

   graphlab is a new parallel framework for machine learning written in
   c++. it is an open source project and has been designed considering the
   scale, variety and complexity of real world data. it incorporates
   various high level algorithms such as stochastic id119
   (sgd), id119 & locking to deliver high performance
   experience. it helps data scientists and developers easily create and
   install applications at large scale.

   but, what makes it amazing?  it   s the presence of neat libraries for
   data transformation, manipulation and model visualization. in addition,
   it comprises of scalable machine learning toolkits which has everything
   (almost) required to improve machine learning models. the toolkit
   includes implementation for deep learning, factor machines, topic
   modeling, id91, nearest neighbors and more.

   here is the complete architecture of graphlab create.

   [102]architechture


what are the benefits of using graphlab ?

   there are multiple benefits of using graphlab as described below:
     * handles large data: data structure of graphlab can handle large
       data sets which result into scalable machine learning. let   s look
       at the data structure of graph lab:
          + [103]sframe: it is an efficient disk-based tabular data
            structure which is not limited by ram. it helps to scale
            analysis and data processing to handle large data set (tera
            byte), even on your laptop. it has similar syntax like pandas
            or r data frames. each column is an sarray, which is a series
            of elements stored on disk. this makes sframes disk based. i
            have discussed the methods to work with    sframes    in
            following sections.
          + [104]sgraph: graph helps us to understand networks by
            analyzing relationships between pair of items. each item is
            represented by a vertex in the graph. relationship between
            items is represented by edges. in graphlab, to perform a
            graph-oriented data analysis, it uses [105]sgraph object. it
            is a scalable graph data structure which store vertices and
            edges in sframes. to know more about this, please refer this
            [106]link. below is graph representation of james bond
            characters.
            [107]bond_basic

     integration with various data sources: graphlab supports various data
   sources like s3, odbc, json, csv, hdfs and many more.

     data exploration and visualization with graphlab canvas. graphlab
   canvas is a browser-based interactive gui which allows you to explore
   tabular data, summary statistics and bi-variate plots. using this
   feature, you spend less time coding for data exploration. this will
   help you to focus more on understanding the relationship and
   distribution of variables. i have discussed this part following
   sections.

     feature engineering: graphlab has an inbuilt option to create new
   useful features to enhance model performance. it comprises of various
   options like transformation, binning, imputation, one hot encoding,
   tf-idf etc.

     modeling: graphlab has various toolkits to deliver easy and fast
   solution for ml problems. it allows you to perform various modeling
   exercise (regression, classification, id91) in fewer lines of
   code. you can work on problems like id126, churn
   prediction, id31, image analysis and many more.

     production automation: data pipelines allow you to assemble reusable
   code task into jobs. then, automatically run them on common execution
   environments (e.g. amazon web services, hadoop).

     graphlab create sdk: advance users can extend the capabilities of
   graphlab create using graphlab creat sdk. you can define new machine
   learning models/ programs  and integrate them with the rest of the
   package. see the github repository [108]here.

     license: it has limitation to use. you can go for 30 days free trial
   period or one year license for academic edition. to extend your
   subscription you;ll be charged (see subscription structure [109]here).


how to install graphlab?

   you can also use graphlab once you have availed its license.
   however, you can also get started with free trial or the academic
   edition with 1 year subscription. so, prior to installation, your
   machine must fulfill the system requirement to run graphlab.

   system requirement for graphlab:

   [110]system_requirement

   if your system fails to meet above requirement, you can use
   [111]graphlab create on the aws free tier also.

   steps for installation:
     * register for [112]free trail. after registration, you will receive
       a product key
     * select your operating system (auto selection is on) and follow the
       given instructions
     * below is the command line installation instruction (for    anaconda
       python environment   ).

   [113]installation_instruction


getting started with graphlab

   after you   ve installed graphlab successfully, you can access it using
      import <library_name>   .
import graphlab
or
import graphlab as gl

   here, i   ll demonstrate the use of graphlab by solving  a data science
   challenge. i have the taken data set from [114]black friday data hack.

     * load data set: as discussed, sframe is the tabular data structure
       available in graphlab. sframes can import data in various formats
       (csv, json, apache avro, odbc ..). a common data format is comma
       separated value (csv) file. in this example, i   ll use csv files.
       now, i load test and train data sets:
sf_train=graphlab.sframe('c:/users/analytics vidhya/desktop/datasets/black_frida
y/train.csv')
sf_test=graphlab.sframe('c:/users/analytics vidhya/desktop/datasets/black_friday
/test.csv')
     * data exploration and visualization: this is a crucial stage of data
       modeling exercise. it require lots of code to infer relationships,
       outliers, missing values. but not in graphlab. here, they   ve
       reduced the coding element (almost minimize) and allows you to
       focus on decision making. let   s explore the data set:
          + see top/ bottom x records:  we can look at the top x records
            of the data set like we do in pandas.sf_train.head(3)
          + [115]top_records unique values of a variable: again, we have
            similar commands as pandas to look at the unique values in a
            variable. [116]unique_values
          + distribution and relationship of variables: you can visualize
            relationships and distribution with just one command for all
            variables. i have already discussed about canvas (web based
            interactive visualization platform to explore data). data in
            an sframe can be visualized with sframe.show(). when we run
            command sframe.show(), it returns a url which redirects
            to graphlab canvas. by default, the data section
            remains active and has three tabs namely:
               o summary: it shows number of columns available in sframe
                 with summary of data. numeric columns (int and float)
                 show a basic summary statistics (num_unique, missing
                 values as num_undefined, min, max, median, mean, std)
                 with box plot. string columns show number of unique
                 values, missing values and table of most frequent items
                 in the column.
                 [117]summary
               o tables: it provide interactive tabular view of the data
                 inside sframe. the paging controls on the left side
                 (image below) allows you to move quickly through the
                 sframe.
                 [118]table click on variable name to look its
                 distribution. below, you can see the frequency table and
                 bar graph for variable age.
                 [119]individual_distribution
               o plot: it helps to create bi-variate plots. currently, it
                 supports scatter plot, heatmap, bar chart, box plot, and
                 line chart. here, you select variables for x and y axis.
                 then, based on data type of variables, it activates the
                 relevant chart option(s). for example: if both x and
                 y-axis variables are numeric, it activates scatter plot.
                 in the bar chart, you have options to add other metrics
                 like standard deviation, min, max, sum, mean and others.
                 [120]plot above, we learnt the steps to
                 create visualization in a browser. but, you can also
                 visualize these information in you ipython notebook. this
                 can be done by, first setting target to ipython notebook
                 then visualize information.
                 [121]inline_visualization

     * data manipulation: you can also perform data manipulation operation
       with sframe such as adding a constant value to all values,
       concatenating two or more variables, create a new variable based
       exiting variable(s) as shown below:
          + add a constant value to variable:
            [122]add_constant_value
          + concatenate two strings and store it to a new variable:
            [123]concatenate_store
          + update values of existing variables: this can be done using
            apply function. in this data set, i have combined age buckets
            greater than 50 using code below:
# make a change to existing variable
# combine all bins of age greater than 50
def combine_age(age):
 if age=='51-55':
 return '50+'
 elif age=='55+':
 return '50+'
 else:
 return age
sf['age']=sf['age'].apply(combine_age)
            now, look at the pre and post visualization of variable    age   .
            [124]pre_post for more details on data manipulation using
            graphlab, please refer this [125]link.
     * feature engineering: feature engineering is an efficient method to
       improve model performance. using this technique, we can create new
       variable(s) after transformation or manipulation of existing
       existing variable(s). in fact, graphlab has automated this
       process. they have various transformation options for numerical,
       categorical, text and image features. also, you   ll find direct
       options for feature binning, imputation, one hot encoding, count
       threshold, tf-idf, hasher, tokenzing and others. let   s look at the
       imputation of categorical feature    product_category_2    based on
          age    and    gender    of    black friday    data set.
# create the data
# variables based on which we want to perform imputation and variable to impute
# you can look at the algorithms behind the imputation [126]here.

sf_impute = sf_train['age','gender','product_category_2']
imputer = graphlab.feature_engineering.categoricalimputer(feature='product_categ
ory_2')
# fit and transform on the same data
transformed_sf = imputer.fit_transform(sf_impute)
#retrieve the imputed values
transformed_sf

[127] impute_categorical
       finally, you can take this input variable to original data set.
sf_train['predicted_product_category_2']=transformed_sf['predicted_feature_produ
ct_category_2']
       similarly, you can apply other feature engineering operations to
       the data set based on your requirement. you can refer this
       [128]link for more details.
     * modeling: at this stage, we do predictions from the past data.
       graphlab easily create models for common tasks, such as:
       a) predicting numeric quantities
       b) building id126s
       c) id91 data and documents
       d) analyzing graphs

   in black friday challenge, we are required predict the numeric
   quantities    purchase    i.e. we need a regression model to predict the
      purchase   .

   in graphlab, we have three type of regression models:
   a) id75
   b) id79 regression
   c) gradient boosted regression
   if you have any confusion in algorithm selection, graphlab takes care
   of that. don   t worry. it selects the right regression model
   automatically.
# make a train-test split
train_data, validate_data = sf_train.random_split(0.8)
# automatically picks the right model based on your data.
model = graphlab.regression.create(train_data, target='purchase', features = ['g
ender','age','occupation','city_category','stay_in_current_city_years',
 'marital_status','product_category_1'])
# save predictions to an sarray
predictions = model.predict(validate_data)
# evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary
results = model.evaluate(validate_data)
results

   output:
{'max_error': 13377.561969523947, 'rmse': 3007.1225949345117}
#do prediction on test data set
final_predictions = model.predict(sf_test)

   to know more about other modeling techniques like id91,
   classification, id126, text analysis,  graph analysis,
   id126s you can refer this [129]link. alternatively,
   here is the complete [130]user guide by dato.


end notes

   in this article,  we learnt about    graphlab create    which helps to
   handle large data set while building machine learning models. we also
   looked at the data structure of graphlab which enables it to handle
   large data set like    sframe    and    sgraph   . i   d recommend you to use
   graphlab. you   d love its automated features like data exploration
   (canvas, interactive web data exploration tool), feature engineering,
   selecting the right models and deployment.

   for better understanding, i   ve also demonstrated a modeling exercise
   using graphlab.  in my next article on graphlab, i will focus on graph
   analysis and id126.

       hi sunil,
       very good write up, just wanted to add that currently carlos
       guestrin is offering a machine learning specialization on coursera
       and they are using graphlab for all the exercises. just in case if
       any one is interested. also, i wish to highlight that graphlab has
       its own issues like no 32-bit os support etc.

       very useful. would be great to see something similar on other ml
       and data science tools and platforms, and also some comparison
       between them. there are so many options available these days its
       difficult to separate wheat from the chaff, and also to know which
       ones will still be around in 5y time and hence are worth investing
       (both time and money) in. thanks!

       hi sunil,
       i am currently doing the above course (
       [153]https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/lecture/6wd6h/vi
       sualizing-predictions-of-simple-model-with-matplotlib ). but i
       don   t want to use graphlab, instead i am using pandas, numpy for
       assignments.
       in the course, the instructor has created a regression model, and
       then he shows the prediction using matplotlib:
       build regression model
       sqft_model = graphlab.linear_regression.create(train_data,
       target=   price   , features=[   sqft_living   ],validation_set=none)
       and then the prediction code is as follows:
       plt.plot(test_data[   sqft_living   ],test_data[   price   ],   .   ,
       test_data[   sqft_living   ],sqft_model.predict(test_data),   -   )
       in the above image, blue dots are test data, green line is the
       prediction from the simple regression. i am a complete beginner to
       programming and python. i wanted to use free resources such as
       pandas and scikit. i have used following to do the same in ipython:
       build regression model
       from pandas.stats.api import ols
       sqft_model = ols(y=train_data[   price   ],
       x=train_data[   sqft_living   ])
       but, i get the following error while inputting the prediction code:
       valueerror: the truth value of a series is ambiguous. use a.empty,
       a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all()
       thus, i am not able to produce the desired result as done by the
       instructor (i.e. the image shown above). can you help me out?
