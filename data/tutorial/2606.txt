lifetime lessons: 20 things every data scientist must know today

   [97]kunal jain, november 18, 2015

introduction

   i   ve spent close to a decade in data science & analytics now. over this
   period, i have learnt new ways of working on data sets and creating
   interesting stories. however, before i could succeed, i failed numerous
   times. success doesn   t come easy!

   how did i succeed? the answer is simple. every time i failed, i said to
   myself,    let   s take one more step   . and i managed to travel a long
   distance. i learnt statistics, data mining, sas, r, python, machine
   learning on the way.

   i confess that, in last 10 years, the methods of predictive modeling
   have become faster. data is becoming larger than ever. we faced
   constraints when faced with big data. but, people came out with several
   big data technologies.

   it   s overwhelming to see how the things have changed. but, there would
   still be many who are lagging to catch up with success in data science
   industry.

   hence, i decided to share 20 things which experience has taught me in
   the last 10 years. hope you find them useful. the idea is to help
   people, who don   t have a mentor to provide them this advice all the
   time. so go ahead and read!

       kunal good day. first of all, thank you so much for your blogs on
       analytics vid. i think that your blogs help me understand better ml
       and business analytics more..my name is arailym. i am from
       kazakhstan.i want build my career in business analytics. i have
       b.s. degree in economics. i know statistics basics and try to learn
       as much more algoritms of ml. i see that is company where i want to
       apply is required deep learning math. i read blogs of linear
       algebra and id203, but i afraid that i couldn   t remind all
       math. (especially discrete mathematics, integrals so on)
       alsoi want to participate in university competition. they required
       present project . i don\t know what to get available data and which
       tool i should use. i afraid if i take data from kaggle that the
       would think that i cheated/ i want to do solve problems like
       segmentation or fraud detection. plese help me. thank you in
       advance. i

       hi kunal,
       thanks for sharing. i have a query on 5th one, ensemble modeling.
       i was in the impression that different and appropriate algorithms
       are used to build models and improve accuracy. but here you say
       combine models and algorithms to boost accuracy. can you elaborate
       on that by citing examples?
       thanks,

       i regularly follow your post in linkedin. it is very helpful..
       after completing my mca in 2007 i had only 1 year java
       experience..after that i got married .due to some circumstances i
       couldnt continue my job..but now i want to reboost my career in
       bigdata industry   is it possible after taking such a long gap to
       reenter in this industry?i am already doing small courses from
       coursera as you suggested.i am eagerly waiting for your valuable
       suggestion.

       i beg to differ on one point though ! python is nowhere near r in
       statistical modeling and ease of use ,,,,,
       people say r has a steep learning curve , and its true ! python is
       easy , again true but as far as cleanliness of the r environment
       for statistics and a gigantic library of r packages plus the
       incredible syntax highlighter of r studio i don   t really see myself
       using python . as far code execution speed is concerned you can
       always use the parallel library in r or write vectorised code or
       use h2o library or use the the enhanced r distribution from
       revolution r open . python is king of flexibility and r is the
       undisputed king of statistics
