dmtk

   distributed machine learning toolkit [82]https://www.dmtk.io please
   open issues in the project below. for any technical support email to
   [83]dmtk@microsoft.com

   dmtk includes the following projects:
     * [84]dmtk framework(multiverso): the parameter server framework for
       distributed machine learning.
     * [85]lightlda: scalable, fast and lightweight system for large-scale
       id96.
     * [86]lightgbm: lightgbm is a fast, distributed, high performance
       gradient boosting (gbdt, gbrt, gbm or mart) framework based on
       decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many
       other machine learning tasks.
     * [87]distributed id27: distributed algorithm for word
       embedding implemented on multiverso.
