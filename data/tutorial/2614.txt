readme

this is a machine learning module i found here:

[79]http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~girolami/machine_learning_module_2006/week_2/lectu
res/wk_2_lect_2.pdf

none of this material is mine, it has all been created by professor. m. a .girol
ami.
this is hands down the best machine-learning tutorials i have found on the web,
and i was afraid
the university link would be taken down, so now its on github.

i hope you enjoy this as much as i did.
