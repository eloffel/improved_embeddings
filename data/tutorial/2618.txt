python programming for the humanities

   [101]join the chat at https://gitter.im/fbkarsdorp/python-course

   the programming language [102]python is widely used within many
   scientific domains nowadays and the language is readily accessible to
   scholars from the humanities. python is an excellent choice for dealing
   with (linguistic as well as literary) textual data, which is so typical
   of the humanities. in this book you will be thoroughly introduced to
   the language and be taught to program basic algorithmic procedures. the
   book expects no prior experience with programming, although we hope to
   provide some interesting insights and skills for more advanced
   programmers as well. the book consists of 10 chapters. chapter 5 and
   chapter 6 are still in draft status and not ready for use.
     * [103]chapter 1 starts with the very basics where we will try to
       whet your appetite. you will be asked to do many short quizzes to
       test whether you really understand the material.
     * [104]chapter 2 will introduce you to the task of text processing.
       you will learn how to read files from your computer, how to clean
       them and and how to compute a word frequency distribution.
     * [105]chapter 3 deals with preprocessing text. you will be
       introduced to some elementary tools to analyse your data.
     * [106]chapter 4 is a more theoretical chapter that explains some
       basic programming principles, common practices and where to find
       documentation.
     * in [107]chapter 5 things are becoming increasingly difficult.
       first, you will write a program to compute the readability of
       texts. next, you will implement the basic algorithm that is behind
       authorship attribution!
     * in [108]chapter 6 we will introduce you to the concept of object
       oriented programming. you will implement a network structure with
       which you can analyze relations between people on twitter.
     * from chapter 7 onwards, we will start working on more real
       applications. in [109]chapter 7 we will work on systems for
       searching through collections of text. we introduce you to the
       field of information retrieval and build a simple information
       retrieval system. this chapter furthers your knowledge about object
       oriented programming.
     * in [110]chapter 8 we create a complete web application to search
       through your own library of pdf files. this will be our first real
       application ready for use by end-users. the chapter introduces you
       to many modules available in the standard library as well as
       third-party modules.
     * [111]chapter 9 will introduce you to some of the more advanced
       techniques used in automatic classification. we will implement a
       naive bayes classifier, show you a number of id74 and
       strategies, and briefly address the question of parameter
       optimization.
     * [112]chapter 10 focuses on hierarchical id91, one of the
       important methods for unsupervized learning. we explain the basic
       methods for doining hierarchical id91 and create a simple
       implementation in python.

   this document describes the installation procedure for all the software
   needed for the python class. if you're stuck anywhere in the
   installation procedure, please do not hesitate to contact folgert
   karsdorp ([113]folgert.karsdorp@meertens.knaw.nl).

sublime text

   we advise you to install a good text editor, sublime text 2 for
   example. however, you are absolutely free to use your own favorite
   editor. for sublime text 2, go to [114]http://www.sublimetext.com/,
   download the version for your operating system and install.

   in the course, we will be using software that works best with google
   chrome. firefox 6 (or above) and safari will also work. internet
   explorer is not supported.

   we will be using python 3 for our course. lower versions are more or
   less supported, but not recommended.

installation

all platforms

   we strongly advise you to install the anaconda python distribution.
   this distribution contains all the necessary modules and packages
   needed for this course. it is available for all platforms and provides
   a simple installation procedure. you can download it from:
   [115]http://continuum.io/downloads. more detailed installation
   instructions can be found here:
   [116]http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html

   anaconda's default installation is python 2.7. however, we will use
   python 3 in this course. to install all necessary packages for python
   3, type
conda create -n py34 python=3.4 anaconda

   followed by
source activate py34

   at the command line. if you work on a windows machine, use the
   following command instead:
activate py34

   (if this doesn't work, have a look here:
   [117]http://continuum.io/blog/anaconda-python-3). after that, you can
   start the course by double-clicking the file start-windows.bat (if you
   are working on windows) or start-unix.sh if you work with linux or
   start-osx.command if you work on mac os x.

windows

   download and install the anaconda python distribution (see above).

   double click the file start-windows.bat.

   if everything goes right, this should open your browser (preferably
   google chrome or firefox) on a page [118]http://127.0.0.1:8888/ (or
   something similar) which says `ip[y]: notebook'. if for some reason,
   the notebook is opened by internet explorer, copy the url and paste
   that in either google chrome or firefox.

os x

   only take these steps if you know what you are doing. otherwise, simply
   download and install the anaconda python distribution (see above).
   after that, double click the file start-osx.command.

   first, you will need to install xcode from the app store. after you
   have successfully installed xcode, open xcode and go to xcode ->
   preferences -> downloads. now click on the install button next to
   commandline tools.

   open spotlight and type in `terminal' to open the terminal application.
   (you can also go to your applications folder and then to utilities
   where you'll find the terminal.app)

   cd to the folder where you downloaded or saved the file
   mac-installer.sh (probably in ~/downloads) by using
cd /folder/of/mac-installer.sh

   run the installer with the following command. the installer will
   download some packages and will request your password to install them.
. mac-installer.sh

   to check your installation, relaunch the terminal.app. then type:
ipython3 notebook --matplotlib=inline

   if everything went well, this should open your browser (best with
   google chrome or firefox) on the page [119]http://127.0.0.1:8888/ which
   says ip[y]: notebook.

linux (ubuntu/debian)

   only take these steps if you know what you are doing. otherwise, simply
   download and install the anaconda python distribution.

   first, open a terminal, then type
# debian 8 / ubuntu 16.04
$ sudo apt-get install python3 ipython3 ipython3-notebook numpy scipy matplotlib

   or
# debian 9 / ubuntu 17.04
$ sudo apt-get install python3 jupyter-notebook numpy scipy matplotlib

   if you run another linux distribution, similar packages should be
   available. finally execute the file start-unix.sh.

static notebooks

   this is a fall-back method.
