   published on jul 27, 2016

   the success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data
   representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different
   representations can entangle and hide more or less the different
   explanatory factors of variation behind the data. although specific
   domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning
   with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for ai is
   motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning
   algorithms implementing such priors. this talk reviews recent work in
   the area of unsupervised id171 and deep learning, focusing
   on advances in understanding the probabilistic and geometric (manifold)
   aspects of regularized auto-encoders. this motivates longer-term
   unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good
   representations, for computing representations (i.e., id136), and
   the geometrical connections between representation learning, density
   estimation and manifold learning. finally, the talk will briefly
   discuss the important question of why training deep or recurrent
   networks is difficult (and important to scale them towards ai) and
   recent advances in this regard.
