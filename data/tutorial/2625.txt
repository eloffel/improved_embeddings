webquestions qa benchmarking dataset

   webquestions ([79]http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sempre/ - berant et
   al., 2013, cc-by) is a popular dataset for benchmarking qa engines,
   especially ones that work on structured knowledge bases.

   this is an effort to make the dataset more organized and easier to use.
   we assign a unique id to each question, and distribute extra
   annotations for each question, e.g. pertaining the questions and
   freebase. we also provide several topic-based splits.

   this is a development version of the dataset. if you use it, please
   cite the git repository and date + shortid of the last commit. there
   are no stability guarantees yet both regarding the data format and the
   actual set of questions. this dataset is distributed under the terms of
   the cc-by 4.0 licence.
     * main/ has the dataset splits as distributed.
     * d-dump/ has question dumps from yodaqa.
     * d-freebase/ has mappings from question to single freebase key, as
       distributed with the original webquestions dataset.
     * d-freebase-mids/ has freebase mids for each concept in each
       question, based on yodaqa entity linking results from d-dump.
     * d-freebase-rp/ has extra custom-computed freebase relation paths.
     * d-freebase-brp/ has extra custom-computed branched freebase
       relation paths (superset of d-freebase-rp).
     * d-entities/ has entity occurences detected in question texts
       (generated by yao et al. for jacana).
     * t-movies/ has question sub-splits pertaining to the movies topic.

   some of the subsplits (d-dump, d-freebase-*) are autogenerated using a
   id53 system (yodaqa). to regenerate these, you can run
   scripts/dump-refresh.sh.

splits

   the original webquestions dataset has train (3778 q) and test (2032 q)
   splits. we keep all the questions within their respective splits, but
   separate train to a few further splits for the benefit of application
   of machine learning methods:
     * devtest (189 q): a set of questions to use for development but not
       to train models on. you may want to use these to decide which
       features to add, then check if the features generalize even for
       questions the model was not trained on.
     * val (755 q): a validation set - questions you do not use for
       training the model but for testing its performance when tuning the
       model (set of features, hyperparameters...). by using this set
       instead of the test set, you are making sure that you are not
       overfitting for the test set indirectly. ideally, you would
       completely withhold the test set, reporting only the final
       performance of your model on it, and use the val set for day-to-day
       development.
     * trainmodel (2834 q): a set of questions to use for model training.

   using these further splits is optional, just make sure to report
   whether you used the sub-splits or the complete train split for
   training (e.g. you are testing just a trivial model that requires no
   tuning, or simply want to be very strict about comparability with past
   research). it is also okay to use devtest and val combination as a
   validation set.

   to generate a .json file with the full train split, run
   scripts/mktrain.py.

data model

   the questions have identifiers in the form of "wqr%06d" (train) or
   "wqs%06d" (test) respectively, where %06d is six-digit number assigned
   based on the original dataset order. the master json files consist of
   an array with single object per question, where each object has string
   attribute "qid", string attribute "qtext" and an attribute "answers"
   which is an array of strings.

   various extra data are present in the d-*/ directories (see the
   respective readmes). to build a single file per split with full data
   for each question, run scripts/fulldata.py.

   to build a yodaqa-compatible dataset in the tsv format, run
   scripts/json2tsv.pl.
