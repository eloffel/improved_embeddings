convolutional attention network

   code related to the paper:
@inproceedings{allamanis2016convolutional,
  title={a convolutional attention network for extreme summarization of source c
ode},
  author={allamanis, miltiadis and peng, hao and sutton, charles},
  booktitle={international conference on machine learning (icml)},
  year={2016}
}

   for more information and the data of the paper, see [79]here.

   the project depends on theano and uses python 2.7.

usage instructions

   to train the copy_attention model with the data use
> python copy_conv_rec_learner.py <training_file> <max_num_epochs> <d> <test_fil
e>

   were d is the embedding space dimenssion (128 in paper.) the best model
   will be saved at <training_file>.pkl

   to evaluate an existing model re-run with exactly the same parameteres
   except for <max_num_epochs> which should be zero.

   the following code will generate names from a pre-trained model and a
   test_file with code examples.
model = convolutionalcopyattentionalrecurrentlearner.load(model_fname)
test_data, original_names = model.naming_data.get_data_in_recurrent_copy_convolu
tion_format(test_file, model.padding_size)
test_name_targets, test_code_sentences, test_code, test_target_is_unk, test_copy
_vectors = test_data

idx = 2  # pick an example from test_file
res = model.predict_name(np.atleast_2d(test_code[idx]))
print "original name:", ' '.join(original_names[idx].split(','))
print "code:", ' '.join(test_code[idx])
print "generated names:"
for r,v in res:
    print v, ' '.join(r)
