welcome to blocks    documentation![19]  

   blocks is a framework that helps you build and manage neural network
   models on using theano.

   want to get try it out? start by [20]installing blocks and having a
   look at the [21]quickstart further down this page. once you   re hooked,
   try your hand at the [22]tutorials and the [23]examples.

   blocks is developed in parallel with [24]fuel, a dataset processing
   framework.

   warning

   blocks is a new project which is still under development. as such,
   certain (all) parts of the framework are subject to change. the last
   stable (and thus likely an outdated) version can be found in the stable
   branch.

   tip

   that said, if you are interested in using blocks and run into any
   problems, feel free to ask your question on the [25]mailing list. also,
   don   t hesitate to file bug reports and feature requests by [26]making a
   github issue.

quickstart[40]  

   construct your model.
>>> mlp = mlp(activations=[tanh(), softmax()], dims=[784, 100, 10],
...           weights_init=isotropicgaussian(0.01), biases_init=constant(0))
>>> mlp.initialize()

   calculate your id168.
>>> x = tensor.matrix('features')
>>> y = tensor.lmatrix('targets')
>>> y_hat = mlp.apply(x)
>>> cost = categoricalcrossid178().apply(y.flatten(), y_hat)
>>> error_rate = misclassificationrate().apply(y.flatten(), y_hat)

   load your training data using fuel.
>>> mnist_train = mnist(("train",))
>>> train_stream = flatten(
...     datastream.default_stream(
...         dataset=mnist_train,
...         iteration_scheme=sequentialscheme(mnist_train.num_examples, 128)),
...     which_sources=('features',))
>>> mnist_test = mnist(("test",))
>>> test_stream = flatten(
...     datastream.default_stream(
...         dataset=mnist_test,
...         iteration_scheme=sequentialscheme(mnist_test.num_examples, 1024)),
...     which_sources=('features',))

   and train!
>>> from blocks.model import model
>>> main_loop = mainloop(
...     model=model(cost), data_stream=train_stream,
...     algorithm=gradientdescent(
...         cost=cost, parameters=computationgraph(cost).parameters,
...         step_rule=scale(learning_rate=0.1)),
...     extensions=[finishafter(after_n_epochs=5),
...                 datastreammonitoring(
...                     variables=[cost, error_rate],
...                     data_stream=test_stream,
...                     prefix="test"),
...                 printing()])
>>> main_loop.run()

...

   for a runnable version of this code, please see the mnist demo in our
   repository with [41]examples.

features[42]  

   currently blocks supports and provides:
     * constructing parametrized theano operations, called    bricks   
     * pattern matching to select variables and bricks in large models
     * algorithms to optimize your model
     * saving and resuming of training
     * monitoring and analyzing values during training progress (on the
       training set as well as on test sets)
     * application of graph transformations, such as dropout (limited
       support)

   in the future we also hope to support:
     * dimension, type and axes-checking
