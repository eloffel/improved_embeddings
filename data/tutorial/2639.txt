deepwalk

   deepwalk uses short id93 to learn representations for vertices
   in graphs.

usage

   example usage
          $deepwalk --input example_graphs/karate.adjlist --output
          karate.embeddings

   --input: input_filename

    1. --format adjlist for an adjacency list, e.g:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 18 20 22 32
2 1 3 4 8 14 18 20 22 31
3 1 2 4 8 9 10 14 28 29 33
...

    2. --format edgelist for an edge list, e.g:
1 2
1 3
1 4
...

    3.

        --format mat for a matlab .mat file containing an adjacency matrix
                (note, you must also specify the variable name of the
                adjacency matrix --matfile-variable-name)

   --output: output_filename

     the output representations in skipgram format - first line is
     header, all other lines are node-id and d dimensional
     representation:
34 64
1 0.016579 -0.033659 0.342167 -0.046998 ...
2 -0.007003 0.265891 -0.351422 0.043923 ...
...

   full command list
          the full list of command line options is available with
          $deepwalk --help

evaluation

   here, we will show how to evaluate deepwalk on the blogcatalog dataset
   used in the deepwalk paper. first, we run the following command to
   produce its deepwalk embeddings:
deepwalk --format mat --input example_graphs/blogcatalog.mat
--max-memory-data-size 0 --number-walks 80 --representation-size 128 --walk-leng
th 40 --window-size 10
--workers 1 --output example_graphs/blogcatalog.embeddings

   the parameters specified here are the same as in the paper. if you are
   using a multi-core machine, try to set --workers to a larger number for
   faster training. on a single machine with 24 xeon e5-2620 @ 2.00ghz
   cpus, this command takes about 20 minutes to finish (--workers is set
   to 20). then, we evaluate the learned embeddings on a multi-label node
   classification task with example_graphs/scoring.py:
python example_graphs/scoring.py --emb example_graphs/blogcatalog.embeddings
--network example_graphs/blogcatalog.mat
--num-shuffle 10 --all

   this command finishes in 8 minutes on the same machine. for faster
   evaluation, you can set --num-shuffle to a smaller number, but expect
   more fluctuation in performance. the micro f1 and macro f1 scores we
   get with different ratio of labeled nodes are as follows:
   % labeled nodes  10%   20%   30%   40%   50%   60%   70%   80%   90%
   micro-f1 (%)    35.86 38.51 39.96 40.76 41.51 41.85 42.27 42.35 42.40
   macro-f1 (%)    21.08 23.98 25.71 26.73 27.68 28.28 28.88 28.70 28.21

   note that the current version of deepwalk is based on a newer version
   of gensim, which may have a different implementation of the id97
   model. to completely reproduce the results in our paper, you will
   probably have to install an older version of gensim(version 0.10.2).

requirements

     * scipy

   (may have to be independently installed)

installation

    1. cd deepwalk
    2. pip install -r requirements.txt
