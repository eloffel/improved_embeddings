tflearn: deep learning library featuring a higher-level api for tensorflow.

   tflearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top
   of tensorflow. it was designed to provide a higher-level api to
   tensorflow in order to facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while
   remaining fully transparent and compatible with it.

   tflearn features include:
     * easy-to-use and understand high-level api for implementing deep
       neural networks, with tutorial and examples.
     * fast prototyping through highly modular built-in neural network
       layers, regularizers, optimizers, metrics...
     * full transparency over tensorflow. all functions are built over
       tensors and can be used independently of tflearn.
     * powerful helper functions to train any tensorflow graph, with
       support of multiple inputs, outputs and optimizers.
     * easy and beautiful graph visualization, with details about weights,
       gradients, activations and more...
     * effortless device placement for using multiple cpu/gpu.

   the high-level api currently supports most of recent deep learning
   models, such as convolutions, lstm, biid56, batchnorm, prelu, residual
   networks, generative networks... in the future, tflearn is also
   intended to stay up-to-date with latest deep learning techniques.

   note: latest tflearn (v0.3) is only compatible with tensorflow v1.0 and
   over.

quick overview

   code example
# classification
tflearn.init_graph(num_cores=8, gpu_memory_fraction=0.5)

net = tflearn.input_data(shape=[none, 784])
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 64)
net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 10, activation='softmax')
net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossid178')

model = tflearn.dnn(net)
model.fit(x, y)

# sequence generation
net = tflearn.input_data(shape=[none, 100, 5000])
net = tflearn.lstm(net, 64)
net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 5000, activation='softmax')
net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossid178')

model = tflearn.sequencegenerator(net, dictionary=idx, seq_maxlen=100)
model.fit(x, y)
model.generate(50, temperature=1.0)

   there are many more examples available [46]here.

where to start?

   to install tflearn, see: [47]installation guide.

   if your version of tensorflow is under 1.0: [48]upgrade tensorflow.

   to get started: [49]getting started with tflearn and [50]tflearn
   tutorials.

   for more examples: [51]examples list.

   to browse the api, check the [52]api documentation.
