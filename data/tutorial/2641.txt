introduction

   until a few years back, deep learning was considered of a lesser
   importance as compared to machine learning. the emergence of neural
   networks & big-data has made various tasks possible.

   back in 2009, deep learning was only an emerging field and only a few
   people recognized it as fruitful area of research. but soon it gained
   momentum and is used today for several applications. speech
   recognition, image recognition, finding patterns in a dataset, object
   classification in photographs, character text generation, self-driving
   cars and many more. hence it is important to be familiar with deep
   learning and its concepts.

   to make it easier for you to learn deep learning, i have curated list
   of youtube videos, tutorials and courses on deep learning from 2016.
   the list includes talks & tutorials from deep learning summer school,
   summits, and conference.

   i hope you will find this helpful.


who can benefit from these videos?

   the videos have been shortlisted for beginners, intermediates and
   experts in deep learning.

   the article has been divided into sections for each one of you. if you
   a novice or intermediate in deep learning then start with the first
   section. if you want to master deep learning then this article will be
   your best resource. first, make a schedule and start learning deep
   learning. i bet  in few weeks you will at least be able to build your
   first model in deep learning.

   for experts in deep learning, the advanced section contains good videos
   for you to enhance your knowledge. the 5 mins videos in the beginners
   will be a good refresher for you.

   for all deep learning / data science enthusiasts you will love the
   applications of deep learning and examples segregated in a separate
   section. there are videos on google deepmind, learn to paint using deep
   learning and how deep learning is making self-driving cars a reality.

   there is also a small section on id23 with one of its
   applications.

            hi nivin,
            there are no pre-requisites. the beginner   s section includes
            videos which will help you get started with deep learning. you
            can start from the first video.
