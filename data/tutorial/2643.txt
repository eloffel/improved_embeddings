building a machine learning / deep learning workstation for under $5000

   [98]kunal jain, november 29, 2016

introduction

   building a machine learning / deep learning workstation can be
   difficult and intimidating. there are so many choices out there. would
   you go for nvidia developer box and spend $15,000? or could you build
   something better in a more cost effective manner. which hardware is
   right for your requirements? how much ram do you need? the questions
   are endless and there might be no right or wrong answers.

   we just finished building our first workstation at analytics vidhya. it
   was a special moment for all of us at analytics vidhya. not because the
   server is a monster (which it is) and we can now let our fantasies run
   on a much larger machine. but, because we were all proud of what we
   have built together. building this server was symbolic of something
   much bigger. it meant that as an organization, we are coming out of our
   monthly cash flow challenges and starting to build for an exciting
   future.

   while building this work station, we faced several trade-offs. we made
   several choices people come across while creating a workstation for
   data science. in this article, i will highlight some of the choices we
   made while building this server, the steps in getting it up and running
   and the thrill of running first large dataset on it. if you are only
   interested in knowing the configuration, you can read it below. if you
   are interested in understanding the trade-offs and the reasons for the
   hardware / software we chose, you can continue to read the rest of the
   article.


configuration of the workstation:

     * processor     [99]intel xeon e2630 v4     10 core processor, 2.2 ghz
       with turboboost upto 3.1 ghz. 25 mb cache
     * motherboard     asrock [100]epc612d8a
     * ram     128 gb ddr4 2133 mhz
     * 2 tb hard disk (7200 rpm) + 512 gb ssd
     * gpu     [101]nvidia titanx pascal (12 gb vram)
     * intel heatsink to keep temperature under control
     * storm trooper cabinet


pros and cons of building a workstation?

   i am sure some of you would be asking, why build a monster workstation
   in today   s world? why not rent a machine on the cloud?

   the true answer is it depends on your requirements. in our case, this
   was the best way to enable the team to do machine learning at scale.
   just to give some context, analytics vidhya currently has 5 people
   today, who might work on large datasets or huge computations. these
   datasets could come from competitions, real world problems from clients
   looking to crowd source solutions from our community or running
   solutions of our winners to verify them.

   here are the reasons, why building a workstation worked best for us:
     * efficient use of resources     till now, we used to enable people
       with laptops having 16 gb ram. while it is not bad, it is not the
       most efficient way to use the resources. firstly, if the dataset
       needs higher ram, we had no way but to rent a bigger machine.
       secondly, not every one was using all the ram all the time, but
       needed high ram when needed. by creating a workstation, we are able
       to pool in same resources, but if required people can have access
       to a much bigger machine. similar argument applies for number of
       cores, if you want to perform parallel computing.
     * ease of travel with laptops     it is difficult to find machines
       which are good for data science (i5 / i7 quad core processor with
       16 gb ram) which are light and not too expensive. due to resource
       constraints, we were forced to buy bulky laptops. with a
       workstation, people could buy cheaper and lighter laptops and
       connect to the work station when needed for the computations.
     * enabling large scale deep learning     even if we would have spent
       more on getting the laptops, you can   t get similar gpu power on a
       laptop today. moving to a workstation enabled us to order the
       nvidia titan x 2016, one of the fastest gpu in the world today!
       there was no way to get this on a laptop and cloud based gpus would
       have been too expensive.
     * limitations on big data transfers to cloud     while getting
       computational power on cloud has become cheap, the data transfer
       hassles are still there. on our internet plan, our upload speed is
       capped at 2 mpbs. so, if you had big data sets     uploading them on
       the cloud can end up taking days. even if we get un-interupted
       speed from the service provider (we are not on a lease line), it
       would take 12 hours to upload a 10 gb dataset.

   obviously nothing comes free in life. so, while we had these
   advantages, there were a few down sides as well. here are the
   compromises we had to make:
     * invest in buying the machine upfront     since we had to buy the
       machine, we had to spend the entire amount upfront. in the long
       term, this is a much better decision as the machines on cloud will
       cost lost more. in the short term, it essentially ended up
       impacting our cash flows     
     * danger of machine getting obsolete     one of the advantages with
       cloud machines is that you can upgrade any time you want. you could
       change the complete hardware of your machines without much
       challenges. on the other hand, the workstation hardware can not be
       replaced that easily. so, in a few years, this impressive monster
       would look like an old bulky machine sitting in one corner of our
       office!
     * risk of hardware failure     with cloud based machines, hardware
       failure would not impact you a lot. your service provider would
       typically take care of it for you. in this case, we now own the
       risk of any damages to the hardware.

   given the pros were working out better for us and i think we would
   still be able to use the server a few years down the line, we went
   ahead with the decision to build a workstation.


a few high level decisions:

   once we decided that we would build a workstation, there were a few
   more decisions we had to take. here were the decisions we needed to
   take:
     * build vs. buy: the immediate question which came up was whether to
       build / assemble the workstation ourselves or to buy one from one
       of the server providers. given the difference in cost, the choice
       was obvious for us. also, by assembling a workstation, you could
       customize it fit your needs closely. for example, even after making
       a few compromises on the requirement, servers from dell or hp would
       cost at least 50% higher. so, we decided to build our own
       workstation.
     * define your budget: we had to define the overall budget for
       creating the workstation. we decided to spend a maximum of ~inr
       300,000 (or $4,400) for creating the workstation.
     * one workstation vs. 2 workstations: one of the possible option was
       to create 2 servers instead of one. one focused on cpu based
       computations and another one on gpu based computations. this would
       have made sure that we had 2 specialized workstations, but it would
       have created a sub-optimal configuration as we would have to buy
       multiple processors and motherboard. it would have also meant
       needing more physical space. we decided to go with a single server.

   once these high level decisions were taken, we started the search on
   finding hardware components of the server.


choosing the hardware:

     * processor: [102]xeon-e5 the first trade-off we came across was
       which chip to buy? i7 processors seemed to have lesser cores
       compared to xeon processors, but higher frequency. i7 processors
       are also very easy to overclock, which is not the case with xeon.
       xeon on the other hand, supported much higher ram     i7 maxed out at
       128 gb ram (that too was available on a single model). also, the
       power consumption of xeon is lower compared to an i7. we started
       shortlisting possible processor chips, which would fit our
       requirement. we came down to a shortlist of a few i7 and xeon
       processors. we decided to go for higher cores, power efficiency and
       possibility to expand more ram in future over high frequency i7
       chips. after searching for prices of various chips and their
       benchmarks, we finally zeroed in on [103]intel xeon e2630 v4 .
     * motherboard: [104]epc612d8a-1l once the processor is finalized, we
       looked for compatible motherboards. since we wanted to use this
       machine for deep learning, we had to make sure that the motherboard
       had enough pcie slots. we wanted to have the option to add up to 2
       gpus in future. additional things to look out for included the
       number of ram slots, which would directly impact the amount of ram
       you can have. you can also look at whether the motherboard support
       one socket or 2 sockets. having 2 sockets is more desirable as you
       can add one more processor to the box later on. we zeroed in on
       asrock [105]epc612d8a     while it had only one socket, it gave us
       option to expand ram further and add more gpus, if needed in
       future.
     * ram: we bought 128 gb ram for now. we an obviously add more, if
       required. this should be good for now. needless to say ddr4 is
       better than ddr3 and 2400 mhz is better than 2133 mhz. we ended up
       with 2133 mhz to save a few bucks.
     * gpu: given the evolution in deep learning, we knew that we had to
       invest in the best in class gpu. the options include nvidia gtx
       1080, nvidia tesla k40. again, we went to the basics on why we need
       gpus. for deep learning, we do not need high precision
       computations, so the expensive tesla k series went out of
       consideration. among the two remaining titan x pascal clearly
       looked far superior for deep learning. there was only one problem    
       this card was not available in india yet. i had to ask one of my
       friends in the us to get it for us.
     * hard disk: the first thing we did was to buy a ssd and a hard disk.
       the idea was to do the frequent read wite operations on the ssd,
       while keep the large datasets on the normal hard disk. we also
       decided to not go with raid based hard disks as they were adding to
       the costs and most of the time, we have backups of the data
       anyways. so, we took a 512 gb ssd + 2 tb hdd (7200 rpm)
     * cabinet:
       [106]cooler-master-chassis-trooper-cabinet-sdl181491502-5-b8502
       smart trooper cabinet
       given the spread of hardware, length of gpu and the cost
       constraints     we decided to go with storm trooper cabinet.
     * power: we added a 1000 watt corsair smps to make sure that the gpu
       and the motherboard get ample power
     * cooling: cooling is very important for a workstation like this.
       ideally, liquid based cooling systems are the most effective.
       however, we could not find a compatible model. so, we went with
       intel heatsink which was the next best option. i was a bit
       skeptical whether this would be sufficient or not. however, we have
       not faced any heating problems till now. the fan on gpu, heat sink
       and 2 of them on cpu have been effective to keep the temperature
       under control.


assembling the server

   with all the hardware ready, it was time to assemble the server. if you
   have not done this before, it might look a bit intimidating from
   outside, but it is not. the components are meant to fit in only in the
   slots they are supposed to fit in. so, here was the monster ready to
   breathe

   [107]20161025_113721


software installation:

   with the hardware ready, we were excited to the core. the next thing
   was installing the right software. before doing so, make sure your
   server is connected via a lan cable and is attached to power. it is
   advisable to add a wireless keyboard so that you can start installation
   of desired software. once you are ready, it is time to awaken the
   monster     boom!

   time to feed the machine with the right software:
     * choosing the os     our preferred os was ubuntu as we are all used to
       working on it. we chose the server veriosn over the desktop version
       as we did not need the graphical interface and thought it would add
       to unwanted processes. ubuntu server 16.04 lts loaded seaid113ssly in
       a few minutes.
     * adding other packages     once the server was ready with ubuntu
       installation, we ran the following commands to update the packages,
       install r & python libraries and setup git. here is the script for
       the same:

#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

#install python2 libraries
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib
sudo pip install ipython[all]
sudo pip install pandas
sudo pip install theano keras scikit-learn
sudo pip install virtualenv

sudo pip install xgboost
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake g++ gfortran git pkg-config python-de
v software-properties-common wget


#install python3 libraries
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install jupyterhub
sudo pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
sudo pip3 install ipython[all]
pip3 install --upgrade notebook


#install r and rstudio
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev libapparmor1 gdebi-core
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev
wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-0.99.903-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-0.99.903-amd64.deb

#upgrading r to latest version. ref: https://pythonandr.com/2015/04/27/upgrading

codename=$(lsb_release -c -s)
echo "deb http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/cran/bin/linux/ubuntu $codename/" | sudo tee -a
/etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys e084dab9
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:marutter/rdev

#installing node package manager for jupyterhub
sudo apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy
npm install -g configurable-http-proxy

#setting up git
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "[108][email protected]"


#installing postgresql
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

   you can add other packages you may need depending on your need, but
   this should give you a base setup ready. time to add deep learning
   tools.


setting up deep learning tools:

   deep learning is an active field of research. with a wide variety of
   available libraries to choose from and their individual dependencies,
   it is very hard to maintain a continuously working dl system. hence, it
   is usually a good practice to set up your own virtual environment. this
   is what we did.

   the easiest solution was to use containers, which are essentially
      boxes    of self-contained softwares. its like virtualization of os, but
   along with the ease of access from local machine.

   the first step we did was to setup nvidia drivers
# install nvidia driver
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install nvidia-367
 sudo shutdown -r now

   then we installed docker
   (https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/).
# docker installation
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates
 sudo apt-key adv \
 --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 \
 --recv-keys 58118e89f3a912897c070adbf76221572c52609d

echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc
/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual
 sudo apt-get install docker-engine
 sudo service docker start

# setup docker for another user
 sudo groupadd docker
 sudo gpasswd -a ${user} docker
 sudo service docker restart

# check installation
 docker run hello-world

   integrating gpu on docker has some additional steps:
wget -p /tmp https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc
.3/nvidia-docker_1.0.0.rc.3-1_amd64.deb
 sudo dpkg -i /tmp/nvidia-docker*.deb && rm /tmp/nvidia-docker*.deb

# test nvidia-smi
 nvidia-docker run --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi

   now comes the main part, installing dl libraries on docker. we built
   the docker from scratch, following this excellent guide
   ([109]https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker/blob/master/readme.md)
git clone https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker.git
 cd dl-docker
 docker build -t floydhub/dl-docker:gpu -f dockerfile.gpu

   thats it! we have completed the    installation steps   . there were a few
   more things to, i.e. handle data persistency. dl requires huge amount
   of data to be processed and the best way to share this data to docker
   system is add as a data volume
   ([110]https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).
nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -v ~/sharedfolder:/sharedfolder
floydhub/dl-docker:gpu bash

   and voila! we have a complete running deep learning system!


end notes

   we shared our decisions and choice of hardware / software as there are
   so many options available today. it is difficult to find the right
   option for you among all the options. if you are looking to build your
   own workstation, this guide should be immensely helpful to you. if you
   are not looking to build one, there is still a lot to learn from the
   process. i myself learnt a lot of finer aspects about hardware
   selection while going through this journey.

   if you had to build one workstation under $4,500     how would you go
   about doing so? would you do something different? if so, why? looking
   forward to hear from you.

       its a little odd combination of hardware, but i can see why you
       chose them. this is my build, that was around 3.5k. if i had 1.5k
       more, would have put that in gpu and 64gb ram.

                 it chews through convnets. i think i can get even better
                 performance by using larger ram and using m2 drive in a
                 raid configuration. havent tried those things out yet.

       hey kunal,
       great post. i am in the process of putting together a workstation
       for myself.
       i am currently finalizing one for about inr 100k which i can use
       over the next couple of years with scaled down options for
       hardware. i can get away with it since i am the only person who
       will use this      i understand why your team had to opt for a higher
       configuration.
       this approach also helps with my cash flow :), i pay inr 100k now
       and get up and running with a workstation which i will add to my
       modest two node laptop cluster. to overcome obsolescence, i plan on
       starting a sip specifically to purchase another workstation (if
       required) in a couple of years. if i don   t need it, well it   s
       vacation money!
       on the deep learning side, get tensorflow up and running on your
       monster. now that the distributed version is made public it opens
       up plenty of options to working on cpus/gpus spread across a
       cluster. you can even decide which devices to use for each task.
       plus their tensor board feature is breath taking! not to forget
       their support for mobile devices which includes capabilities for
       running your models on the client side rather than having to ping a
       server.
       as always my best wishes to you and the team, continue to go from
       strength to strength.
       regards,
       clarence

            thanks clarence     good to hear from you after long time.
            if you are plannning to use the workstation for deep learning
                i think a modest processor, 16 gb ram, the best gpu in your
            budget with motherboard supporting gpu expansion in future is
            possibly the way to go!
            alternately, you can build a highend cpu and large ram and add
            gpu in future     
            tensorflow and tensor board are definitely the way to go!
            let me know, how your build goes.

       thanks kunal for your post. i found it very useful.
       i have quite some good options with
       [144]http://www.deltaserverstore.com/tower.html
       i am exploring the hpz800( 2xhexacore 2.80ghz, 96gb ram, 2tb 7.2k
       hdd) or the .hp ml370g6 ( 2xhexacore 2.80ghz, 144gb ram, 4x146gb
       10k sas) and both are priced at $cad 1,100.
       i presently have a lenovo w510 with 512gb 7.2k hdd + 512gb ssd ,
       16gb ram with individual operating systems.i will like to also
       migrate the 512gb ssd to the new workstation but will love to keep
       the windows 10 currently running on it, and have ubuntu run of a
       2tb secondary drive.
       i presently do lots of numerical computing/simulation and my
       applications mostly run on windows. but i am exploring the data
       science space and seeing my self transiting to the opensource world
       in achieving the same objectives (numerical computing/simulation
       +machine learning) and will love to double the work station for
       some data crunching      and explore options with ubuntu.
       my dilemma is remotely accessing both os (windows & ubuntu)
       simultaneously. what solution would you suggest?virtualization of
       the ubuntu os?or any other ideas. and what remote access software
       will you suggest. teamviewer, vshpere hypervisor , citrix xenapp,
       will prefer something free anyday.
       cheers!

            hi larry,
            there are several options i can think of depending on what you
            need. the easiest might be to use windows server edition with
            ubuntu machine virtualized.
            windoes server would allow for remote access, so you would not
            need a teamviewer separately. you can check out vagrant as one
            of the virtialization options     worked seaid113ssly when i
            tried. it is free as well.

                 thanks for your response and advice. i just checked out
                 vagrant, definitely the way to go.
                 i am avoiding windows server as most the software i have
                 deployed have very expensive server versions, which will
                 run costs off the roof for me.

       nice write up. i went with a i7 multicore two years ago with a
       nvidia based video card. power and cooling was the big issue. while
       i wanted to go xeon, i went i7 as it has lots of water cooling
       options. system has 64 gb ram, asus motherboard, 10tb (3 2tb and 1
       4tb hard drives) storage. ran about 3k by the time i was done. same
       configuration with ubuntu and the nvidia -docker as it allows use
       of the docker containers for testing different machine learning
       without messing up the main operating system. i learned that you
       should buy both video cards at once as you may not be able to get
       another card if you wait too long. all in all, a very nice write
       up. cheers

            good advice on video cards. that is the plan as well     if we
            need more power, i would also want to add the card quickly.
            given that this is nvidia   s latest architecture     i am hoping
            i should have time for next 6     12 months to buy the card, in
            case i decide to double up.

       great article,
       i am also planning to buy a deep learning system aimed at solving
       kaggle like id161 problems. what configuration would you
       suggest for a single user system?
       is gpu more important that processor in such applications?
       budget would be half of what you have spent keeping in mind that i
       would expand it in due course of time.
       your inputs would be much appreciated.

            hello ankit.
            for a single user system, i   d prefer cloud solutions over
            buying a gpu system. nevertheless, what i would suggest you is
            to look for getting a medium to high range gaming laptops as
            gpu is the heart and soul of a deep learning system and gaming
            laptops have most of the requirements covered.
            i would not say gpu is more important than processor as they
            go hand in hand.
            do make sure you refer all the high level decision when buying
            a system as mentioned above.
