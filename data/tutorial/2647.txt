introduction to machine learning with python

   this repository holds the code for the forthcoming book "introduction
   to machine learning with python" by [90]andreas mueller and [91]sarah
   guido. you can find details about the book on the [92]o'reilly website.

   the books requires the current stable version of scikit-learn, that is
   0.20.0. most of the book can also be used with previous versions of
   scikit-learn, though you need to adjust the import for everything from
   the model_selection module, mostly cross_val_score, train_test_split
   and gridsearchcv.

   this repository provides the notebooks from which the book is created,
   together with the mglearn library of helper functions to create figures
   and datasets.

   for the curious ones, the cover depicts a [93]hellbender.

   all datasets are included in the repository, with the exception of the
   aclimdb dataset, which you can download from the page of [94]andrew
   maas. see the book for details.

   if you get importerror: no module named mglearn you can try to install
   mglearn into your python environment using the command pip install
   mglearn in your terminal or !pip install mglearn in jupyter notebook.

errata

   please note that the first print of the book is missing the following
   line when listing the assumed imports:
from ipython.display import display

   please add this line if you see an error involving display.

   the first print of the book used a function called plot_group_kfold.
   this has been renamed to plot_label_kfold because of a rename in
   scikit-learn.

setup

   to run the code, you need the packages numpy, scipy, scikit-learn,
   matplotlib, pandas and pillow. some of the visualizations of decision
   trees and neural networks structures also require graphviz. the chapter
   on text processing also requirs nltk and spacy.

   the easiest way to set up an environment is by installing [95]anaconda.

installing packages with conda:

   if you already have a python environment set up, and you are using the
   conda package manager, you can get all packages by running
conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow graphviz python-
graphviz

   for the chapter on text processing you also need to install nltk and
   spacy:
conda install nltk spacy

installing packages with pip

   if you already have a python environment and are using pip to install
   packages, you need to run
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow graphviz

   you also need to install the graphiz c-library, which is easiest using
   a package manager. if you are using os x and homebrew, you can brew
   install graphviz. if you are on ubuntu or debian, you can apt-get
   install graphviz. installing graphviz on windows can be tricky and
   using conda / anaconda is recommended. for the chapter on text
   processing you also need to install nltk and spacy:
pip install nltk spacy

downloading english language model

   for the text processing chapter, you need to download the english
   language model for spacy using
python -m spacy download en

submitting errata

   if you have errata for the (e-)book, please submit them via the
   [96]o'reilly website. you can submit fixed to the code as pull-requests
   here, but i'd appreciate it if you would also submit them there, as
   this repository doesn't hold the "master notebooks".
