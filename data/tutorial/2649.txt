word_cloud

   a little word cloud generator in python. read more about it on the
   [99]blog post or the [100]website.

   the code is tested against python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

installation

   if you are using pip:
pip install wordcloud

   if you are using conda, you can install from the conda-forge channel:
conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud

installation notes

   wordcloud depends on numpy and pillow.

   to save the wordcloud into a file, matplotlib can also be installed.
   see [101]examples below.

   if there are no wheels available for your version of python, installing
   the package requires having a c compiler set up. before installing a
   compiler, report an issue describing the version of python and
   operating system being used.

examples

   check out [102]examples/simple.py for a short intro. a sample output
   is:

   [103]constitution

   or run [104]examples/masked.py to see more options. a sample output is:

   [105]alice in wonderland

   getting fancy with some colors: [106]parrot with rainbow colors

command-line usage

   the wordcloud_cli tool can be used to generate word clouds directly
   from the command-line:
$ wordcloud_cli --text mytext.txt --imagefile wordcloud.png

   if you're dealing with pdf files, then pdftotext, included by default
   with many linux distribution, comes in handy:
$ pdftotext mydocument.pdf - | wordcloud_cli --imagefile wordcloud.png

   in the previous example, the - argument orders pdftotext to write the
   resulting text to stdout, which is then piped to the stdin of
   wordcloud_cli.py.

   use wordcloud_cli --help so see all available options.

licensing

   the wordcloud library is mit licenced, but contains droidsansmono.ttf,
   a true type font by google, that is apache licensed. the font is by no
   means integral, and any other font can be used by setting the font_path
   variable when creating a wordcloud object.
