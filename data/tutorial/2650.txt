thon programming
tools/                          various building python scripts

installation

   you need python 3 (or 2) and a bunch of scientific modules for the code
   examples, mainly ipython 2.0+, numpy, scipy, pandas, and matplotlib.
   many recipes that require other modules come with the appropriate
   installation instructions.

   we highly recommend that you use an all-in-one python distribution like
   [93]anaconda. this distribution comes with an excellent package manager
   named conda. it lets you install easily many modules on most platforms
   (windows, linux, mac os x), in 64-bit (recommended if you have a 64-bit
   os) or 32-bit.

   the recipes are written for python 3 first, but they also work with
   python 2. please favor python 3 over python 2 if you can.

cloning the repository

   you need [94]git, a distributed versioning system, to download a local
   copy of this repository. open a terminal and type:
git clone https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code.git

   this will copy the repository in a local folder named cookbook-code.

running the examples

   launch the ipython notebook server with:
ipython notebook

   in your browser, go to 127.0.0.1:8888. you can navigate in the
   repository and open the notebooks.

contribute

   you are welcome to contribute to this repository. you can use the issue
   tracker to report any problem. you can also propose a pull request (pr)
   to fix an error, to add some information, or even propose a brand new
   recipe in the guests/ folder!
