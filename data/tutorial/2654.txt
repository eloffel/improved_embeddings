making computers explain themselves

   researchers from mit   s computer science and artificial intelligence
   laboratory (csail) have devised a way to train neural networks so that
   they provide not only predictions and classifications but rationales
   for their decisions.

   new training technique would reveal the basis for machine-learning

   in recent years, the best-performing systems in artificial-intelligence
   research have come courtesy of neural networks, which look for patterns
   in training data that yield useful predictions or classifications. a
   neural net might, for instance, be trained to recognize certain objects
   in digital images or to infer the topics of texts.

   but neural nets are black boxes. after training, a network may be very
   good at classifying data, but even its creators will have no idea why.
   with visual data, it   s sometimes possible to automate experiments that
   determine [138]which visual features a neural net is responding to. but
   text-processing systems tend to be more opaque.

   at the association for computational linguistics    conference on
   empirical methods in natural language processing, researchers from
   mit   s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory (csail)
   will present a new way to train neural networks so that they provide
   not only predictions and classifications but rationales for their
   decisions.

      in real-world applications, sometimes people really want to know why
   the model makes the predictions it does,    says tao lei, an mit graduate
   student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author
   on the new paper.    one major reason that doctors don   t trust
   machine-learning methods is that there   s no evidence.   

      it   s not only the medical domain,    adds regina barzilay, the delta
   electronics professor of electrical engineering and computer science
   and lei   s thesis advisor.    it   s in any domain where the cost of making
   the wrong prediction is very high. you need to justify why you did it.   

      there   s a broader aspect to this work, as well,    says tommi jaakkola,
   an mit professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the
   third coauthor on the paper.    you may not want to just verify that the
   model is making the prediction in the right way; you might also want to
   exert some influence in terms of the types of predictions that it
   should make. how does a layperson communicate with a complex model
   that   s trained with algorithms that they know nothing about? they might
   be able to tell you about the rationale for a particular prediction. in
   that sense it opens up a different way of communicating with the
   model.   

   virtual brains

   neural networks are so called because they mimic     approximately     the
   structure of the brain. they are composed of a large number of
   processing nodes that, like individual neurons, are capable of only
   very simple computations but are connected to each other in dense
   networks.

   in a process referred to as    deep learning,    training data is fed to a
   network   s input nodes, which modify it and feed it to other nodes,
   which modify it and feed it to still other nodes, and so on. the values
   stored in the network   s output nodes are then correlated with the
   classification category that the network is trying to learn     such as
   the objects in an image, or the topic of an essay.

   over the course of the network   s training, the operations performed by
   the individual nodes are continuously modified to yield consistently
   good results across the whole set of training examples. by the end of
   the process, the computer scientists who programmed the network often
   have no idea what the nodes    settings are. even if they do, it can be
   very hard to translate that low-level information back into an
   intelligible description of the system   s decision-making process.

   in the new paper, lei, barzilay, and jaakkola specifically address
   neural nets trained on textual data. to enable interpretation of a
   neural net   s decisions, the csail researchers divide the net into two
   modules. the first module extracts segments of text from the training
   data, and the segments are scored according to their length and their
   coherence: the shorter the segment, and the more of it that is drawn
   from strings of consecutive words, the higher its score.

   the segments selected by the first module are then passed to the second
   module, which performs the prediction or classification task. the
   modules are trained together, and the goal of training is to maximize
   both the score of the extracted segments and the accuracy of prediction
   or classification.

   one of the data sets on which the researchers tested their system is a
   group of reviews from a website where users evaluate different beers.
   the data set includes the raw text of the reviews and the corresponding
   ratings, using a five-star system, on each of three attributes: aroma,
   palate, and appearance.

   what makes the data attractive to natural-language-processing
   researchers is that it   s also been annotated by hand, to indicate which
   sentences in the reviews correspond to which scores. for example, a
   review might consist of eight or nine sentences, and the annotator
   might have highlighted those that refer to the beer   s    tan-colored head
   about half an inch thick,       signature guinness smells,    and    lack of
   carbonation.    each sentence is correlated with a different attribute
   rating.

   validation

   as such, the data set provides an excellent test of the csail
   researchers    system. if the first module has extracted those three
   phrases, and the second module has correlated them with the correct
   ratings, then the system has identified the same basis for judgment
   that the human annotator did.

   in experiments, the system   s agreement with the human annotations was
   96 percent and 95 percent, respectively, for ratings of appearance and
   aroma, and 80 percent for the more nebulous concept of palate.

   in the paper, the researchers also report testing their system on a
   database of free-form technical questions and answers, where the task
   is to determine whether a given question has been answered previously.

   in unpublished work, they   ve applied it to thousands of pathology
   reports on breast biopsies, where it has learned to extract text
   explaining the bases for the pathologists    diagnoses. they   re even
   using it to analyze mammograms, where the first module extracts
   sections of images rather than segments of text.

      there   s a lot of hype now     and rightly so     around deep learning, and
   specifically deep learning for natural-language processing,    says byron
   wallace, an assistant professor of computer and information science at
   northeastern university.    but a big drawback for these models is that
   they   re often black boxes. having a model that not only makes very
   accurate predictions but can also tell you why it   s making those
   predictions is a really important aim.   

      as it happens, we have a paper that   s similar in spirit being
   presented at the same conference,    wallace adds.    i didn   t know at the
   time that regina was working on this, and i actually think hers is
   better. in our approach, during the training process, while someone is
   telling us, for example, that a movie review is very positive, we
   assume that they   ll mark a sentence that gives you the rationale. in
   this way we train the deep-learning model to extract these rationales.
   but they don   t make this assumption, so their model works without using
   direct annotations with rationales, which is a very nice property.
