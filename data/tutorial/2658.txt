   id151 tutorial reading
   the following is a list of papers that i think are worth reading for
   our
   discussion of machine translation. i've tried to give a short blurb
   about
   each of the papers to put them in context. i've included a number of
   papers
   that i marked "optional" that i think are interesting, but are either
   supplementary or the material is more or less covered in the other
   papers.
   if anyone would like more information on a particular topic or would
   like to discuss any of these papers, feel free to e-mail me

   part 1 (jan. 19)
   [1]a statistical mt tutorial workbook. kevin knight. 1999.
   very good introduction to word-based id151.
   written in an informal, understandable, tutorial oriented style.
   [2]automating knowledge acquisition for machine translation.
   kevin knight. 1997.
   (optional) another tutorial oriented paper that steps through
   how one can learn from bilingual data. also introduces a number of
   important concepts for mt.
   [3]foundations of statistical nlp, chapter 13. manning and schutze.
   1999.
   (optional) must be accessed from ucsd. overview of statistical mt.
   spends a lot of time on sentence and word alignment of bilingual data.
   [4]foundations of statistical nlp, chapter 6. manning and schutze.
   1999.
   (optional) must be accessed from ucsd. discusses id165 language
   modeling. id38 is crucial for smt and many other natural
   language applications. i won't spend much time discussing language
   modeling, but for those that are interested this is a good
   introduction.
   part 2 (jan. 26)
   word models:
   [5]the mathematics of id151:
   parameter estimation. p. f. brown, s. a. della pietra,
   v. j. della pietra and r.l. mercer. 1993.
   (optional) all you ever wanted to know about word level
   models. describes ibm models 1-5 and parameter estimation
   for these models. it's about 50 pages and contains a lot of
   material for the interested reader.
   word model decoding:
   [6]decoding algorithm in id151.
   ye-yi wand and alex waibel. 1997.
   early paper discussing decoding of ibm model 2. the paper
   provides a fairly good introduction to word-level decoding
   including multi-stack search (i.e. multiple beams) and rest
   cost estimation (heuristic functions).
   [7]an efficient id67 algorithm for statistical machine
   translation.
   franz josef och, nicola ueffing, hermann ney. 2001.
   (optional) one of many papers on decoding with word-based smt. they
   discuss the basic idea of viewing decoding as state space search and
   provide one method for doing this. they describe decoding for model 3
   and suggest a few different heuristics that are admissible, leading to
   few search errors.
   phrase based statistical mt:
   [8]statistical phrase-based translation.
   philipp koehn, franz jasof ock and daniel marcu. 2003.
   good, short overview of phrased based systems. if you want more
   details, see the paper below.
   [9]the alignment template approach to id151.
   franz josef och and hermann ney. 2004.
   (optional) this is a journal paper discussing one phrase based
   statistical system
   including decoding. this is more or less the system used at isi and
   is probably the best current system (though syntax based systems my
   beat
   these in the next few years). requires acrobat 5 and to be at ucsd.
   part 3 (feb. 2)
   phrase-based decoding:
   see the previous paper.
   syntax based translation:
   [10]what's in a translation rule? galley, hopkins, knight and marcu.
   2004.
   this is the current system being investigated at isi and the hope is
   that
   these syntax based systems will perform better than phrase based
   systems.
   the paper is a bit tough to read since it's a conference paper.
   [11]a syntax-based statistical translation model. yamada and knight.
   2001.
   (optional) predecessor model to galley et al., but similar.
   syntax based decoding:
   [12]foundations of statistical nlp, chapter 12. manning and schutze.
   1999.
   must be on campus. this is a chapter on parsing (not actually decoding)
   however, since the above rules are very similar to pid18s, then decoding
   is very similar to parsing... just with more complications.
   [13]a decoder for syntax-based statistical mt. kenji yamada and kevin
   knight. 2001.
   (optional) decoder for the above yamada and knight model.
   part 4 (feb. 9)
   discriminative training:
   [14]discriminative training and maximum id178 models for statistical
   machine translation.
   och and ney. 2002.
   learning how the best models for combining the different models
   (traslation
   model, language model, etc.) using maximum id178 parameter
   estimation.
   this line of research is still very important and my be interesting to
   many of you since it's very machine learningy.
   [15]discriminative reranking for machine translation.
   shen, sarkar and och. 2004.
   (optional) given a ranked output of possible translations from the
   translation system, this paper uses the id88 algorithm to learn
   a reranking of the sentences to improves the top translation.
   mt evaluation:
   [16]id7: a method for automatic evaluation of machine translation.
   papineni, roukos, ward and zhu. 2001.
   foundational method for evaluating mt methods and still used currently.
