deep learning summer school 2016 - montreal

deep learning summer school, montreal 2016

   deep neural networks that learn to represent data in multiple layers of
   increasing abstraction have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art
   for id103, object recognition, id164,
   predicting the activity of drug molecules, and many other tasks. deep
   learning discovers intricate structure in large datasets by building
   distributed representations, either via supervised, unsupervised or
   id23.

   [17]the deep learning summer school 2016 is aimed at graduate students
   and industrial engineers and researchers who already have some basic
   knowledge of machine learning (and possibly but not necessarily of deep
   learning) and wish to learn more about this rapidly growing field of
   research.
