tensorflow fold

   tensorflow fold is a library for creating [80]tensorflow models that
   consume structured data, where the structure of the computation graph
   depends on the structure of the input data. for example, [81]this model
   implements [82]treelstms for id31 on parse trees of
   arbitrary shape/size/depth.

   fold implements [83]dynamic batching. batches of arbitrarily shaped
   computation graphs are transformed to produce a static computation
   graph. this graph has the same structure regardless of what input it
   receives, and can be executed efficiently by tensorflow.

   [87]animation

   this animation shows a [88]id56 run with dynamic
   batching. operations of the same type appearing at the same depth in
   the computation graph (indicated by color in the animiation) are
   batched together regardless of whether or not they appear in the same
   parse tree. the [89]embed operation converts [90]words to vector
   representations. the fully connected ([91]fc) operation combines word
   vectors to form vector representations of phrases. the output of the
   network is a vector representation of an entire sentence. although only
   a single parse tree of a sentence is shown, the same network can run,
   and batch together operations, over multiple parse trees of arbitrary
   shapes and sizes. the tensorflow concat, while_loop, and gather ops are
   created once, prior to variable initialization, by [92]loom, the
   low-level api for tensorflow fold.

   if you'd like to contribute to tensorflow fold, please review the
   [93]contribution guidelines.
