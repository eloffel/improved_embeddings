sparse bilingual word representations

   code for sparse bilingual embeddings as described in [70]sparse
   bilingual word representations for cross-lingual lexical entailment.

prerequisites

     * matlab

getting embeddings

   run 'sh fasta_biling.sh' with the following parameters (in order):
     * en vocab file : one word per line (|e| lines)
     * fr vocab file : one word per line (|f| lines)
     * dense en embeddings : one vector per line, each vector a space
       seperated list of floats (|e| lines)
     * dense fr embeddings : one vector per line, each vector a space
       seperated list of floats (|f| lines)
     * alignment matrix : .mat file containing the crosslingual statistics
       matrix s (of size |e| x |f|)

   example files are available [71]here.

   the output of the above script will be two vector files, one for each
   language. these new vectors will be sparse and interpretable, with the
   dimensions aligned across languages!

   nb :there are other hyperparameters in the script which you should
   consider adjusting.

data

   the data folder contains
     * final_dataset.tsv - the french-english crosslingual lexical
       entailment dataset
     * bisparse_{en,fr}.txt - the french-english bilingual sparse vectors
       used to obtained results in the paper

utils

   this folder contains some other useful code :
     * top_dims.py - interpret the dimensions given a (sparse) vector file

   if you use this code or the associated dataset, please cite the paper!
