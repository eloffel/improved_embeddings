[122]deepmind lab

   deepmind lab is a 3d learning environment based on id software's
   [123]quake iii arena via [124]ioquake3 and [125]other open source
   software.

    [126]deepmind lab - nav maze level 1 [127]deepmind lab - stairway to
     melon level [128]deepmind lab - laser tag space bounce level (hard)

   deepmind lab provides a suite of challenging 3d navigation and
   puzzle-solving tasks for learning agents. its primary purpose is to act
   as a testbed for research in artificial intelligence, especially deep
   id23.

about

   disclaimer: this is not an official google product.

   if you use deepmind lab in your research and would like to cite the
   deepmind lab environment, we suggest you cite the [129]deepmind lab
   paper.

   you can reach us at [130]lab@deepmind.com.

getting started on linux

     * get [131]bazel from bazel.io.
     * clone deepmind lab, e.g. by running

$ git clone https://github.com/deepmind/lab
$ cd lab

   for a live example of a random agent, run
lab$ bazel run :python_random_agent --define graphics=sdl -- \
               --length=10000 --width=640 --height=480

   here is some [132]more detailed build documentation, including how to
   install dependencies if you don't have them.

   to enable compiler optimizations, pass the flag --compilation_mode=opt,
   or -c opt for short, to each bazel build, bazel test and bazel run
   command. the flag is omitted from the examples here for brevity, but it
   should be used for real training and evaluation where performance
   matters.

play as a human

   to test the game using human input controls, run
lab$ bazel run :game -- --level_script=tests/empty_room_test --level_setting=log
tostderr=true
# or:
lab$ bazel run :game -- -l tests/empty_room_test -s logtostderr=true

   leave the logtostderr setting off to disable most log output.

   the values of observations that the environment exposes can be printed
   at every step by adding a flag --observation observation_name for each
   observation of interest.
lab$ bazel run :game -- --level_script=lt_chasm --observation vel.trans --observ
ation vel.rot

train an agent

   deepmind lab ships with an example random agent in
   [133]python/random_agent.py which can be used as a starting point for
   implementing a learning agent. to let this agent interact with deepmind
   lab for training, run
lab$ bazel run :python_random_agent

   the [134]python api is used for agent-environment interactions.

   deepmind lab ships with [135]different levels implementing different
   tasks. these tasks can be configured using lua scripts, as described in
   the [136]lua api.
     __________________________________________________________________

upstream sources

   deepmind lab is built from the ioquake3 game engine, and it uses the
   tools q3map2 and bspc for map creation. bug fixes and cleanups that
   originate with those projects are best fixed upstream and then merged
   into deepmind lab.
     * bspc is taken from [137]github.com/ttimo/bspc, revision
       d9a372db3fb6163bc49ead41c76c801a3d14cf80. there are virtually no
       local modifications, although we integrate this code with the main
       ioq3 code and do not use their copy in the deps directory. we
       expect this code to be stable.
     * q3map2 is taken from [138]github.com/ttimo/gtkradiant, revision
       d3d00345c542c8d7cc74e2e8a577bdf76f79c701. a few minor local
       modifications add synchronization. we also expect this code to be
       stable.
     * ioquake3 is taken from [139]github.com/ioquake/ioq3, revision
       29db64070aa0bae49953bddbedbed5e317af48ba. the code contains
       extensive modifications and additions. we aim to merge upstream
       changes occasionally.

   we are very grateful to the maintainers of these repositories for all
   their hard work on maintaining high-quality code bases.

external dependencies, prerequisites and porting notes

   deepmind lab currently ships as source code only. it depends on a few
   external software libraries, which we ship in several different ways:
     * the zlib, glib, libxml2, jpeg and png libraries are referenced as
       external bazel sources, and bazel build files are provided. the
       dependent code itself should be fairly portable, but the build
       rules we ship are specific to linux on x86. to build on a different
       platform you will most likely have to edit those build files.
     * message digest algorithms are included in this package (in
       [140]//third_party/md), taken from the reference implementations of
       their respective rfcs. a "generic id23 api" is
       included in [141]//third_party/rl_api, which has also been created
       by the deepmind lab authors. this code is portable.
     * egl headers are included in this package (in
       //third_party/gl/{[142]egl,[143]khr}), taken from the khronos
       opengl/opengl es xml api registry at
       [144]www.khronos.org/registry/egl. the headers have been modified
       slightly to remove the dependency of egl on x.
     * several additional libraries are required but are not shipped in
       any form; they must be present on your system:
          + sdl 2
          + gettext (required by glib)
          + opengl: a hardware driver and library are needed for
            hardware-accelerated human play. the headless library that
            machine learning agents will want to use can use either
            hardware-accelerated rendering via egl or glx or software
            rendering via osmesa, depending on the --define headless=...
            build setting.
          + python 2.7 (other versions might work, too) with numpy, pil.
            (a few tests require a numpy version of at least 1.8.) python
            3 (at least 3.5) is supported experimentally.

   the build rules are using a few compiler settings that are specific to
   gcc. if some flags are not recognized by your compiler (typically those
   would be specific warning suppressions), you may have to edit those
   flags. the warnings should be noisy but harid113ss.
