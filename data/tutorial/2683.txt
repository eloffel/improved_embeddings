polyglot

   abstract

   distributed word representations (id27s) have recently
   contributed to competitive performance in id38 and several
   nlp tasks. in this work, we train id27s for more than 100
   languages using their corresponding wikipedias. we quantitatively
   demonstrate the utility of our id27s by using them as the
   sole features for training a part of speech tagger for a subset of
   these languages. we find their performance to be competitive with near
   state-of-art methods in english, danish and swedish. moreover, we
   investigate the semantic features captured by these embeddings through
   the proximity of word groupings. we will release these embeddings
   publicly to help researchers in the development and enhancement of
   multilingual applications.

   polyglot is joint work with [13]bryan perozzi, and [14]steven skiena.

   online demo

   the demo shows words proximity in the embedding space. given a word we
   calculate its neighbours in the space according to the euclidean
   distance. in case, you are using the latest version of firefox 23.0+,
   this demo will be blocked by default. [15]here are instructions on how
   to disable protection and enable the demo. otherwise, you can have
   direct access to the demo at <[16]wordrepresentation.appspot.com>.

   download the embeddings

   download wikipedia text dumps

   in order to aid researchers, we offer a processed wikipedia dumps that
   have tokenized text. this material is available under [18]cc by-sa 3.0.

   embeddings tutorial

   for each language there is a directory that contains its own data. the
   data is stored as a pickled python object. here is a small script to
   extract the data. the tutorial is hosted here at this link
   <[19]http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6046170>.

   train your own models

   if the pre-trained models do not fit your problem, feel free to use one
   of two choices we developed:

   word2embeddings
     * supports cpu and gpu computation
     * requires [20]theano.
     * [21]bitbucket page

   polyglot2
     * supports cpu only.
     * faster than word2embeddings on cpu (especially if compiled against
       openblas).
     * requires cython.
     * [22]project page

   [23]word2embeddings and [24]polyglot2 are open source, licensed under
   the [25]gnu general public license (v3 or later). note that this is the
   full gpl, which allows many free uses, but does not allow its
   incorporation into any type of distributed [26]proprietary software,
   even in part or in translation. commercial licensing is also available;
   please contact us if you are interested.
