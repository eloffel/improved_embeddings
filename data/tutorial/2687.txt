   in this article we will learn how neural networks work and how to
   implement them with the r programming language! we will see how we can
   easily create neural networks with r and even visualize them. basic
   understanding of r is necessary to understand this article.

neural networks


   neural networks are a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic
   the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks. biological
   neural networks have interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive
   inputs, then based on these inputs they produce an output signal
   through an axon to another neuron. we will try to mimic this process
   through the use of id158s (ann), which we will just
   refer to as neural networks from now on. the process of creating a
   neural network begins with the most basic form, a single id88.

the id88


   let's start our discussion by talking about the id88! a
   id88 has one or more inputs, a bias, an activation function, and
   a single output. the id88 receives inputs, multiplies them by
   some weight, and then passes them into an activation function to
   produce an output. there are many possible id180 to
   choose from, such as the logistic function, a trigonometric function, a
   step function etc. we also make sure to add a bias to the id88,
   this avoids issues where all inputs could be equal to zero (meaning no
   multiplicative weight would have an effect). check out the diagram
   below for a visualization of a id88:

                                 id88

   once we have the output we can compare it to a known label and adjust
   the weights accordingly (the weights usually start off with random
   initialization values). we keep repeating this process until we have
   reached a maximum number of allowed iterations, or an acceptable error
   rate.

   to create a neural network, we simply begin to add layers of
   id88s together, creating a multi-layer id88 model of a
   neural network. you'll have an input layer which directly takes in your
   feature inputs and an output layer which will create the resulting
   outputs. any layers in between are known as hidden layers because they
   don't directly "see" the feature inputs or outputs. for a visualization
   of this check out the diagram below (source: wikipedia).

                               neural network

   let's move on to actually creating a neural network in r!

data


   we'll use islr's built in college data set which has several features
   of a college and a categorical column indicating whether or not the
   school is public or private.
#install.packages('islr')
library(islr)

print(head(college,2))

id174


   it is important to normalize data before training a neural network on
   it. the neural network may have difficulty converging before the
   maximum number of iterations allowed if the data is not normalized.
   there are a lot of different methods for id172 of data. we will
   use the built-in scale() function in r to easily accomplish this task.

   usually it is better to scale the data from 0 to 1, or -1 to 1. we can
   specify the center and scale as additional arguments in the scale()
   function. for example:
# create vector of column max and min values
maxs <- apply(college[,2:18], 2, max)
mins <- apply(college[,2:18], 2, min)

# use scale() and convert the resulting matrix to a data frame
scaled.data <- as.data.frame(scale(college[,2:18],center = mins, scale = maxs -
mins))

# check out results
print(head(scaled.data,2))
