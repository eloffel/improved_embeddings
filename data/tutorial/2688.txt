   there are many python machine learning resources freely available
   online. where to begin? how to proceed? go from zero to python machine
   learning hero in 7 steps!
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [42]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   getting started. two of the most de-motivational words in the english
   language. the first step is often the hardest to take, and when given
   too much choice in terms of direction it can often be debilitating.

                         machine learning confusion
                               where to begin?

   this post aims to take a newcomer from minimal knowledge of machine
   learning in python all the way to knowledgeable practitioner in 7
   steps, all while using freely available materials and resources along
   the way. the prime objective of this outline is to help you wade
   through the numerous free options that are available; there are many,
   to be sure, but which are the best? which complement one another? what
   is the best order in which to use selected resources?

   moving forward, i make the assumption that you are not an expert in:
     * machine learning
     * python
     * any of python's machine learning, scientific computing, or data
       analysis libraries

   it would probably be helpful to have some basic understanding of one or
   both of the first 2 topics, but even that won't be necessary; some
   extra time spent on the earlier steps should help compensate.

step 1: basic python skills


   if we intend to leverage python in order to perform machine learning,
   having some base understanding of python is crucial. fortunately, due
   to its widespread popularity as a general purpose programming language,
   as well as its adoption in both scientific computing and machine
   learning, coming across beginner's tutorials is not very difficult.
   your level of experience in both python and programming in general are
   crucial to choosing a starting point.

   first, you need python installed. since we will be using scientific
   computing and machine learning packages at some point, i suggest that
   you [43]install anaconda. it is an industrial-strength python
   implementation for linux, osx, and windows, complete with the required
   packages for machine learning, including numpy, scikit-learn, and
   matplotlib. it also includes ipython notebook, an interactive
   environment for many of our tutorials. i would suggest python 2.7, for
   no other reason than it is still the dominant installed version.

   if you have no knowledge of programming, my suggestion is to start with
   the following free online book, then move on to the subsequent
   materials:
     * [44]python the hard way, by zed a. shaw

   learn-python if you have experience in programming but not with python
   in particular, or if your python is elementary, i would suggest one or
   both of the following:
     * [45]google developers python course (highly recommended for visual
       learners)
     * [46]an introduction to python for scientific computing (from ucsb
       engineering), by m. scott shell (a great scientific python intro
       ~60 pages)

   and for those looking for a 30 minute crash course in python, here you
   go:
     * [47]learn x in y minutes (x = python)

   of course, if you are an experienced python programmer you will be able
   to skip this step. even if so, i suggest keeping the very readable
   [48]python documentation handy.

step 2: foundational machine learning skills


   kdnuggets' own zachary lipton has pointed out that [49]there is a lot
   of variation in what people consider a "data scientist." this actually
   is a reflection of the field of machine learning, since much of what
   data scientists do involves using machine learning algorithms to
   varying degrees. is it necessary to intimately understand [50]kernel
   methods in order to efficiently create and gain insight from a support
   vector machine model? of course not. like almost anything in life,
   required depth of theoretical understanding is relative to practical
   application. gaining an intimate understanding of machine learning
   algorithms is beyond the scope of this article, and generally requires
   substantial amounts of time investment in a more academic setting, or
   via intense self-study at the very least.

   the good news is that you don't need to possess a phd-level
   understanding of the theoretical aspects of machine learning in order
   to practice, in the same manner that not all programmers require a
   theoretical computer science education in order to be effective coders.

   andrew ng's coursera course often gets rave reviews for its content; my
   suggestion, however, is to browse the course notes compiled by a former
   student of the online course's previous incarnation. skip over the
   octave-specific notes (a matlab-like language unrelated to our python
   pursuits). be warned that these are not "official" notes, but do seem
   to capture the relevant content from andrew's course material. of
   course, if you have the time and interest, now would be the time to
   take [51]andrew ng's machine learning course on coursera.
     * [52]unofficial andrew ng course notes

   there all sorts of video lectures out there if you prefer, alongside
   ng's course mentioned above. i'm a fan of tom mitchell, so here's a
   link to his recent lecture videos (along with maria-florina balcan),
   which i find particularly approachable:
     * [53]tom mitchell machine learning lectures

   you don't need all of the notes and videos at this point. a valid
   strategy involves moving forward to particular exercises below, and
   referencing applicable sections of the above notes and videos when
   appropriate. for example, when you come across an exercise implementing
   a regression model below, read the appropriate regression section of
   ng's notes and/or view mitchell's regression videos at that time.

step 3: scientific python packages overview


   alright. we have a handle on python programming and understand a bit
   about machine learning. beyond python there are a number of open source
   libraries generally used to facilitate practical machine learning. in
   general, these are the main so-called scientific python libraries we
   put to use when performing elementary machine learning tasks (there is
   clearly subjectivity in this):
     * [54]numpy - mainly useful for its n-dimensional array objects
     * [55]pandas - python data analysis library, including structures
       such as dataframes
     * [56]matplotlib - 2d plotting library producing publication quality
       figures
     * [57]scikit-learn - the machine learning algorithms used for data
       analysis and data mining tasks

   a good approach to learning these is to cover this material:
     * [58]scipy lecture notes, by ga  l varoquaux, emmanuelle gouillart,
       and olav vahtras

   this pandas tutorial is good, and to the point:
     * [59]10 minutes to pandas

   you will see some other packages in the tutorials below, including, for
   example, seaborn, which is a data visualization library based on
   matplotlib. the aforementioned packages are (again, subjectively) the
   core of a wide array of machine learning tasks in python; however,
   understanding them should let you adapt to additional and related
   packages without confusion when they are referenced in the following
   tutorials.

   now, on to the good stuff...
