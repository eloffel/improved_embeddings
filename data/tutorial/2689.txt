   this post outlines setting up a neural network in python using
   scikit-learn, the latest version of which now has built in support for
   neural network models.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by jose portilla, udemy data science instructor.

   i'm jose portilla and i [38]teach thousands of students on udemy about
   data science and programming and i also conduct [39]in-person
   programming and data science training. check out the end of the article
   for discount coupons on my courses!

   the most popular machine learning library for python is [40]scikit
   learn. the newest version (0.18) was just released a few days ago and
   now has built in support for neural network models. in this article we
   will learn how neural networks work and how to implement them with the
   python programming language and latest version of scikit-learn! basic
   understanding of python is necessary to understand this article, and it
   would also be helpful (but not necessary) to have some experience with
   sci-kit learn.

   also as a quick side note, i wrote a sister article to this one
   detailing the same topic but in r, you can find it [41]here.

neural networks


   neural networks are a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic
   the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks. biological
   neural networks have interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive
   inputs, then based on these inputs they produce an output signal
   through an axon to another neuron. we will try to mimic this process
   through the use of id158s (ann), which we will just
   refer to as neural networks from now on. the process of creating a
   neural network begins with the most basic form, a single id88.

the id88


   let's start our discussion by talking about the id88! a
   id88 has one or more inputs, a bias, an activation function, and
   a single output. the id88 receives inputs, multiplies them by
   some weight, and then passes them into an activation function to
   produce an output. there are many possible id180 to
   choose from, such as the logistic function, a trigonometric function, a
   step function etc. we also make sure to add a bias to the id88,
   this avoids issues where all inputs could be equal to zero (meaning no
   multiplicative weight would have an effect). check out the diagram
   below for a visualization of a id88:

                                 id88

   once we have the output we can compare it to a known label and adjust
   the weights accordingly (the weights usually start off with random
   initialization values). we keep repeating this process until we have
   reached a maximum number of allowed iterations, or an acceptable error
   rate.

   to create a neural network, we simply begin to add layers of
   id88s together, creating a multi-layer id88 model of a
   neural network. you'll have an input layer which directly takes in your
   feature inputs and an output layer which will create the resulting
   outputs. any layers in between are known as hidden layers because they
   don't directly "see" the feature inputs or outputs. for a visualization
   of this check out the diagram below (source: wikipedia).

                                     ann

   let's move on to actually creating a neural network with python!

scikit-learn


   in order to follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have the
   latest version of scikit learn installed! it is easily installable
   either through pip or conda, but you can reference the [42]official
   installation documentation for complete details on this.

data


   we'll use scikit learn's built in breast cancer data set which has
   several features of tumors with a labeled class indicating whether the
   tumor was malignant or benign. we will try to create a neural network
   model that can take in these features and attempt to predict malignant
   or benign labels for tumors it has not seen before. let's go ahead and
   start by getting the data!

   this object is like a dictionary, it contains a description of the data
   and the features and targets:

dict_keys(['descr', 'feature_names', 'target_names', 'target', 'data'])

(569, 30)

   let's set up our data and our labels:

train test split


   let's split our data into training and testing sets, this is done
   easily with scikit learn's train_test_split function from
   model_selection:
