   the lack of parallel processing in machine learning tasks inhibits
   economy of performance, yet it may very well be worth the trouble. read
   on for an introductory overview to gpu-based parallelism, the cuda
   framework, and some thoughts on practical implementation.

   by [38]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   traditionally (whatever that means in this context), machine learning
   has been executed in single processor environments, where algorithmic
   bottlenecks can lead to substantial delays in model processing, from
   training, to classification, to distance and error calculations, and
   beyond. beyond recent technology-harnessing in neural networking
   training, much of machine learning - including both off-the-shelf
   libraries like [39]scikit-learn and [40]diy algorithm implementation -
   has been approached without the use of parallel processing.

   the lack of parallel processing, in this context referring to parallel
   execution on a shared-memory architecture, inhibits the potential
   exploitation of large numbers of concurrently-executing threads
   performing independent tasks in order to achieve economy of
   performance. the dearth of parallelism is attributable to all sorts of
   reasons, not the least of which being that parallel programming is
   hard. [41]it really is.

                          parallel problem overview
                     fig. 1: parallel problem overview.

   also, parallel processing is not magic, and cannot "just be used" in
   every situation; there are both practical and theoretical algorithmic
   design issues that must be considered when even thinking about
   incorporating parallel processing into a project. however, with big
   data encompassing such large amounts of data, sets of which are
   increasingly being relied upon for routine machine learning tasks, the
   trouble associated with parallelism may very well be worth it in a
   given situation due solely to the potential of dramatic time-savings
   related to algorithm execution.

general purpose computing on graphics processing units


   a contemporary favorite for parallelism in appropriate situations, and
   focus of this article, is utilizing [42]general purpose computing on
   graphics processing units (gpgpu), a strategy exploiting the numerous
   processing cores found on high-end modern graphics processing units
   (gpus) for the simultaneous execution of computationally expensive
   tasks. while not all machine learning tasks, or any other collection of
   software tasks for that matter, can benefit from gpgpu, there are
   undoubtedly numerous computationally expensive and time-monopolizing
   tasks to which gpgpu could be an asset. modifying algorithms to allow
   certain of their tasks to take advantage of gpu parallelization can
   demonstrate noteworthy gains in both task performance and completion
   speed.

                              flynn's taxonomy
                          fig. 2: flynn's taxonomy.

   the gpgpu paradigm fits into [43]flynn   s taxonomy as [44]single
   program, multiple data (spmd) architecture, which differs from from the
   traditional multicore cpu computing paradigm.

                                    spmd
      fig. 3: single program multiple data (spmd) subdivision of mimd.

   it should be noted that, while these modifications would undoubtedly
   benefit the processing of the very large datasets which are the very
   definition of big data, their implementation could have a positive
   effect on much smaller sets of data as well. a number of particular
   machine learning tasks can be computationally expensive and
   time-consuming regardless of data size. parallelizing those which are
   not necessarily required to be executed in serial could potentially
   lead to gains for small datasets as well.

   machine learning algorithms could also see performance gains by
   parallelizing common tasks which may be shared among numerous
   algorithms, such as performing id127, which is used by
   several classification, regression, and id91 techniques,
   including, of particular interest, id75.

   an interesting sidenote relates to the theoretical expected speedup in
   task execution latency. [45]amdahl's law states that the theoretical
   speedup of an entire task's execution increases with the incremental
   improvement of each system resource. however, regardless of the
   collective improvement's magnitude, theoretical speedup is limited by
   the consitutent task which cannot benefit from parallel improvements,
   or improves the least. the chain is only as strong (fast) as its
   weakest (slowest) link.

   for an in-depth introductory treatment of generalized parallel
   computing, [46]read this.

cuda parallel programming framework


   the [47]cuda parallel programming framework from nvidia is a particular
   implementation of the gpgpu paradigm. cuda once was an acronym for
   compute unified device architecture, but nvidia dropped the expansion
   and now just uses cuda. this architecture, facilitating our machine
   learning parallelization via gpu acceleration (another way to refer to
   gpgpu), requires particular consideration in order to effectively
   manage available resources and provide the maximum execution speed
   benefit.

   cuda is technically a heterogeneous computing environment, meaning that
   it facilitates coordinated computing on both cpus and gpus. the cuda
   architecture consists of hosts and devices, with host referring to a
   traditional cpu, and device referencing processors with large numbers
   of arithmetic units, typically gpus. cuda provides extensions to
   traditional programming languages (the native cuda bindings are c, but
   have been ported or made otherwise available to many additional
   languages), enabling the creation of kernels, which are
   parallel-executing functions.

   a kernel, when launched, gets simultaneously executed by a large number
   of cuda device threads, a collection of which are referred to as a
   block of threads, blocks being collected into grids. threads are
   arranged in 3-dimensional layouts within blocks, which are, in turn,
   arranged in 3-dimensional layouts within grids. figure 4 demonstrates
   these relationships and layouts. the total number of threads, blocks,
   and grids employed by a particular kernel are strategically dictated by
   a programmer   s code executing on the host at kernel launch, based on
   given situational requirements.
