--------------------------------------------------------------------------

the project makes available a standard corpus of reasonable size (0.8 billion wo
rds)
to train and evaluate language models.

a few sample results we obtained at google on this data are detailed at:
papers/naaclhlt2013.pdf

besides the scripts needed to rebuild the training/held-out data, it also makes
available log-id203 values for each word in each of ten feld-out data sets
,
for each of the following baseline models:
. unpruned katz (1.1b id165s),
. pruned katz (~15m id165s),
. unpruned interpolated kneser-ney (1.1b id165s),
. pruned interpolated kneser-ney (~15m id165s)

the corpus is derived from the training-monolingual.tokenized/news.20??.en.shuff
led.tokenized data distributed at [83]http://statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.h
tml, monolingual language model training data (download it all in one file, 11 g
b, at [84]http://statmt.org/wmt11/training-monolingual.tgz).

a copy of the already pre-processed data, paper describing the benchmark, and ot
her stuff is hosted at: [85]http://www.statmt.org/lm-benchmark/

corpus preparation:
====================
. download the "monolingual language model training data" ([86]http://statmt.org
/wmt11/training-monolingual.tgz, 11 gb).
$ tar --extract -v --file ../statmt.org/tar_archives/training-monolingual.tgz --
wildcards training-monolingual/news.20??.en.shuffled
followed by:
$ ./scripts/get-data.sh

for a more detailed description of the steps involved, see readme.corpus_generat
ion.

the md5sums for the files generated from the statmt.org download are listed at:
readme.corpus_generation_checkpoints.

you can use:
$ md5sum -c readme.corpus_generation_checkpoints
to check that the files you produced match the checksums of those used to produc
e the results in the paper.

baseline language models:
==========================
. trained and evaluated katz and interpolated kneser-ney language models.

. the word-level id203 assignment for each word in the first 10 shards of
the test data
(including the 00000 shard above for which we report lm performance) is availabl
e at:
baseline-lms/log/output.tar (tar-ed gzip files; due to their relatively large si
ze they
are hosted on gdrive at [87]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b3u4eqge3buemwhps1h
kddzvtja/edit?usp=sharing).

the output is in the following format:
...
words: <s> hello , world ! </s>
word ids: 0 1044976486 1699010037 1539844246 217790329 1
hello   1044976486 -                           1.051147e+01 1.223186e+01 - cost=
1.234405e+01
,       1699010037 -              8.899814e-01 8.908027e-01 3.305907e+00 - cost=
1.806272e+00
world   1539844246 - 6.488597e+00 5.339889e+00 9.798830e+00 7.934176e+00 - cost=
6.488597e+00
!        217790329 - 1.622149e+00 6.229870e+00 6.770101e+00 8.099472e+00 - cost=
1.622149e+00
</s>             1 -   notfound   3.559926e-01 3.563211e-01 2.975316e+00 - cost=
3.559926e-01
- total ------------------------------------------------------------------ cost=
2.261707e+01

the output first repeats the input sentence (with <s> and </s> added). then it s
hows the corresponding integer word ids. subsequent lines list prodlm entries ob
tained with prodlmclient and the resulting smoothed cost calculated by prodlmwra
pper. for each word, it shows the entries for the unigram, bigram, trigram etc.
ending in the word shown at the beginning of the line. the example above shows a
 fourgram model. thus, the first column after the hyphen shows the fourgram entr
y, followed by the trigram, bigram and unigram entries 1.234405e+01.

the first word of the sentence is "hello". the implicit first token of the sente
nce is <s>, resulting in the bigram "<s>". there are no trigram and fourgram for
 the first word, so those columns are empty. the value stored for the bigram is
1.051147e+01, the value stored for the unigram is 1.223186e+01. prodlmwrapper us
es these to calculate a smoothed cost of .

the line with the exclamation mark shows entries for id165s ending in "!": the
fourgram "hello , world !" has a value of 1.622149e+00, the trigram ", world !"
has a value of 6.229870e+00, etc. notfound (which is shown as the value for the
fourgram ", world ! <s>") indicates that the particular id165 is not stored in
the model.

baseline lm results summary:
=============================

here are the out-of-vocabulary (oov) rates and perplexity (ppl)/id165 hit ratio
