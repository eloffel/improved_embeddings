the wikitext long term dependency id38 dataset

   by: [36]stephen merity

   the wikitext id38 dataset is a collection of over 100
   million tokens extracted from the set of verified [37]good and
   [38]featured articles on wikipedia. the dataset is available under the
   [39]creative commons attribution-sharealike license.

   compared to the preprocessed version of id32 (ptb), wikitext-2
   is over 2 times larger and wikitext-103 is over 110 times larger. the
   wikitext dataset also features a far larger vocabulary and retains the
   original case, punctuation and numbers - all of which are removed in
   ptb. as it is composed of full articles, the dataset is well suited for
   models that can take advantage of long term dependencies.

download

   word level: for the datasets, you can download them from:
     * [50]download wikitext-2 word level (4.3 mb)
     * [51]download wikitext-103 word level (181 mb)

   each file contains wiki.train.tokens, wiki.valid.tokens, and
   wiki.test.tokens. no processing is needed other than replacing newlines
   with <eos> tokens.

   raw / character level: for the datasets, you can download them from:
     * [52]download wikitext-2 raw character level data
     * [53]download wikitext-103 raw character level data

   the raw tokens before the addition of <unk> tokens. they should only be
   used for character level work or for creating newly derived datasets.

examples

 = gold dollar =

 the gold dollar or gold one @-@ dollar piece was a coin struck as a regular iss
ue by the united states bureau of the mint from 1849 to 1889 . the coin had thre
e types over its lifetime , all designed by mint chief engraver james b. longacr
e . the type 1 issue had the smallest diameter of any united states coin ever mi
nted .
 a gold dollar had been proposed several times in the 1830s and 1840s , but was
not initially adopted . congress was finally galvanized into action by the incre
ased supply of bullion caused by the california gold rush , and in 1849 authoriz
ed a gold dollar . in its early years , silver coins were being hoarded or expor
ted , and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce . silver again circula
ted after congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter
 , and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins van
ished from circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the american
 civil war .
 gold did not again circulate in most of the nation until 1879 ; once it did , t
he gold dollar did not regain its place . in its final years , it was struck in
small numbers , causing speculation by hoarders . it was also in demand to be mo
unted in jewelry . the regular issue gold dollar was last struck in 1889 ; the f
ollowing year , congress ended the series .

 = super mario land =

 super mario land is a 1989 side @-@ scrolling platform video game , the first i
n the super mario land series , developed and published by nintendo as a launch
title for their game boy handheld game console . in gameplay similar to that of
the 1985 super mario bros. , but resized for the smaller device 's screen , the
player advances mario to the end of 12 levels by moving to the right and jumping
 across platforms to avoid enemies and pitfalls . unlike other mario games , sup
er mario land is set in sarasaland , a new environment depicted in line art , an
d mario pursues princess daisy . the game introduces two gradius @-@ style shoot
er levels .
 at nintendo ceo hiroshi yamauchi 's request , game boy creator gunpei yokoi 's
nintendo r & d1 developed a mario game to sell the new console . it was the firs
t portable version of mario and the first to be made without mario creator and y
okoi prot  g   shigeru miyamoto . accordingly , the development team shrunk mario
gameplay elements for the device and used some elements inconsistently from the
series . super mario land was expected to showcase the console until nintendo of
 america bundled tetris with new game boys . the game launched alongside the gam
e boy first in japan ( april 1989 ) and later worldwide . super mario land was l
ater rereleased for the nintendo 3ds via virtual console in 2011 again as a laun
ch title , which featured some tweaks to the game 's presentation .
 initial reviews were laudatory . reviewers were satisfied with the smaller supe
r mario bros. , but noted its short length . they considered it among the best o
f the game boy launch titles . the handheld console became an immediate success
and super mario land ultimately sold over 18 million copies , more than that of
super mario bros. 3 . both contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised t
he game 's soundtrack . later reviews were critical of the compromises made in d
evelopment and noted super mario land 's deviance from series norms . the game b
egot a series of sequels , including the 1992 super mario land 2 : 6 golden coin
s , 1994 wario land : super mario land 3 , and 2011 super mario 3d land , though
 many of the original 's mechanics were not revisited . the game was included in
 several top game boy game lists and debuted princess daisy as a recurring mario
 series character .

 = = = sinclair scientific programmable = = =

 the sinclair scientific programmable was introduced in 1975 , with the same cas
e as the sinclair oxford . it was larger than the scientific , at 73 by 155 by 3
4 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 9 in    6 @.@ 1 in    1 @.@ 3 in ) , and used a larger  batt
ery , but could also be powered by mains electricity .
 it had 24 @-@ step programming abilities , which meant it was highly limited fo
r many purposes . it also lacked functions for the natural logarithm and exponen
tial function . constants used in programs were required to be integers , and th
e programming was wasteful , with start and end quotes needed to use a constant
in a program .
 however , included with the calculator was a library of over 120 programs that
that performed common operations in mathematics , geometry , statistics , financ
e , physics , electronics , engineering , as well as fluid mechanics and materia
ls science . the full library of standard programs contained over 400 programs i
n the sinclair program library .

dataset statistics

   in comparison to the mikolov processed version of the id32
   (ptb), the wikitext datasets are larger. wikitext-2 aims to be of a
   similar size to the ptb while wikitext-103 contains all articles
   extracted from wikipedia. the wikitext datasets also retain numbers (as
   opposed to replacing them with n), case (as opposed to all text being
   lowercased), and punctuation (as opposed to stripping them out).
