dialog-based language learning

   this project contains code for the dialog-based learning memn2n setup
   in the following paper: "[61]dialog-based language learning". this
   implementation was written by [62]jiwei li.

setup

   this code requires [63]torch7 and its luarocks packages cutorch, cunn,
   nngraph, torchx, and tds.

   to get the data, from this directory first run ./setup_data.sh to
   download the data (368m download, unpacks to 4.7gb).

usage

   you can use one of the try_*.sh scripts as examples of how to train the
   model on one of the datasets.

   as demonstrated there, to train run:
th train.lua [params]

   available options are:
-batch_size             (default 32)
-token_size             (default 0, number of tokens)
-dimension              (default 20, dimensionality of embedding vectors)
-init_weight    (default 0.1, initialization weights)
-n_hop                  (default 3, number of hops)
-lr                             (default 0.01, learning rate)
-thres                  (default 40, threshold for gradient clipping)
-iter_halve_lr  (default 20, number of iterations after which start halving lear
ning rate)
-task                   (default 1, which task to test)
-gpu_index              (default 1, which gpu to use)
-policy                 (default 0.5, choose from 0.01, 0.1, or 0.5 to select th
e rate of correct--vs random--answers)
-n_iter                 (default 20, number of iterations)
-beta                   (default true, whether to use beta for fp setting)
-negative               (default 5, number of negative samples)
-dataset                (default 'babi', choose from 'babi' or 'movieqa')
-setting                (default 'rbi', choose from 'rbi', 'fp', 'im', or 'rbi+f
p')
