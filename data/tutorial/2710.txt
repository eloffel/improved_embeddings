build your own deep learning box

   [16]may 19, 2016october 21, 2016

   deep learning is a technique used to solve complex problems such as
   natural language processing and [17]image recognition. we are now able
   to solve these computational problems quickly, thanks to a component
   called the graphics processing unit (gpu). originally used to generate
   high-resolution computer images at fast speeds, the gpu   s computational
   efficiency makes it ideal for executing deep learning algorithms.
   analysis which used to take weeks can now be completed in a few days.

   while all modern computers have a gpu, not all gpus can be programmed
   for deep learning. for those who do not have a deep learning-enabled
   gpu, this post provides a step-by-step layman   s tutorial on building
   your own deep learning box. our deep learning box is essentially
   another computer equipped with a deep learning-enabled gpu. the gpu is
   the main difference between a regular computer and a deep learning box.

   first, check if [18]your gpu is listed on this site. if it is, it means
   you already have a gpu capable of deep learning, and you can start from
   the second section below on software installation. if your computer
   does not have a suitable gpu, read on to find out about how you can get
   the required components for less than $1.5k.

purchase hardware

   this section lists the main components of your deep learning box. if
   you have no computing knowledge or you want to save time, you may
   choose to purchase these in-store and pay a nominal fee for assistance
   to assemble the components. prices listed below are in usd as of march
   2016. the total cost was $1285, which we funded using prize money from
   competitions.

   motherboard
   distributes power to the rest of the components and enables
   communication between them. it is a printed circuit board.

   central processing unit (cpu)
   performs general computational operations, like a brain. it is a chip
   on the motherboard.

   6600k (cpu)

   random-access memory (ram)
   enables quick retrieval of information, like working memory. it is
   another fixture on the motherboard.

   graphics processing unit (gpu)
   performs intensive computations for deep learning. our chosen gpu, the
   gtx 970, has a small form factor so that we could fit it into a
   portable case. an older gpu, the gtx 770, was able to train a deep
   learning model with 5120 images on 20 iterations within 33 seconds.
   hence, our machine is expected to perform even faster. nonetheless, you
   can also get a 1070x or 1080x now as they   ve become more affordable.

   port.
   $50     cooler master elite 110

   assembly
   $25     in-store service to secure and wire the components.

   after the box has been assembled, connect it to a standalone monitor,
   keyboard and mouse.

                                install software

   step 1: install ubuntu
   ubuntu is the operating system (os) on which your deep learning box
   will run, much like windows or mac. a straightforward way to install
   the os would be to use another computer to download the os file onto a
   usb stick. then, plug the usb stick into your deep learning box and
   install the os from there.

   follow the links for instructions on how to download the os file onto
   the usb stick from a [19]windows or [20]mac. once you boot ubuntu on
   your deep learning box from the usb stick for the first time, you   ll be
   brought through the installation process.

   step 2: installing the deep learning stack

   deep stack
   nvidia is one of the companies that produces gpus and they have
   developed a deep learning framework called digits. before we can get
   digits running, we have to install a few software up the stack.

   we need to install a driver, which acts as an access key for the deep
   learning software to harness the gpu for its computations. to install
   it, press ctrl+alt+t to open the terminal window.

   linuxterminal.png

   as of ubuntu 14.04, the nvidia drivers are part of the official
   repository. even though the version maintained in the repository might
   not be the newest compared to those on the official nvidia website,
   they are usually more stable and have been tested by the community
   against different software. we would recommend using the drivers from
   the ubuntu repository.

   to search for the latest driver to install:
apt-cache search nvidia

   you should be able to find a package that looks like    nvidia-xxx    where
   xxx is the version number of the driver. choose the latest one. in this
   example we would be using nvidia-352.

   then, type in the following commands:
sudo apt-get install nvidia-352 nvidia-352-uvm
sudo apt-get install nvidia-modprobe nvidia-settings

   the additional packages    nvidia-modprobe    and    nvidia-settings    allow
   easier installations of future packages to ubuntu.

   step 3: install cuda and digits

   cuda is a platform that enables the gpu to execute tasks in parallel,
   increasing its efficiency. digits is the interface for deep learning
   analysis. you use this interface to upload data, train models and make
   predictions. to install them, run the following commands:
cuda_repo_pkg=cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb &&
    wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_
64/$cuda_repo_pkg &&
    sudo dpkg -i $cuda_repo_pkg

ml_repo_pkg=nvidia-machine-learning-repo_4.0-2_amd64.deb && wget http://develope
r.download.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/$ml_repo_
pkg && sudo dpkg -i $ml_repo_pkg
apt-get update
apt-get install digits

   when the installation is successful, fire up your browser and go to
   [21]http://localhost. you should see a webpage like the one below:

   digits homepage.png

   if you run into errors, refer to the troubleshooting section in the
   [22]official installation guide.

                                  run analysis

   nvidia digits is a user-friendly platform that allows you to train
   prediction models using deep learning techniques. the video below
   provides a comprehensive demo on the entire process, from uploading
   data to making predictions:

   hide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

                                   conclusion

   that   s it. you have just built your own deep learning box. if you   re
   new to deep learning, you can also test the techniques in the cloud
   first, using [24]google   s cloud machine learning platform. however,
   using your own gpu to run analysis might allow you more speed and
   flexibility to tweak parameters in the long-run.

   did you learn something useful today? we would be glad to inform you
   when we have new tutorials, so that your learning continues!

       i   ve been attempting to find information about the relative
       importance of the various parts. seems like the graphics card is
       the most important component, but what about the other parts, ie.
       memory speed, hard drive capacity/type etc.?
       so far, my machine is a dell r900 poweredge with 4 quad-core
       processors and 64 gb memory (600 mhz). i   m hoping that running with
       higher speed (ssd) drives will help make up for the lower speed
       memory and lower speed processors. it   s got many cores/threads, but
       overall it   s much slower then modern i5/i7 type computers.
       is there some kind of a benchmark that would help to identify
       potential bottlenecks in a system related to deep learning? perhaps
       it   s better just to run the models and look for i/o issues.
       anyways, thanks for the article. excellent info.

       if you want to dive into deep learning it will be a necessity work
       with a titan x. you will see why a 4 gb ram gpu card is not enough
       after some study. first of all you will have a lesser batch size.
       so you have to deal with other hyper parameters like learning rate
       to achieve the model convergence. sometimes it will never converge
       with small batch size. so some deep models architectures will never
       be in your scope like resnets or vgg.

            hi fsr,
            at work, i run k40s and will likely move to the pascal cards
            once things stabilize. agree that setup this isn   t meant for
            industrial grade deep learning but its more for exploring and
            playing with the different knobs of the models. we will have a
            follow on article using the box in some of the experiments.

       hello,it is a great essay! however ,i am a poor student from china
       , and i want to study deep learning by myself. so, i want to buy a
       computer with:
       cpu i7 6700k
       gpu gtx970
       ram 16g ddr4
       total count may be 6000 rmb or 1000 dollars.
       and i want to realize the deep  or deep  as practice ,so i am
       curious can i use these hardwares to implement the procedure? or i
       need a gtx980 or taller, which i an   r afford.
       what is more, my teacher buy a thinkstation with quadro k4200,can i
       use it to realize the deepid?

            hi pang,
            you can use your laptop   s gtx 970m to train deepid which has
            implementations in caffe. but the laptop   s performance might
            be slower than the gtx 970 featured here as the gtx970m is a
            mobility version of the gtx 970. comparison as follows.
            [77]http://gpuboss.com/gpus/geforce-gtx-980-vs-geforce-gtx-970
            m
            however it is better to use a non-laptop based solution, such
            as a full desktop computer, to train as such gpu intensive
            processing will cause the laptop to overheat.

   algobeans is the brainchild of two data science enthusiasts, annalyn
   (university of cambridge) and kenneth (stanford university). we noticed
   that while data science is increasingly used to improve workplace
   decisions, many people know little about the field. hence, we created
   algobeans so that everyone and anyone can learn - be it an aspiring
   student or enterprising business professional. each tutorial covers the
   important functions and assumptions of a data science technique,
   without any math or jargon. we also illustrate these techniques with
   real-world data and examples.
