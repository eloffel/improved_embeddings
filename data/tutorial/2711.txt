where will your country stand in world war iii?

   [16]april 12, 2016september 22, 2016

   in the recent panama papers scandal, journalists analyzed 11.5 million
   documents [17]using network graphs to trace the use of offshore tax
   structures. in this chapter, we use a network graph technique called
   social network analysis (sna) to map weapons transfer between
   countries. by analyzing bilateral weapons trade, a network of
   multilateral ties can be distilled, providing insights into the complex
   arena of international politics.

   sna is based on mathematics and computer science concepts, and is
   applied in many social science disciplines. it analyzes relationships
   between individuals, uncovering social circles and influential people
   within a network. for instance, it can identify the [18]main character
   in game of thrones, a popular television series. sna is also used in
   government intelligence to map out [19]crime rings and [20]terrorist
   cells. apart from people, other entities such as objects can be mapped
   in a network as well.

introduction to graphs

   in sna, network structures called graphs are used to analyze
   relationships between individuals. each individual is represented by a
   node. a line called an edge between two nodes indicates a relationship
   between two individuals. these edges can have a value or weight that
   indicates the strength of the relationship.

   in the graph below, david is acquainted with all three other
   individuals. among his three acquaintances, julia and mary know each
   other, but they do not know tom. as julia has only just met david and
   mary, their edges with julia are weak.
   simplegraph

   a simple friendship network. the thickness of the edge denotes the
   level of relationship.

an illustration

   data from the stockholm international peace research institute (sipri)
   has annual information on bilateral transfers of major conventional
   weapons. all prices are in us dollars using 1990 prices. magnitude of
   arms transfer can be interpreted as a measure of bilateral
   relationship, since a country will only trust another with weapons if
   they are aligned on the international stage. as the value of arms trade
   between two countries can fluctuate based on when new technologies are
   available for sale, we looked at data from 2006 to 2015, and used the
   10-year trade volume between countries as a measure of their
   relationship. only 10-year trade volumes above $100 million are
   analyzed, and the resulting network graph contained 91 nodes and 295
   edges.

   the graph was generated using gephi, and the network layout was
   determined using a force-directed algorithm. in this algorithm, nodes
   and edges are assigned    forces   . nodes that have no edges between them
   repel each other, while nodes that do have connecting edges attract
   each other based on the strength of their connection.
   [21]armsnetwork

   source: sipri

interpreting the network

   in the graph above, each node represents a country, and an edge exists
   between two countries if there is over $100 million worth of arms
   traded between them in the last 10 years. the size of the edges is
   proportional to the value of arms trade between two countries, the
   largest of which is between russia and india ($22.3b), followed by
   russia and china ($11.1b). of the 295 edges, only 55 of them have
   values above $1 billion.

   a node   s color denotes the subgroup of the country. the subgroups are
   discovered using the louvain method, which maximizes edges between
   countries in their own subgroup, and minimizes edges between countries
   of different subgroups. since edges can be viewed as cordial relations
   between two countries, the subgroups can be viewed as alliances or
   alignments. countries within the same subgroup are more likely to be
   singing the same tune in international politics, whereas countries of
   different subgroups are possibly against each other.

   this algorithm has accurately placed us in a different group from
   russia and china, and the largest group (blue) contains the us and many
   of her key allies. the countries that surround us in the network are
   her strategic partners across the world that she counts on to maintain
   her power against her rivals. the second group (yellow) comprises
   mostly european nations, but also contains countries friendly to the
   west which are grouped separately from the blue group because their key
   arms trading partner is germany, netherlands, or sweden, instead of the
   us.

   the last group (red) comprises states which have closer relations to
   russia or china, and are mostly from asia and africa. many of these
   countries have government types which are incompatible with the us, and
   are often criticized by the west for their human rights records or
   their lack of democracy. the most surprising inclusion in this group is
   ukraine, which has seemingly unstable relations with russia due to
   russia   s military intervention in ukraine in 2014. ukraine   s placement
   is due to her arms trade with many countries in her subgroup such as
   russia and china, as well as her lack of interactions with western
   nations. in fact, according sipri, ukraine exported us$227m worth of
   arms to russia in 2014 and 2015, despite russia   s military operating in
   their country during this period.

how influential is a country?

   the size of each country   s node represents its centrality in the
   network, and is determined using the id95 algorithm. this
   algorithm, named after google founder larry page, was used by an
   initial version of google to rank websites. in our network, id95
   determines a country   s centrality by the number of connections it has,
   the strength of its connections, as well as the importance of the
   countries it is connected to. thus, centrality can be seen as a
   country   s influence on the global stage.

   [22]id95

   unsurprisingly, id95 ranked the us as the most influential country
   in the network. despite russia   s involvement in the two largest
   bilateral arms transfer, it is the us that tops total arms transfer
   value over the last 10 years. the us traded $92.5b worth of arms with
   her allies, including south korea ($8.12b), united arab emirates
   ($6.98b), australia ($6.21b), and saudi arabia ($5.69b). in total, the
   us conducted arms trade valued above $1 billion with 22 other countries
   in this period.

   despite india having the third largest total trade volume, it is ranked
   a distant 14^th by id95, due to having fewer links. instead, the
   algorithm identified us, russia, germany, france, and china in its top
   five, which again demonstrates the accuracy of the algorithm since four
   of them wield significant power as permanent members of the united
   nations security council.

   a surprise inclusion in the top 15 is ukraine (6^th), since she is not
   known to be an influential country. this demonstrates the limitations
   of using just the sipri data to analyze international relations.
   ukraine   s position is inflated because of her major arms export
   industry, as she was the 10^th largest exporter from 2006-2015. she
   shipped weapons to 15 different countries in this network, of which 5
   of them import exclusively from her.

       is the value of the arms trade summed up over the last 10 years? it
       would be nice if the model can track the changes over time over
       discrete time points, e.g. yearly or 3-yearly (depending on what is
       a good length of time that is relevant for arms purchases). then
       one can see the changing relationships between states over time

       great analysis.. very interesting.. could you please list any other
       similar techniques other than sna that could help perform similar
       analysis? just want to know what they are and understand their pros
       and cons compared to sna.

            hi naveen, a variation on our network graph is having directed
            edges, useful if there   s a meaningful difference between
            imports and exports (which we didn   t thought there was). there
            are also many ways to analyse a network other than centrality
            and subgroups. for example, one might be concerned about the
            average degree of separation when analyzing a terrorist cell,
            in order to understand how developed is the cell. even for
            measuring centrality itself, there are many different methods,
            each suited to different data.

            hi, the louvain algorithm can be used to find the subgroups.
            once you have your data in gephi, you can find the subgroups
            in your network automatically using the id91 tool in
            gephi.

about algobeans

   algobeans is the brainchild of two data science enthusiasts, annalyn
   (university of cambridge) and kenneth (stanford university). we noticed
   that while data science is increasingly used to improve workplace
   decisions, many people know little about the field. hence, we created
   algobeans so that everyone and anyone can learn - be it an aspiring
   student or enterprising business professional. each tutorial covers the
   important functions and assumptions of a data science technique,
   without any math or jargon. we also illustrate these techniques with
   real-world data and examples.
