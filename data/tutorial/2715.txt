   this post provides a concise overview of 18 natural language processing
   terms, intended as an entry point for the beginner looking for some
   orientation on the topic.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [40]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   at the intersection of computational linguistics and artificial
   intelligence is where we find natural language processing. very
   broadly, natural language processing (nlp) is a discipline which is
   interested in how human languages, and, to some extent, the humans who
   speak them, interact with technology. nlp is an interdisciplinary topic
   which has historically been the equal domain of artificial intelligence
   researchers and linguistics alike; perhaps obviously, those approaching
   the discipline from the linguistics side must get up to speed on
   technology, while those entering the discipline from the technology
   realm need to learn the linguistic concepts.

   it is this second group that this post aims to serve at an introductory
   level, as we take a no-nonsense approach to defining some key nlp
   terminology. while you certainly won't be a linguistic expert after
   reading this, we hope that you are better able to understand some of
   the nlp-related discourse, and gain perspective as to how to proceed
   with learning more on the topics herein.

   so here they are, 18 select natural language processing terms,
   concisely defined, with links to further reading where appropriate.

   nlp wordcloud

   1. [41]natural language processing (nlp)

   natural language processing (nlp) concerns itself with the interaction
   between natural human languages and computing devices. nlp is a major
   aspect of computational linguistics, and also falls within the realms
   of computer science and artificial intelligence.

   2. id121

   id121 is, generally, an early step in the nlp process, a step
   which splits longer strings of text into smaller pieces, or tokens.
   larger chunks of text can be tokenized into sentences, sentences can be
   tokenized into words, etc. further processing is generally performed
   after a piece of text has been appropriately tokenized.

   3. id172

   before further processing, text needs to be normalized. id172
   generally refers to a series of related tasks meant to put all text on
   a level playing field: converting all text to the same case (upper or
   lower), removing punctuation, expanding contractions, converting
   numbers to their word equivalents, and so on. id172 puts all
   words on equal footing, and allows processing to proceed uniformly.

   4. id30

   id30 is the process of eliminating affixes (suffixed, prefixes,
   infixes, circumfixes) from a word in order to obtain a word stem.

                               running     run

   5. lemmatization

   lemmatization is related to id30, differing in that lemmatization
   is able to capture canonical forms based on a word's [42]lemma.

   for example, id30 the word "better" would fail to return its
   citation form (another word for lemma); however, lemmatization would
   result in the following:

                               better     good

   it should be easy to see why the implementation of a stemmer would be
   the less difficult feat of the two.

   6. corpus

   in linguistics and nlp, corpus (literally latin for body) refers to a
   collection of texts. such collections may be formed of a single
   language of texts, or can span multiple languages -- there are numerous
   reasons for which multilingual corpora (the plural of corpus) may be
   useful. corpora may also consist of themed texts (historical, biblical,
   etc.). corpora are generally solely used for statistical linguistic
   analysis and hypothesis testing.

   7. stop words

   stop words are those words which are filtered out before further
   processing of text, since these words contribute little to overall
   meaning, given that they are generally the most common words in a
   language. for instance, "the," "and," and "a," while all required words
   in a particular passage, don't generally contribute greatly to one's
   understanding of content. as a simple example, the following
   [43]panagram is just as legible if the stop words are removed:

    [del: the :del] quick brown fox jumps over [del: the :del] lazy dog.

   8. parts-of-speech (pos) tagging

   id52 consists of assigning a category tag to the tokenized parts
   of a sentence. the most popular id52 would be identifying words
   as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

   id52

   9. statistical id38

   statistical id38 is the process of building a statistical
   language model which is meant to provide an estimate of a natural
   language. for a sequence of input words, the model would assign a
   id203 to the entire sequence, which contributes to the estimated
   likelihood of various possible sequences. this can be especially useful
   for nlp applications which generate text.

   10. bag of words

   bag of words is a particular representation model used to simplify the
   contents of a selection of text. the id159 omits grammar
   and word order, but is interested in the number of occurrences of words
   within the text. the ultimate representation of the text selection is
   that of a bag of words (bag referring to the set theory concept of
   [44]multisets, which differ from simple sets).

   actual storage mechanisms for the bag of words representation can vary,
   but the following is a simple example using a dictionary for
   intuitiveness. sample text:

                       "well, well, well," said john.

                 "there, there," said james. "there, there."

   the resulting bag of words representation as a dictionary:
   {
      'well': 3,
      'said': 2,
      'john': 1,
      'there': 4,
      'james': 1
   }

   11. id165s

   id165s is another representation model for simplifying text selection
   contents. as opposed to the orderless representation of bag of words,
   id165s modeling is interested in preserving contiguous sequences of n
   items from the text selection.

   an example of trigram (3-gram) model of the second sentence of the
   above example ("there, there," said james. "there, there.") appears as
   a list representation below:
   [
      "there there said",
      "there said james",
      "said james there",
      "james there there",
   ]

   12. id157

   id157, often abbreviated regexp or regexp, are a tried
   and true method of concisely describing patterns of text. a regular
   expression is represented as a special text string itself, and is meant
   for developing search patterns on selections of text. regular
   expressions can be thought of as an expanded set of rules beyond the
   wildcard characters of ? and *. though often cited as frustrating to
   learn, id157 are incredibly powerful text searching
   tools.

   13. zipf's law

   zipf's law is used to describe the relationship between word
   frequencies in document collections. if a document collection's words
   are ordered by frequency, and y is used to describe the number of times
   that the xth word appears, zipf's observation is concisely captured as
   y = cx^-1/2 (item frequency is inversely proportional to item rank).
   more generally, [45]wikipedia says:

     zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language
     utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to
     its rank in the frequency table. thus the most frequent word will
     occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word,
     three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.

   zipf's law

   14. similarity measures

   there are numerous similarity measures which can be applied to nlp.
   what are we measuring the similarity of? generally, strings.
     * levenshtein - the number of characters that must be deleted,
       inserted, or substituted in order to make a pair of strings equal
     * jaccard - the measure of overlap between 2 sets; in the case of
       nlp, generally, documents are sets of words
     * smith waterman - similar to levenshtein, but with costs assigned to
       substitution, insertion, and deletion

   15. syntactic analysis

   also referred to as parsing, syntactic analysis is the task of
   analyzing strings as symbols, and ensuring their conformance to a
   established set of grammatical rules. this step must, out of necessity,
   come before any further analysis which attempts to extract insight from
   text -- semantic, sentiment, etc. -- treating it as something beyond
   symbols.

   16. [46]semantic analysis

   also known as meaning generation, semantic analysis is interested in
   determining the meaning of text selections (either character or word
   sequences). after an input selection of text is read and parsed
   (analyzed syntactically), the text selection can then be interpreted
   for meaning. simply put, syntactic analysis is concerned with what
   words a text selection was made up of, while semantic analysis wants to
   know what the collection of words actually means. the topic of semantic
   analysis is both broad and deep, with a wide variety of tools and
   techniques at the researcher's disposal.

   17. [47]id31

   id31 is the process of evaluating and determining the
   sentiment captured in a selection of text, with sentiment defined as
   feeling or emotion. this sentiment can be simply positive (happy),
   negative (sad or angry), or neutral, or can be some more precise
   measurement along a scale, with neutral in the middle, and positive and
   negative increasing in either direction.

   id31

   18. [48]information retrieval

   information retrieval is the process of accessing and retrieving the
   most appropriate information from text based on a particular query,
   using context-based indexing or metadata. one of the most famous
   examples of information retrieval would be google search.
