neural programmer

   implementation of the neural programmer model described in [63]paper

   flag to the location of the data.

training

   python neural_programmer.py

   the models are written to flags.output_dir

testing

   python neural_programmer.py --evaluator_job=true

   the models are loaded from flags.output_dir. the evaluation is done on
   development data.

   in case of errors because of encoding, add "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-" as
