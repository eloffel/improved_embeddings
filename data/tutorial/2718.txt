autoextend - extending id27s to embeddings for synsets and lexeme

introduction

   autoextend will extend existing id27s to embeddings for
   lexeme and synsets. it is flexible in that it can take any word
   embeddings as input and does not need an additional training corpus.
   the synset/lexeme embeddings obtained live in the same vector space as
   the id27s.
   to learn more about autoextend, read the following paper:
   [1]http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/p15-1173 or watch the talk (24min):

get started

git clone https://github.com/casaro/autoextend.git

extract words, synsets, etc. from id138

   1a) open file id138extractor.java
   1b) set path to jwnl (jwnl-1.4_rc3 or newer)
   1c) set path to your input id27s (can be binary or text)
   1d) set path to desired output folder
   1e) get it running

run autoextend

   2a) open autoextend.m
   2b) set folder in else clause to folder of 1d)
   2c) get it running
   2e) play around with parameters
   2f) run writevectors.m to get word and synset embeddings in one file

run ims with with synset features

   3a) add all three files to the ims system
   3b) search for "path to word and synset vectors"
   3c) set path to file of 2f)
   3d) get it running

pre-trained embeddings

   you can download pre-trained synsets and lexeme embeddings [3]here (163
   mb). they live in the same vector space as the pre-trained word
   embeddings by mikolov (see [4]https://code.google.com/p/id97/). the
   synset ids correspond to the ids in id138 1.7.1. a mapping of synset
   ids to lexemes in the synset is included in the zip file. note: an
   updated version for the lexeme vectors was uploaded on 2015/11/25.
