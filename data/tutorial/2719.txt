introduction

   tf-id195 is a general-purpose encoder-decoder framework for
   tensorflow that can be used for machine translation, text
   summarization, conversational modeling, image captioning, and more.

   machine translation model

design goals

   we built tf-id195 with the following goals in mind:
     * general purpose: we initially built this framework for machine
       translation, but have since used it for a variety of other tasks,
       including summarization, conversational modeling, and image
       captioning. as long as your problem can be phrased as encoding
       input data in one format and decoding it into another format, you
       should be able to use or extend this framework.
     * usability: you can train a model with a single command. several
       types of input data are supported, including standard raw text.
     * reproducibility: training pipelines and models are configured using
       yaml files. this allows other to run your exact same model
       configurations.
     * extensibility: code is structured in a modular way and that easy to
       build upon. for example, adding a new type of attention mechanism
       or encoder architecture requires only minimal code changes.
     * documentation: all code is documented using standard python
       docstrings, and we have written guides to help you get started with
       common tasks.
     * good performance: for the sake of code simplicity, we did not try
       to squeeze out every last bit of performance, but the
       implementation is fast enough to cover almost all production and
       research use cases. tf-id195 also supports distributed training
       to trade off computational power and training time.

faq

   1. how does this framework compare to the [25]google neural machine
   translation system? is this the official open-source implementation?

   no, this is not an official open-source implementation of the gid4
   system. this framework was built from the bottom up to cover a wider
   range of tasks, id4 being one of them. we have
   not replicated the exact gid4 architecture in this framework, but we
   welcome [26]contributions in that direction.

related frameworks

   the following frameworks offer functionality similar to that of
   tf-id195. we hope to collaborate with the authors of these frameworks
   so that we can learn from each other.
     * [27]openid4 (torch)
     * [28]neural monkey (tensorflow)
     * [29]nematus (theano)
