tensorflow models

   this repository contains a number of different models implemented in
   [111]tensorflow:

   the [112]official models are a collection of example models that use
   tensorflow's high-level apis. they are intended to be well-maintained,
   tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable tensorflow api. they
   should also be reasonably optimized for fast performance while still
   being easy to read. we especially recommend newer tensorflow users to
   start here.

   the [113]research models are a large collection of models implemented
   in tensorflow by researchers. they are not officially supported or
   available in release branches; it is up to the individual researchers
   to maintain the models and/or provide support on issues and pull
   requests.

   the [114]samples folder contains code snippets and smaller models that
   demonstrate features of tensorflow, including code presented in various
   blog posts.

   the [115]tutorials folder is a collection of models described in the
   [116]tensorflow tutorials.
