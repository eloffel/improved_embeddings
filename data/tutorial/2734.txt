outline

   this is an introductory course in machine learning (ml) that covers the
   basic theory, algorithms, and applications. ml is a key technology in
   big data, and in many financial, medical, commercial, and scientific
   applications. it enables computational systems to adaptively improve
   their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data.
   ml has become one of the hottest fields of study today, taken up by
   undergraduate and graduate students from 15 different majors at
   caltech. this course balances theory and practice, and covers the
   mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects. the lectures [11]below
   follow each other in a story-like fashion:
     * what is learning?
     * can a machine learn?
     * how to do it?
     * how to do it well?
     * take-home lessons.

   the 18 lectures are about 60 minutes each plus q&a. the content of each
   lecture is color coded:

                            theory; mathematical
                            technique; practical
                            analysis; conceptual

   the learning problem - introduction; supervised, unsupervised, and
   id23. components of the learning problem.
   is learning feasible? - can we generalize from a limited sample to the
   entire space? relationship between in-sample and out-of-sample.
   the linear model i - linear classification and id75.
   extending linear models through nonlinear transforms.
   error and noise - the principled choice of error measures. what happens
   when the target we want to learn is noisy.
   training versus testing - the difference between training and testing
   in mathematical terms. what makes a learning model able to generalize?
   theory of generalization - how an infinite model can learn from a
   finite sample. the most important theoretical result in machine
   learning.
   the vc dimension - a measure of what it takes a model to learn.
   relationship to the number of parameters and degrees of freedom.
   id160 - breaking down the learning performance into
   competing quantities. the learning curves.
   the linear model ii - more about linear models. id28,
   maximum likelihood, and id119.
   neural networks - a biologically inspired model. the efficient
   id26 learning algorithm. hidden layers.
   overfitting - fitting the data too well; fitting the noise.
   deterministic noise versus stochastic noise.
   id173 - putting the brakes on fitting the noise. hard and soft
   constraints. augmented error and weight decay.
   validation - taking a peek out of sample. model selection and data
   contamination. cross validation.
   support vector machines - one of the most successful learning
   algorithms; getting a complex model at the price of a simple one.
   kernel methods - extending id166 to infinite-dimensional spaces using the
   kernel trick, and to non-separable data using soft margins.
   radial basis functions - an important learning model that connects
   several machine learning models and techniques.
   three learning principles - major pitfalls for machine learning
   practitioners; occam's razor, sampling bias, and data snooping.
   epilogue - the map of machine learning. brief views of bayesian
   learning and aggregation methods.

live lectures

   this course was broadcast live from the lecture hall at caltech in
   april and may 2012. there was no 'take 2' for the recorded videos. the
   lectures included live q&a sessions with online audience participation.
   here is [31]a sample of a live lecture as the online audience saw it in
   real time.
