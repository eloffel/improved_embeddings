relationship modeling networks (rmn)

   code for model described in [72]feuding families and former friends:
   unsupervised learning for dynamic fictional relationships along with
   [73]a dataset of character interactions. feel free to email me at
   [74]miyyer@umd.edu with any comments/problems/questions/suggestions.

dependencies:

     * python 2, numpy, theano, lasagne
     * recommended to train w/ gpu, on a 980 ti each epoch takes 2-3
       minutes

dataset description:

     * 20,046 relationships with 387,614 total spans from 1,378 different
       books
     * each span is provided in a bag-of-words format where stopwords and
       infrequent words have been filtered out as described in the paper

download data and train model:

     * bash run.sh (downloads character interaction dataset, metadata
       info, and 300d glove embeddings pretrained on the common crawl, and
       then runs train_rmn.py to train an rmn on the downloaded dataset)

visualizing learned trajectories

     * running train_rmn.py yields three output files: the model
       parameters (rmn_params.pkl), the learned descriptors
       (descriptors.log), and the learned trajectories (trajectories.log).
       before generating visualizations, you need to manually label each
       descriptor (each line in the descriptor file). you can do this by
       simply inserting your labels as the first word of each line in the
       descriptor file.
     * after labeling the descriptors, run viz.py to generate
       visualizations like the ones below:

to-dos:

     * clean and integrate the alpha tuning code
     * better comment rmn hyperparams and add argparse
