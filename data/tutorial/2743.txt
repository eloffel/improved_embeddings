about

   cherrypicker is a coreference resolution tool that implements our
   recently-developed cluster-ranking model as well as two existing
   learning-based coreference models (the mention-pair model and the
   mention-ranking model). cluster rankers aim to address the major
   weaknesses of the widely-investigated mention-pair model, and have
   empirically been shown to surpass the performance of both the
   mention-pair model and the mention-ranking model by a large margin.
   since cluster rankers offer substantially higher precision than existng
   coreference models, we believe that they can be beneficially used in
   many high-level nlp applications.

   all coreference models included in cherrypicker employ linguistic
   features that are largely motivated by those described in the [6]ng &
   cardie acl 2002 paper, and were trained using [7]id166^light on the
   english portion of the [8]ace 2005 multilingual training corpus. since
   ace 2005 restricts coreference to noun phrases that belong to one of
   seven semantic classes (namely, person, organization, gpe
   (geo-political entity), facility, location, vehicle, and weapon), the
   resulting coreference models will generate coreference chains only for
   noun phrases belonging to these semantic classes.

   cherrypicker also includes a mention detector that was trained using
   [9]crf++ on the same training data to identify noun phrases that belong
   to these seven semantic classes, so there is no need for the user to
   provide noun phrases as input. for feature generation, cherrypicker
   relies on the following nlp tools:
        1. [10]the stanford log-linear part-of-speech tagger
        2. [11]the stanford named entity recognizer (ner)
        3. [12]the charniak statistical syntactic parser
        4. [13]the minipar parser

   all these software tools, as well as id166^light and crf++, are included
   as part of our software package. cherrypicker only assumes as input a
   text that is sentence-delimited, with one sentence per line, and
   produces coreference chains in the [14]muc format. see the readme file
   for details.

   cherrypicker may be freely downloaded and used for all educational and
   research activities, but may not be used for commerical or for-profit
   purposes. please acknowledge your use of the software by citing the
   following paper, which contains the technical ideas behind our
   cluster-ranking model:

requirements

   the current version of cherrypicker has only been tested on unix/linux
   machines. since some of the software tools on which it relies run on
   unix/linux machines only, we do not expect cherrypicker to be able to
   run on other platforms. additional requirements are described in the
   readme file.

download

                   [18]download cherrypicker version 1.01

   as described in the readme file, a simple java command will run the
   tool. various options can be tweaked using arguments.

questions

   for instructions to run the tool please refer to readme file. please
   note that cherrypicker is provided "as-is": the software does not come
   with any warranty or guarantee of any kind and may not be further
