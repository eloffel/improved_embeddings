   we are an open community dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence
   by assembling teams of volunteer researchers around the world to work
   on problems curated by leaders of the field.

as a leading researcher, outsource your backlog of projects and promote
equality of opportunity in ai research:

     * submit research problems to the attention of the community.
     * provide light, high-level guidance and mentorship to the team of
       contributors working to solve the problem you submitted.
     * receive credit for your contributions to the research process.

as a research contributor, gain experience and have an impact:

     * explore our list of open problems, and pick one to work on.
     * join the team of contributors collaborating to solve it - entirely
       in the open.
     * gain machine learning expertise in contact with mentors and fellow
       contributors.
     * ship code and ideas that make a meaningful impact in the real
       world.
