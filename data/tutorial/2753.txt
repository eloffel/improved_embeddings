google's python class

   welcome to google's python class -- this is a free class for people
   with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn python.
   the class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code
   exercises to practice python coding. these materials are used within
   google to introduce python to people who have just a little programming
   experience. the first exercises work on basic python concepts like
   strings and lists, building up to the later exercises which are full
   programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections. the
   class is geared for people who have a little bit of programming
   experience in some language, enough to know what a "variable" or "if
   statement" is. beyond that, you do not need to be an expert programmer
   to use this material.

   to get started, the python sections are linked at the left --
   [31]python set up to get python installed on your machine, [32]python
   introduction for an introduction to the language, and then [33]python
   strings starts the coding material, leading to the first exercise. the
   end of each written section includes a link to the code exercise for
   that section's material. the lecture videos parallel the written
   materials, introducing python, then strings, then first exercises, and
   so on. at google, all this material makes up an intensive 2-day class,
   so the videos are organized as the day-1 and day-2 sections.

   this material was created by [34]nick parlante working in the engedu
   group at google. special thanks for the help from my google colleagues
   john cox, steve glassman, piotr kaminksi, and antoine picard. and
   finally thanks to google and my director maggie johnson for the
   enlightened generosity to put these materials out on the internet for
   free under the [35]creative commons attribution 2.5 license -- share
   and enjoy!
