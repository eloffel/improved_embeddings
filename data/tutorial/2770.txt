   pynlpl, pronounced as 'pineapple', is a python library for natural
   language processing. it contains various modules useful for common, and
   less common, nlp tasks. pynlpl can be used for basic tasks such as the
   extraction of id165s and frequency lists, and to build simple language
   model. there are also more complex data types and algorithms. mor

   pynlpl, pronounced as 'pineapple', is a python library for natural
   language processing. it contains various modules useful for common, and
   less common, nlp tasks. pynlpl can be used for basic tasks such as the
   extraction of id165s and frequency lists, and to build simple language
   model. there are also more complex data types and algorithms. moreover,
   there are parsers for file formats common in nlp (e.g.
   folia/giza/moses/arpa/timbl/cql). there are also clients to interface
   with various nlp specific servers. pynlpl most notably features a very
   extensive library for working with folia xml (format for linguistic
   annotatation).

   the library is a divided into several packages and modules. it works on
   python 2.7, as well as python 3.

   the following modules are available:
     * pynlpl.datatypes - extra datatypes (priority queues, patterns,
       tries)
     * pynlpl.evaluation - evaluation & experiment classes (parameter
       search, wrapped progressive sampling, class evaluation
       (precision/recall/f-score/auc), sampler, confusion matrix,
       multithreaded experiment pool)
     * pynlpl.formats.cgn - module for parsing cgn (corpus gesproken
       nederlands) part-of-speech tags
     * pynlpl.formats.folia - extensive library for reading and
       manipulating the documents in [97]folia format (format for
       linguistic annotation).
     * pynlpl.formats.fql - extensive library for the folia query language
       (fql), built on top of pynlpl.formats.folia. fql is currently
       documented [98]here.
     * pynlpl.formats.cql - parser for the corpus query language (cql), as
       also used by corpus workbench and sketch engine. contains a
       convertor to fql.
     * pynlpl.formats.giza - module for reading giza++ word alignment data
     * pynlpl.formats.moses - module for reading moses phrase-translation
       tables.
     * pynlpl.formats.sonar - largely obsolete module for pre-releases of
       the sonar corpus, use pynlpl.formats.folia instead.
     * pynlpl.formats.timbl - module for reading timbl output (consider
       using [99]python-timbl instead though)
     * pynlpl.lm.lm - module for simple language model and reader for arpa
       language model data as well (used by srilm).
     * pynlpl.search - various search algorithms (breadth-first,
       depth-first, beam-search, hill climbing, a star, various variants
       of each)
     * pynlpl.statistics - frequency lists, levenshtein, common statistics
       and id205 functions
     * pynlpl.textprocessors - simple tokeniser, id165 extraction

installation

   download and install the latest stable version directly from the python
   package index with pip install pynlpl (or pip3 for python 3 on most
   systems). for global installations prepend sudo.

   alternatively, clone this repository and run python setup.py install
   (or python3 setup.py install for python 3 on most system. prepend sudo
   for global installations.

   this software may also be found in the certain linux distributions,
   such as the latest versions as debian/ubuntu, as python-pynlpl and
   python3-pynlpl. pynlpl is also included in our [100]lamachine
   distribution.
