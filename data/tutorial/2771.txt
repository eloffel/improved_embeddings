about

   yalign is a tool for extracting parallel sentences from comparable
   corpora.

   [80]id151 relies on [81]parallel corpora
   (eg.. [82]europarl) for training translation models. however these
   corpora are limited and take time to create. yalign is designed to
   automate this process by finding sentences that are close translation
   matches from [83]comparable corpora. this opens up avenues for
   harvesting parallel corpora from sources like translated documents and
   the web.

installation

   yalign requires that you install [84]scikit-learn.

   after that you can install yalign from pypi via pip:
sudo pip install yalign

usage

   firstly we need to download and unpack the english to spanish model.
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machinalis/yalign/develop/data/models/0.1
/en-es.tar.gz
tar -xvzf en-es.tar.gz

   now we can use the yalign-align script along with the english to
   spanish model to align two web pages.
yalign-align en-es http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antiparticle http://es.wikipedia
.org/wiki/antipart%c3%adcula

   yalign is not limited to any one language pair. by creating your own
   models you can align any two languages. for more details on how to use
   yalign and on yalign's implementation please [85]read the docs.
