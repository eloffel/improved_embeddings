some new interesting deep learning datasets for data scientists

   posted on [51]march 2, 2017march 14, 2018 author [52]muktabh mayank

   larger tagged datasets and more available computing power is what has
   triggered the recent ai revolution. in this article, i have listed some
   of the very enthralling deep learning datasets i found recently for
   data scientists.

[53]emnist: an extension of mnist to handwritten letters

   m
   mnist is one of the very popular datasets for people getting started
   with deep learning in particular and machine learning on images in
   general. mnist has images of digits which are to be mapped to the
   digits themselves. emnist extends this to images of letters as well.
   the dataset can be downloaded [54]here . there is an alternative
   dataset we discovered as well on reddit. it   s called [55]hasyv2 and can
   be downloaded [56]here

   link 1

[57]hico & hico-det

   link 2
   hico has images containing multiple objects and these objects have been
   tagged along with their relationships. the proposed problem is for
   algorithms to be able to dig out objects in an image and relationship
   between them after being trained on this dataset. i expect multiple
   papers to come out of this dataset in future.

[58]clevr: a diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary
visual reasoning

   clevr
   clevr is an attempt by fei-fei li   s group, the same scientist who
   developed the revolutionary id163 dataset. it has objects and
   questions asked about those objects along with their answers specified
   by humans. the aim of the project is to develop machines with common
   sense about what they see. so for example, the machine should be able
   to find    an odd one out    in an image automatically. you can download
   the dataset [59]here.

[60]holstep: a machine learning dataset for higher-order [61]logic theorem
proving

   link 4
   this dataset is tagged in a way so that algorithms trained on it can be
   used for automatic theorem proving . the download link is [62]here.

[63]the parallel meaning bank: towards a multilingual corpus of translations
annotated with compositional meaning representations

   link 5
   the parallel meaning bank (pmb), developed at the university of
   groningen, comprises sentences and texts in raw and tokenised format,
   tags for part of speech, named entities and lexical categories, and
   formal meaning representations. the download link is [64]here

[65]jfleg: a fluency corpus and benchmark for grammatical error correction

   jfleg dataset is an aim to tag sentences with nominal grammatical
   corrections and smart grammatical corrections. this dataset aims to
   build machines that can correct grammar automatically for people making
   mistakes. the dataset can be downloaded [66]here.

[67]introducing vqa v2.0: a more balanced and bigger vqa dataset!

   this dataset has images, questions asked on them and their answers
   tagged. the aim is to train machines to answer questions asked about
   images (and in continuation about the real world they are seeing).
   visual qa is an old dataset but its 2.0 version came out just this
   december.

   link 6

[68]google cloud & youtube-8m video understanding challenge

   link 8
   probably the largest dataset available for training in the open. this
   is a dataset of 8 million youtube videos tagged with the objects within
   them. there is also a running kaggle competition on the dataset with a
   bounty of 1,00,000 dollars.

[69]data science bowl 2017

   front_page this turns out to be the largest bounty offered to crack a
   data science problem. there are prizes of $1 million to be grabbed by
   data scientists who can detect lung cancer using this dataset of tagges
   ct-scans.

[70]exoplanets dataset

   link 9
   today, a team that includes mit and is led by the carnegie institution
   for science has released the largest collection of observations made
   with a technique called radial velocity, to be used for hunting
   exoplanets. the dataset can be downloaded [71]here

[72]end-to-end interpretation of the french street name signs dataset

   link 10 this is a huge dataset of french street signs labeled with what
   they denote. the dataset is easily readable by everyone   s favorite
   tensorflow and can be downloaded [73]here

[74]a realistic dataset for the smart home device scheduling problem for
dcops

   an upcoming dataset for iot and ai interface. you can download it
   [75]here .

[76]repeval 2017 shared task

   from sam bowman   s team, the creators of the famous snli dataset, this
   dataset about understanding the meaning of the text is going to be out
   soon as a competition. the dataset is expected by 15th march. you can
   find it [77]here once it   s live.

[78]driver speed dataset

   a 200 gb huge dataset, which is aimed to calculate speed of moving
   vehicles. can be downloaded [79]here

   link 11

[80]similar questions dataset by quora

   this dataset is donated by quora, so that people can train algorithms
   to identify similar questions. just to be clear for a machine to say
      why is apple tasty ?     and    why are apple stocks trending?    is a very
   difficult thing. this is what the dataset aims the machine to
   recognize.

[81]nwpu-resisc45 remote sensing images dataset

   a huge dataset of remote sensing images covering a wide array of
   landscapes which can be seen through sattelites. potential technology
   that can be developed includes satellite surveys, monitoring, and
   surveillance. unfortunately, we are still waiting for the download link
   here.
   c57xqqvwcaeiiia

[82]recipe to create your own free datasets from the open web

   this is probably the most interesting of the datasets. this dataset has
   not been tagged by humans but by machines. also, the authors make
   things clear about what is to be done if we want to create a similar
   dataset from the millions of images which are already available on the
   web.

[83]the lip dataset

   this large-scale dataset focuses on the semantic understanding of a
   person. the download link for the dataset is [84]here

[85]wikireading data

   this dataset is a large-scale natural language understanding task and
   publicly-available dataset with 18 million instances. the downlaod link
   is [86]here

[87]muscima++

   muscima++ is a dataset of handwritten music notation for musical symbol
   detection. [88]here is the download link.

[89]descript (describing script structure)

   descript is a crowdsourced corpus of event sequence descriptions (esds)
   for different scenarios crowdsourced via amazon mechanical turk.
   [90]here is the download link.

[91]maluuba frames

   maluuba   s datasets are meant to encourage research in the filed of
   artificial intelligence. [92]here is the download link.

[93]the umcd dataset

   this is a collection of geo-referenced video sequences acquired at
   low-altitude for mosaicking and change detection purposes.

[94]stanford 2d-3d-semantics dataset (2d-3d-s)

   the 2d-3d-s dataset provides a variety of mutually registered
   modalities from 2d, 2.5d and 3d domains, with instance-level semantic
   and geometric annotations.

   wrapping up the deep learning datasets list for now, i will keep
   updating when i find some more interesting datasets.
