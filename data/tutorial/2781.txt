   a semantically annotated parallel corpus for english, german, dutch and
   italian!

   the parallel meaning bank (pmb), developed at the [11]university of
   groningen and building upon the [12]groningen meaning bank, comprises
   sentences and texts in raw and tokenised format, syntactic analysis,
   word senses, thematic roles, reference resolution, and formal meaning
   representations. the main objective of the pmb is to provide
   fine-grained meaning representations for words, sentences and texts.
   sentences are, in isolation, often ambiguous. in the pmb we aim to
   provide the most likely interpretation for a sentence, with a minimal
   use of underspecification.

                        [13][screenshot_explorer.png]

   the current (development) version of the pmb is accessible via the
   [14]pmb explorer. you are welcome to contribute to the pmb by providing
   corrections to existing linguistic annotations in a wiki-like
   environment. anyone can register via the [15]pmb explorer and check,
   improve, or discuss linguistic annotations. released data can be
   downloaded from the [16]data page.

   the pmb is developed at the [17]university of groningen as part of the
   nwo vici project "lost in translation -- found in meaning" (project
   number 277-89-003), led by johan bos (2015-2020). the [18]logo for the
   pmb was designed by [19]sara b  rcena and [20]valerio basile. on special
   occasions the pmb is decorated with special logos, for instance
   [21]this logo designed by [22]lasha abzianidze for introducing a
   special christmas feeling.
