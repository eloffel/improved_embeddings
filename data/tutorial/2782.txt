   first quora dataset release: question pairs
   [3]korn  l csernai

   authors: [4]shankar iyer, [5]nikhil dandekar, and [6]korn  l csernai

   today, we are excited to announce the first in what we plan to be a
   series of public dataset releases. our dataset releases will be
   oriented around various problems of relevance to quora and will give
   researchers in diverse areas such as machine learning, natural language
   processing, network science, etc. the opportunity to try their hand at
   some of the challenges that arise in building a scalable online
   knowledge-sharing platform. our first dataset is related to the problem
   of identifying duplicate questions.

   an important product principle for quora is that there should be a
   single question page for each logically distinct question. as a simple
   example, the queries    what is the most populous state in the usa?    and
      which state in the united states has the most people?    should not
   exist separately on quora because the intent behind both is identical.
   having a canonical page for each logically distinct query makes
   knowledge-sharing more efficient in many ways: for example, knowledge
   seekers can access all the answers to a question in a single location,
   and writers can reach a larger readership than if that audience was
   divided amongst several pages.

   to mitigate the inefficiencies of having duplicate question pages at
   scale, we need an automated way of detecting if pairs of question text
   actually correspond to semantically equivalent queries. this is a
   challenging problem in natural language processing and machine
   learning, and it is a problem for which we are always searching for a
   better solution.

   the dataset that we are releasing today will give anyone the
   opportunity to train and test models of semantic equivalence, based on
   actual quora data. we are eager to see how diverse approaches fare on
   this problem.

   our dataset consists of over 400,000 lines of potential question
   duplicate pairs. each line contains ids for each question in the pair,
   the full text for each question, and a binary value that indicates
   whether the line truly contains a duplicate pair. here are a few sample
   lines of the dataset:
   [main-qimg-6a8e91c6f6329e96360ab7b2a1ad3c8e]

   here are a few important things to keep in mind about this dataset:
     * our original sampling method returned an imbalanced dataset with
       many more true examples of duplicate pairs than non-duplicates.
       therefore, we supplemented the dataset with negative examples. one
       source of negative examples were pairs of    related questions   
       which, although pertaining to similar topics, are not truly
       semantically equivalent.
     * the distribution of questions in the dataset should not be taken to
       be representative of the distribution of questions asked on quora.
       this is, in part, because of the combination of sampling procedures
       and also due to some sanitization measures that have been applied
       to the final dataset (e.g., removal of questions with extremely
       long question details).
     * the ground-truth labels contain some amount of noise: they are not
       guaranteed to be perfect.

   we are hosting the dataset on s3, and it is subject to our [7]terms of
   service, allowing for non-commercial use. you can download the dataset
