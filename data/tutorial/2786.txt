   data set information:

   the dataset is in the form of a 11463 x 5812 matrix of word counts,
   containing 11463 words and 5811 nips conference papers (the first
   column contains the list of words). each column contains the number of
   times each word appears in the corresponding document. the names of the
   columns give information about each document and its timestamp in the
   following format: xyear_paperid.
   the matrix of word counts was obtained using the r package 'tm        to
   process the raw .txt files of the full text of the nips conference
   papers published between 1987 and 2015. the document-term matrix was
   constructed after id121, removal of stopwords and truncation of
   the vocabulary by only keeping words occurring more than 50 times.

   attribute information:

   column 1: 'x' (list of words)
   columns 2-5812: 'xyear_id' (timestamp and paper id)
