   sumpy: a python automatic text summarization library

   we currently have several baseline summarizers implemented:

   [x] lede

   [x] textrank

   [x] lexrank

   [x] centroid

   [x] id8 ngram evaluation

   and have plans to implement many more.

   todo:

   [ ] id8 skip-gram and lcs evaluation

   [ ] freqsum/sumbasic

   [ ] submodular optimization based summarizers

   [ ] lda/distributes sentence representation based summarizer

   [ ] dems

   [ ] ilp based summarizers

   [ ] collect topic signatures/important word lists

   sumpy contains several ready to use summarizers with sensible defaults.
   here is a simple example to get you started:
import sumpy

doc1 = "this is the text for document1. it is for explanatory purposes..."
doc2 = "this is another document text..."
doc3 = "and yet another document..."

inputs = [doc1, doc2, doc3]

print "lede summarizer:"
print sumpy.lede(inputs)

print "\ntextrank summarizer:"
print sumpy.textrank(inputs)

print "\ncentroid summarizer:"
print sumpy.centroid(inputs)
