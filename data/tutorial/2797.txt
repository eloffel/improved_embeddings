[33]intelligent machines

the extraordinary link between deep neural networks and the nature of the
universe

nobody understands why deep neural networks are so good at solving complex
problems. now physicists say the secret is buried in the laws of physics.

   in the last couple of years, deep learning techniques have transformed
   the world of artificial intelligence. one by one, the abilities and
   techniques that humans once imagined were uniquely our own have begun
   to fall to the onslaught of ever more powerful machines. deep neural
   networks are now better than humans at tasks such as face recognition
   and object recognition. they   ve mastered the ancient game of go and
   thrashed the best human players.

   but there is a problem. there is no mathematical reason why networks
   arranged in layers should be so good at these challenges.
   mathematicians are flummoxed. despite the huge success of deep neural
   networks, nobody is quite sure how they achieve their success.

   today that changes thanks to the work of henry lin at harvard
   university and max tegmark at mit. these guys say the reason why
   mathematicians have been so embarrassed is that the answer depends on
   the nature of the universe. in other words, the answer lies in the
   regime of physics rather than mathematics.

   first, let   s set up the problem using the example of classifying a
   megabit grayscale image to determine whether it shows a cat or a dog.

   such an image consists of a million pixels that can each take one of
   256 grayscale values. so in theory, there can be 256^1000000 possible
   images, and for each one it is necessary to compute whether it shows a
   cat or dog. and yet neural networks, with merely thousands or millions
   of parameters, somehow manage this classification task with ease.

   in the language of mathematics, neural networks work by approximating
   complex mathematical functions with simpler ones. when it comes to
   classifying images of cats and dogs, the neural network must implement
   a function that takes as an input a million grayscale pixels and
   outputs the id203 distribution of what it might represent.
   [deep-learning-image.png?sw=600&amp;cx=0&amp;cy=1&amp;cw=982&amp;ch=560
   ]

   the problem is that there are orders of magnitude more mathematical
   functions than possible networks to approximate them. and yet deep
   neural networks somehow get the right answer.

   now lin and tegmark say they   ve worked out why. the answer is that the
   universe is governed by a tiny subset of all possible functions. in
   other words, when the laws of physics are written down mathematically,
   they can all be described by functions that have a remarkable set of
   simple properties.

   so deep neural networks don   t have to approximate any possible
   mathematical function, only a tiny subset of them.

   to put this in perspective, consider the order of a polynomial
   function, which is the size of its highest exponent. so a quadratic
   equation like y=x^2 has order 2, the equation y=x^24 has order 24, and
   so on.

   obviously, the number of orders is infinite and yet only a tiny subset
   of polynomials appear in the laws of physics.    for reasons that are
   still not fully understood, our universe can be accurately described by
   polynomial hamiltonians of low order,    say lin and tegmark. typically,
   the polynomials that describe laws of physics have orders ranging from
   2 to 4.

   the laws of physics have other important properties. for example, they
   are usually symmetrical when it comes to rotation and translation.
   rotate a cat or dog through 360 degrees and it looks the same;
   translate it by 10 meters or 100 meters or a kilometer and it will look
   the same. that also simplifies the task of approximating the process of
   cat or dog recognition.

   these properties mean that neural networks do not need to approximate
   an infinitude of possible mathematical functions but only a tiny subset
   of the simplest ones.

   there is another property of the universe that neural networks exploit.
   this is the hierarchy of its structure.    elementary particles form
   atoms which in turn form molecules, cells, organisms, planets, solar
   systems, galaxies, etc.,    say lin and tegmark. and complex structures
   are often formed through a sequence of simpler steps.

   this is why the structure of neural networks is important too: the
   layers in these networks can approximate each step in the causal
   sequence.

   lin and tegmark give the example of the cosmic microwave background
   radiation, the echo of the big bang that permeates the universe. in
   recent years, various spacecraft have mapped this radiation in ever
   higher resolution. and of course, physicists have puzzled over why
   these maps take the form they do.

   tegmark and lin point out that whatever the reason, it is undoubtedly
   the result of a causal hierarchy.    a set of cosmological parameters
   (the density of dark matter, etc.) determines the power spectrum of
   density fluctuations in our universe, which in turn determines the
   pattern of cosmic microwave background radiation reaching us from our
   early universe, which gets combined with foreground radio noise from
   our galaxy to produce the frequency-dependent sky maps that are
   recorded by a satellite-based telescope,    they say.

   each of these causal layers contains progressively more data. there are
   only a handful of cosmological parameters but the maps and the noise
   they contain are made up of billions of numbers. the goal of physics is
   to analyze the big numbers in a way that reveals the smaller ones.

   and when phenomena have this hierarchical structure, neural networks
   make the process of analyzing it significantly easier.

      we have shown that the success of deep and cheap learning depends not
   only on mathematics but also on physics, which favors certain classes
   of exceptionally simple id203 distributions that deep learning is
   uniquely suited to model,    conclude lin and tegmark.

   that   s interesting and important work with significant implications.
   id158s are famously based on biological ones. so
   not only do lin and tegmark   s ideas explain why deep learning machines
   work so well, they also explain why human brains can make sense of the
   universe. evolution has somehow settled on a brain structure that is
   ideally suited to teasing apart the complexity of the universe.

   this work opens the way for significant progress in artificial
   intelligence. now that we finally understand why deep neural networks
   work so well, mathematicians can get to work exploring the specific
   mathematical properties that allow them to perform so well.
      strengthening the analytic understanding of deep learning may suggest
   ways of improving it,    say lin and tegmark.

   deep learning has taken giant strides in recent years. with this
   improved understanding, the rate of advancement is bound to accelerate.
