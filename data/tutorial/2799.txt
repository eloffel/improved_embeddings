   introduction
   [5][terrific-annot.png]

   the word soft may evoke positive connotations of warmth and cuddliness
   in many contexts, but calling a hockey player soft would be an insult.
   if you were to say something was terrific in the 1800s, this would
   probably imply that it was terrifying and awe-inspiring; today,
   terrific basically just implies that something is (pretty) good.

   a word's sentiment or connotation depends on the domain or context in
   which it is used. however, previous computational work in natural
   language processing largely ignores this issue, and focuses and
   building and deploying generic domain-general sentiment lexicons.

   socialsent is a collection of code and datasets for performing
   domain-specific id31. the socialsent code package
   contains the sentprop algorithm for inducing domain-specific sentiment
   lexicons from unlabeled text, as well as a number of baseline
   algorithms.

   we have also released domain-specific historical sentiment lexicons for
   150 years of english and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250
   "subreddit" communities from reddit.com. the historical lexicons reveal
   that more than 5% of sentiment-bearing words switched their polarity
   from 1850 to 2000, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how
   sentiment varies drastically between online communities.

   the paper [6]inducing domain-specific sentiment lexicons from unlabeled
   corpora details the sentprop algorithm and describes the lexicons we
   induced.

   getting started (code download)
   all the code is available [7]on github

   domain-specific sentiment lexicons for download

   1.   community-specific sentiment lexicons for the 250 largest
   subreddit communities from [8]reddit.com

   community-specific lexicons are [9]available here. each lexicon
   contains sentiment values for the top-5000 non-stop words in each
   community (there may be less than 5000 after removing the stop-words,
   however). the lexicons were constructed using all public comment data
   from the year 2014. the included readme in the download file contains
   more info.

   2.   historical sentiment lexicons for the last 150 years of english
   (by decade)

   we provide two varieties of historical sentiment lexicons:
     * [10]sentiment scores for frequent words (the top-5000 non-stop
       words in each decade from 1850-2000)
     * [11]sentiment scores for adjectives (all adjectives that occurred
       more than 100 times in the data, from 1850-2000)

   the included readmes in the download files contains more info. both the
   lexicons were constructed using the [12]corpus of historical american
   english.

   this data is made available under the [13]public domain dedication and
   license v1.0 whose full text can be found at:

   highlights

   1.   word sentiment varies drastically between online communities
   [16][twoxvssports-v2.png]

   word sentiment differs drastically between a community dedicated to
   sports (r/sports) and one dedicated to female perspectives and gender
   issues (r/twox). words like soft and animal have positive sentiment in
   r/twox but negative sentiment in r/sports, while the opposite holds for
   words like crazy and insane.

   2.   word sentiment varies dramatically over historical time-periods
   [17][pathetic-annot.png] [18][lean-annot.png]

   historical sentiment lexicons reveal how words have changed in their
   connotation over time. [19]our analysis shows that around 5% of
   sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) words switched polarity between 1850
   and 2000. for example, we found that
    a. pathetic became more negative. it used to be similar in meaning to
       passionate but gained connotations of "weakness" over time.
    b. lean became more positive. it used to be associated with "weakness"
       or "frailty", but over time it become more associated with
       "fitness" and "muscularity".

   semantic similarities computed using word vector embeddings were used
   to contextualize these shifts (e.g., showing that pathetic became more
   semantically similar to weak).
