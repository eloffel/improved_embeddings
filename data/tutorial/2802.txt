   thanks to [33]+richgillin for a pointer to a reddit page on datasets
   reddit [34]www.reddit.com/r/datasets/

   the top datasets for december 2013 include

   [35]nfl game metadata since 1980 (csv file). mapitout reddit user
   explains how to link the metadata with the results:
     * download the schedule and results as a csv from pro football
       reference for each season that you want (example:
       [36]www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2007/games.htm). add a
       year variable to each file.
     * stack up all the csv files into a single csv.
     * using the date variable and the year variable that you added,
       construct an id variable that looks like one in the metadata file:
       yyyymmdd0[home team abbreviation]. you'll probably need to look
       through the metadata to get all the team abbreviations, but they
       look pretty self-explanatory ("den" for denver, "dal" for dallas,
       etc.).
     * merge the results data onto the metadata by that id.

   [37]top 2.5 million posts. this is a dataset of the all-time top 1,000
   posts, from the top 2,500 subreddits by subscribers, pulled from reddit
   between august 15-20, 2013.
