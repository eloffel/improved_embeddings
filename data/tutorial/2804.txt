id104 (for nlp)

   developing new methods to solve scientific tasks is cool, but they
   usually require data. we researchers often find ourselves collecting
   data rather than trying to solve new problems. i've collected data for
   most of my papers, but never thought of it as an interesting blog post
   topic. recently, i attended [5]chris biemann's excellent id104
   course at [6]esslli 2016 (the 28th european summer school in logic,
   language and information), and was inspired to write about the topic.
   this blog post will be much less technical and much more high-level
   than the course, as my posts usually are. nevertheless, credit for many
   interesting insights on the topic goes to chris biemann.^[7]1
   who needs data anyway?
   so let's start from the beginning: what is this data and why do we need
   it? suppose that i'm working on automatic methods to recognize the
   semantic relation between words, e.g. i want my model to know that cat
   is a type of animal, and that wheel is a part of a car.
   at the very basic level, if i already developed such a method, i will
   want to check how well it does compared to humans. evaluation of my
   method requires annotated data, i.e. a set of word pairs and their
   corresponding true semantic relations, annotated by humans. this will
   be the "test set"; the human annotations are considered as "gold/true
   labels". my model will try to predict the semantic relation between
   each word-pair (without accessing the true labels). then, i will use
   some evaluation metric (e.g. precision, recall, f1 or accuracy) to see
   how well my model predicted the human annotations. for instance, my
   model would have 80% accuracy if for 80% of the word-pairs it predicted
   the same relation as the human annotators.

                                     [8][dataset_example.png]
    figure 1: an example of dataset entries for recognizing the semantic
                           relation between words.

   if that was the only data i needed, i would have been lucky. you don't
   need that many examples to test your method. therefore, i could select
   some word-pairs (randomly or using some heuristics), and annotate them
   myself, or bribe my colleagues with cookies (as i successfully did
   twice). the problem starts when you need training data, i.e., when you
   want your model to learn to predict something based on labelled
   examples. that usually requires many more examples, and annotating data
   is a very tiring and sisyphean work.
   what should we do, then? outsource the annotation process -- i.e., pay
   with real money, not cookies!
   what is id104?
   the word id104 is a blend word composed of crowd
   (intelligence) + (out-)sourcing [1]. the idea is to take a task that
   can be performed by experts (e.g. translating a document from english
   to spanish), and outsource it to a large crowd of non-experts (workers)
   that can perform it.
   the requester defines the task, and the workers work on it. the
   requester than decides whether to accept/reject the work and pays the
   workers (in case of acceptance).
   the benefits of using "regular" people rather than experts are:
    1. you pay them much less than experts - typically a few cents per
       question (/task). (e.g., [2] found that in translation tasks, the
       crowd reached the same quality as the professionals, with less than
       12% of the costs).
    2. they are more easily available via id104 platforms (see
       below).
    3. by letting multiple people work on the task rather than a
       single/few experts, the task could be completed in a shorter time.

   the obvious observation is that the quality of a worker is not as good
   as the expert; in id104, it is not a single worker that
   replaces the expert, but the crowd. rather than trusting a single
   worker, you assign each task to a certain number of workers, and
   combine their results. a common practice is to use the majority voting.
   for instance, let's say that i ask 5 workers what is the semantic
   relation between cat and dog, giving them several options. 3 of them
   say that cat and dog are mutually exclusive words (e.g. one cannot be
   both a cat and a dog), one of them says that they are opposites, and
   one says that cat is a type of dog. the majority has voted in the favor
   of mutually exclusive, and this is what i will consider as the correct
   answer.^[9]2
   the main id104 platforms (out of many others) are [10]amazon
   mechanical turk and [11]crowdflower. in this blog post i will not
   discuss the technical details of these platforms. if you are interested
   in a comparison between the two, refer to [12]these slides from the
   naacl 2015 id104 tutorial.

                                        [13][annotation.png]
    figure 2: an example of a question in amazon mechanical turk, from my
                                  project.

   what can be crowdsourced?
   not every data we need to collect can be collected via id104;
   some data may require expert annotation, e.g. if we need to annotate
   the syntactic trees of sentences in natural language, that's probably a
   bad idea to ask non-experts to do so.
   the rules of thumb for crowdsourcability are:
     * the task is easy to explain, and you as a requester indeed explain
       it simply. they key idea is to keep it
       simple. the instructions should be short, i.e. do not expect
       workers to read a 50 page manual. they don't get paid enough for
       that. the instructions should include examples.
     * people can easily agree on the "correct" answer, e.g. "is there a
       cat in this image?" is good, "what is the meaning of life?" is
       really bad. everything else is borderline :) one thing to consider
       is the possible number of correct answers. for instance, if the
       worker should reply with a sentence (e.g. "describe the following
       image"), they can do so in so many ways. always aim one possible
       answer for a question.
     * each question is relatively small.
     * bonus: the task is fun. workers will do better if they enjoy the
       task. if you can think of a way to [14]gamify your task, do so!

                               [15][cat.jpg]
                   figure 3: is there a cat in this image?

   some tasks are borderline and may become suitable for id104 if
   presented in the right way to the workers. if the task at hand seems
   too complicated to be crowdsourced, ask yourself: can i break it into
   smaller tasks that can each be crowdsourced? for example, let workers
   write a sentence that describes an image, and accept all answers; then
   let other workers validate the sentences (ask them: does this sentence
   really describe this image?).
   some examples for (mostly language-related) data collected with
   id104
   (references omitted, but are available in the course slides in the link
   above).
     * checking whether a sentence is grammatical or not.
     * alignment of dictionary definitions - for instance, if a word has
       multiple meanings, and hence has multiple definitions in each
       dictionary - the task was to align the definitions corresponding to
       the same meaning in different dictionaries.
     * translation.
     * paraphrase collection - get multiple sentences with the same
       meaning. these were obtained by asking multiple workers to describe
       the same short video.
     * [16]duolingo started as a id104 project!
     * [17]and so did recaptcha!

   how to control for the quality of data?
   ok, so we collected a lot of data. how do we even know if it's good?
   can i trust my workers to do well on the task? could they be as good as
   experts? and what if they just want my money and are cheating on the
   task just to get easy money?
   there are many ways to control for the quality of workers:
    1. the id104 platforms provide some information about the
       workers, such as the number of tasks they completed in the past,
       their approval rate (% of their tasks that were approved),
       location, etc. you can define your requirements from the workers
       based on this information.
    2. don't trust a single worker -- define that your task should be
       answered by a certain number of workers (typically 5) and aggregate
       their answers (e.g. by majority voting).
    3. create control questions - a few questions for which you know the
       correct answer. these questions are displayed to the worker just
       like any other questions. if a worker fails to answer too many
       control questions, the worker is either not good or trying to cheat
       you. don't use this worker's answers (and don't let the worker
       participate in the task anymore; either by rejecting their work or
       by blocking them).^[18]3
    4. create a qualification test - a few questions for which you know
       the correct answer. you can require that any worker who wants to
       work on your task must take the test and pass it. as opposed to the
       control questions, the test questions don't have to be identical in
       format to the task itself, but should predict the worker's ability
       to perform the task well.
    5. second-pass reviewing - create another task in which workers
       validate previous workers' answers.
    6. bonus the good workers - they will want to keep working for you.
    7. watch out for spammers! some workers are only after your money, and
       they don't take your task seriously, e.g. they will click on the
       same answer for all questions. there is no correlation between the
       number of questions workers answer and their quality, however, it
       is worth looking at the most productive workers: some of them may
       be very good (and you might want to give them bonuses), while some
       of them may be spammers.

   ethical issues in id104
   as a requester, you need to make sure you treat your workers properly.
   always remember that workers are first of all people. when you consider
   how much to pay or whether to reject a worker's work, think of the
   following:
     * many workers rely on id104 as their main income.
     * they have no job security.
     * rejection in some cases is unfair - even if the worker was bad in
       the task, they still spent time working (unless you are sure that
       they are cheating).
     * new workers do lower-paid work to build up their reputation, but
       underpaying is not fair and not ethical.
     * are you sure you explained the task well? maybe it is your fault if
       all the workers performed badly?

   the good news is that, from my little experience, paying well pays off
   for the requester too. if you pay enough (but not too much!), you get
   good workers that want to do the task well. when you underpay, the good
   workers don't want to work on your task - they can get better paying
   tasks. the time to complete the task will be longer. and if you are
   like me, the thought of underpaying your workers will keep you awake at
   night. so pay well :)^[19]4
   important take-outs for successful id104:
     * work in small batches. if you have 10,000 questions, don't publish
       all at once. try some, learn from your mistakes, correct them and
       publish another batch. mistakes are bound to happen, and they might
       cost you good money!
     * use worker errors to improve instructions (remember: it might be
       your fault).
     * keep. it. simple.
     * use quality control mechanisms.
     * don't underpay!
     * always expect workers to be sloppy. repeat guidelines and questions
       and don't expect workers to remember them.
     * if your questions are automatically generated, use random order and
       try to balance the number of questions with each expected answer,
       otherwise workers will exploit this bias (e.g. if most word-pairs
       are unrelated, they will mark all of them as unrelated without
       looking twice).
     * make workers' lives easier, and they will perform better. for
       instance, if you have multiple questions regarding the same word,
       group them together.
     * if you find a way to make your task more fun, do so!

   [20]1 and i would also like to mention another wonderful
   [21]id104 tutorial that i attended last year at naacl 2015,
   which was given by chris callison-burch, lyle ungar, and ellie pavlick.
   unfortunately, at that time i had no personal experience with
   id104, nor believed that my university will ever have budget
   for that, therefore made no effort to remember the technical details; i
   was completely wrong. a year later i published a [22]paper about a
   dataset collected with id104, on which i even got a best paper
   award  :) ^[23]   
   [24]2 for more sophisticated aggregation methods that assign weights to
   workers based on their quality, see [25]mace. ^[26]   
   [27]3 blocking a worker means that they can't work on your tasks
   anymore. rejecting a worker means that they are not paid for the work
   they have already done. as far as i know, it is not recommended to
   reject a worker, because then they write bad things about you in
   [28]turker nation and nobody wants to work for you anymore. in
   addition, you should always give workers the benefit of the doubt;
   maybe you didn't explain the task well enough.[29]^   
   [30]4 so how much should you pay? first of all, not less than 2 cents.
   second, try to estimate how long a single question takes and aim an
   hourly pay of around 6 usds. for example, in [31]this paper i paid 5
   cents per question, which i've been told is the higher bound for such
   tasks.[32]^
