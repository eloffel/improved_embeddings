   [59]codalab overview video

why codalab worksheets?

   while there has been tremendous progress in machine learning, data
   science, natural language processing, id161, and many other
   data- and computation-intensive fields, the research process is far
   from optimal. most of the time, the output of research is simply a pdf
   file (published paper). even when people release their data and code
   (which is a big step forward), it is often not obvious how to run it to
   obtain the results in a paper. simply put:

     today, researchers spend excruciating amounts of time reproducing
     published results.

   the goal of codalab worksheets is to fix this in order to both
   accelerate the rate of research and make it more sound.

how does codalab worksheets work?

     codalab keeps the full provenance of an experiment, from raw data to
     the final performance numbers that you put in your paper.

   there are two important concepts in codalab: bundles and worksheets.

   bundles are immutable files/directories that represent the code, data,
   and results of an experimental pipeline. there are two ways to create
   bundles. first, users can upload bundles, datasets in any format or
   programs in any programming language. second, users can create run
   bundles by executing shell commands that depend on the contents of
   previous bundles. a run bundle is specified by a set of bundle
   dependencies and an arbitrary shell command. this shell command is
   executed in a [60]docker container in a directory with the
   dependencies. the contents of the run bundle are the files/directories
   which are written to the current directory by the shell command:
   [execution.png] above, each rounded rectangle represents a bundle, and
   arrows represent dependencies between bundles. there are two bundles
   which are uploaded by the user: the top left bundle is a single script
   id98.py containing the training code, and the top right bundle mnist
   contains the dataset. then there is a run bundle exp2, which depends on
   id98.py and mnist. codalab creates a [61]docker container and executes
   the shell command (bottom of box in green). running exp2 produces new
   files stdout, stderr, and stats.json, which form the contents of exp2.
   in summary, the dependency graph over bundles precisely captures the
   research process in an immutable way.

   worksheets organize and present an experimental pipeline in a
   comprehensible way, and can be used as a lab notebook, a tutorial, or
   an executable paper. worksheets contain references to bundles, and are
   written in a custom [62]markdown language.

   consider the following example: [worksheets-schema.png] at the center
   is the dependency graph over four bundles. on the side are two separate
   worksheets, which contain both text and pointers to various bundles.
   worksheet 1 might be alice's research log where she is running
   experiments, while worksheet 2 might be her collaborator bob, who uses
   the same dataset (0x1b) and runs an analysis comparing alice's results
   (0x19) with someone else's results (0xe1).

   codalab's philosophy is to give you full control of how you want to run
   your experiments and get out of your way. it just maintains the
   dependency structure of your experiments and takes care of the actual
   execution. a good analogy is git, which maintains the revision history
   and gives you total freedom in terms of what to put in your repository.

how do i learn more?

   the best place to start is to clone the [63]examples and tutorials
   repository and walk through the material there. the links below are
   good more for reference.
