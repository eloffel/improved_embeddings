   sponsored by siglex

international workshop on semantic evaluation 2017

   semeval (semantic evaluation) is an ongoing series of evaluations of
   computational semantic analysis systems, organized under the umbrella
   of siglex, the special interest group on the lexicon of the association
   for computational linguistics. semeval has evolved from the [8]senseval
   id51 evaluation series. the [9]semeval wikipedia
   entry and the [10]acl semeval wiki provide a more detailed historical
   overview. semeval-2017 will be the 11th workshop on semantic evaluation
   and will be collocated with the 55th annual meeting of the association
   for computational linguistics (acl). semeval will  be held in
   vancouver, canada, at the westin bayshore hotel august 3rd and 4th,
   2017.
