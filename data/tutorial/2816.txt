using breeze

building it yourself.

   this project can be built with sbt 0.13

sbt

   for sbt, add these lines to your sbt project definition:
     * for sbt versions 0.13.x or later

librarydependencies  ++= seq(
  // other dependencies here
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "0.11.2",
  // native libraries are not included by default. add this if you want them (as
 of 0.7)
  // native libraries greatly improve performance, but increase jar sizes.
  // it also packages various blas implementations, which have licenses that may
 or may not
  // be compatible with the apache license. no gpl code, as best i know.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "0.11.2",
  // the visualization library is distributed separately as well.
  // it depends on lgpl code.
    "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-viz" % "0.11.2"
)

resolvers ++= seq(
  // other resolvers here
  // if you want to use snapshot builds (currently 0.12-snapshot), use this.
  "sonatype snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapsho

scalaversion := "2.10.4"

   for more details on the optional breeze-natives module, please watch
   sam halliday's talk at scala exchange 2014 [91]high performance linear
   algebra in scala ([92]follow along with high-res slides).

maven

   maven looks like this:
<dependency>
  <groupid>org.scalanlp</groupid>
  <artifactid>breeze_2.10</artifactid> <!-- or 2.11 -->
  <version>0.10</version>
</dependency>

other build tools

   of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. the
   scalala parts are largely rewritten.
