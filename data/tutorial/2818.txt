neural module networks

   update 22 jun 2017: code for our end-to-end module network framework is
   available at [78]https://github.com/ronghanghu/n2nmn. the n2nmn code
   works better and is easier to set up. use it!

   this library provides code for training and evaluating neural module
   networks (nmns). an nmn is a neural network that is assembled
   dynamically by composing shallow network fragments called modules into
   a deeper structure. these modules are jointly trained to be freely
   composable. for a general overview to the framework, refer to:

     [79]neural module networks. jacob andreas, marcus rohrbach, trevor
     darrell and dan klein. cvpr 2016.

     [80]learning to compose neural networks for id53.
     jacob andreas, marcus rohrbach, trevor darrell and dan klein. naacl
     2016.

   at present the code supports predicting network layouts from
   natural-language strings, with end-to-end training of modules. various
   extensions should be straightforward to implement   alternative layout
   predictors, supervised training of specific modules, etc.

   please cite the cvpr paper for the general nmn framework, and the naacl
   paper for dynamic structure selection. feel free to email me at
   [81]jda@cs.berkeley.edu if you have questions. this code is released
   under the apache 2 license, provided in license.txt.

installing dependencies

   you will need to build my fork of the excellent [82]apollocaffe
   library. this fork may be found at [83]jacobandreas/apollocaffe, and
   provides support for a few caffe layers that haven't made it into the
   main apollo repository. ordinary caffe users: note that you will have
   to install the runcython python module in addition to the usual caffe
   dependencies.

   one this is done, update apollo_root at the top of run.sh to point to
   your apollocaffe installation.

   you will also need to install the following packages:
colorlogs, sexpdata

downloading data

   all experiment data should be placed in the data directory.

vqa

   in data, create a subdirectory named vqa. follow the [84]vqa setup
   instructions to install the data into this directory. (it should have
   children annotations, images, etc.)

   we have modified the structure of the vqa images directory slightly.
   images should have two subdirectories, raw and conv. raw contains the
   original vqa images, while conv contains the result of preprocessing
   these images with a [85]16-layer vggnet as described in the paper.
   every file in the conv directory should be of the form
   coco_{setname}_{imageid}.jpg.npz, and contain a 512x14x14 image map in
   zipped numpy format. here's a [86]gist with the code i use for doing
   the extraction.

geoqa

   download the geoqa dataset from the [87]lsp website, and unpack it into
   data/geo.

parsing questions

   every dataset fold should contain a file of parsed questions, one per
   line, formatted as s-expressions. if multiple parses are provided, they
   should be semicolon-delimited. as an example, for the question "is the
   train modern" we might have:
(is modern);(is train);(is (and modern train))

   for vqa, these files should be named
   questions/{train2014,val2014,...}.sps2. for geoqa, they should be named
   environments/{fl,ga,...}/training.sps. parses used in our papers are
   provided in extra and should be installed in the appropriate location.
   the vqa parser script is also located under extra/vqa; instructions for
   running are provided in the body of the script.

running experiments

   you will first need to create directories vis and logs (which
   respectively store run logs and visualization code)

   different experiments can be run by providing an appropriate
   configuration file on the command line (see the last line of run.sh).
   examples for vqa and geoqa are provided in the config directory.

   looking for shapes? i haven't finished integrating it with the rest of
   the codebase, but check out the shapes branch of this repository for
   data and code.
