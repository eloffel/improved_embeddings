  "phrases in english" (pie) and the british national corpus

   the [29]british national corpus (bnc) is a carefully-selected
   collection of 4124 contemporary written and spoken english texts,
   primarily from the united kingdom.  the corpus totals over 100 million
   words and [30]covers a representative range of domains, genres and
   registers. the entire corpus has been analyzed and marked up with
   [31]part of speech (pos) tags. provenance and other attributes are
   carefully documented for each text. "[32]what is the bnc?" provides a
   succinct overview of the corpus;  for an exhaustive description,
   consult the [33]british national corpus users reference guide.
   [34]chapter 1 of guy aston and lou burnard's bnc handbook includes an
   informative survey of possible uses of corpora in general and of the
   bnc in particular.  additional useful information and resources
   (including various frequency lists with more refined id52) are
   found on the [35]companion website for [36]word frequencies in written
   and spoken english based on the british national corpus by geoffrey
   leech, paul rayson and andrew wilson.  the introduction includes a very
   readable discussion of how the corpus was tokenized and tagged.

   pie incorporates a database derived from the second or world edition of
   the bnc (2000), but is not affiliated with the bnc consortium. it aims
   to provide a simple yet powerful interface for studying words and
   phrases up to eight words long appropriate for both experienced
   researchers and novice users.  for investigating words in longer
   contexts, the full bnc corpus and xaira search and analysis software is
   available on cd-rom from the [37]bnc consortium (a single user license
   costs only    75).  alternatively, one can [38]look up individual words
   and phrases online.

   to understand and interpret the datasets produced here and to compare
   them to results of direct queries to bnc, please [39]read how and why
   the original data were normalized to build the pie database.

  what can pie do?

   explore the distribution of words and phrases in english via various
   query interfaces:
     * [40]id165s are sequences of n words, where n falls in the range
       1-8, and word means a token of any lexical entity assigned a pos
       tag by the claws parser ([41]details). for example, the most
       frequent 1-gram in the bnc data is the, and the end of the tops the
       list of 4-grams.
     * [42]phrase-frames are sets of variants of an id165 identical
       except for one word, represented here by the wildcard symbol *. the
       most frequent (and most productive, i.e. having the greatest number
       of variants) 4-frame is the * of the, with 5652 variants such as
       the end of the, the rest of the, the top of the, the nature of the
       etc.
     * [43]pos-grams are patterns of part of speech tags assigned to word
       forms without reference to the specific lexical entities.  when
       ordered by types, the most frequent "3-pos-gram" is art adj noun,
       e.g. the other hand.  on the other hand, when ordered by tokens,
       the 3-pos-gram prep art noun as in at the end are more frequent.
     * [44]char-grams are sequences of n letters.  their distribution can
       be studied by position (initial, medial, final) as well as by
       frequency in tokens or types.  unsurprisingly, the is the most
       frequent 3-char-gram by tokens (8,222,751 tokens, 1007 types), but
       ing has the most distinct types (2,991,683 tokens, 9416 types).

   each query returns datasets in "chunks" of up to 100,000 items, and
   queries can be repeated until all matching data have been retrieved.
   results can be ordered alphabetically, by frequency or by pos tag. for
   focused studies, users can "filter" results for specific word-forms and
   / or word-classes which a query must match or exclude.  all query
   interfaces offer full support for wildcards.  a click on any phrase
   brings up example concordances from the bnc.  details are found in the
   [45]tutorials.

   sample uses of filters include searches for... click description to
   show actual query
     * 3-grams of the pattern determiner adjective noun

   [46]advanced search
   > [adv1.gif]
   > word fields are left blank to match any word-form. [47]simple search
   > [simple1.gif] simple search requires + as a "wildword" symbol to
   match any word-form.
     * 2-grams of the pattern adjective plus the noun student

   [48]advanced search
   > [adv2.gif] [49]simple search
   > [simple2.gif]
     * 4-frames which do not start with determiners and in which the
       second word is a "wildword"
       [50]phrase-frame search
       > [pframe3.gif]
       check "exclude" to match tags / word-forms except those entered.
     * 2-grams which start with any form of the verb organise / organize
       [51]advanced search
       > [adv4.gif]
       separate alternate forms with a space. wildcard * matches any verb
       ending. pos filter eliminates nouns, adjectives etc.

   this site also supports querying with id157 and
   downloading an entire dataset matching a query in tabbed format for
   import into a database. ultimately tools developed for [52]kwicfinder
   and [53]kfngram will permit browsing and analysis of the datasets via a
   graphical user interface on the pc. slight modifications to [54]data
   id172 conventions may result in minor discrepancies in
   frequencies reported for the two versions of the database. major
   changes to this site will be announced on the [55]corpora, [56]linguist
   and [57]corpus linguistics and language teaching lists.

  acknowledgements

   first and foremost* this site owes its very existence to the monumental
   achievement of the bnc development team. after months of reading and
   re-reading every bit of documentation and rooting around in the
   sgml-encoded data i have profound respect and gratitude for their
   efforts and accomplishments. we all look forward to future updates to
   the corpus. [*[58]234 occurrences in the bnc ]

   as site developer i also gratefully acknowledge my debt to michael
   stubbs of the university of trier for fruitful e-mail discussions that
   led to the creation and refinement of this database and web site. it
   was stubbs who generously suggested that i add support for
   "phrase-frames" to [59]kfngram. this concept originated with his
   research assistant isabel barth, who also implemented the original
   phrase-frame generator. their collaboration led to the insightful paper
   "using recurrent phrases as text-type discriminators: a quantitative
   method and some findings" (functions of language (10, 1, 2003).
   [60]kfngram was originally developed for a [61]comparative study of a
   corpus i compiled from the web with data from the bnc. when i remarked
   that generating lists of all the id165s and phrase-frames in the bnc
   would really test the limits of [62]kfngram, stubbs encouraged me to do
   it and suggested breaking the lists down further by domain and genre.
   the goal has evolved from a collection of overwhelmingly large static
   lists into databases which produce manageable datasets tailored to the
   user's research needs. four of stubbs' works available online survey
   and illustrate core concepts and point the way to exploring words and
   phrases:
     * "[63]on very frequent phrases in english:  distributions, functions
       and structures". plenary address, icame 25 (international computer
       archive for modern and medieval english), verona, italy, 19-23 may
       2004
     * "[64]conrad, concordance, collocation: heart of darkness or light
       at the end of the tunnel?", the third sinclair open lecture (2003).
     * "[65]words in use: introductory examples", chapter 1 of words and
       phrases: corpus studies in lexical semantics (blackwell, 2001)
     * "[66]using very large text collections to study semantic schemas"
       (2000)

   finally i am indebted to david lee for permission to incorporate
   portions of his spreadsheet [67]bnc index for the bnc world edition in
   the database. users are encouraged to consult his thorough discussion
   of the issues of classification by "text type" in: lee, david y. w.
   2001. [68]genres, registers, text types, domains and styles: clarifying
   the concepts and navigating a path through the bnc jungle. language
   learning & technology, vol.5(3): 37-72.
