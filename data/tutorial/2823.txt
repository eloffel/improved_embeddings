introduction

   the mirflickr-25000 open evaluation project consists of 25000 images
   downloaded from the social photography site [27]flickr through its
   public [28]api coupled with complete manual annotations, pre-computed
   descriptors and software for bag-of-words based similarity and
   classification and a matlab-like tool for exploring and classifying
   imagery.

   we are doing our best to make sure that mirflickr will be:
     * open
       access to the collection is simple and reliable, with image
       copyright clearly established. this is realized by selecting only
       images offered under the [29]creative commons license. see the
       [30]copyright section below.
     * interesting
       images are also selected based on their high [31]interestingness
       rating. as a result the image collection is representative for the
       domain of original and high-quality photography.
     * practical
       in particular for the research community dedicated to improving
       id162. we have collected the user-supplied image
       [32]flickr tags as well as the [33]exif metadata and make it
       available in easy-to-access text files. additionally we provide
       manual image [34]annotations on the entire collection suitable for
       a variety of benchmarks.

   mirflickr-25000 is an evolving effort with many ideas for extension. so
   far the image collection, metadata, annotations, descriptors and
   software can be downloaded below. if you enter your email address
   before downloading, we will keep you posted of the latest updates.

copyright and licenses

   although most images on flickr are published with all rights reserved,
   there is also a large number of images offered under [35]creative
   commons copyright licenses. the creative commons attribution licenses
   allow for image use as long as the photographer is credited for the
   original creation. possibly, use is granted under [36]additional
   restrictions, but none of these preclude the use of the images for
   benchmarking purposes.

   while compiling the mirflickr-25000 collection we have made sure only
   creative commons images were included and took care to collect as much
   information possible about the creators of the image. the creator
   information as well as the exact license type and image title are
   collected in image license metafiles, which are distributed together
   with the images.

   we would like to take the opportunity here to express our gratitude to
   the image photographers for allowing us to use their pictures: we
   greatly appreciate this and gladly acknowledge your work. your names
   and license details are also listed in this [37]credit document. please
   let us know if you have special wishes on how you would like to be
   credited or have additional details that must be incorporated.

flickr tags

   one of the great attractions of flickr is the platform it offers its
   users to search and share their pictures based on image tags. we also
   supply these image tags in two forms: the raw form in which they are
   obtained from the users and in processed form with raw data cleaned up
   (a bit) by flickr.

   for retrieval research we are mainly interested in concrete visual
   concepts. the most common tags of this type are listed below (colors,
   seasons and place names were left out):

                [table with most common concrete flickr tags]

   the average number of tags per image is 8.94. in the collection there
   are 1386 tags which occur in at least 20 images. most tags are in
   english, but foreign terms occur as well.

exif

   [38]exif (exchangable image file format) metadata represents a number
   of properties and settings of the digital camera at the time of taking
   a picture. this includes information on:
     * the camera itself: brand, manufacturer, ...
     * camera settings: exposure, aperture, focal length, iso speed,
       metering mode, ...
     * image settings: orientation, resolution, compression, ...
     * time, date (and location)

   flickr separates the exif data from the images: the information is no
   longer embedded in the image files! for about 85% of the images in the
   collection, exif data are available and permission is granted by the
   creator to access this data through the api. for these images we have
   collected the data (with exception of binary data such as for
   thumbnails) and made them available in plain text files. note that even
   when exif data was collected, not all fields are always present. the
   table below shows the possession for a number of common fields.

                  [table with exif field possession rates]

   exif geolocation fields are particularly scarce and are available for
   only 152 images.

annotations

   the annotation scheme has been set up in a way to make it easy to
   extend it with new keywords without having to go through all 25000
   images again. this is possible by stepwise refinement along two
   dimensions:
    1. relevance level: from possibly relevant to actually relevant
       we first annotate concepts or topics by interpreting them in a very
       wide sense. for an image to receive a label, the concept does not
       need to appear prominently; as long as it visible or applicable at
       least to some extent, this is already sufficient. we call the
       labels resulting from this level of annotation potential labels.
       these labels should capture all images that could possibly apply to
       the concept in real searches. in this way they can act as a sort of
       greatest common denominator for the concept, with the goal of
       making subsequent annotation of more narrow interpretations a lot
       faster.
       next, using the potential labels, we annotate the images with
       relevant labels. these are annotations for a specific
       interpretation of a concept by a single annotator. a label is
       supplied only if the annotator found the image really relevant to
       his interpretation. our goal is to supply several of such
       annotations for each concept. note that so far however, most
       concepts only have single interpretations each: one where the
       concept/topic is "salient" to the annotator in a general sense.
    2. abstraction level: from general to specific categories
       we have first annotated the image collection with labels for the
       general topics listed in the table below. these topics were chosen
       in such a way that they cover a lot of interesting topics as proper
       subtopics. to annotate such subtopics we only have to consider
       images that have a potential label for the more general topic.

extension

   the mir flickr collection has been extended in two ways. first, the
   number of images has been extended to 1 million images. second, we now
   supply a number of content-based visual descriptors for the entire new
   set of images.

   the new images are obtained in the same way as the original images. all
   images are made available under a creative commons attribution licence.
   to obtain high quality photography, the images are also selected based
   on their flickr interestingness score. note that the new images are not
   manually annotated like the core set of 25000 images, but all original
   flickr user tag data, as well as the exif metadata, are again made
   available.

   the content-based visual descriptors that are supplied for the new
   images are the mpeg-7 edge histogram and homogeneous texture
   descriptors, and the [42]isis group color descriptors.

   all original images are made available through bittorrent. since, for
   many, the full collection may prove too large to download, we also
   provide 64x64 pixel jpeg-thumbnails. for further details, see the
   [43]download page.(has both 25k and 1m)

   the extension is described in:
