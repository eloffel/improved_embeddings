   published on sep 6, 2016

   over the last few years, rapid progress in ai have enabled our
   smartphones, social networks, and search engines to understand our
   voice, recognize our faces, and identifiy objects in our photos with
   very good accuracy. these improvements are due in large part to the
   emergence of a new class of machine learning methods known as deep
   learning. a particular type of deep learning system called
   convolutional network (convnet) has been particularly successful for
   image and id103.
   but we are still quite far from emulating the learning abilities of
   animal of humans. a key element we are missing is predictive (or
   unsupervised) learning: the ability of a machine to model the
   environment, predict possible futures and understand how the world
   works by observing it and acting in it, a very active topic of research
   at the moment.
   yann lecun,
   facebook ai research & new york university.
   ---
   yann lecun is director of ai research at facebook, and silver professor
   of dara science, computer science, neural science, and electrical
   engineering at new york university, affiliated with the nyu center for
   data science, the courant institute of mathematical science, the center
   for neural science, and the electrical and computer engineering
   department.
   he received the electrical engineer diploma from ecole superieure
   d'ingenieurs en electrotechnique et electronique (esiee), paris in
   1983, and a phd in computer science from universite pierre et marie
   curie (paris) in 1987. after a postdoc at the university of toronto, he
   joined at&t bell laboratories in holmdel, nj in 1988. he became head of
   the image processing research department at at&t labs-research in 1996,
   and joined nyu as a professor in 2003, after a brief period as a fellow
   of the nec research institute in princeton. from 2012 to 2014 he
   directed nyu's initiative in data science and became the founding
   director of the nyu center for data science. he was named director of
   ai research at facebook in late 2013 and retains a part-time position
   on the nyu faculty.
   his current interests include ai, machine learning, computer
   perception, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. he has
   published over 180 technical papers and book chapters on these topics
   as well as on neural networks, handwriting recognition, image
   processing and compression, and on dedicated circuits and architectures
   for computer perception. the character recognition technology he
   developed at bell labs is used by several banks around the world to
   read checks and was reading between 10 and 20% of all the checks in the
   us in the early 2000s. his image compression technology, called djvu,
   is used by hundreds of web sites and publishers and millions of users
   to access scanned documents on the web. since the late 80's he has been
   working on deep learning methods, particularly the convolutional
   network model, which is the basis of many products and services
   deployed by companies such as facebook, google, microsoft, baidu, ibm,
   nec, at&t and others for image and video understanding, document
   recognition, human-computer interaction, and id103.
   lecun has been on the editorial board of ijcv, ieee pami, and ieee
   trans. neural networks, was program chair of cvpr'06, and is chair of
   iclr 2013 and 2014. he is on the science advisory board of institute
   for pure and applied mathematics, and has advised many large and small
   companies about machine learning technology, including several startups
   he co-founded. he is the lead faculty at nyu for the moore-sloan data
   science environment, a $36m initiative in collaboration with uc
   berkeley and university of washington to develop data-driven methods in
   the sciences. he is the recipient of the 2014 ieee neural network
   pioneer award.
