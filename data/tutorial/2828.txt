   [100]genetic programming in python, with a scikit-learn inspired api

welcome to gplearn!

   gplearn implements genetic programming in python, with a
   [101]scikit-learn inspired and compatible api.

   while genetic programming (gp) can be used to perform a [102]very wide
   variety of tasks, gplearn is purposefully constrained to solving
   symbolic regression problems. this is motivated by the scikit-learn
   ethos, of having powerful estimators that are straight-forward to
   implement.

   symbolic regression is a machine learning technique that aims to
   identify an underlying mathematical expression that best describes a
   relationship. it begins by building a population of naive random
   formulas to represent a relationship between known independent
   variables and their dependent variable targets in order to predict new
   data. each successive generation of programs is then evolved from the
   one that came before it by selecting the fittest individuals from the
   population to undergo genetic operations.

   gplearn retains the familiar scikit-learn fit/predict api and works
   with the existing scikit-learn [103]pipeline and [104]grid search
   modules. the package attempts to squeeze a lot of functionality into a
   scikit-learn-style api. while there are a lot of parameters to tweak,
   [105]reading the documentation should make the more relevant ones clear
   for your problem.

   gplearn currently supports regression through the symbolicregressor as
   well as transformation for automated feature engineering with the
   symbolictransformer, which is designed to support regression problems,
   but should also work for binary classification. future versions of the
   package will expand this class to support more complicated multi-target
   classification problems, and much more is planned too.

   gplearn is built on scikit-learn and a fairly recent copy (0.18.1+) is
   required for [106]installation. if you come across any issues in
   running or installing the package, [107]please submit a bug report.

   i hope you get some excellent results from using gplearn! if you do,
   please [108]drop me a line on my blog about how you used it.
