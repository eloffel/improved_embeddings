[5]a cuda implementation of the id116 id91 algorithm

   05 mar 2019

   this blog post will cover a [6]cuda c implementation of the id116
   id91 algorithm. id116 id91 is a hard id91 algorithm
   which means that each datapoint is assigned to one cluster (rather than
   multiple clusters with different probabilities). the algorithm starts
   with random cluster assignments and iterates between two steps

[7]implementing the distbelief deep neural network training framework with
akka

   presently, most deep neural networks are trained using gpus due to the
   enormous number of parallel computations that they can perform. without
   the speed-ups provided by gpus, deep neural networks could take days or
   even weeks to train on a single machine. however, using gpus can be
   prohitive for several reasons

[8]id97 tutorial part ii: the continuous bag-of-words model

   18 may 2015

   in the [9]previous post the concept of word vectors was explained as
   was the derivation of the skip-gram model. in this post we will explore
   the other id97 model - the continuous bag-of-words (cbow) model. if
   you understand the skip-gram model then the cbow model should be quite
   straight-forward because in many ways they are mirror images of each
   other. for instance, if you look at the model diagram

[10]id97 tutorial part i: the skip-gram model

   in many natural language processing tasks, words are often represented
   by their tf-idf scores. while these scores give us some idea of a
   word   s relative importance in a document, they do not give us any
   insight into its semantic meaning. id97 is the name given to a
   class of neural network models that, given an unlabelled training
   corpus, produce a vector for each word in the corpus that encodes its
   semantic information. these vectors are usefull for two main reasons.
