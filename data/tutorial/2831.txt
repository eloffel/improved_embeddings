setup guide

   pre-requisites: git, python 2.7.x, virtualenv, pip (7.1.x recommended)
     * if you're using ubuntu, here are all the packages you'll need
       before you can proceed
$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-dev build-essential curl libatlas-base-d
ev gfortran
$ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev

     * clone the repo from github
$ git clone https://github.com/rouseguy/intro2deeplearning.git
$ cd intro2deeplearning

     * create python virtual environment
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate

     * install requirements using pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

       use requirements_linux.txt instead of requirements.txt if you're on
       linux
     * when the requirements are being downloaded / installed, fetch the
       datasets simultaneously
$ sh download_data.sh

     * run check_env.py script to test the dependencies
$ python check_env.py

       output should look like this
[ ok ] scipy version 0.15.1
[ ok ] pil version 1.1.7
[ ok ] keras
[ ok ] ipython version 4.0.0
[ ok ] theano version 0.7.0
[ ok ] numpy version 1.9.2
[ ok ] pandas version 0.16.2
[ ok ] gensim version 0.10.3
[ ok ] sklearn version 0.16.1

       this means you have all the dependencies installed and you're ready
       to start.
     * run the notebook
$ cd notebooks
$ ipython notebook

       this opens your default browser which displays the list of
       notebooks in the current directory.
       open 1. introduction to id158s.ipynb. now, run
       the first cell with imports in the notebook (shift + enter). if you
       have all the dependencies installed, this should run without any
       errors.

   note: we only support ubuntu linux (tested) & osx environments. we
   strongly recommend windows users to have a vm running linux, and then
   install these requirements on that vm.
