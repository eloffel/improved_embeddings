   top deep learning papers on arxiv are presented, summarized, and
   explained with the help of a leading researcher in the field.

   deep learning
   [38]arxiv, maintained by cornell university, is a popular open access
   academic paper preprint repository. it is an outlet for cutting edge
   research in numerous scientific fields, including machine learning.
   mirroring the current general trend in academia, much of the recent
   posted machine learning research is deep learning related.
   [39]hugo larochelle, phd, is a universit   de sherbrooke machine
   learning professor (on leave), twitter research scientist, noted neural
   network researcher, and deep learning aficiando. since late summer
   2015, he has been drafting and publicly sharing notes on arxiv machine
   learning papers that he has taken an interest in. at the time of this
   writing he has shared notes on 10 papers.
   a selection of 5 arxiv machine learning papers that hugo has read and
   shared notes on follows. in an effort to help us better understand
   their content, for each paper an overview of its abstract along with an
   excerpt from hugo's notes are presented. it is hoped that having top
   deep learning papers explained by a noted expert in the field will make
   some of the more complex aspects of the science more approachable.
   1. [40]training recurrent networks online without backtracking
   authors: yann ollivier, guillaume charpiat
   date posted to arxiv: 28 jul 2015
   [41]abstract (excerpt): we introduce the "nobacktrack" algorithm to
   train the parameters of dynamical systems such as recurrent neural
   networks. this algorithm works in an online, memoryless setting, thus
   requiring no id26 through time, and is scalable, avoiding
   the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the full
   gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters. [ ... ]
   preliminary tests on a simple task show that the stochastic
   approximation of the gradient introduced in the algorithm does not seem
   to introduce too much noise in the trajectory, compared to maintaining
   the full gradient, and confirm the good performance and scalability of
   the kalman-like version of nobacktrack.
   [42]hugo's two cents (excerpt): online training of id56s is a big,
   unsolved problem.
   the current approach people use is to truncate backprop to only a few
   steps in the past, which is more of a heuristic.
   this paper makes progress towards a more principled approach. i really
   like the "rank-one trick" of equation 7, really cute! and it is quite
   central to this method too, so good job on connecting those dots!
   the authors present this work as being preliminary, and indeed they do
   not compare with truncated backprop. i really hope they do in a future
   version of this work. also, i don't think i buy their argument that the
   "theory of stochastic id119 applies".
   2. [43]semi-supervised learning with ladder network
   authors: antti rasmus, harri valpola, mikko honkala, mathias berglund,
   tapani raiko
   date posted to arxiv: 9 jul 2015
   [44]abstract: we combine supervised learning with unsupervised learning
   in deep neural networks. the proposed model is trained to
   simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost
   functions by id26, avoiding the need for layer-wise
   pretraining. our work builds on top of the ladder network proposed by
   valpola (2015) which we extend by combining the model with supervision.
   we show that the resulting model reaches state-of-the-art performance
   in various tasks: mnist and cifar-10 classification in a
   semi-supervised setting and permutation invariant mnist in both
   semi-supervised and full-labels setting.
   [45]hugo's two cents (excerpt): what i find most exciting about this
   paper is its performance. on mnist, with only 100 labeled examples, it
   achieves 1.13% error! that is essentially the performance of stacked
   denoising autoencoders, trained on the entire training set (though that
   was before relus and batch id172, which this paper uses)! this
   confirms a current line of thought in deep learning (dl) that, while
   recent progress in dl applied on large labeled datasets does not rely
   on any unsupervised learning (unlike at the "beginning" of dl in the
   mid 2000s), unsupervised learning might instead be crucial for success
   in low-labeled data regime, in the semi-supervised setting.
   unfortunately, there is one little issue in the experiments, disclosed
   by the authors: while they used few labeled examples for training,
   model selection did use all 10k labels in the validation set. this is
   of course unrealistic.
