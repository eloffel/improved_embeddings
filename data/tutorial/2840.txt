   i am reading this book ([29]nltk) and it is confusing. id178 is
   [30]defined as:

     id178 is the sum of the id203 of each label times the log
     id203 of that same label

   how can i apply id178 and maximum id178 in terms of id111?
   can someone give me a easy, simple example (visual)?

   i assume id178 was mentioned in the context of building [48]decision
   trees.

   to illustrate, imagine the task of [49]learning to [50]classify
   first-names into male/female groups. that is given a list of names each
   labeled with either m or f, we want to learn a [51]model that fits the
   data and can be used to predict the gender of a new unseen first-name.
name       gender
-----------------        now we want to predict
ashley        f              the gender of "amro" (my name)
brian         m
caroline      f
david         m

   first step is [52]deciding what [53]features of the data are relevant
   to the target class we want to predict. some example features include:
   first/last letter, length, number of vowels, does it end with a vowel,
   etc.. so after feature extraction, our data looks like:
# name    ends-vowel  num-vowels   length   gender
# ------------------------------------------------
ashley        1         3           6        f
brian         0         2           5        m
caroline      1         4           8        f
david         0         2           5        m

   the goal is to build a [54]decision tree. an example of a [55]tree
   would be:
length<7
|   num-vowels<3: male
|   num-vowels>=3
|   |   ends-vowel=1: female
|   |   ends-vowel=0: male
length>=7
|   length=5: male

   basically each node represent a test performed on a single attribute,
   and we go left or right depending on the result of the test. we keep
   traversing the tree until we reach a leaf node which contains the class
   prediction (m or f)

   so if we run the name amro down this tree, we start by testing "is the
   length<7?" and the answer is yes, so we go down that branch. following
   the branch, the next test "is the number of vowels<3?" again evaluates
   to true. this leads to a leaf node labeled m, and thus the prediction
   is male (which i happen to be, so the tree predicted the outcome
   [56]correctly).

   the decision tree is [57]built in a top-down fashion, but the question
   is how do you choose which attribute to split at each node? the answer
   is find the feature that best splits the target class into the purest
   possible children nodes (ie: nodes that don't contain a mix of both
   male and female, rather pure nodes with only one class).

   this measure of purity is called the [58]information. it represents the
   [59]expected amount of [60]information that would be needed to specify
   whether a new instance (first-name) should be classified male or
   female, given the example that reached the node. we calculate it based
   on the number of male and female classes at the node.

   [61]id178 on the other hand is a measure of impurity (the opposite).
   it is defined for a [62]binary class with values a/b as:
id178 = - p(a)*log(p(a)) - p(b)*log(p(b))

   this [63]binary id178 function is depicted in the figure below
   (random variable can take one of two values). it reaches its maximum
   when the id203 is p=1/2, meaning that p(x=a)=0.5 or
   similarlyp(x=b)=0.5 having a 50%/50% chance of being either a or b
   (uncertainty is at a maximum). the id178 function is at zero minimum
   when id203 is p=1 or p=0 with complete certainty (p(x=a)=1 or
   p(x=a)=0 respectively, latter implies p(x=b)=1).

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:binary_id178_plot.svg

   of course the definition of id178 can be generalized for a discrete
   random variable x with n outcomes (not just two):

   id178

   (the log in the formula is usually taken as the [64]logarithm to the
   base 2)
     __________________________________________________________________

   back to our task of name classification, lets look at an example.
   imagine at some point during the process of constructing the tree, we
   were considering the following split:
     ends-vowel
      [9m,5f]          <--- the [..,..] notation represents the class
    /          \            distribution of instances that reached a node
   =1          =0
 -------     -------
 [3m,4f]     [6m,1f]

   as you can see, before the split we had 9 males and 5 females, i.e.
   p(m)=9/14 and p(f)=5/14. according to the definition of id178:
id178_before = - (5/14)*log2(5/14) - (9/14)*log2(9/14) = 0.9403

   next we compare it with the id178 computed after considering the
   split by looking at two child branches. in the left branch of
   ends-vowel=1, we have:
id178_left = - (3/7)*log2(3/7) - (4/7)*log2(4/7) = 0.9852

   and the right branch of ends-vowel=0, we have:
id178_right = - (6/7)*log2(6/7) - (1/7)*log2(1/7) = 0.5917

   we combine the left/right entropies using the number of instances down
   each branch as [65]weight factor (7 instances went left, and 7
   instances went right), and get the final id178 after the split:
id178_after = 7/14*id178_left + 7/14*id178_right = 0.7885

   now by comparing the id178 before and after the split, we obtain a
   measure of [66]information gain, or how much information we gained by
   doing the split using that particular feature:
information_gain = id178_before - id178_after = 0.1518

   you can interpret the above calculation as following: by doing the
   split with the end-vowels feature, we were able to reduce uncertainty
   in the sub-tree prediction outcome by a small amount of 0.1518
   (measured in [67]bits as [68]units of information).

   at each node of the tree, this calculation is performed for every
   feature, and the feature with the largest information gain is chosen
   for the split in a [69]greedy manner (thus favoring features that
   produce pure splits with low uncertainty/id178). this process is
   applied recursively from the root-node down, and stops when a leaf node
   contains instances all having the same class (no need to split it
   further).

   note that i skipped over some [70]details which are beyond the scope of
   this post, including how to handle [71]numeric features, [72]missing
   values, [73]overfitting and [74]pruning trees, etc..

       @all3fox: this is explained in the last paragraph, the process
       should stop for that particular branch if it gets to a pure node (a
       leaf node where all the instances belong to the same class, so it
       cant be split any further). the node thus predicts the only class
       it contains..     [81]amro mar 23 '15 at 22:41

       @all3fox: in practice, going all the way to pure nodes produces
       quite deep id90 that suffer from overfitting (i.e trees
       that fit too well the training data, but that generalize poorly to
       other data not represented in the training set). hence we usually
       stop when we get to a certain minimum number of instances in leaf
       nodes (and just predict the majority class), and/or perform some
       kind of pruning (see the wikipedia links provided above to learn

       @rami: right, to avoid problem like [85]overfitting, smaller trees
       are preferred over larger ones (i.e reaching decisions with fewer
       tests). note that the heuristic by which splitting features are
       chosen is a greedy search algorithm, so the generated tree is not
       guaranteed to be the smallest possible one in the space of all
       possible trees (nor is it guaranteed to be globally-optimal one
       w.r.t classification error). this is in fact an [86]np-complete
       problem...     [87]amro may 29 '15 at 15:16

   to begin with, it would be best to understand the measure of
   information.

how do we measure the information?

   when something unlikely happens, we say it's a big news. also, when we
   say something predictable, it's not really interesting. so to quantify
   this interesting-ness, the function should satisfy
     * if the id203 of the event is 1 (predictable), then the
       function gives 0
     * if the id203 of the event is close to 0, then the function
       should give high number
     * if id203 0.5 events happens it give one bit of information.

   one natural measure that satisfy the constraints is
i(x) = -log_2(p)

   where p is the id203 of the event x. and the unit is in bit, the
   same bit computer uses. 0 or 1.

example 1

   fair coin flip :

   how much information can we get from one coin flip?

   answer : -log(p) = -log(1/2) = 1 (bit)

example 2

   if a meteor strikes the earth tomorrow, p=2^{-22} then we can get 22
   bits of information.

   if the sun rises tomorrow, p ~ 1 then it is 0 bit of information.

id178

   so if we take expectation on the interesting-ness of an event y, then
   it is the id178. i.e. id178 is an expected value of the
   interesting-ness of an event.
h(y) = e[ i(y)]

   more formally, the id178 is the expected number of bits of an event.

example

   y = 1 : an event x occurs with id203 p

   y = 0 : an event x does not occur with id203 1-p
h(y) = e[i(y)] = p i(y==1) + (1-p) i(y==0)
     = - p log p - (1-p) log (1-p)

   log base 2 for all log.

   i can't give you graphics, but maybe i can give a clear explanation.

   suppose we have an information channel, such as a light that flashes
   once every day either red or green. how much information does it
   convey? the first guess might be one bit per day. but what if we add
   blue, so that the sender has three options? we would like to have a
   measure of information that can handle things other than powers of two,
   but still be additive (the way that multiplying the number of possible
   messages by two adds one bit). we could do this by taking log[2](number
   of possible messages), but it turns out there's a more general way.

   suppose we're back to red/green, but the red bulb has burned out (this
   is common knowledge) so that the lamp must always flash green. the
   channel is now useless, we know what the next flash will be so the
   flashes convey no information, no news. now we repair the bulb but
   impose a rule that the red bulb may not flash twice in a row. when the
   lamp flashes red, we know what the next flash will be. if you try to
   send a bit stream by this channel, you'll find that you must encode it
   with more flashes than you have bits (50% more, in fact). and if you
   want to describe a sequence of flashes, you can do so with fewer bits.
   the same applies if each flash is independent (context-free), but green
   flashes are more common than red: the more skewed the id203 the
   fewer bits you need to describe the sequence, and the less information
   it contains, all the way to the all-green, bulb-burnt-out limit.

   it turns out there's a way to measure the amount of information in a
   signal, based on the the probabilities of the different symbols. if the
   id203 of receiving symbol x[i] is p[i], then consider the
   quantity
-log p[i]

   the smaller p[i], the larger this value. if x[i] becomes twice as
   unlikely, this value increases by a fixed amount (log(2)). this should
   remind you of adding one bit to a message.

   if we don't know what the symbol will be (but we know the
   probabilities) then we can calculate the average of this value, how
   much we will get, by summing over the different possibilities:
i = -   p[i] log(p[i])

   this is the information content in one flash.
red bulb burnt out: p[red] = 0, p[green]=1, i = -(0 + 0)  = 0
red and green equiprobable: p[red] = 1/2, p[green = 1/2], i = -(2 * 1/2 * log(1/
2)) = log(2)
three colors, equiprobable: p[i]=1/3, i = -(3 * 1/3 * log(1/3)) = log(3)
green and red, green twice as likely: p[red]=1/3, p[green]=2/3, i = -(1/3 log(1/
3) + 2/3 log(2/3)) = log(3) - 2/3 log(2)

   this is the information content, or id178, of the message. it is
   maximal when the different symbols are equiprobable. if you're a
   physicist you use the natural log, if you're a computer scientist you
   use log[2] and get bits.

   i really recommend you read about id205, bayesian methods
   and maxent. the place to start is this (freely available online) book
   by david mackay:

   [96]http://www.id136.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/

   those id136 methods are really far more general than just text
   mining and i can't really devise how one would learn how to apply this
   to nlp without learning some of the general basics contained in this
   book or other introductory books on machine learning and maxent
   bayesian methods.

   the connection between id178 and id203 theory to information
   processing and storing is really, really deep. to give a taste of it,
   there's a theorem due to shannon that states that the maximum amount of
   information you can pass without error through a noisy communication
   channel is equal to the id178 of the noise process. there's also a
   theorem that connects how much you can compress a piece of data to
   occupy the minimum possible memory in your computer to the id178 of
   the process that generated the data.

   i don't think it's really necessary that you go learning about all
   those theorems on communication theory, but it's not possible to learn
   this without learning the basics about what is id178, how it's
   calculated, what is it's relationship with information and id136,
   etc...

   when i was implementing an algorithm to calculate the id178 of an
   image i found these links, see [101]here and [102]here.

   this is the pseudo-code i used, you'll need to adapt it to work with
   text rather than images but the principles should be the same.
//loop over image array elements and count occurrences of each possible
//pixel to pixel difference value. store these values in prob_array
for j = 0, ysize-1 do $
    for i = 0, xsize-2 do begin
       diff = array(i+1,j) - array(i,j)
       if diff lt (array_size+1)/2 and diff gt -(array_size+1)/2 then begin
            prob_array(diff+(array_size-1)/2) = prob_array(diff+(array_size-1)/2
) + 1
       endif
     endfor

//convert values in prob_array to probabilities and compute id178
n = total(prob_array)

entrop = 0
for i = 0, array_size-1 do begin
    prob_array(i) = prob_array(i)/n

    //base 2 log of x is ln(x)/ln(2). take ln of array element
    //here and divide final sum by ln(2)
    if prob_array(i) ne 0 then begin
        entrop = entrop - prob_array(i)*alog(prob_array(i))
    endif
endfor

entrop = entrop/alog(2)

   i got this code from somewhere, but i can't dig out the link.

     * there are so much different id178() functions out there for

       [106]mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28692-id178 in the
       latter, the developer says it is for 1d signals but users keep

informally

   id178 is availability of information or knowledge, lack of
   information will leads to difficulties in prediction of future which is
   high id178 (next word prediction in id111) and availability of
   information/knowledge will help us more realistic prediction of future
   (low id178).

   relevant information of any type will reduce id178 and helps us
   predict more realistic future, that information can be word "meat" is
   present in sentence or word "meat" is not present. this is called
   information gain
     __________________________________________________________________

formally

   id178 is lack of order of predicability

   as you are reading a book about nltk it would be interesting you read
   about maxent classifier module
   [111]http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.classify.html#module-nltk.classify.ma
   xent

   for id111 classification the steps could be: pre-processing
   (id121, steaming, feature selection with information gain ...),
   transformation to numeric (frequency or tf-idf) (i think that this is
   the key step to understand when using text as input to a algorithm that
   only accept numeric) and then classify with maxent, sure this is just
   an example.
