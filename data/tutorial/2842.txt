pybrain -- the python machine learning library
===============================================


installation
------------
quick answer: make sure you have scipy installed, then
        python setup.py install

longer answer: (if the above was any trouble) we keep more
detailed installation instructions (including those
for the dependencies) up-to-date in a wiki at:
        [86]http://wiki.github.com/pybrain/pybrain/installation


documentation
-------------
please read
        docs/documentation.pdf
or browse
        docs/html/*
featuring: quickstart, tutorials, api, etc.

if you have matplotlib, the scripts in
        examples/*
may be instructive as well.
