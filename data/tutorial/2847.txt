     study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

features

     * data structures for graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs
     * many standard graph algorithms
     * network structure and analysis measures
     * generators for classic graphs, random graphs, and synthetic
       networks
     * nodes can be "anything" (e.g., text, images, xml records)
     * edges can hold arbitrary data (e.g., weights, time-series)
     * open source [2]3-clause bsd license
     * well tested with over 90% code coverage
     * additional benefits from python include fast prototyping, easy to
