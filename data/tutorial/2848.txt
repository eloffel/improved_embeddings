  get started

 requirements

   on linux (and other unix-like systems), you will need a c and a c++
   compiler, the tool make and the development header files for your
   version of python. on debian and ubuntu linux the build-essential and
   python-dev packages install these. on mac os x, you can get a working c
   and c++ compiler as well as make by installing xcode or the xcode
   command line tools.

   see also the platform-specific installation instructions below.

  installation

   igraph is on the [28]python package index so it can be installed using
   pip or easy_install:

$ pip install python-igraph

   if the c core of igraph has already been installed to a location that
   can be detected using pkg-config, pip will compile and link the
   extension to the c core that you have installed. if the c core is not
   installed or is installed in a location that cannot be detected using
   pkg-config, pip will attempt to download a matching version of the c
   core and compile it together with the python interface. note that this
   will not work on windows; you are advised to download and run one of
   the python wheels that christoph gohlke provides on [29]his website.

  installation on mac os x

   instead of letting pip compile the c core for you, you can install
   [30]homebrew and the homebrew/science/igraph formula. this will ensure
   that the c core is found by pip so running pip install python-igraph
   will compile the python interface only and link it to the c core.

  installation on windows

   the preferred way to install the python interface on windows is to
   download one of the unofficial installers built by [31]christoph
   gohlke. (thanks christoph!). we do not provide "official" installers
   for windows as we don't use windows ourselves and we would not be able
   to test them before release. note that the automatic compilation of the
   c core when running pip install python-igraph will not work on windows!

 tutorials

     * a short tutorial is provided on [32]this page.
     * the documentation of the [33]graph and [34]graphbase classes
       provide a good overview of most of the functionality in the python
       interface.

 documentation     for version 0.7.0

 python manual

     * [35]tutorial     read online
     * [36]reference manual     browse online
     * [37]pdf file

   documentation for the python interface is also included in the python
   docstrings, so you can use pydoc or the built-in python help facility
   as well.

 downloads
