welcome to apache mahout!

   the apache mahout    project's goal is to build an environment for
   quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.

   for additional information about mahout, visit the [100]mahout home
   page

setting up your environment

   whether you are using mahout's shell, running command line jobs or
   using it as a library to build your own apps you'll need to setup
   several environment variables. edit your environment in ~/.bash_profile
   for mac or ~/.bashrc for many linux distributions. add the following
export mahout_home=/path/to/mahout
export mahout_local=true # for running standalone on your dev machine,
# unset mahout_local for running on a cluster

   you will need $java_home, and if you are running on spark, you will
   also need $spark_home.

using mahout as a library

   running any application that uses mahout will require installing a
   binary or source version and setting the environment. to compile from
   source:
     * mvn -dskiptests clean install
     * to run tests do mvn test
     * to set up your ide, do mvn eclipse:eclipse or mvn idea:idea

   to use maven, add the appropriate setting to your pom.xml or build.sbt
   following the template below.

   to use the samsara environment you'll need to include both the engine
   neutral math-scala dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupid>org.apache.mahout</groupid>
    <artifactid>mahout-math-scala_2.10</artifactid>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>

   and a dependency for back end engine translation, e.g:
<dependency>
    <groupid>org.apache.mahout</groupid>
    <artifactid>mahout-spark_2.10</artifactid>
    <version>${mahout.version}</version>
</dependency>

building from source

prerequisites:

   linux environment (preferably ubuntu 16.04.x) note: currently only the
   jvm-only build will work on a mac. gcc > 4.x nvidia card (installed
   with opencl drivers alongside usual gpu drivers)

downloads

   install java 1.7+ in an easily accessible directory (for this example,
   ~/java/)
   [101]http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downl
   oads-2133151.html

   create a directory ~/apache/ .

   download apache maven 3.3.9 and un-tar/gunzip to
   ~/apache/apache-maven-3.3.9/ .
   [102]https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

   download and un-tar/gunzip hadoop 2.4.1 to ~/apache/hadoop-2.4.1/ .
   [103]https://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.4.1/

   download and un-tar/gunzip spark-1.6.3-bin-hadoop2.4 to ~/apache/ .
   [104]http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html choose release: spark-1.6.3
   (nov 07 2016) choose package type: pre-built for hadoop 2.4

   install viennacl 1.7.0+ if running ubuntu 16.04+
sudo apt-get install libviennacl-dev

   otherwise if your distribution   s package manager does not have a
   viennniacl-dev package >1.7.0, clone it directly into the directory
   which will be included in when being compiled by mahout:
mkdir ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp && git clone https://github.com/viennacl/viennacl-dev.git
cp -r viennacl/ /usr/local/
cp -r cl/ /usr/local/

   ensure that the opencl 1.2+ drivers are installed (packed with most
   consumer grade nvidia drivers). not sure about higher end cards.

   clone mahout repository into ~/apache.
git clone https://github.com/apache/mahout.git

configuration

   when building mahout for a spark backend, we need four system
   environment variables set:
    export mahout_home=/home/<user>/apache/mahout
    export hadoop_home=/home/<user>/apache/hadoop-2.4.1
    export spark_home=/home/<user>/apache/spark-1.6.3-bin-hadoop2.4
    export java_home=/home/<user>/java/jdk-1.8.121

   mahout on spark regularly uses one more env variable, the ip of the
   spark cluster   s master node (usually the node which one would be logged
   into).

   to use 4 local cores (spark master need not be running)
export master=local[4]

   to use all available local cores (again, spark master need not be
   running)
export master=local[*]

   to point to a cluster with spark running:
export master=spark://master.ip.address:7077

   we then add these to the path:
   path=$path$:mahout_home/bin:$hadoop_home/bin:$spark_home/bin:$java_home/bin

   these should be added to the your ~/.bashrc file.

building mahout with apache maven

   currently mahout has 3 builds. from the $mahout_home directory we may
   issue the commands to build each using mvn profiles.

   jvm only:
mvn clean install -dskiptests

   jvm with native openmp level 2 and level 3 matrix/vector multiplication
mvn clean install -pviennacl-omp -phadoop2 -dskiptests

   jvm with native openmp and opencl for level 2 and level 3 matrix/vector
   multiplication. (gpu errors fall back to openmp, currently only a
   single gpu/node is supported).
mvn clean install -pviennacl -phadoop2 -dskiptests

testing the mahout environment

   mahout provides an extension to the spark-shell, which is good for
   getting to know the language, testing partition loads, prototyping
   algorithms, etc..

   to launch the shell in local mode with 2 threads: simply do the
   following:
$ master=local[2] mahout spark-shell

   after a very verbose startup, a mahout welcome screen will appear:

scala>

   at the scala> prompt, enter:
scala> :load /home/<andy>/apache/mahout/examples
                               /bin/sparsesparsedrmtimer.mscala

   which will load a id127 timer function definition. to
   run the matrix timer:
        scala> timesparsedrmmmul(1000,1000,1000,1,.02,1234l)
            {...} res3: long = 16321

   note the 0.14.0 release is missing a class required for this; will be
   fixed in 0.14.1. we can see that the jvm only version is rather slow,
   thus our motive for gpu and native multithreading support.

   to get an idea of what   s going on under the hood of the timer, we may
   examine the .mscala (mahout scala) code which is both fully functional
   scala and the mahout r-like dsl for tensor algebra:


def timesparsedrmmmul(m: int, n: int, s: int, para: int, pctdense: double = .20,
 seed: long = 1234l): long = {
  val drma = drmparallelizeempty(m , s, para).mapblock(){
       case (keys,block:matrix) =>
           val r =  scala.util.random
           r.setseed(seed)
           val blockb = new sparserowmatrix(block.nrow, block.ncol)
           blockb := {x => if (r.nextdouble < pctdense) r.nextdouble else x }
       (keys -> blockb)
  }

  val drmb = drmparallelizeempty(s , n, para).mapblock(){
       case (keys,block:matrix) =>
           val r =  scala.util.random
           r.setseed(seed + 1)
           val blockb = new sparserowmatrix(block.nrow, block.ncol)
           blockb := {x => if (r.nextdouble < pctdense) r.nextdouble else x }
       (keys -> blockb)
  }

  var time = system.currenttimemillis()

  val drmc = drma %*% drmb

  // trigger computation
  drmc.numrows()

  time = system.currenttimemillis() - time

  time

}

   have disabled it from the binary releases. to use flink please
   uncomment the line in the root pom.xml in the <modules> block so it
