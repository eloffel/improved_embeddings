       sam harris can we build ai without losing control over it?
       scared of superintelligent ai? you should be, says neuroscientist
       and philosopher sam harris     and not just in some theoretical way.
       we're going to build superhuman machines, says harris, but we
       haven't yet grappled with the problems associated with creating
       something that may treat us the way we treat ants.

       ray kurzweil get ready for hybrid thinking
       two hundred million years ago, our mammal ancestors developed a new
       brain feature: the neocortex. this stamp-sized piece of tissue
       (wrapped around a brain the size of a walnut) is the key to what
       humanity has become. now, futurist ray kurzweil suggests, we should
       get ready for the next big leap in brain power, as we tap into the
       computing power in the cloud.

       zeynep tufekci machine intelligence makes human morals more
       important
       machine intelligence is here, and we're already using it to make
       subjective decisions. but the complex way ai grows and improves
       makes it hard to understand and even harder to control. in this
       cautionary talk, techno-sociologist zeynep tufekci explains how
       intelligent machines can fail in ways that don't fit human error
       patterns     and in ways we won't expect or be prepared for. "we
       cannot outsource our responsibilities to machines," she says. "we
       must hold on ever tighter to human values and human ethics."

       jeremy howard the wonderful and terrifying implications of
       computers that can learn
       what happens when we teach a computer how to learn? technologist
       jeremy howard shares some surprising new developments in the
       fast-moving field of deep learning, a technique that can give
       computers the ability to learn chinese, or to recognize objects in
       photos, or to help think through a medical diagnosis. (one deep
       learning tool, after watching hours of youtube, taught itself the
       concept of "cats.") get caught up on a field that will change the
       way the computers around you behave ... sooner than you probably
       think.
    5. 17:58
       fei-fei li how we're teaching computers to understand pictures
       when a very young child looks at a picture, she can identify simple
       elements: "cat," "book," "chair." now, computers are getting smart
       enough to do that too. what's next? in a thrilling talk, computer
       vision expert fei-fei li describes the state of the art     including
       the database of 15 million photos her team built to "teach" a
       computer to understand pictures     and the key insights yet to come.
    6. 16:31
       nick bostrom what happens when our computers get smarter than we
       are?
       artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds    
       within this century, research suggests, a computer ai could be as
       "smart" as a human being. and then, says nick bostrom, it will
       overtake us: "machine intelligence is the last invention that
       humanity will ever need to make." a philosopher and technologist,
       bostrom asks us to think hard about the world we're building right
       now, driven by thinking machines. will our smart machines help to
       preserve humanity and our values     or will they have values of
       their own?

       rana el kaliouby this app knows how you feel     from the look on
       your face
       our emotions influence every aspect of our lives     how we learn,
       how we communicate, how we make decisions. yet they're absent from
       our digital lives; the devices and apps we interact with have no
       way of knowing how we feel. scientist rana el kaliouby aims to
       change that. she demos a powerful new technology that reads your
       facial expressions and matches them to corresponding
       emotions. this "emotion engine" has big implications, she says, and
       could change not just how we interact with machines     but with each
       other.

       ken jennings watson, jeopardy and me, the obsolete know-it-all
       trivia whiz ken jennings has made a career as a keeper of facts; he
       holds the longest winning streak in history on the us quiz show
       jeopardy. but in 2011, he played a challenge match against ibm's
       supercomputer watson     and lost. with humor and humility, jennings
       tells us how it felt to have a computer literally beat him at his
       own game, and makes the case for good old-fashioned human
       knowledge.

       garry kasparov don't fear intelligent machines. work with them
       we must face our fears if we want to get the most out of technology
           and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of
       humanity, says garry kasparov. one of the greatest chess players in
       history, kasparov lost a memorable match to ibm supercomputer deep
       blue in 1997. now he shares his vision for a future where
       intelligent machines help us turn our grandest dreams into reality.
