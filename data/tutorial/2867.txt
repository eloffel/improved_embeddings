   this edition of deep learning research review explains recent research
   papers in the deep learning subfield of generative adversarial
   networks. don't have time to read some of the top papers? get the

   starting this week, i   ll be doing a new series called deep learning
   research review. every couple weeks or so, i   ll be summarizing and
   explaining research papers in specific subfields of deep learning.
   this week i   ll begin with id3.

introduction


   [37]according to yann lecun,    adversarial training is the coolest thing
   since sliced bread   . i   m inclined to believe so because i don   t think
   sliced bread ever created this much buzz and excitement within the deep
   learning community. in this post, we   ll be looking at 3 papers that
   built on the pioneering [38]work of ian goodfellow in 2014.

quick summary of gans


   i briefly mentioned ian goodfellow   s generative adversarial
   network [39]paper in one of my prior blog posts, [40]9 deep learning
   papers you should know about.  the basic idea of these networks is that
   you have 2 models, a generative model and a discriminative model. the
   discriminative model has the task of determining whether a given image
   looks natural (an image from the dataset) or looks like it has been
   artificially created. the task of the generator is to create natural
   looking images that are similar to the original data distribution. this
   can be thought of as a zero-sum or minimax two player game. the analogy
   used in the paper is that the generative model is like    a team of
   counterfeiters, trying to produce and use fake currency    while the
   discriminative model is like    the police, trying to detect the
   counterfeit currency   . the generator is trying to fool the
   discriminator while the discriminator is trying to not get fooled by
   the generator. as the models train through alternating optimization,
   both methods are improved until a point where the    counterfeits are
   indistinguishable from the genuine articles   .

[41]laplacian pyramid of adversarial networks


   introduction

   so, one of the most important uses of adversarial networks is the
   ability to create natural looking images after training the generator
   for a sufficient amount of time. these are some samples of what the
   generator outputted in goodfellow   s 2014 paper.

   gan

   as you can see, the generator worked well with digits and faces, but it
   created very fuzzy and vague images when using the cifar-10 dataset.

   in order to fix this problem, emily denton, soumith chintala, arthur
   szlam, and rob fergus published the paper titled    deep generative image
   models using lapalacian pyramid of adversarial networks   . the main
   contribution of the paper is a type of network architecture that
   produces high-quality generated images that are mistaken for real
   images almost 40% of the time when assessed by human evaluators.

   approach

   before getting into the paper, let   s think about the job of the
   generator in a gan. it has to produce a large, complex, and natural
   image that is good enough to convince a trained discriminator. not such
   an easy task in one shot. the way the authors combat this is by using
   multiple id98 models to sequentially generate images in increasing
   scales. as emily denton said in her[42]talk on lapgans,

   gan

   the approach of this paper is to build a laplacian pyramid of
   generative models. for those that aren   t familiar, a laplacian pyramid
   is basically an image representation that consists of a series of
   filtered images at successively sparser densities ([43]more info for
   those interested). the idea is that each level of this pyramid
   representation contains information about the image at a particular
   scale. it is a sort of decomposition of the original image.

   let   s review what the inputs and outputs are of a simple gan. the
   generator takes in an input noise vector from a distribution and
   outputs an image. the discriminator takes in this image (or a real
   image from the training data) and outputs a scalar describing how
      real    the image is. now, let   s look at a conditional gan (cgan).
   everything remains the same, except that both the discriminator and the
   generator receive another piece of information as an input. this
   information is likely in the form of some sort of class label or
   another image.

   network architecture

   the authors propose a set of convnet models and that each layer of the
   pyramid will have a convnet associated with it. the change is the
   traditional gan structure is that instead of having just one generator
   id98 that creates the whole image, we have a series of id98s that create
   the image sequentially by slowly increasing the resolution (aka going
   along the pyramid) and refining images in a coarse to fine fashion.
   each level has its own id98 and is trained on two components. one is a
   low resolution image and the other is a noise vector (which was the
   only input in traditional gans). this is where the idea of cgans come
   into play as there are multiple inputs. the output will be a generated
   image that is then upsampled and used as input to the next level of the
   pyramid. this method is effective because the generators in each level
   are able to utilize information from different resolutions in order to
   create more finely grained outputs in the successive layers.
