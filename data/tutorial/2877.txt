python for linguists - a gentle introduction to programming

   as a linguistics undergrad, i wrote my first term paper on affixes. i
   spent a summer counting words by hand and collecting them in a
   spreadsheet. it took weeks, and once i was done, i was so tired and
   frustrated that i had no mind to re-run the calculations, and i had to
   write the actual paper in the remaining week. the outcome was
   predictably horrible, for everyone involved.

   when i started programming in my phd, i realized how useful even a
   little bit of programming would have been for that task: i could have
   solved the counting in a matter of minutes, and spent the rest of that
   summer writing a better paper and enjoying life. my hope is that this
   tutorial can help make someone's life a bit easier, and to show that
   programming is not some black art, but a useful tool in every linguists
   tool box.

installation

   in order to run this tutorial, you will need python 3. the easiest way
   to install this is to got to [65]anaconda, download the installer for
   your operating system, and run it.

   and open the .ipynb file. you can do this in a terminal window, by
   typing
