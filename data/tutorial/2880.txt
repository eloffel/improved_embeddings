   stories

   michael kennedy

   host, talk python to me podcast
   founder talk python training

   i'm in the unique position of asking over 100 industry experts the
   following question on my talk python to me podcast. "when you write
   some python code, what editor do you open up?" while the answers vary,
   it is frequently pycharm. the reasons the guests give are usually the
   same reasons i've been a pycharm advocate for years.
     * pycharm deeply understands your project, not just individual files
     * refactoring is a breeze across an entire project
     * the built-in sql tooling is amazing
     * autocomplete works better than any other editor, by far

   that's just a few reasons i open pycharm daily to build my web
   properties and manage the software that runs my business.

   cory althoff

   author of the self-taught programmer: the definitive guide to
   programming professionally

   pycharm is the best ide i've ever used. with pycharm, you can access
   the command line, connect to a database, create a virtual environment,
   and manage your version control system all in one place, saving time by
   avoiding constantly switching between windows. i couldn't imagine going
   back to programming without pycharm's local history feature and
   debugger. add the rest of its convenient shortcuts and features, and
   you have the perfect ide.

   features

what's new in pycharm 2019.1

   jupyter notebooks

jupyter notebooks

   support for jupyter notebooks was completely redesigned: directly edit
   notebook files and run cells straight from the editor. pycharm will
   also automatically start a jupyter notebook server for you.
   html and css quick documentation

css quick docs

   modern css is very powerful, which means there's a lot of concepts to
   understand. to help you to focus on the concepts rather than the order
   of shorthand properties, we improved the quick docs.
   recent locations

recent locations

   it's easy to find a file, but usually you're not just looking for the
   file, but a specific place within the file. recent locations shows you
   the places you've seen recently, and helps you navigate between them.
