                  reconcile - coreference resolution engine

   reconcile is an automatic coreference resolution system that was
   developed to provide a stable test-bed for researchers to implement new
   ideas quickly and reliably. it achieves roughly state of the art
   performance on many of the most common coreference resolution test
   sets, such as muc-6, muc-7, and ace. reconcile comes ready out of the
   box to train and test on these common data sets (though the data sets
   are not provided) as well as the ability to run on unlabeled texts.
   reconcile utilizes supervised machine learning classifiers from the
   weka toolkit, as well as other language processing tools such as the
   berkeley parser and stanford id39 system.
   the source language is java, and it is freely available under the gpl.

performance

   muc & b^3 scores for several common coreference data sets. these
   experiments use the supplied model, ave_id88_uw, trained on the
   university of wolverhampton corpus supplied with reconcile. this model
   is used in the stand-alone jar version of reconcile as well.
