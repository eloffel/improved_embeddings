  abstract:

   we present the first unsupervised approach to the problem of learning a
   semantic parser, using markov logic. our usp system transforms
   dependency trees into quasi-logical forms, recursively induces lambda
   forms from these, and clusters them to abstract away syntactic
   variations of the same meaning. the map semantic parse of a sentence is
   obtained by recursively assigning its parts to lambda-form clusters and
   composing them. we evaluate our approach by using it to extract a
   knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. usp
   substantially outperforms textrunner, dirt and an informed baseline on
   both precision and recall on this task.
