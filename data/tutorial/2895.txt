   this 3-hour course (video + slides) offers developers a quick
   introduction to deep-learning fundamentals, with some tensorflow thrown
   into the bargain.

   [15]deep learning (aka neural networks) is a popular approach to
   building machine-learning models that is [16]capturing developer
   imagination. if you want to acquire deep-learning skills but lack the
   time, i feel your pain.

   in university, i had a math teacher who would yell at me,    mr. g  rner,
   integrals are taught in kindergarten!    i get the same feeling today,
   when i read most free online resources dedicated to deep learning. my
   kindergarten education was apparently severely lacking in    dropout
   lullabies,       cross-id178 riddles,    and [17]   relu-gru-id56-lstm monster
   stories.    yet, these fundamental concepts are taken for granted by
   many, if not most, authors of online educational resources about deep
   learning.

   to help more developers embrace deep-learning techniques, without the
   need to earn a ph.d., i have attempted to flatten the learning curve by
   building a short crash-course (3 hours total). the course is focused on
   a few basic network architectures, including dense, convolutional and
   recurrent networks, and training techniques such as dropout or batch
   id172. (this course was initially presented at the [18]devoxx
   conference in antwerp, belgium, in november 2016.) by watching the
   recordings of the course and viewing the annotated slides, you can
   learn how to solve a couple of typical problems with neural networks
   and also pick up enough vocabulary and concepts to continue your deep
   learning self-education     for example, by
   exploring [19]tensorflow resources. (tensorflow is google   s internally
   developed framework for deep learning, which has been growing in
   popularity since it was released as open source in 2015.)

dive into the presentations

   if you have 1 hour: watch [20]this presentation while following the
   [21]slide deck. this installment covers dense and convolutional
   networks and is also available as a [22]self-paced codelab
   if you have 3 hours (recommended; recurrent networks are worth it!):
   watch [23]this presentation. you'll need both slide decks, [24]part
   1 and [25]part 2.
