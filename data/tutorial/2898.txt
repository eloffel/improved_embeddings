gpu accelerated computing with python

   python is one of the most popular programming languages today for
   science, engineering, data analytics and deep learning applications.
   however, as an interpreted language, it has been considered too slow
   for high-performance computing.

   [22]numba, a python compiler from [23]anaconda that can compile python
   code for execution on cuda-capable gpus, provides python developers
   with an easy entry into gpu-accelerated computing and a path for using
   increasingly sophisticated cuda code with a minimum of new syntax and
   jargon. with cuda python and [24]numba, you get the best of both
   worlds: rapid iterative development with python combined with the speed
   of a compiled language targeting both cpus and nvidia gpus.

setup cuda python

   to run cuda python, you will need the [25]cuda toolkit installed on a
   system with cuda capable gpus. use [26]this guide for easy steps to
   install cuda. if you do not have a [27]cuda-capable gpu, you can access
   one of the thousands of gpus available from cloud service providers
   including amazon aws, microsoft azure and ibm softlayer. the
   nvidia-maintained [28]cuda amazon machine image (ami) on aws, for
   example, comes pre-installed with cuda and is available for use today.
   [29]nvidia amis on aws [30]download cuda

   to get started with numba, the first step is to download and install
   the [31]anaconda python distribution that includes many popular
   packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, ipython, etc) and    conda   , a
   powerful package manager. once you have anaconda installed, install the
   required cuda packages by typing conda install numba cudatoolkit
   pyculib.

get started with cuda python

   the blog post [32]numba: high-performance python with cuda acceleration
   is a great resource to get you started. also refer to the [33]numba
   tutorial for cuda on the continuumio github repository and the numba
   posts on [34]anaconda   s blog.

   if you are new to python, explore the [35]beginner section of the
   python website for some excellent getting started resources. the blog,
   [36]an even easier introduction to cuda, introduces key cuda concepts
   through simple examples.

   check out numbas [37]github repository for additional examples to
   practice. you can also get the full [38]jupyter notebook for the
   mandelbrot example on github.

additional resources

   the developer blog posts, [39]seven things you might not know about
   numba and [40]gpu-accelerated graph analytics in python with numba
   provide additional insights into gpu computing with python.

   nvidia also provides hands-on training through a collection of
   self-paced courses and instructor-led workshops. the courses guide you
   step-by-step through editing and execution of code and interaction with
   visualization tools, woven together into a simple immersive experience.
   practice the techniques you learned in the materials above through
   hands-on content.

   you can [42]register for free access to nvidia tesla gpus in the cloud
   to deploy your python applications once they are ready.
