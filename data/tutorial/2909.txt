tutorial on mallet in python

   [49]radim   eh    ek 2014-03-20[50] gensim, [51]programming[52] 29
   comments

   [53]mallet,    machine learning for language toolkit    is a brilliant
   software tool. unlike [54]gensim,    topic modelling for humans   , which
   uses python, mallet is written in java and spells    id96    with
   a single    l   . dandy.

mallet   s lda

   mallet   s implementation of [55]id44 has lots of
   things going for it.

   it   s based on sampling, which is a more accurate fitting method than
   id58. variational methods, such as the [56]online vb
   id136 implemented in gensim, are easier to parallelize and
   guaranteed to converge    but they essentially solve an approximate, aka
   more inaccurate, problem.

   mallet is not    yet another midterm assignment implementation of gibbs
   sampling   . it contains [57]cleverly optimized code, is threaded to
   support multicore computers and, importantly, battle scarred by legions
   of humanity majors [58]applying mallet to literary studies.

   plus, written directly by [59]david mimno, a top expert in the field.

gensim wrapper

   i   ve wanted to include a similarly efficient sampling implementation of
   lda in gensim for a long time, but never found the time/motivation.
   [60]ben trahan, the author of the recent lda hyperparameter
   optimization patch for gensim, is on the job.

   in the meanwhile, i   ve added a simple wrapper around mallet so it can
   be used directly from python, following gensim   s api:
model = gensim.models.ldamallet(path_to_mallet, corpus, num_topics=10,  word=d
ictionary)
print model[corpus]  # calculate & print topics of all documents in the corpus

   and that   s it. the api is identical to the [61]ldamodel class already
   in gensim, except you must specify path to the mallet executable as its
   first parameter.

   check [62]the ldamallet api docs for setting other parameters such as
   threading (faster training, but consumes more memory), sampling
   iterations etc.

mallet on reuters

   let   s run a full end-to-end example.

   [63]nltk includes several datasets we can use as our training corpus.
   in particular, the following assumes that the nltk dataset    reuters   
   can be found under /users/kofola/nltk_data/corpora/reuters/training/:
# set up logging so we see what's going on
import logging
import os
from gensim import corpora, models, utils
logging.basicconfig(format="%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s", level=lo
gging.info)

def iter_documents(reuters_dir):
    """iterate over reuters documents, yielding one document at a time."""
    for fname in os.listdir(reuters_dir):
        # read each document as one big string
        document = open(os.path.join(reuters_dir, fname)).read()
        # parse document into a list of utf8 tokens
        yield utils.simple_preprocess(document)

class reuterscorpus(object):
    def __init__(self, reuters_dir):
        self.reuters_dir = reuters_dir
        self.dictionary = corpora.dictionary(iter_documents(reuters_dir))
        self.dictionary.filter_extremes()  # remove stopwords etc

    def __iter__(self):
        for tokens in iter_documents(self.reuters_dir):
            yield self.dictionary.doc2bow(tokens)

# set up the streamed corpus
corpus = reuterscorpus('/users/kofola/nltk_data/corpora/reuters/training/')
# info : adding document #0 to dictionary(0 unique tokens: [])
# info : built dictionary(24622 unique tokens: ['mdbl', 'fawc', 'degussa', 'wood
s', 'hanging']...) from 7769 documents (total 938238 corpus positions)
# info : keeping 7203 tokens which were in no less than 5 and no more than 3884
(=50.0%) documents
# info : resulting dictionary: dictionary(7203 unique tokens: ['yellow', 'four',
 'resisted', 'cyprus', 'increase']...)

# train 10 lda topics using mallet
mallet_path = '/users/kofola/downloads/mallet-2.0.7/bin/mallet'
model = models.ldamallet(mallet_path, corpus, num_topics=10,  word=corpus.dict
ionary)

bow = corpus.dictionary.doc2bow(utils.simple_preprocess(doc))
print model[bow]  # print list of (topic id, topic weight) pairs
# [[(0, 0.0903954802259887),
#   (1, 0.13559322033898305),
#   (2, 0.11299435028248588),
#   (3, 0.0847457627118644),
#   (4, 0.11864406779661017),
#   (5, 0.0847457627118644),
#   (6, 0.0847457627118644),
#   (7, 0.10357815442561205),
#   (8, 0.09981167608286252),
#   (9, 0.0847457627118644)]]

   apparently topics #1 (oil&co) and #4 (wheat&co) got the highest
   weights, so it passes the sniff test.

   note this mallet wrapper is new in gensim [64]version 0.9.0, and is
   extremely rudimentary for the time being. it serializes input (training
   corpus) into a file, calls the java process to run mallet, then parses
   out output from the files that mallet produces. not very efficient, not
   very robust.

   depending on how this wrapper is used/received, i may extend it in the
   future.

   or even better, [65]try your hand at improving it yourself.

                 ya, decided to clean it up a bit first and put my local
                 version into a forked gensim. will be ready in next
                 couple of days
                 i am also thinking about chancing a direct port of blei   s
                 dtm implementation, but not sure about it yet.

       great! thanks for putting this together     
       is there a way to save the model to allow documents to be tested on
       it without retraining the whole thing?

            you   re welcome     
            the best way to    save the model    is to specify the `prefix`
            parameter to ldamallet constructor:
            [93]http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/wrappers/ldamallet.h
            tml#gensim.models.wrappers.ldamallet.ldamallet
            by default, the data files for mallet are stored in temp under
            a randomized name, so you   ll lose them after a restart. but
            when you say `prefix=   /my/directory/mallet/   `, all mallet
            files are stored there instead. then you can continue using
            the model even after reload.
            the python model itself is saved/loaded using the standard
            `load()`/`save()` methods, like all models in gensim.
            hope that helps,

            are you using the same input as in tutorial?
            maybe you passed in two queries, so you got two outputs?
            send more info (versions of gensim, mallet, input, gist your

       is this supposed to work with python 3? after making your sample
       compatible with python2/3, it will run under python 2, but it will
       throw an exception under python 3.

            under github? [116]https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/
            include your package versions / os etc please.

       hi radim, thanks for the article .
       i am new to topic modelling and mallet.
       may i ask gensim wrapper and mallet on reuters together? or they
       are two different things in this tutorial?

            hi sandy,
            i   m not sure what you mean. but the best place to describe
            your problem or ask for help would be our open source mailing
            list:

            sorry , i meant do i need to run it at 2 different files. or
            should i put the two things together and run as a whole?

                      sandy,
                      first to answer your question:
                      i had the same error (attributeerror:    module   
                      object has no attribute    ldamallet   ). i looked in
                      gensim/models and found that ldamallet.py is in the
                      wrappers directory
                      ([131]https://github.com/rare-technologies/gensim/tr
                      ee/develop/gensim/models/wrappers). so, instead use
                      the following:
                      from gensim.models import wrappers
                      (i used gensim.models.wrappers import ldamallet)
                      next, i noticed that your number of kept tokens is
                      very small (81), since you   re using a small corpus.
                      this may be appropriate since those would be the
                      most confident distinctive words, but i   d use a
                      lower no_below (to keep infrequent tokens) and
                      possibly a higher no_above ratio.
                      .filter_extremes(no_below=1, no_above=.7)
                      finally, use self.model.save(model_filename) to save
                      the model (you can then use load()) and
                      self.model.show_topics(num_topics=-1) to get a list
                      of all topics so that you can see what each number
                      corresponds to, and what words represent the topics.

       hello.
       i would like to thank you for your great efforts.
       i have a question if you don   t mind? is it normal that i get
       completely different topics models when using mallet lda and gensim
       lda?!
       i expect differences but they seem to be very different when i
       tried them on my corpus. i have also compared with the reuters
       corpus and below are my models definitions and the top 10 topics
       for each model.
       model = models.wrappers.ldamallet(mallet_path, corpus,
       num_topics=10,  word=corpus.dictionary)
       gensim_model=
       gensim.models.ldamodel.ldamodel(corpus,num_topics=10, word=corpus
       .dictionary)
       there are some different parameters like alpha i guess, but i am
       not sure if there is any other parameter that i have missed and
       made the results so different?!
