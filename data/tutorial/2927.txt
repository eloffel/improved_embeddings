paraphrase generation

     open sourced implementation of [79]this paper: syntax-based
     alignment of multiple translations: extracting paraphrases and
     generating new sentences
     demo is available [80]here.

installation

   i am assuming that you have python 2.7 and pip installed ! all other
   requirements are mentioned in requirements.txt

   install them as:
pip install -r requirements.txt

   if you are having problem installing them this way, try to install each
   of the following independently. i am sure this won't be difficult.
     * nltk
     * pydot
     * asciitree
     * awesome-print
     * requests
     * bllipparser

   installing bllipparser on mac is a little mess. you can follow these
   links to help: [81]link1, [82]link2, [83]link3. or else, try running it
   on linux/ubuntu vm : )
     __________________________________________________________________

   usage:

   example.py documents the basic usage.
     * step 1: clone this repo:
       https://github.com/harshtrivedi/paraphrase-generation
     * step 2: go to the root directory: cd paraphrase-generation/
     * step 3: open python terminal and rest can be done as follows:

from main_lib import *

list_of_equivalent_sentences = [
"at least 12 people were killed in the battle last week",
"at least 12 people lost their lives in last week's fighting",
"last week's fight took at least 12 lives",
"the fighting last week killed at least 12"
]

id122 = get_id122(list_of_equivalent_sentences)
# returns instance of id122 class.

   please note:
     * id122 instance has start and end attributes. each of them is a
       id122node instance.
     * and each instance of id122node has nexts and previouses attributes.
       each is a dictionary with key as word labeled edge and value as the
       next / previous node on that edge.
     * each instance of id122node is identified by unique id which can be
       used to indentify the node while traversing.
