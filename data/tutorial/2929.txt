syncpy python library

   the syncpy python library is an ongoing open-source project conceived
   and developed at the institut des syst  mes intelligentes et robotique
   (isir) at the universit   pierre et marie curie (upmc), paris 6, france.

   syncpy library is currently under development in the framework of the
   smart labex project ([72]http://www.smart-labex.fr)

motivation

   syncpy is a novel open-source analytic library for investigating
   synchrony in a fast and exhaustive way. it stems from work and
   discussions among researchers on synchrony in different domains as
   engineering, computer science and psychology.

   syncpy is mainly aimed at helping researchers to explore, try and
   compare in an easy way and with a single tool synchrony methods
   starting from signals. signals are synthetic or experimental time
   series organized as python pandas dataframes.

   the library has been conceived to investigate synchrony in human-human/
   human machine interaction, however, although it focuses on
   interpersonal synchrony, all the methods are exploitable in other
   contexts.

architecture

   syncpy includes three main components:
     * utils package
     * graphical interface
     * synchrony methods package

   the utils package contains functionals of general utility directly used
   by the synchrony methods or to preprocess the input signals.

   the graphical interface is a pyqt application conceived to assist users
   to choose and try several methods. more specifically, it allows users
   to:
    1. load time series from files
    2. visualize these time series
    3. choose a consistent method according to the data set
    4. compute the selected method and
    5. visualize and/or save the result in a file (.csv format, .png
       format).

   the synchrony methods package contains the methods to compute
   synchrony. the methods are organized following the structure described
   in the paper: "syncpy - a unified analytic library for synchrony" (see
   references).
