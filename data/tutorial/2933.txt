   [97]artificial intelligence has reached peak hype. news outlets report
   that companies have replaced workers with ibm watson and that
   algorithms are beating doctors at diagnoses. new ai startups pop up
   everyday, claiming to solve all your personal and business problems
   with machine learning.

   ordinary objects like juicers and wi-fi routers suddenly advertise
   themselves as    powered by ai.    not only can smart standing desks
   remember your height settings, they can also [98]order you lunch.

   much of the ai hubbub is generated by reporters who   ve never trained a
   neural network and by startups or those hoping to be acqui-hired for
   engineering talent despite not having solved any real business
   problems. no wonder there are so many misconceptions about what ai can
   and cannot do.

deep learning is undeniably mind-blowing

   neural networks were invented in the    60s, but recent boosts in big
   data and computational power made them actually useful. a new
   discipline called    deep learning    has arisen that can apply complex
   neural network architectures to model patterns in data more accurately
   than ever before.

   the results are undeniably impressive. computers can now [99]recognize
   objects in images and video and [100]transcribe speech to text better
   than humans can. google [101]replaced google translate   s architecture
   with neural networks, and now machine translation is also closing in on
   human performance.

   the practical applications are mind-blowing as well. computers can
   [102]predict crop yield better than the usda and indeed [103]diagnose
   cancer more accurately than elite physicians.

   john launchbury, a director at darpa, [104]describes three waves of
   artificial intelligence:

   1. handcrafted knowledge, or id109 like ibm   s deep blue or
   watson

   2. statistical learning, which includes machine learning and deep
   learning

   3. contextual adaption, which involves constructing reliable,
   explanatory models for real-world phenomena using sparse data, like
   humans do

   as part of the current second wave of ai, deep learning algorithms work
   well because of what launchbury calls the    manifold hypothesis    (see
   below). in simplified terms, this refers to how different types of
   high-dimensional natural data tend to clump and be shaped differently
   when visualized in lower dimensions.

   by mathematically manipulating and separating data clumps, deep neural
   networks can distinguish different data types. while neural nets can
   achieve nuanced classification and predication capabilities, they are
   essentially what launchbury [105]calls    spreadsheets on steroids.

deep learning also has deep problems

   at the recent [106]ai by the bay conference, francois chollet
   emphasized that deep learning is simply more powerful pattern
   recognition than previous statistical and machine learning methods.
      the most important problem for ai today is abstraction and reasoning,   
   explains chollet, an ai researcher at google and famed inventor of
   widely used deep learning library [107]keras.    current supervised
   perception and id23 algorithms require lots of data,
   are terrible at planning, and are only doing straightforward pattern
   recognition.   

   by contrast, humans    learn from very few examples, can do very
   long-term planning, and are capable of forming abstract models of a
   situation and [manipulating] these models to achieve extreme
   generalization.   

   even simple human behaviors are laborious to teach to a deep learning
   algorithm. let   s examine a situation such as avoiding being hit by a
   car as you walk down the road. if you go the supervised learning route,
   you   d need huge data sets of car situations with clearly labeled
   actions to take, such as    stop    or    move.    then you   d need to train a
   neural network to learn the mapping between the situation and the
   appropriate action.

   if you go the id23 route, where you give an algorithm
   a goal and let it independently determine the ideal actions to take,
   the computer would need to die thousands of times before learning to
   avoid cars in different situations.

      you cannot achieve general intelligence simply by scaling up today   s
   deep learning techniques,    warns chollet.

   humans only need to be told once to avoid cars. we   re equipped with the
   ability to generalize from just a few examples and are capable of
   imagining (i.e. modeling) the dire consequences of being run over.
   without losing life or limb, most of us quickly learn to avoid being
   overrun by motor vehicles.

   while neural networks achieve statistically impressive results across
   large sample sizes, they are    individually unreliable    and often make
   mistakes humans would never make, such as classifying a toothbrush as a
   baseball bat.

   your results are only as good as your data. neural networks fed
   inaccurate or incomplete data will simply produce the wrong results.
   the outcomes can be both embarrassing and damaging. in two major pr
   debacles, google images incorrectly classified african americans as
   gorillas, while microsoft   s tay learned to spew racist,
   misogynistic hate speech after only hours training on twitter.

   undesirable biases are implicit in our input data. google   s massive
   id97 embeddings are built off of 3 million words from google news.
   the data set makes associations such as    father is to doctor as
   mother is to nurse,    which [108]reflect gender bias in our language.
   researchers such as tolga bolukbasi of boston university have taken to
   human ratings on mechanical turk to perform    hard de-biasing    to undo
   such associations.

   such tactics are essential since, according to bolukbasi,    word
   embeddings not only reflect stereotypes but can also amplify them.    if
   the term    doctor    is more associated with men than women, then an
   algorithm might prioritize male job applicants over female job
   applicants for open physician positions.

   finally, ian goodfellow, inventor of id3
   (gans), [109]showed that neural networks can be deliberately tricked
   with adversarial examples. by mathematically manipulating an image in a
   way that is undetectable to the human eye, sophisticated attackers can
   trick neural networks into grossly misclassifying objects.

   the dangers such adversarial attacks pose to ai systems are alarming,
   especially since adversarial images and original images seem identical
   to us. self-driving cars could be hijacked with seemingly innocuous
   signage and secure systems could be compromised by data that initially
   appears normal.

what   s beyond deep learning?

   how can we overcome the limitations of deep learning and proceed toward
   general artificial intelligence? chollet   s initial plan of attack
   involves using    super-human pattern recognition, like deep learning, to
   augment explicit search and formal systems,    starting with the field of
   mathematical proofs. automated theorem provers (atps) typically use
   brute force search and quickly hit combinatorial explosions in
   practical use. in the [110]deepmath project, chollet and his colleagues
   used deep learning to assist the proof search process, simulating a
   mathematician   s intuitions about what lemmas (a subsidiary or
   intermediate theorem in an argument or proof) might be relevant.

   another approach is to develop more explainable models. in handwriting
   recognition, neural nets currently need to be trained on tens to
   hundreds of thousands of examples to perform decent classification.
   instead of looking at just pixels, however, launchbury of darpa
   explains that generative models can be taught the strokes behind any
   given character and can use this physical construction information to
   disambiguate between similar numbers, such as a 9 or a 4.

   yann lecun, inventor of convolutional neural networks (id98s) and
   director of ai research at facebook, proposes    [111]energy-based
   models    as a method of overcoming limits in deep learning. typically, a
   neural network is trained to produce a single output, such as an image
   label or sentence translation. lecun   s energy-based models instead give
   an entire set of possible outputs, such as the many ways a sentence
   could be translated, along with scores for each configuration.

   geoffrey hinton, widely called the    father of deep learning    wants to
   replace neurons in neural networks with    capsules    that he
   believes more accurately reflect the cortical structure in the human
   mind.    evolution must have found an efficient way to adapt features
   that are early in a sensory pathway so that they are more helpful to
   features that are several stages later in the pathway,    hinton
   [112]explains. he hopes that capsule-based neural network architectures
   will be more resistant to the adversarial attacks that goodfellow
   illuminated above.

   perhaps all of these approaches to overcoming the limits of deep
   learning have truth value. perhaps none of them do. only time and
   continued investment in ai research will tell.
