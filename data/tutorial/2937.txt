five hundred deep learning papers, part ii (adding javascript)

   oct 15, 2015

   in my [3]last post, i shown a graph representing around five hundred
   papers regarding deep learning and their authors and citations.

adding javascript

   i added some pure js to make the svg graph a little interactive, i also
   included the svg in an [4]svgpanzoom so you can zoom and move through
   the graph.

instructions

   to interact with the graph, you need to have javascript enabled in your
   browser and let the page load completely before interacting. then:
     * hover on a node to enlarge and highlight that node and all
       connected ones
     * click on a node to hold/un-hold the highlighting
     * click on a node with the alt-key down to open the paper   s url in a
       new tab.
     * always remember that you can get information about a paper or an
       author by hovering for a second on a node.
     * use the + and - buttons to zoom the graph, you can also move in the
       zoomed area by dragging the graph and zooming by double-clicking on
       it
     * press the reset button if you have problems with the zoomable
       interface

   read the legend below to know the colour meanings.

   i hope i didn   t miss anything or left any bugs (if so, please let me
   know).

legend

     * nodes:
          + green : authors, size depend on the number of written papers,
            [5]very tiny at default zoom settings, but they get bigger if
            highlighted
          + pink to red: papers, coloured based on the publication date,
            sizes depend on the number of citations received per year
     * edges:
          + green :    authored by    relationship
          + earth blue (very few chilli pepper and magenta) :    cited by   
            relationship
     * interaction:
          + magenta: highlighted node on mouse hover
          + dimorphotheca magenta: highlighted node, toggled on mouse
            click
          + cyan: papers cited by highlighted papers or authors who wrote
            an highlighted paper
          + blue hosta: papers citing an highlighted paper
