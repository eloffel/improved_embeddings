code samples for "neural networks and deep learning"

   this repository contains code samples for my book on [75]"neural
   networks and deep learning".

   the code is written for python 2.6 or 2.7. michal daniel dobrzanski has
   a repository for python 3 [76]here. i will not be updating the current
   repository for python 3 compatibility.

   the program src/network3.py uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the theano
   library. it needs modification for compatibility with later versions of
   the library. i will not be making such modifications.

   as the code is written to accompany the book, i don't intend to add new
   features. however, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel free to
   fork and modify the code.
