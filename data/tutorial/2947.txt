examples from the ipython mini-book

   this repository contains all code examples from the book [76]learning
   ipython for interactive computing and data visualization, [77]packt
   publishing, by [78]cyrille rossant.

book overview

   this book is a beginner-level introduction to ipython for interactive
   python programming, high-performance numerical computing, and data
   visualization. it assumes nothing more than familiarity with python. it
   targets developers, students, teachers, hobbyists who know python a
   bit, and who want to learn ipython for the extended console, the
   notebook, and for more advanced scientific applications.

   the book first introduces ipython for interactive python and shell
   programming. it shows how ipython can considerably improve the
   productivity of a developer who creates, debugs, benchmarks and
   profiles python code.

   then, the reader learns the very basics of vector computing, and
   discovers how to load and analyze numerical and tabular data with numpy
   and pandas. the book shows the interactive visualization capabilities
   of the platform with matplotlib, scipy and pil. it also contains a few
   image processing examples.

   some techniques to accelerate python code are also demonstrated, using
   either interactive parallel computing features from ipython (using mpi
   or not), or cython to compile a portion of the code in c for really
   interesting speedups.

   finally, the book shows how ipython can be customized for advanced
   uses, notably with the creation of new extensions and magic commands.

code examples

   most files are ipython notebooks (.ipynb extension with json data).
   there are also some python external scripts (.py extension).

   the following modules are used in at least one example:
     * python 2.7
     * ipython 0.13+
     * numpy
     * pandas
     * scipy
     * matplotlib
     * matplotlib basemap
     * networkx
     * pyqt or pyside
     * cython
     * pil

   you can view the notebooks in the ipython notebook viewer (see links
   below).

chapter 2: interactive work with ipython

     * [79]example 1. we download and extract a social graph dataset (ego
       graphs of anonymous facebook users, obtained on the [80]snap
       project from stanford university). this example illustrates how to
       interact with the filesystem from ipython.
     * [81]example 2. here we explore with ipython the dataset downloaded
       in the previous example.
     * [82]example 3. we use the networkx package to process social
       graphs. we show how to explore simultaneously the data and a new
       python module as well in an ipython interactive session.

chapter 3: numerical computing with ipython

     * [83]example 1. we introduce here the very basics of vector
       computing and numpy multidimensional arrays. we show with a simple
       example what performance gains we can expect by using numpy instead
       of pure python loops.
     * [84]example 2. we generate multiplication tables with different
       methods, showing the performance benefits of using vectorized
       computations and broadcasting.
     * [85]example 3. we download and analyze a new dataset containing the
       geographical coordinates of all cities in the world, as well as the
       population for some of them. [86]this free dataset has been created
       by [87]maxmind.

chapter 4: interactive plotting and graphical interfaces

     * [88]example 1. this is a short introduction to the most basic
       plotting features of matplotlib.
     * [89]example 2. we use the world cities dataset from the previous
       example to create a human density world map with scipy and
       matplotlib.
     * [90]example 3. we show how to plot histograms of social data.
     * [91]example 4. we show a few customization options with matplotlib.
     * [92]example 5. we show how to use pil and scipy for some basic
       image processing algorithms.
     * [93]example 6. this is a 3d plot example with matplotlib.

chapter 5: high performance and parallel computing

     * [94]example 1. we demonstrate the most basic interactive parallel
       computing features of ipython.
     * [95]example 2. we show how monte carlo simulations can be
       parallelized with ipython.
     * [96]example 3. this is a simple mpi example executed from an
       interactive ipython session.
     * [97]example 4. we show how an imperative algorithm (sieve of
       eratosthenes) implemented in python can be accelerated with cython.
     * [98]example 5. we show how to use cython with numpy-based
       algorithms for dramatic speed improvements.

chapter 6: customizing ipython

     * [99]example 1. we show how to load ipython extensions, with an
       application to line-by-line profiling of python code.
     * [100]example 2. we show how to create a new ipython extension. as
       an example, we create a very basic extension for writing and
       executing c++ code in the ipython notebook.
     * [101]example 3. we illustrate the rich display features of the
       ipython notebook.
