introduction

   python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. it is very
   easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

installation

   mac os x and linux comes pre installed with python. windows users can
   download python from [87]https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

   to install ipython run,
$ pip install ipython[all]

   this will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook,
   qtconsole, tests etc.

installation from unofficial distributions

   installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome.
   anaconda and canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary python
   libraries and also ipython.

anaconda

   download anaconda from [88]https://www.continuum.io/downloads

   anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages.
   both python 2.7 and 3.4 options are available.

canopy

   download canopy from [89]https://store.enthought.com/downloads/#default

   canopy has a premium version which offers 300+ python packages. but the
   free version works just fine. canopy as of now supports only 2.7 but it
   comes with its own text editor and ipython environment.

launching ipython notebook

   from the terminal
ipython notebook

   in canopy and anaconda, open the respective terminals and execute the
   above.

how to learn from this resource?

   you can download the pdf copy from here : [90]get started with python

   it is better to download all the ipython notebooks from this repository
   [91]https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/python-lectures and learn it on
   the notebook itself rather than having to refer to a pdf.

   launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks.
   open each one of them
cell > all output > clear

   this will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each
   statement and learn interactively.
