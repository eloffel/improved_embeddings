introduction to python[11]  

   introduction to python is a resource for students who want to learn
   python as their first language, and for teachers who want a free and
   open curriculum to use with their students.

   if you are viewing the project through ipython notebook viewer, you
   might want to visit the student-facing pages at [12]introtopython.org.
   there is a cleaner navigation there, and some better overall styling.

start learning python[13]  

   if your computer is already set up to run python programs, you can get
   started with [14]hello world, your very first python program.

set up your programming environment[15]  

   if your computer is not yet set up to run python programs, we can show
   you how to [16]get python up and running.

contribute[17]  

   if you already know python and would like to help build introduction to
   python, see the project's [18]github page. you might want to look at
   [19]issue 17, which discusses a few specific ways you can contribute to
   the project.

about[23]  

   i teach high school math and science, and i also teach an introduction
   to programming class each fall. this project started as a series of
   ipython notebooks i wrote when teaching this year's programming class.

   this website does not host notebooks, it only renders notebooks
   available on other websites.
