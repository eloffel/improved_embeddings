foreword

   dynamic languages were seen in the past only as scripting languages,
   used to automate small tasks, but with the passing of time, they grew,
   matured and conquered their place in the market, to the point of
   calling the attention of the major providers of technology.

   several factors contributed to this change, such as the internet, open
   source software and agile development methodologies. the internet has
   enabled the sharing of information in a way unprecedented in history,
   which made possible the growth of open source software. dynamic
   languages are usually open source and share the same features and in
   some cases, the same goals.

   among the dynamic languages, python stands out as one of the most
   popular and powerful. there is a lively community of language users in
   the world, and this is reflected in active mailing lists and many tools
   available in open source.

   learning a new programming language means learning to think
   differently. and learn a dynamic language represents a paradigm shift
   even harder for those people who have spent years developing in static
   languages.

   the e-book "python para desenvolvedores" ("python for developers")
   aimed to fill a gap, which was the lack of free courseware in
   portuguese about the python programming language. the work was adopted
   as a support material for several universities in brazil, served as a
   reference for academic papers and has been downloaded over 100,000
   times from its official website.

   this e-book was originally written in portuguese and was translated by
   a small group of volunteers who do not speak english natively, so we
   ask for help from those who know better the english language, to refine
   the work, which we believe is a meaningful contribution to the python
   users around the world.

about the author

   luiz eduardo borges is an engineer and systems analyst, a graduate
   degree in computer graphics by state university of rio de janeiro
   (uerj). he has been working for over two decades in computer science
   under various ways.

using the book

   this book can be read in two different ways:
    1. the first way is the most interactive of all. here you have to
       clone the repository of the book to download all files .ipynb to
       your local machine. if you have ipython installed, you can then
       view all the chapters in your browser and run the code examples.
       this is one of the best ways to maximize your learning, but some
       dependencies must be installed on a machine.
    2. the second way is to use the site [71]nbviewer which presents the
       ipython notebook right in your browser. the content is updated
       according to the repository updates. to access the chapters, use
       the links on the content section above.
