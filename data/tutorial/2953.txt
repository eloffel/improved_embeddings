python for exploratory computing

   lots of books are written on scientific computing, but very few deal
   with the much more common exploratory computing (a term coined by
   fernando perez), which represents daily tasks of many scientists and
   engineers that try to solve problems but are not computer scientists.
   this set of notebooks is written for scientists and engineers who want
   to use python programming for exploratory computing, scripting, data
   analysis, and visualization. python makes many of these programming
   tasks quick, easy, and, probably most importantly, fun.

   no prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed. each notebook
   covers a specific topic and includes a number of exercises. the
   exercises should take less than 4 hours to complete for each notebook.
   answers to the exercises are given at the end of the notebook. there
   are two versions of each notebook: one with and one without output
   cells. the notebooks without the output cells are intended for people
   wanting to learn python. running the output cells is part of the
   learning process. all notebooks and accompanying data files may be
   downloaded by clicking on the 'download .zip file' button to the right.
   notebooks with output cells cells have the addition _sol and can be
   viewed by clicking on the links below.

   notebooks can be run after you install python and the appropriate
   packages. the easiest way to do this is to install an installer that
   includes python and a set of the most popular packages. the notebooks
   listed here are for python 3.x. they probably run on python 2. the
   three main options for python distributions with-batteries-included are
   [2]anaconda (mac, windows, linux), [3]canopy express (mac, windows,
   linux), and [4]pythonxy (windows). all these notebooks were developed
   with anaconda. after installing anaconda, start the navigator and then
   launch the jupyter notebook, which will open the jupyter notebook
   dashboard in your webbrowser (starting in your documents folder on
   windows and your home directory on a mac). use the dashboard to surf to
   the directory where you stored your notebooks (you can onely surf to
   lower directories not higher directories) and click on the one you want
   to open.
