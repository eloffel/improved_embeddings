       [94]https://jakevdp.github.io/pythondatasciencehandbook/
     * run the code using the jupyter notebooks available in this
       repository's [95]notebooks directory.
     * launch executable versions of these notebooks using [96]google
       colab: [97]colab
     * launch a live notebook server with these notebooks using
       [98]binder: [99]binder
     * buy the printed book through [100]o'reilly media

about

   the book was written and tested with python 3.5, though other python
   versions (including python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.

   the book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data
   in python: particularly [101]ipython, [102]numpy, [103]pandas,
   [104]matplotlib, [105]scikit-learn, and related packages. familiarity
   with python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction
   to the language itself, see the free companion project, [106]a
   whirlwind tour of python: it's a fast-paced introduction to the python
   language aimed at researchers and scientists.

   see [107]index.ipynb for an index of the notebooks available to
   accompany the text.

software

   the code in the book was tested with python 3.5, though most (but not
   all) will also work correctly with python 2.7 and other older python
   versions.

   the packages i used to run the code in the book are listed in
   [108]requirements.txt (note that some of these exact version numbers
   may not be available on your platform: you may have to tweak them for
   your own use). to install the requirements using [109]conda, run the
   following at the command-line:
$ conda install --file requirements.txt

   to create a stand-alone environment named pdsh with python 3.5 and all
   the required package versions, run the following:
$ conda create -n pdsh python=3.5 --file requirements.txt

   you can read more about using conda environments in the [110]managing
   environments section of the conda documentation.
