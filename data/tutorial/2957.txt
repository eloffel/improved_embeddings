   [84]title

   python modules and ipython notebooks, which accompany the book
   introduction to statistics with python

   [85]cover

   this repo contains three folders: isp, ipynb, and ipynb_slides

"isp": introduction to statistics with python

   all the python programs that go with the book:
     * code samples (also called quantlets)
     * solutions for the exercises in the book
     * code-listings, i.e. python programs printed in the book
     * code to generate the figures in the book

"ipynb": ipython notebooks

     * these notebooks are not used explicitly in the book, and contain
       important samples and solutions to statistical applications of
       python.
     * also contains a folder for data used by the ipython notebooks.

"ipynb_slides": corresponding reveal.js-slides

   reveal.js is a powerful presentation application, based on css and
   html5. it exists for all platforms (windows, linux, osx), and has to be
   installed on your computer if you want to use those slides.
     * you can either create the slides yourself from the ipynb-files,
       using the command
       jupyter nbconvert --to slides --reveal-prefix ".." *.ipynb
       (note that the string after "--reveal-prefix" indicates where your
       reveal.js directories can be found.)
     * or you copy this directory (i.e. ipynb_slides) to the location
       where your reveal.js directories are, and are ready to go right
       away.

errata

   the file [86]errata.pdf contains the a list of mistakes in the
   manuscript, and the corresponding corrections.
