practical_rl [112]binder

   an open course on id23 in the wild. taught on-campus
   at [113]hse and [114]ysda and maintained to be friendly to online
   students (both english and russian).

   note: this branch is an on-campus version of the for spring 2019 ysda
   and hse students. for full course materials, switch to the [115]master
   branch.

manifesto:

     * optimize for the curious. for all the materials that aren   t covered
       in detail there are links to more information and related materials
       (d.silver/sutton/blogs/whatever). assignments will have bonus
       sections if you want to dig deeper.
     * practicality first. everything essential to solving reinforcement
       learning problems is worth mentioning. we won't shun away from
       covering tricks and heuristics. for every major idea there should
       be a lab that makes you to    feel    it on a practical problem.
     * git-course. know a way to make the course better? noticed a typo in
       a formula? found a useful link? made the code more readable? made a
       version for alternative framework? you're awesome!
       [116]pull-request it!

course info

     * chat room for ysda & hse students is [117]here
     * grading rules for ysda & hse students is [118]here

       [121]lecture slides, [122]online student survival guide
     * anonymous [123]feedback form.
     * virtual course environment:
          + [124]installing dependencies on your local machine
            (recommended).
          + [125]google colab - set open -> github ->
            yandexdataschool/pracical_rl -> {branch name} and select any
