pandas cookbook

   [81]binder

   [82]pandas is a python library for doing data analysis. it's really
   fast and lets you do exploratory work incredibly quickly.

   the goal of this cookbook is to give you some concrete examples for
   getting started with pandas. the [83]docs are really comprehensive.
   however, i've often had people tell me that they have some trouble
   getting started, so these are examples with real-world data, and all
   the bugs and weirdness that entails.

   i'm working with 3 datasets right now
     * 311 calls in new york
     * how many people were on montr  al's bike paths in 2012
     * montreal's weather for 2012, hourly

   it comes with batteries (data) included, so you can try out all the
   examples right away.

table of contents

     * [84]a quick tour of the ipython notebook
       shows off ipython's awesome tab completion and magic functions.
     * [85]chapter 1: reading from a csv
       reading your data into pandas is pretty much the easiest thing.
       even when the encoding is wrong!
     * [86]chapter 2: selecting data & finding the most common complaint
       type
       it's not totally obvious how to select data from a pandas
       dataframe. here i explain the basics (how to take slices and get
       columns)
     * [87]chapter 3: which borough has the most noise complaints? (or,
       more selecting data)
       here we get into serious slicing and dicing and learn how to filter
       dataframes in complicated ways, really fast.
     * [88]chapter 4: find out on which weekday people bike the most with
       groupby and aggregate
       the groupby/aggregate is seriously my favorite thing about pandas
       and i use it all the time. you should probably read this.
     * [89]chapter 5: combining dataframes and scraping canadian weather
       data
       here you get to find out if it's cold in montreal in the winter
       (spoiler: yes). web scraping with pandas is fun!
     * [90]chapter 6: string operations! which month was the snowiest?
       strings with pandas are great. it has all these vectorized string
       operations and they're the best. we will turn a bunch of strings
       containing "snow" into vectors of numbers in a trice.
     * [91]chapter 7: cleaning up messy data
       cleaning up messy data is never a joy, but with pandas it's easier
       <3
     * [92]chapter 8: parsing unix timestamps
       this is basically a quick trick that took me 2 days to figure out.
     * [93]chapter 9 - loading data from sql databases
       how to load data from an sql database into pandas, with examples
       using sqlite3, postgresql, and mysql.

how to use this cookbook

   the easiest way is to try it out instantly online using binder's
   awesome service. [94]start by clicking here, wait for it to launch,
   then click on "cookbook", and you'll be off to the races! it will let
   you run all the code interactively without having to install anything
   on your computer.

   to install it locally , you'll need an up-to-date version of ipython
   notebook (>= 3.0) and n your computer pandas (>=0.13) for this to work
   properly. it's set up to work with python 2.7.

   you can get these using pip (you may want to do this inside a virtual
   environment to avoid conflicting with your other libraries).
  pip install -r requirements.txt

   this can be difficult to get set up and require you to compile a whole
   bunch of things. i instead use and recommend [95]anaconda, which is a
   python distribution which will give you everything you need. it's free
   and open source.

   once you have pandas and ipython, you can get going!
git clone https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook.git
cd pandas-cookbook/cookbook
ipython notebook

   a tab should open up in your browser at http://localhost:8888

   happy pandas!

running the cookbook inside docker container.

   this repository contains dockerfile and can be built into a docker
   container. to build the container run following command from inside of
   the repository directory:
docker build -t jvns/pandas-cookbook -f dockerfile-local .

   run the container:
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -e "password=makeapassword" <image id>

   you can find out about the id of the image, by checking
docker images

   after starting the container, you can access ipython notebook with the
   cookbook on port 8888. remember to use https and authenticate with
   makeapassword.
https://<docker ip>:8888

contribute!

   if you see something wrong, or there's something you'd like to learn
   that i haven't explained here, or there's something you know about that
   you would like to share, create an issue! send me email! send a pull
   request!
