introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn

   this video series will teach you how to solve machine learning problems
   using python's popular scikit-learn library. it was [93]featured on
   kaggle's blog in 2015.

   there are 9 video tutorials totaling 4 hours, each with a corresponding
   jupyter notebook. the notebook contains everything you see in the
   video: code, output, images, and comments.

   note: the notebooks in this repository have been updated to use python
   3.6 and scikit-learn 0.19.1. the original notebooks (shown in the
   video) used python 2.7 and scikit-learn 0.16, and can be downloaded
   from the [94]archive branch. you can read about how i updated the code
   in this [95]blog post.

   you can [96]watch the entire series on youtube, and [97]view all of the
   notebooks using nbviewer.

   [98]watch the first tutorial video

   once you complete this video series, i recommend enrolling in my online
   course, [99]machine learning with text in python, to gain a deeper
   understanding of scikit-learn and natural language processing.

bonus video

   at the pycon 2016 conference, i taught a 3-hour tutorial that builds
   upon this video series and focuses on text-based data. you can watch
   the [127]tutorial video on youtube.

   here are the topics i covered:
    1. model building in scikit-learn (refresher)
    2. representing text as numerical data
    3. reading a text-based dataset into pandas
    4. vectorizing our dataset
    5. building and evaluating a model
    6. comparing models
    7. examining a model for further insight
    8. practicing this workflow on another dataset
    9. tuning the vectorizer (discussion)
