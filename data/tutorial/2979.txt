                    data 8: the foundations of data science

   the uc berkeley foundations of data science course combines three
   perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and
   real-world relevance. given data arising from some real-world
   phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that
   phenomenon? the course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer
   programming and statistical id136, in conjunction with hands-on
   analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document
   collections, geographical data, and social networks. it delves into
   social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.

   the course is offered in partnership with the [2]berkeley division of
   data sciences.

materials

   all materials for the course, including the textbook and assignments,
   are available for free online under a creative commons license.

   textbook: [13]computational and inferential thinking: the foundations
   of data science is a free online textbook that includes interactive
   jupyter notebooks and public data sets for all examples. the textbook
   source is maintained as an [14]open source project.

   assignments: [15]all assignments from the spring 2017 course offering,
   as well as [16]assignments from the fall 2016 offering are available as
   jupyter notebooks. the notebooks assume a python 3 installation with
   the standard modules from [17]an anaconda installation such as numpy
   and matplotlib, as well as the [18]datascience and [19]okpy modules.

   lecture materials: all [20]lecture videos from fall 2016 are hosted by
   youtube. slides as [21]pdf from fall 2016 and [22]google slides and
   jupyter notebooks from spring 2017 are linked from the respective
   course calendars. to request access to the source of the slides for
   instructional purposes, please fill out our [23]data 8 instructor
   interest form.

infrastructure

   all of the software components of the course are maintained as
   open-source projects. we encourage you to contact us if you want any
   help using them. we also have prepared [24]a guide on how to set up
   course infrastructure.

   the [25]datascience module: the course uses a module for table
   manipulation, charts, and maps that provides an interface appropriate
   for an introductory course. the table class is similar to a dataframe
   in [26]pandas, but explicitly does not support row indexes,
   hierarchical indexes, time series data, missing values, slicing, and
   many other advanced features that can complicate table manipulation for
   novices. the charting features use matplotlib, but customize the output
   to match the pedagogical goals of the course. the mapping features are
   implemented by [27]folium, but aim to simplify working with tables and
   geojson files. while the datascience module can certainly be used
   outside the context of the course, it was specifically designed to
   support the data 8 curriculum, while setting up students to transition
   to more standard tools such as pandas.

   the [28]ok autograder and submission system: the assignments depend on
   a python-based autograder that includes client-side tests available to
   students at any time and server-side tests intended for
   correctness-based grading. assignments are distributed with a folder of
   named tests, which include test cases. these test cases are invoked
   from within a notebook.

   hosted computing environment: we provide a hosted environment for our
   students to edit and execute their notebooks. it includes two
   components, a [29]kubernetes-based deployment of jupyterhub that we
   have specifically designed for courses, and an [30]assignment server
   that loads assignments into the students    environment.

   if you want more information about any of these tools, please fill out
   our [31]data 8 instructor interest form or email denero@berkeley.edu.
