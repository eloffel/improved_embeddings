definition

   a simple neural network for solving a xor function is a common task and
   is mostly required for our studies and other stuff . so , i have given
   some examples and some basic neural networks used to solve them more
   easily and there is a bonus program for you too .

sample

   a network with one hidden layer containing two neurons should be enough
   to separate the xor problem. follow these steps :-

     the first neuron acts as an or gate and the second one as a not and
     gate.

     add both the neurons and if they pass the treshold it   s positive.
     you can just use linear decision neurons for this with adjusting the
     biases for the tresholds.

     the inputs of the not and gate should be negative for the 0/1
     inputs.

     this picture should make it more clear, the values on the
     connections are the weights, the values in the neurons are the
     biases, the decision functions act as 0/1 decisions (or just the
     sign function works in this case too).

note-

     if you are using basic id119 (with no other optimization,
     such as momentum), and a minimal network 2 inputs, 2 hidden neurons,
     1 output neuron, then it is definitely possible to train it to learn
     xor, but it can be quite tricky and unreliable.

   back propagation solution network

   because of the nature of the activation function, the activity on the
   output node can never reach either    0    or    1   . we take values of less
   than 0.1 as equal to 0, and greater than 0.9 as equal to 1.

   if the network seems to be stuck, it has hit what is called a    local
   minimum   . keep your eye on the bias of the hidden node and wait. it
   will eventually head towards zero. as it approaches zero, the network
   will get out of the local minimum, and will shortly complete. this is
   because of a    momentum turn    that is used in the calculation of the
   weights.

   conditional back propagation network

   this network can learn any logical relationship expressible in a truth
   table of this sort. in the following, you can change the desired
   output, and train the network to produce that output.

   back propagation for any binary logical function

   this network makes use of binary values and is used in less iterative
   steps. it   s most handy and is quicker in getting the solution.

   mlp( multi layered id88

   this is a complex network with more basic nodes used and here, the
   feature value is set.
