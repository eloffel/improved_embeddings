10 days of deep learning

   i took a challenge upon myself to fast pace my deep learning skills
   using the python data stack. i will take on a real life practical
   challenge everyday and try to solve it using deep learning (starting
   from the basics)

day 1

     text classification using multi layered id88 and comparing
     with nn's

todo:

    1. use learning rate decay
    2. batch id172
    3. more number of epochs

day 2

     text classification using tfidf feature matrix and mlp

todo:

    1. use lrd, batch normalisation
    2. use dropout
    3. further process the tfidf matrix using truncatedsvd

day 3

     text classification using id97 and mlp

todo:

    1. use lrd, batch normalisation, dropout
    2. tweaking id97 hyperparams

day 4

     text classification using convolutional neural networks

todo:

    1. use lrd, batch normalisation, dropout
    2. try a multi-layer convolutional network

day 5

     text classification using recurrent neural networks

todo:

    1. use lrd, batch normalisation, dropout
    2. use a combination of id98 and id56
