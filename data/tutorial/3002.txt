optimizing an approximation of id8 for id57

   in this project, an approximation of id8-n is derived. this
   approximation is linearly factorizable into the individual scores of
   sentences which can be then optimize via integer id135
   (ilp). this repositery contains the code for our optimizer which takes
   scored sentences and extract the best summary according to the id8
   approximation.

     abstract: this paper presents a problem-reduction approach to
     extractive id57, where we propose a
     reduction to the problem of scoring individual sentences with their
     id8 scores based on supervised learning. for the summarization,
     which builds upon the sentence scores, we derive an approximation of
     the id8 score of a set of sentences, and define a principled
     discrete optimization problem for sentence selection. we perform a
     detailed experimental evaluation on two duc datasets to demonstrate
     the validity of our approach and will make the code freely
     available. our approach establishes a prerequisite for leveraging
     and exploiting a variety of existing techniques from machine
     learning for id57.

requirements

     * pulp 1.6.1 ([69]https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulp)
     * numpy 1.11.1 ([70]http://www.numpy.org)

expected results

   to check the installation, a trivial toy example is computed by
   running: python ilp_r.py

parameter description

     * sentences
          + a list of the sentences with their scores [(sentence, score)].
     * length_constraint
          + the length constraint of the summary in number of words.
     * [overlap_discount]
          + hyper-parameter to specify the discount in the pairwise
            interactions between sentences.
     * [damping]
          + factor to give some control on the relative importance between
            sentence scores and pairwise interactions.
     * [max_depth]
          + use for computation efficiency, only consider the top
            max_depth sentences.
     * [n]
          + n for id165s. indicates whether the optimizer should work
            with unigrams, bigrams, ...
