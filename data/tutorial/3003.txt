train faster-rid98 on a new dataset

   to train this faster rid98 model on a new dataset, follow the
   instructions below.

step 1: download faster-rid98:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rid98.git
cd $faster-rid98-root/lib
make
cd $faster-rid98-root/caffe-fast-rid98
cp makefile.config.example makefile.config

   note: you may need to update your caffe through:
cd caffe-fast-rid98
git remote add caffe https://github.com/bvlc/caffe.git
git fetch caffe
git merge -x theirs caffe/master

   then change "makefile.config" : first, uncomment "with_python_layer :=
   1" then uncomment "use_cudnn := 1" if you'd like to use gpu
   (recommended), i assume you've already installed gpu, cuda, cudnn. you
   may also need to add hdf5 path to your libraries directory.
make -j8 && make pycaffe

step 2: download models and run a demo

cd ..
./data/scripts/fetch_faster_rid98_models.sh
./data/scripts/fetch_id163_models.sh

   run demo.py "python ./tools/demo.py --gpu 0 --net vgg16"

   make sure you've successfully finished all parts mentioned above
   without error message. then you can proceed.

step 3: prepare to train your model.

   my strategy is to prepare the data as the same format as the pascal_voc
   data. first, download pascal_voc data:
wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/voc/voc2007/voctrainval_06-nov-2007.tar

wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/voc/voc2007/voctest_06-nov-2007.tar

wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/voc/voc2007/vocdevkit_08-jun-2007.tar

tar xvf voctrainval_06-nov-2007.tar

tar xvf voctest_06-nov-2007.tar

tar xvf vocdevkit_08-jun-2007.tar

   then you should linke this dataset with py-faster-rid98:
cd $faster-rid98-root/data

ln -s $your/data/directory/vocdevkit vocdevkit2007

step 4: prepare your own dataset

   this is the most important step, and you should modify multiple files
   inside $faster-rid98-root/lib.

   (1) transform your data into the format of voc2007. the pascal voc 2007
   dataset are composed of three folders: imagesets, jpegimages,
   annotations. you should build your own dataset like this. the
   annotations file should be ".xml" format. create the dataset using the
   script "tools/create_xml.py". then you divide your dataset into
   trainval, val, train, test part. then you delete the original "voc2007"
   folder inside the "vocdevkit" folder with the new dataset folder you
   just created.

   (2) change the file "$faster-rid98-root/lib/datasets/pascal_voc.py" line
   30 "self._classes" to the actuall classes of your datasets

   since you are using a different dataset, the number of classes might be
   different and the format of your picture might also be different from
   ".jpg", so you may also need to change "self._image_ext = '.jpg'"
   accordingly.

   (3) comment "$faster-rid98-root/lib/datasets/imdb.py" line 111 "assert
   ..." and add these codes below:
for iii in range(boxes.shape[0]):
    if boxes[iii, 0] > boxes[iii, 2]:
                  boxes[iii, 0] = 0

   (4) file "$faster-rid98-root/lib/rpn/proposal_target_layer.py" line 124
   should be "cls = int(clss[ind])" and line 166 should be
   "...size=int(fg_rois_per_this_image),..." and line 184 should be
   "labels[int(fg_rois_per_this_image):] = 0" and line 177 should be " ...
   size=int(bg_rois_per_this_image), ...".

   (5) change the number of classes in your
   "models/pascal_voc/faster_rid98_end2end" prototxt file. the original 21
   and 84 should be replaced with new numbers

   (6) in lib/fast_rid98/train.py import google.protobuf.text_format as
   text_format, then change the line "pb2.text_format..." as
   "text_format..."

step 5: train your model!

   before training your model, remember to delete the file "data/cache/*",
   in case you have any previous training.
cd $faster-rid98-root
./experiments/scripts/faster_rid98_end2end.sh 0 vgg16 pascal_voc
