   youtube contains a great many videos on the topic of machine learning,
   but it can be hard to figure out what's worth watching, especially
   since 300 hours of video are uploaded to youtube every minute. here we
   bring you the most popular recent machine learning videos worth
   watching. this post updates a previous very popular post [45]top 10
   machine learning videos on youtube from 2015.  we also added a few top
   relevant playlists.

   here are the top videos ranked by views as of may 3, 2017.

   [46]1. mari/o - machine learning for video games (4.3m views)

   this fun demo video shows how machine learning can be applied to video
   games. this is achieved using neural networks and id107.
   what's really great about this video is how the author concisely
   describes how the neural network acts to achieve the given performance.
   having played super mario world myself, i can say the gameplay is
   extremely impressive, learned or not!

   [47]2. machine learning (stanford) (1.4m views)

   this is the first video (lecture 1 published 8 years ago) in the great
   series of stanford machine learning lectures given by andrew ng. this
   would make a good starting point for self-learning the essentials of
   machine learning. if the material in this video appeals to you, his
   [48]coursera course may also appeal to you.

   3. [49]google's deep mind explained! - self learning a.i. (1.3m views)

   the video uploaded by coldfusion (formally known as coldfustion) to
   show     the cutting edge of the world around us in a fun relaxed
   atmosphere   ; including example sources: why alphago is not an "expert
   system   ,    inside deepmind    nature video,    alphago and the future of
   artificial intelligence    bbc newsnight.

   4. [50]genetic algorithm. learning to jump over ball. (1.05m views)

   this animation lasts less than 3 minutes but illustrated automated
   design of motion strategy using genetic algorithm and neural network.
   learning simple creature to jump over ball.

   [51]5. tensorflow: open source machine learning (957k views)

   this video introduces tensorflow. it is an open source software library
   for numerical computation using data flow graphs. originally developed
   by researchers and engineers working on the google brain team within
   google's machine intelligence research organization for the purposes of
   conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research.

   6. [52]hello world - machine learning recipes #1 (574k views)

   this video uploaded by google developers. six lines of python is all it
   takes to write your first machine learning program! in this episode,
   we'll briefly introduce what machine learning is and why it's
   important. then, we'll follow a recipe for supervised learning (a
   technique to create a classifier from examples) and code it up.

   7. [53]caltech machine learning (504,870 views)

   this video is also the start to a lecture series on machine learning.
   with this series, it is given by professor yaser abu-mostafa of
   caltech. this series also has an [54]online course, which also has a
   great companion textbook. this is another great way to learn the
   foundations of machine learning.

   8. [55]the next generation of neural networks (468,321 views)

   this google tech talk by geoffrey hinton covers the next generation of
   neural networks. this acts as a good introduction to deep learning.
   it's a few years old, but still acts as a great technical introduction
   to the topic.

   9. [56]deep learning: intelligence from big data (451,046 views)

   this panel, hosted by the stanford graduate school of business, has
   many industry professionals discussing the impact of deep learning.
   this is interesting because it gives many viewpoints and different ways
   of understanding the same concept. this is a good video to watch to get
   a diversity of opinions.

   10[57]. learning: support vector machines (362,417 views)

   this is a lecture of a course at mit (mit 6.034 artificial
   intelligence, fall 2010). in this lecture, patrick winston (instructor)
   showed support vector machines in some mathematical detail. he used
   lagrange multipliers to maximize the width of the street given certain
   constraints. if needed, we transform vectors into another space, using
   a id81.
