   [95]license
   [96]conda package for skll [97]supported python versions for skll
   [98]doi for citing skll 1.0.0

   this python package provides command-line utilities to make it easier
   to run machine learning experiments with scikit-learn. one of the
   primary goals of our project is to make it so that you can run
   scikit-learn experiments without actually needing to write any code
   other than what you used to generate/extract the features.

command-line interface

   the main utility we provide is called run_experiment and it can be used
   to easily run a series of learners on datasets specified in a
   configuration file like:
[general]
experiment_name = titanic_evaluate_tuned
# valid tasks: cross_validate, evaluate, predict, train
task = evaluate

[input]
# these directories could also be absolute paths
# (and must be if you're not running things in local mode)
train_directory = train
test_directory = dev
# can specify multiple sets of feature files that are merged together automatica
lly
# (even across formats)
featuresets = [["family.ndj", "misc.csv", "socioeconomic.arff", "vitals.csv"]]
# list of scikit-learn learners to use
learners = ["randomforestclassifier", "decisiontreeclassifier", "svc", "multinom
ialnb"]
# column in csv containing labels to predict
label_col = survived
# column in csv containing instance ids (if any)
id_col = passengerid

[tuning]
# should we tune parameters of all learners by searching provided parameter grid
s?
grid_search = true
# function to maximize when performing grid search
objectives = ['accuracy']

[output]
# also compute the area under the roc curve as an additional metric
metrics = ['roc_auc']
# the following can/should be absolute paths
log = output
results = output
predictions = output
models = output

   for more information about getting started with run_experiment, please
   check out [99]our tutorial, or [100]our config file specs.

   we also provide utilities for:
     * [101]converting between machine learning toolkit formats (e.g.,
       arff, csv, megam)
     * [102]filtering feature files
     * [103]joining feature files
     * [104]other common tasks

python api

   if you just want to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate learning code,
   you can also use our simple python api which also supports pandas
   dataframes. the main way you'll want to use the api is through the
   learner and reader classes. for more details on our api, see [105]the
   documentation.

   while our api can be broadly useful, it should be noted that the
   command-line utilities are intended as the primary way of using skll.
   the api is just a nice side-effect of our developing the utilities.

a note on pronunciation

   [106]skll logo
   [107]doc/spacer.png

   scikit-learn laboratory (skll) is pronounced "skull": that's where the
   learning happens.
