what is loso?

   loso is a chinese segmentation system written in python. it was
   developed by victor lin ([69]bornstub@gmail.com) for plurk inc.

copyright & licnese

   copyright of loso owns by plurk inc. it is an open source under bsd
   license.

setup loso

   to install loso, clone the repo and run following command
cd loso
python setup.py develop

   also, you need to run a [70]redis database for storing the lexicon
   database. also, you need to copy configuration template and modify it.
cp default.yaml myconf.yaml
vim myconf.yaml

   to use your configuration, you have to set the configuration
   environment variable loso_config_file. for example:
loso_config_file=myconfig.yaml python setup.py server

use loso

   loso determines segmentation according to the lexicon database, and the
   algorithm is based on hidden makov model, therefore, it is not possible
   to use the service before building a lexicon database.

   to feed a text file to the database, here you can run
python setup.py feed -f /home/victorlin/plurk_src/realtime_search/word_segment/s
ample_data/sample_tr_ch

   to clean the database, you can run
python setup.py reset

   to interact and test for splitting terms, here you can run
python setup.py interact

   for example
text:                                                             
....
                                                                 

   to use the segmentation service as xmlrpc service, here you can run
python setup.py serve

   following is a simple python program for showing how to use it
import xmlrpclib

proxy = xmlrpclib.serverproxy("http://localhost:5566/")

terms = proxy.splitterms(u'                                                            ')
print ' '.join(terms)

   and the output should be
