handling imbalanced dataset in supervised learning using family of smote
algorithm.

   consider a problem where you are working on a machine learning
   classification problem. you get an accuracy of 98% and you are very
   happy. but that happiness doesn   t last long when you look at the
   confusion matrix and realize that majority class is 98% of the total
   data and all examples are classified as majority class. welcome to the
   real world of imbalanced data sets!!

   some of the well-known examples of imbalanced data sets are

   1 - fraud detection:  where number of fraud cases could be much smaller
   than non-fraudulent transactions.

   2- prediction of disputed / delayed invoices: where the problem is to
   predict default / disputed invoices.

   3- predictive maintenance data sets, etc

   in all the above examples, the cost of mis-classifying minority class
   could very high. that means, if i am not able to identify the fraud
   cases correctly, the model won   t be useful.


   there are multiple ways of handling unbalanced data sets. some of them
   are : collecting more data, trying out different ml algorithms,
   modifying class weights, penalizing the models, using anomaly detection
   techniques, oversampling and under sampling techniques etc.

   i am focusing mainly on smote based oversampling techniques in this
   article. as a data scientist you might not have direct control over
   collection of more data which might need various approvals from client,
   top management and could also take more time etc. also, applying class
   weights or too much parameter tuning can lead to overfitting.
   undersampling technique can lead to loss of important information. but
   that might not be the case with oversampling techniques. oversampling
   methods can be easily tried and embedded in your framework.

over sampling algorithms based on smote

   1-smote: synthetic minority over sampling technique (smote) algorithm
   applies knn approach where it selects k nearest neighbors, joins them
   and creates the synthetic samples in the space. the algorithm takes the
   feature vectors and its nearest neighbors, computes the distance
   between these vectors. the difference is multiplied by random number
   between (0, 1) and it is added back to feature. smote algorithm is a
   pioneer algorithm and many other algorithms are derived from smote.

   reference: [37]smote

   r implementation:  smotefamily, unbalanced, dmwr

   python implementation: imblearn

   [38][imbdata2.png?width=750]

   2- adasyn:  adaptive synthetic (adasyn) is based on the idea of
   adaptively generating minority data samples according to their
   distributions using k nearest neighbor. the algorithm adaptively
   updates the distribution and there are no assumptions made for the
   underlying distribution of the data.  the algorithm uses euclidean
   distance for knn algorithm. the key difference between adasyn and smote
   is that the former uses a density distribution, as a criterion to
   automatically decide the number of synthetic samples that must be
   generated for each minority sample by adaptively changing the weights
   of the different minority samples to compensate for the skewed
   distributions. the latter generates the same number of synthetic
   samples for each original minority sample.

   reference: [39]adasyn

   r implementation: smotefamily

   python implementation:  imblearn


   3- ans: adaptive neighbor synthetic (ans) dynamically adapts the number
   of neighbors needed for oversampling around different minority regions.
   this algorithm eliminates the parameter k of smote for a dataset and
   assign different number of neighbors for each positive instance. every
   parameter for this technique is automatically set within the algorithm
   making it become parameter free.

   reference: [40]ans

   r implementation: smotefamily


   4- border smote: borderline-smote generates the synthetic sample along
   the borderline of minority and majority classes. this also helps in
   separating out the minority and majority classes.

   reference - [41]border smote

   r implementation: smotefamily

   [42][imbdata3.png?width=750]

   5-safe level smote: safe level is defined as the number of a positive
   instances in k nearest neighbors. if the safe level of an instance is
   close to 0, the instance is nearly noise. if it is close to k, the
   instance is considered safe. each synthetic instance is generated in
   safe position by considering the safe level ratio of instances. in
   contrast, smote and borderline-smote may generate synthetic instances
   in unsuitable locations, such as overlapping regions and noise regions.

   reference: [43]sls

   r implementation: smotefamily


   6- dbsmote: density-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique is
   based on id91 algorithm dbscan. the clusters are discovered by
   dbscan algorithm. dbsmote generates synthetic instances along a
   shortest path from each positive instance to a pseudo-centroid of a
   minority-class cluster

   reference: [44]dbsmote

   r implementation: smotefamily


   combining oversampling and undersampling:

   1-smotetomek: tomek links can be used as an under-sampling method or as
   a data cleaning method. tomek links to the over-sampled training set as
   a data cleaning method. thus, instead of removing only the majority
   class examples that form tomek links, examples from both classes are
   removed

   reference: [45]smote tomek

   python implementation: imblearn

   [46][imbdata4.png]

   2-smoteenn: just like tomek, edited nearest neighbor removes any
   example whose class label differs from the class of at least two of its
   three nearest neighbors. the enn method removes the instances of the
   majority class whose prediction made by knn method is different from
   the majority class. enn method can remove both the noisy examples as
   borderline examples, providing a smoother decision surface. enn tends
   to remove more examples than the tomek links does, so it is expected
   that it will provide a more in depth data cleaning

   [47][imbdata5.png]

   below is the list of packages and algorithms available in python and r.

python

   1- imblearn

   the under sampling has following algorithms implemented:
    1. cluster centroids
    2. condensed nearest neighbor
    3. edited nearest neighbors
    4. repeated edited nearest neighbors
    5. all knn
    6. instance hardness threshold
    7. near miss
    8. neighborhood cleaning rule
    9. one sided selection
   10. random under sampler
   11. tomek links

   while over sampling has following algorithms implemented:

        1.adasyn

        2.random over sampler

        3.smote

   the combination of oversampling and undersampling covers smoteenn and
   smotetomek

    link :      [48]imblearn

r:

   1- rose: the package only implements the algorithm random over sampling

   link: [49]rose

   2- dmwr: the package reads as    data mining with r    and comes with
   implementation  of smote algorithm. smote algorithm uses nearest
   neighbor concept to oversample the minority class.

   link: [50]dmwr

   3- unbalanced: the unbalanced package has implementation of following
   algorithms
    1. tomek link,
    2. condensed nearest neighbor(id98),
    3. one sided selection(oss),
    4. edited nearest neighbor(enn),
    5. neighborhood cleaning rule (ncl),
    6. smote.

   the unbalanced package also offers the implementation of racing
   algorithm which suggest best method for unbalanced dataset.


   4- smotefamily :
