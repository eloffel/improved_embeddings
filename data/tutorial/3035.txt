   10 days? hm, that   s definitely a challenging task :). however, i think
   that 10 days is also definitely a time frame where you can get a pretty
   good overview of machine learning field and maybe get started to apply
   some techniques to your problems.

   after reading an introduction to the 3 different subfields (supervised
   learning, unsupervised learning, and id23). i would
   probably spend the time on simple (yet useful) algorithms that are
   representative of these fields (and maybe save id23
   for later). e.g., simple id75 and ridge regression for
   regression analysis, id28 and k-nearest neighbors for
   classification, and id116 and hierarchical id91 for id91
   tasks. once you understand the goals of each algorithm and how they try
   to solve a particular problem, it is fairly easy to add more algorithms
   and approaches to your repertoire. however, besides algorithms, it is
   also important to know how to prepare your data (feature selection,
   transformation, and compression) and how to evaluate your models.
   maybe, as a starter, you could check out our machine learning in
   scikit-learn tutorial at scipy 2016. it   s approx. 6 hours and
   summarizes most of the basics while introducing the scikit-learn
   library, which can come in handy for implementation and further
   studies:

   if you are interested in understanding the math behind the algorithms,
   andrew ng   s cousera course [15]machine learning - stanford university |
   coursera (and my book) provide a gentle introduction, but i realize
   that this is probably not within the scope of 10 days :).
