   here is a bare bones take on learning machine learning with python, a
   complete course for the quick study hacker with no time (or patience)
   to spare.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [39]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   sure, there are lots of tutorials and overviews on gaining the insight
   you need into picking up machine learning, but many (most?) of them
   take the long view: get a foundation first, learn the basics next, then
   learn a bit of complementary theory before getting too far ahead of
   yourself in practical terms, take a step back, try your hand at a few
   examples, undertake a project on your own... this is all great advice,
   and a great approach to learning... well, almost anything.

                                   gorilla
                  i know, i know... too corny to be funny.

   but let's say you're not starting from scratch. or you're a savant. or
   you don't have the patience to go through all of the motions. let's say
   you want to hit the ground running and scramble under pressure to learn
   everything right now. the best approach? ideally, no, but i'm in no
   position to judge. i work best under pressure, and can sympathize with
   the impatient among us who just want to get on with things.

   let's be clear: this is assuredly not the path to achieve greatness
   quickly. with learning machine learning -- much as with machine
   learning itself -- there is no free lunch. however, getting a practical
   overview for the purposes of testing the waters and deciding whether
   learning more about the topic is what you are after, or if you already
   posses a solid theoretical understanding of much of these (or related)
   concepts, the way of the guerrilla may be for you.

   with that in mind, here is a bare bones take on learning machine
   learning with python, a complete course for the quick study hacker with
   no time (or patience) to spare.

preparing and learning python


   since this is all about python machine learning, we start with google's
   python course. the video playlist is below, and the accompanying
   materials are [40]found here.

                                   iframe:
   [41]https://www.youtube.com/embed/tktzob2vjuk?list=plfzerfzhgqztmgwfvez
                               qbnpc1ck0i6cql

   once we get that taken care of, we want to install the python
   scientific stack using [42]anaconda, as shown in the below video.

            iframe: [43]https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjc6ldi3hwk

machine learning crash course


   for a very crash course on machine learning itself, watch melanie
   warrick's "how to get started with machine learning" talk from pycon
   2014.

            iframe: [44]https://www.youtube.com/embed/uborfxosvys

pandas for data analysis


   since much data wrangling, munging, and manipulation is done using the
   [45]pandas library, getting a solid look at data preparation with the
   library is essential enough to spend some time learning it well. watch
   jonathan rocher's scipy 2016 tutorial on this very subject.

            iframe: [46]https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ohws7j1hva

scikit-learn for machine learning


   and on to the undisputed heavyweight for python machine learning:
   [47]scikit-learn. this is a general purpose machine learning library
   with dozens of algorithms and associated tools refined through years of
   open source collaboration. to get going with scikit-learn, watch
   andreas mueller and sebastian raschka's tutorial in 2 parts, also from
   scipy 2016.

            iframe: [49]https://www.youtube.com/embed/cte8fycpylk

deep learning without a phd


   on to deep learning... this talk by martin g  rner covers an
   introduction to deep learning, and gives treatment of both
   convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures, all with an
   emphasis on the practical. see the video of the talk below, and check
   out the [50]corresponding code lab here (covers convolutional neural
   networks).

                                   iframe:
   [51]https://www.youtube.com/embed/vq2nnj4g6n0?list=plfzerfzhgqzqjus7lxn
                               vxngwagjyd7pul

looking for more?


   a logical next step may be covering individual algorithms in more
   depth, and these are but a few additional modest resources in this
   direction:
     * [52]7 steps to mastering machine learning with python
     * [53]7 more steps to mastering machine learning with python
     * [54]7 steps to understanding deep learning


   hopefully this is enough to get the motivated hacker up and practicing
   with machine learning in a few days. it's not a complete course,
   however; understanding the underlying statistical building blocks of
   machine learning takes years, and becoming proficient in the practical
   will take hundreds of hours of doing. however, no one said you can't
   get your hands dirty and have some introductory fun on the way to
   perfecting a new craft.
