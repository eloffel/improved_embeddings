25 must know terms & concepts for beginners in deep learning

   [96]dishashree gupta, may 21, 2017

     artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning         whatever
     you   re doing if you don   t understand it         learn it. because
     otherwise you   re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.

     -mark cuban

   this statement from mark cuban might sound drastic     but its message is
   spot on! we are in middle of a revolution     a revolution caused by
   [del: big :del] huge data and a ton of computational power.

   for a minute, think how a person would feel in early 20th century if he
   / she did not understand electricity. you would have been used to doing
   things in a particular manner for ages and all of a sudden things
   around you started changing. things which required many people can now
   be done with one person and electricity. we are going through a similar
   journey with machine learning & deep learning today.

   so, if you haven   t explored or understood the power of deep learning    
   you should start it today. i have written this article to help you
   understand common terms used in deep learning.


who should read this article?

   if you are some one who wants to learn or understand deep learning,
   this article is meant for you. in this article, i will explain various
   terms used commonly in deep learning.

   if you are wondering why i am writing this article     i am writing it
   because i want you to start your deep learning journey without hassle
   or without getting intimidated. when i first began reading about deep
   learning, there were several terms i had heard about, but it was
   intimidating when i tried to understand them. there are several words
   which are recurring when we start reading about any deep learning
   application.

   in this article, i have created something like a deep learning
   dictionary for you which you can refer whenever you need the basic
   definition of the most common terms used. i hope after this article
   these terms wouldn   t haunt you anymore.


terms related to topics:

   to help you understand various terms, i have broken them in 3 different
   groups. if you are looking for a specific term, you can skip to that
   section. if you are new to the domain, i would recommend that you go
   through them in the order i have written them.
    1. basics of neural networks
          + common id180
    2. convolutional neural networks
    3. recurrent neural networks


basics of neural networks

   1) neuron- just like a neuron forms the basic element of our brain, a
   neuron forms the basic structure of a neural network. just think of
   what we do when we get new information. when we get the information, we
   process it and then we generate an output. similarly, in case of a
   neural network, a neuron receives an input, processes it and generates
   an output which is either sent to other neurons for further processing
   or it is the final output.


   2) weights     when input enters the neuron, it is multiplied by a
   weight. for example, if a neuron has two inputs, then each input will
   have has an associated weight assigned to it. we initialize the weights
   randomly and these weights are updated during the model training
   process. the neural network after training assigns a higher weight to
   the input it considers more important as compared to the ones which are
   considered less important. a weight of zero denotes that the particular
   feature is insignificant.

   let   s assume the input to be a, and the weight associated to be w1.
   then after passing through the node the input becomes a*w1


   3) bias     in addition to the weights, another linear component is
   applied to the input, called as the bias. it is added to the result of
   weight multiplication to the input. the bias is basically added to
   change the range of the weight multiplied input. after adding the bias,
   the result would look like a*w1+bias. this is the final linear
   component of the input transformation.


   4) activation function     once the linear component is applied to the
   input, a non-linear function is applied to it. this is done by applying
   the activation function to the linear combination.the activation
   function translates the input signals to output signals. the output
   after application of the activation function would look something like
   f(a*w1+b) where f() is the activation function.

   in the below diagram we have    n    inputs given as x1 to xn and
   corresponding weights wk1 to wkn. we have a bias given as bk. the
   weights are first multiplied to its corresponding input and are then
   added together along with the bias. let this be called as u.

   u=   w*x+b

   the activation function is applied to u i.e. f(u) and we receive the
   final output from the neuron as yk = f(u)



commonly applied id180

   the most commonly applied id180 are     sigmoid, relu and
   softmax

   a) sigmoid     one of the most common id180 used is
   sigmoid. it is defined as:
sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)

source: wikipedia

   the sigmoid transformation generates a more smooth range of values
   between 0 and 1. we might need to observe the changes in the output
   with slight changes in the input values. smooth curves allow us to do
   that and are hence preferred over step functions.


   b) relu(rectified linear units)     instead of sigmoids, the recent
   networks prefer using relu id180 for the hidden layers.
   the function is defined as:
f(x) = max(x,0).

   the output of the function is x when x>0 and 0 for x<=0. the function
   looks like this:

source: cs231n

   the major benefit of using relu is that it has a constant derivative
   value for all inputs greater than 0. the constant derivative value
   helps the network to train faster.


   c) softmax     softmax id180 are normally used in the
   output layer for classification problems. it is similar to the sigmoid
   function, with the only difference being that the outputs are
   normalized to sum up to 1. the sigmoid function would work in case we
   have a binary output, however in case we have a multiclass
   classification problem, softmax makes it really easy to assign values
   to each class which can be easily interpreted as probabilities.

   it   s very easy to see it this way     suppose you   re trying to identify a
   6 which might also look a bit like 8. the function would assign values
   to each number as below. we can easily see that the highest id203
   is assigned to 6, with the next highest assigned to 8 and so on   


   5) neural network     neural networks form the backbone of deep
   learning.the goal of a neural network is to find an approximation of an
   unknown function. it is formed by interconnected neurons. these neurons
   have weights, and bias which is updated during the network training
   depending upon the error. the activation function puts a nonlinear
   transformation to the linear combination which then generates the
   output. the combinations of the activated neurons give the output.

   a neural network is best defined by    liping yang    as    

      neural networks are made up of numerous interconnected conceptualized
   artificial neurons, which pass data between themselves, and which have
   associated weights which are tuned based upon the network   s
      experience.    neurons have activation thresholds which, if met by a
   combination of their associated weights and data passed to them, are
   fired; combinations of fired neurons result in    learning   .


   6) input / output / hidden layer     simply as the name suggests the
   input layer is the one which receives the input and is essentially the
   first layer of the network. the output layer is the one which generates
   the output or is the final layer of the network. the processing layers
   are the hidden layers within the network. these hidden layers are the
   ones which perform specific tasks on the incoming data and pass on the
   output generated by them to the next layer. the input and output layers
   are the ones visible to us, while are the intermediate layers are
   hidden.

source: cs231n


   7) mlp (multi layer id88)     a single neuron would not be able to
   perform highly complex tasks. therefore, we use stacks of neurons
   to generate the desired outputs. in the simplest network we would have
   an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. each layer has
   multiple neurons and all the neurons in each layer are connected to all
   the neurons in the next layer. these networks can also be called as
   fully connected networks.



   8) forward propagation     forward propagation refers to the movement of
   the input through the hidden layers to the output layers. in forward
   propagation, the information travels in a single direction forward. the
   input layer supplies the input to the hidden layers and then the output
   is generated. there is no backward movement.


   9) cost function     when we build a network, the network tries to
   predict the output as close as possible to the actual value. we measure
   this accuracy of the network using the cost/id168. the cost or
   id168 tries to penalize the network when it makes errors.

   our objective while running the network is to increase our prediction
   accuracy and to reduce the error, hence minimizing the cost function.
   the most optimized output is the one with least value of the cost or
   id168.

   if i define the cost function to be the mean squared error, it can be
   written as    

   c= 1/m    (y     a)^2 where m is the number of training inputs, a is the
   predicted value and y is the actual value of that particular example.

   the learning process revolves around minimizing the cost.


   10) id119     id119 is an optimization algorithm
   for minimizing the cost. to think of it intuitively, while climbing
   down a hill you should take small steps and walk down instead of just
   jumping down at once. therefore, what we do is, if we start from a
   point x, we move down a little i.e. delta h, and update our position to
   x-delta h and we keep doing the same till we reach the bottom. consider
   bottom to be the minimum cost point.


   [grad.png]

   [97]source

   mathematically, to find the local minimum of a function one takes steps
   proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function.

   you can go through [98]this article for a detailed understanding of
   id119.


   11) learning rate     the learning rate is defined as the amount of
   minimization in the cost function in each iteration. in simple terms,
   the rate at which we descend towards the minima of the cost function is
   the learning rate. we should choose the learning rate very carefully
   since it should neither be very large that the optimal solution is
   missed and nor should be very low that it takes forever for the network
   to converge.

   [99]source

   12) id26     when we define a neural network, we assign random
   weights and bias values to our nodes. once we have received the output
   for a single iteration, we can calculate the error of the network. this
   error is then fed back to the network along with the gradient of the
   cost function to update the weights of the network. these weights are
   then updated so that the errors in the subsequent iterations is
   reduced. this updating of weights using the gradient of the cost
   function is known as back-propagation.

   in back-propagation the movement of the network is backwards, the error
   along with the gradient flows back from the out layer through the
   hidden layers and the weights are updated.


   13) batches     while training a neural network, instead of sending the
   entire input in one go, we divide in input into several chunks of equal
   size randomly. training the data on batches makes the model more
   generalized as compared to the model built when the entire data set is
   fed to the network in one go.


   14) epochs     an epoch is defined as a single training iteration of all
   batches in both forward and back propagation. this means 1 epoch is a
   single forward and backward pass of the entire input data.

   the number of epochs you would use to train your network can be chosen
   by you. it   s highly likely that more number of epochs would show higher
   accuracy of the network, however, it would also take longer for the
   network to converge. also you must take care that if the number of
   epochs are too high, the network might be over-fit.


   15) dropout     dropout is a id173 technique which prevents
   over-fitting of the network. as the name suggests, during training a
   certain number of neurons in the hidden layer is randomly dropped. this
   means that the training happens on several architectures of the neural
   network on different combinations of the neurons. you can think of drop
   out as an ensemble technique, where the output of multiple networks is
   then used to produce the final output.

source: [100]original paper


   16) batch id172     as a concept, batch id172 can be
   considered as a dam we have set as specific checkpoints in a river.
   this is done to ensure that distribution of data is the same as the
   next layer hoped to get. when we are training the neural network, the
   weights are changed after each step of id119. this changes
   the how the shape of data is sent to the next layer.

   but the next layer was expecting the distribution similar to what it
   had previously seen. so we explicitly normalize the data before sending
   it to the next layer.


convolutional neural networks

   17) filters     a filter in a id98 is like a weight matrix with which we
   multiply a part of the input image to generate a convoluted output.
   let   s assume we have an image of size 28*28. we randomly assign a
   filter of size 3*3, which is then multiplied with different 3*3
   sections of the image to form what is known as a convoluted output. the
   filter size is generally smaller than the original image size. the
   filter values are updated like weight values during id26 for
   cost minimization.

   consider the below image. here filter is a 3*3 matrix     which is
   multiplied with each 3*3 section of the image to form the convolved
   feature.


   18) id98 (convolutional neural network)     convolutional neural networks
   are basically applied on image data. suppose we have an input of size
   (28*28*3), if we use a normal neural network, there would be
   2352(28*28*3) parameters. and as the size of the image increases the
   number of parameters becomes very large. we    convolve    the images to
   reduce the number of parameters (as shown above in filter definition).
   as we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we
   will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the output of
   that filter at every position. we will stack these activation maps
   along the depth dimension and produce the output volume.

   you can see the below diagram for a clearer picture.

source: cs231n


   19) pooling     it is common to periodically introduce pooling layers in
   between the convolution layers. this is basically done to reduce a
   number of parameters and prevent over-fitting. the most common type of
   pooling is a pooling layer of filter size(2,2) using the max operation.
   what it would do is, it would take the maximum of each 4*4 matrix of
   the original image.

source: cs231n

   you can also pool using other operations like average pooling, but max
   pooling has shown to work better in practice.


   20) padding     padding refers to adding extra layer of zeros across the
   images so that the output image has the same size as the input. this is
   known as same padding.

   after the application of filters  the convolved layer in the case of
   same padding has the size equal to the actual image.

   valid padding refers to keeping the image as such an having all the
   pixels of the image which are actual or    valid   . in this case after the
   application of filters the size of the length and the width of the
   output keeps getting reduced at each convolutional layer.


   21) data augmentation     data augmentation refers to the addition of new
   data derived from the given data, which might prove to be beneficial
   for prediction. for example, it might be easier to view the cat in a
   dark image if you brighten it, or for instance, a 9 in the digit
   recognition might be slightly tilted or rotated. in this case, rotation
   would solve the problem and increase the accuracy of our model. by
   rotating or brightening we   re improving the quality of our data. this
   is known as data augmentation.

recurrent neural network

   22) recurrent neuron     a recurrent neuron is one in which the output of
   the neuron is sent back to it for t time stamps. if you look at the
   diagram the output is sent back as input t times. the unrolled neuron
   looks like t different neurons connected together. the basic advantage
   of this neuron is that it gives a more generalized output.

source: cs231n


   23) id56(recurrent neural network)     recurrent neural networks are used
   especially for sequential data where the previous output is used to
   predict the next one. in this case the networks have loops within them.
   the loops within the hidden neuron gives them the capability to store
   information about the previous words for some time to be able to
   predict the output. the output of the hidden layer is sent again to the
   hidden layer for t time stamps. the unfolded neuron looks like the
   above diagram. the output of the recurrent neuron goes to the next
   layer only after completing all the time stamps. the output sent is
   more generalized and the previous information is retained for a longer
   period.

   the error is then back propagated according to the unfolded network to
   update the weights. this is known as id26 through
   time(bptt).


   24) vanishing gradient problem     vanishing gradient problem arises in
   cases where the gradient of the activation function is very small.
   during back propagation when the weights are multiplied with these low
   gradients, they tend to become very small and    vanish    as they go
   further deep in the network. this makes the neural network to forget
   the long range dependency. this generally becomes a problem in cases of
   recurrent neural networks where long term dependencies are very
   important for the network to remember.

   this can be solved by using id180 like relu which do not
   have small gradients.


   25) exploding gradient problem     this is the exact opposite of the
   vanishing gradient problem, where the gradient of the activation
   function is too large. during back propagation, it makes the weight of
   a particular node very high with respect to the others rendering them
   insignificant. this can be easily solved by clipping the gradient so
   that it doesn   t exceed a certain value.

            hi surya,
            convolution layer is the basic building block of id98. it is
            the one which is obtained by applying filters.
            pooling layers however are just applied for feature reduction
            and reduce overfitting. we just apply the max function over
            defined strides of input data.

       excellent description of key concepts and overview of deep
       learning. am just getting into this after 32 years in it as i have
       always enjoyed statistics and started learning r and will be
       teaching python in the fall (university where i am an adjunct
       faculty member is switching from vb.net to python).
