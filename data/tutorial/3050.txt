   time series analysis is a family of tools too often overlooked by
   marketing researchers and data scientists.

   what is a time series?

   many data sets are cross-sectional and represent a single slice of
   time.  however, we also have data collected over many periods - weekly
   sales data, for instance.  this is an example of time series data.
   time series analysis is a specialized branch of statistics used
   extensively in fields such as econometrics and operations research.
   unfortunately, most marketing researchers and data scientists still
   have had little exposure to it. as we'll see, it has many very
   important applications for marketers.

   just to get our terms straight, below is a simple illustration of what
   a time series data file looks like.  the column labeled date is the
   date variable and corresponds to a respondent id in survey research
   data.  week, the sequence number of each week, is included because
   using this column rather than the actual dates can make graphs less
   cluttered.  the sequence number can also serve as a trend variable in
   certain kinds of time series models.  sales is the number of packs sold
   in each week.

   i should note that the unit of analysis doesn't have to be brands and
   can include individual consumers or groups of consumers whose behavior
   is followed over time.

   but first, why do we need to distinguish between cross-sectional and
   time series analysis?  for several reasons, one being that our research
   objectives will usually be different.  another is that most statistical
   methods we learn in college and make use of in marketing research are
   intended for cross-sectional data, and if we apply them to time series
   data the results we obtain may be misleading.  time is a dimension in
   the data we need to take into account.

   time series analysis is a complex subject but, in short, when we use
   our usual cross-sectional techniques such as regression on time series
   data:
    1. standard errors can be far off.  more often than not, p-values will
       be too small and variables can appear "more significant" than they
       really are;
    2. in some cases regression coefficients can be seriously biased; and
    3. we are not taking advantage of the information the serial
       correlation in the data provides.

   univariate analysis

   to return to our example data, one objective might be to forecast sales
   for our brand.  there are many ways to do this and the most
   straightforward is univariate analysis, in which we essentially
   extrapolate future data from past data.  two popular univariate time
   series methods are exponential smoothing (e.g., holt-winters) and arima
   (autoregressive integrated moving average).  in the example shown in
   figure 1, one year (52 weeks) of historical sales data have been used
   to forecast sales one quarter (12 weeks) ahead with an arima model.

   causal modeling

   obviously, there are risks in assuming the future will be like the past
   but, fortunately, we can also include "causal" (predictor) variables to
   help mitigate these risks.  but besides improving the accuracy of our
   forecasts, another objective may be to understand which marketing
   activities most influence sales.

   causal variables will typically include data such as grps and price and
   also may incorporate data from consumer surveys or exogenous variables
   such as gdp.  these kinds of analyses are called market response or
   marketing mix modeling and are a central component of romi (return on
   marketing investment) analysis.  they can be thought of as key driver
   analysis for time series data.  the findings are often used in
   simulations to try to find the "optimal" marketing mix.

   transfer function models, armax and dynamic regression are terms that
   refer to specialized regression procedures developed for time series
   data.  there are more sophisticated methods, in addition, and i'll
   touch on a few in just a bit.

   multiple time series

   you might need to analyze multiple time series simultaneously, e.g.,
   sales of your brands and key competitors.  figure 2 below is an example
   and shows weekly sales data for three brands over a one-year period.
   since sales movements of brands competing with each other will
   typically be correlated over time, it often will make sense, and be
   more statistically rigorous, to include data for all key brands in one
   model instead of running separate models for each brand.

   vector autoregression (var), the vector error correction model
   (vecm) and the more general state space framework are three
   frequently-used approaches to multiple time series analysis.  causal
   data can be included and market response/marketing mix modeling
   conducted.

   other methods

   there are several additional methods relevant to marketing research and
   data science i'll now briefly describe.
     * panel models include cross sections in a time series analysis.
       sales and marketing data for several brands, for instance, can be
       stacked on top of one another and analyzed simultaneously.  panel
       modeling permits category-level analysis and also comes in handy
       when data are infrequent (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
     * longitudinal analysis is a generic and sometimes confusingly-used
       term that can refer to panel modeling with a small number of
       periods ("short panels"), as well as to repeated measures, growth
       curve analysis or multilevel analysis.  in a literal sense it
       subsumes time series analysis but many authorities reserve that
       term for analysis of data with many time periods (e.g., >25).
       structural equation modeling (sem) is one method widely-used in
       growth curve modeling and other longitudinal analyses.
     * survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the
       expected length of time until one or more events happen, such as
       death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems.
       it's also called duration analysis in economics and event history
       analysis in sociology. it is often used in customer churn analysis.
     * in some instances one model will not fit an entire series well
       because of structural changes within the series, and model
       parameters will vary across time. there are numerous breakpoint
       tests and models (e.g., state space, switching regression)
       available for these circumstances.
     * you may also notice that sales, call center activity or other data
       series you are tracking exhibit clusters of volatility. that is,
       there may be periods in which the figures move up and down in much
       more extreme fashion than other periods. figure 3 gives an
       illustration of this kind of pattern.

   [:0]

     * in these cases, you should consider a class of models with the
       forbidding name of garch (generalized autoregressive conditional
       heteroskedasticity).  arch and garch models were originally
       developed for financial markets but can used for other kinds of
       time series data when volatility is of interest.  volatility can
       fall into many patterns and, accordingly, there are many flavors of
       garch models.  causal variables can be included.  there are also
       multivariate extensions (mgarch) if you have two or more series you
       wish to analyze jointly.
     * non-parametric econometrics is a very different approach to
       studying time series and longitudinal data that is now receiving a
       lot of attention because of big data and the greater computing
       power we now enjoy.  these methods are increasingly feasible and
       useful as alternatives to the more familiar methods such as those
       described in this article.
     * machine learning (e.g., id158s) is also useful
       in some circumstances but the results can be hard to interpret -
       they predict well but may not help us understand the mechanism that
       generated to data (the why).  to some extent, this drawback also
       applies to non-parametric techniques.
     * most of the methods i've mentioned are time domain techniques.
       another group of methods known as frequency domain, plays a more
       limited role in marketing research.

   further study

   i've barely scratched the surface of a rich and multifaceted set of
   techniques that are new to most marketing researchers and data
   scientists, but increasingly important to our work.  for readers
   wishing to learn more about these methods, there are now online courses
   and many excellent introductory [7]textbooks available, as well as
   those covering specific topics in depth.
