pixel-id98++

   this is a python3 / [79]tensorflow implementation of [80]pixelid98++, as
   described in the following paper:

   pixelid98++: a pixelid98 implementation with discretized logistic mixture
   likelihood and other modifications, by tim salimans, andrej karpathy,
   xi chen, diederik p. kingma, and yaroslav bulatov.

   our work builds on pixelid98s that were originally proposed in [81]van
   der oord et al. in june 2016. pixelid98s are a class of powerful
   generative models with tractable likelihood that are also easy to
   sample from. the core convolutional neural network computes a
   id203 distribution over a value of one pixel conditioned on the
   values of pixels to the left and above it. below are example samples
   from a model trained on cifar-10 that achieves 2.92 bits per dimension
   (compared to 3.03 of the pixelid98 in van der oord et al.):

   samples from the model (left) and samples from a model that is
   conditioned on the cifar-10 class labels (right):

   [82]improved pixelid98 papers

   this code supports multi-gpu training of our improved pixelid98 on
   [83]cifar-10 and [84]small id163, but is easy to adapt for
   additional datasets. training on a machine with 8 maxwell titan x gpus
   achieves 3.0 bits per dimension in about 10 hours and it takes
   approximately 5 days to converge to 2.92.

setup

   to run this code you need the following:
     * a machine with multiple gpus
     * python3
     * numpy, tensorflow and imageio packages:

pip install numpy tensorflow-gpu imageio

training the model

   use the train.py script to train the model. to train the default model
   on cifar-10 simply use:
python3 train.py

   you might want to at least change the --data_dir and --save_dir which
   point to paths on your system to download the data to (if not
   available), and where to save the checkpoints.

   i want to train on fewer gpus. to train on fewer gpus we recommend
   using cuda_visible_devices to narrow the visibility of gpus to only a
   few and then run the script. don't forget to modulate the flag --nr_gpu
   accordingly.

   i want to train on my own dataset. have a look at the dataloader
   classes in the data/ folder. you have to write an analogous data
   iterator object for your own dataset and the code should work well from
   there.

pretrained model checkpoint

   you can download our pretrained (tensorflow) model that achieves 2.92
   bpd on cifar-10 [85]here (656mb).
