id197

   this is a tensorflow implementation of id197 for
   the task of (semi-supervised) classification of nodes in a graph, as
   described in our paper:

   thomas n. kipf, max welling, [74]semi-supervised classification with
   id197 (iclr 2017)

   for a high-level explanation, have a look at our blog post:

   thomas kipf, [75]id197 (2016)

installation

python setup.py install

requirements

     * tensorflow (>0.12)
     * networkx

run the demo

cd id197
python train.py

data

   in order to use your own data, you have to provide
     * an n by n adjacency matrix (n is the number of nodes),
     * an n by d feature matrix (d is the number of features per node),
       and
     * an n by e binary label matrix (e is the number of classes).

   have a look at the load_data() function in utils.py for an example.

   in this example, we load citation network data (cora, citeseer or
   pubmed). the original datasets can be found here:
   [76]http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/projects/lbc/. in our version (see
   data folder) we use dataset splits provided by
   [77]https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid (zhilin yang, william w.
   cohen, ruslan salakhutdinov, [78]revisiting semi-supervised learning
   with graph embeddings, icml 2016).

   you can specify a dataset as follows:
python train.py --dataset citeseer

   (or by editing train.py)

models

   you can choose between the following models:
     * id197: graph convolutional network (thomas n. kipf, max welling,
       [79]semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional
       networks, 2016)
     * id197_cheby: chebyshev polynomial version of graph convolutional
       network as described in (micha  l defferrard, xavier bresson, pierre
       vandergheynst, [80]convolutional neural networks on graphs with
       fast localized spectral filtering, nips 2016)
     * dense: basic multi-layer id88 that supports sparse inputs

graph classification

   our framework also supports batch-wise classification of multiple graph
   instances (of potentially different size) with an adjacency matrix
   each. it is best to concatenate respective feature matrices and build a
   (sparse) block-diagonal matrix where each block corresponds to the
   adjacency matrix of one graph instance. for pooling (in case of
   graph-level outputs as opposed to node-level outputs) it is best to
   specify a simple pooling matrix that collects features from their
   respective graph instances, as illustrated below:
