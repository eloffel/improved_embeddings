   this post takes the concept of an ontology and presents it in a clear
   and simple manner, devoid of the complexities that often surround such
   explanations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   jo stichbury, [36]grakn labs.

   this is a short blog post to introduce the concept of an ontology for
   those who are unfamiliar with the term, or who have previously
   encountered explanations that make little or no sense, as i have. i   m
   aiming to    democratise knowledge of this topic    as one of my colleagues
   put it.

                       [1*6u4pqejzfz6zondolruwqg.jpeg]
        find your way out of the maze of words (image: public domain)

   having spent the last six months reading around this subject in my new
   role at [37]grakn.ai, with numerous frustrated and cyclical google
   searches, i think i   m in a good position to attempt a simple
   explanation. if, like me, you aren   t a philosopher, mathematician or
   hard-core computer science phd, you may be put off by definitions such
   as [38]this from wikipedia:

        ...an ontology is a formal naming and definition of the types,
     properties, and interrelationships of the [39]entities that really
     or fundamentally exist for a particular [40]domain of discourse. it
     is thus a practical application of philosophical [41]ontology, with
     a [42]taxonomy...   

   another [43]example:

        an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared
     conceptualization.   

   maybe it   s just me, but although i know the meaning of those words, i
   don   t really understand anything when they   re put together as above.
   google isn   t massively helpful either:

   [1*ookd6n7k3mghkkh6b-ioyq.png]

   to be fair, if you stick with it rather than run away screaming, the
   wikipedia article i cited above continues to explain that an ontology
   is:

        ...a model for describing the world that consists of a set of
     types, properties, and relationship types. there is also generally
     an expectation that the features of the model in an ontology should
     closely resemble the real world (related to the object)...   

   this makes more sense to me, as i   m familiar with object-oriented c++,
   and it doesn   t sound that unlike it. i thought i   d illustrate the
   definition with an example using an ontology in [44]grakn.ai to define
   objects, express their properties, and show how the objects relate to
   one another.

   still with me? i hope i   ve not slipped into the territory of confusing
   semantic terminology just yet (by the way, please see the end of this
   article for more examples of ontological explicative horrors).

the grakn knowledge model


   in grakn, we use four types in an ontology:
     * entity: represents an objects or thing, for example: person, man,
       woman.
     * relation: represents relationships between things, for example, a
       parent-child relationship between two person entities.
     * role: describes the participation of entities in a relation. for
       example, in a marriage relation, there are roles of husband and
       wife, respectively.
     * resource: represents the properties associated with an entity or a
       relation, for example, a name or date. resources consist of
       primitive types and values, such as strings or integers.

   grakn has its own declarative graph query language, called graql, for
   expressing an ontology that can be to be loaded into a graph. let   s
   look at a simple example from the [45]grakn documentation, which uses
   genealogy data from a family that lived in the 18th and 19th century.
   here is the ontology:
insert

# entities

person sub entity
  plays parent
  plays child
  has identifier
  has firstname
  has surname
  has middlename
  has age-at-death
  has death-date
  has gender;

# resources

identifier sub resource datatype string;
firstname sub resource datatype string;
surname sub resource datatype string;
middlename sub resource datatype string;
age-at-death sub resource datatype long;
death-date sub resource datatype string;
gender sub resource datatype string;
birth-date sub resource datatype string;

# roles and relations

parentship sub relation
  relates parent
  relates child
  has birth-date;

parent sub role;
child sub role;

   the sub keyword expresses sub-typing, so person sub entity is simply
   describing that a person is a sub-type of the built-in graql entity
   type.

   in the ontology above, there is one entity sub-type, or category of
   object, which is a person. the person can take one of two different
   roles in a parentship relation with another person entity: a parent or
   child role. the parentship relation has a single property associated
   with it (a date of birth), while the person entity has a number of
   properties, such as names, age and gender.

   [1*vz5hicyhsqjgf7vbmo4pfa.jpeg]

   of course, this is a contrived example, designed to show the basic
   elements of a grakn ontology. it is possible to build a more extensive
   hierarchy through inheritance (entities to represent a man or a woman
   could inherit from an abstract person entity for example) and to
   introduce additional relations and roles (for example, marriage).

why do we need an ontology?


   we need an ontology to allow grakn to discover whether the data has any
   inconsistencies (also known as validation) and to extract implicit
   information from data (known as id136).

   as an example of validation, consider a glitch in the data whereby a
   person was incorrectly named as a parent of themselves. in adding the
   data, grakn would spot that a person entity was attempting to take both
   parent and child roles in a parentship relation, and would flag it up
   as an inconsistency.

   graql uses machine reasoning to perform id136 over data types and
   relation types, to discover implicit associations. a nice example is to
   use the gender of a person to infer more specific details of their role
   in a parentship relation (whether they are the mother or father, or
   daughteror son).

   we can extend the ontology we defined above to show those additional
   roles:
person
  plays son
  plays daughter
  plays mother
  plays father;

parentship sub relation
  relates mother
  relates father
  relates son
  relates daughter;

mother sub parent;
father sub parent;
son sub child;
daughter sub child;

   we also need to provide graql with some    rules    to follow to infer
   these new roles in the parentship. i won   t show them in graql, as it
   isn   t particularly readable, and the object here is to illustrate what
   they do, rather than how they are written. in effect they say that, in
   a parentship relation:
     * if the parent is male and the child is male, the roles are father
       and son.
     * if the parent is female and the child is male, the roles are mother
       and son.
     * if the parent is male and the child is female, the roles are father
       and daughter.
     * if the parent is female and the child is female, the roles are
       mother and daughter.

   the rules are applied by graql across the dataset to build new
   information from what is already contained in the data.

   to find out more about how to work with the grakn knowledge model, we
   recommend you take a look at our documentation: in particular the
   [46]quickstart tutorial and [47]knowledge model guide. if you   re stuck
   or need to talk to us, please join our growing [48]grakn community.

   i   d like to be clear that i mean no disrepect to the original authors
   of some of the above terrifying explanations, who are experts in their
   fields and writing for the cognoscenti. just for entertainment, here
   are a few other amazingly opaque definitions. please hit us up in the

   favourite...

     [51]gruber 2008:        an ontology defines a set of representational
     primitives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse.   

     [52]gene ontology consortium:    ontologies are    specifications of a
     relational vocabulary   . in other words they are sets of defined
     terms like the sort that you would find in a dictionary, but the
     terms are given hierarchical relationships to one another. the terms
     in a given vocabulary are likely to be restricted to those used in a
     particular field or domain, and in the case of go, the terms are all
     biological.
