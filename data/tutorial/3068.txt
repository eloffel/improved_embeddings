   this post outlines an entire 6-part tutorial series on the mxnet deep
   learning library and its python api. in-depth and descriptive, this is
   a great guide for anyone looking to start leveraging this powerful
   neural network library.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by julien simon, principal technical evangelist, amazon web services.

   in this series, i will try to give you an overview of the [38]mxnet
   deep learning library: we   ll look at its main features and its python
   api (which i suspect will be the #1 choice). later on, we   ll explore
   some of the mxnet tutorials and notebooks available online, and we   ll
   hopefully manage to understand every single line of code!

   if you   d like learn more about the rationale and the architecture of
   mxnet, you should read this [39]paper, named    mxnet: a flexible and
   efficient machine learning library for heterogeneous distributed
   systems   . we   ll cover most of the concepts presented in the paper, but
   hopefully in a more accessible way.

                               mxnet tutorial
                               mxnet tutorial.

   [40]part 1: getting started

   first things first: let   s install mxnet. you   ll find the official
   instructions [41]here, but here are some additional tips.

   one of the cool features of mxnet is that it can run identically on cpu
   and gpu (we   ll see later how to pick one or the other for our
   computations). this means that even if your computer doesn   t have an
   nvidia gpu (just like my macbook), you can still write and run mxnet
   code which you   ll use later on gpu-enabled systems.

   [42]part 2: the symbol api

   in part 1, we covered some mxnet basics and then discussed the ndarray
   api (tldr: ndarrays is where we   re going to store data, parameters,
   etc).

   now that we   ve got data covered, it   s time to look at how mxnet defines
   computation steps.

   [43]part 3: the module api

   in this article, we   re going to use what we learned on symbols and
   ndarrays to prepare some data and build a neural network. then, we   ll
   use the [44]module api to train the network and predict results.

   [45]part 4: using a pre-trained model for image classification
   (inception v3)

   in part 3, we built and trained our first neural network. we now know
   enough to take on more advanced examples.

   state of the art deep learning models are insanely complex. they have
   hundreds of layers and take days         if not weeks         to train on vast
   amounts of data. building and tuning these models requires a lot of
   expertise.

   fortunately, using these models is much simpler and only requires a few
   lines of code. in this article, we   re going to work with a pre-trained
   model for image classification called inception v3.

                              id98 architecture
                   architecture of a id98 (source: nvidia)

   [46]part 5: more pre-trained models (vgg16 and resnet-152)

   in part 4, we saw how easy it was to use a pre-trained version of the
   inception v3 model for id164. in this article, we   re going
   to load two other famous [47]convolutional neural networks (vgg19 and
   resnet-152) and we   ll compare them to inception v3.

   [48]part 6: real-time id164 on a raspberry pi (and it
   speaks, too!)

   in part 5, we used three different pre-trained models for object
   detection and compared them using a couple of images.

   one of the things we learned is that models have very different memory
   requirements, the most frugal model being inception v3 with    only   
   43mb. obviously, this begs the question:    can we run this on something
   really small, say a raspberry pi?   . well, let   s find out!
