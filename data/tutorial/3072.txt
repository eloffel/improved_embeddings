single line functions for detailed visualizations

the quickest and easiest way to go from analysis...

   [100]roc_curves

...to this.

   scikit-plot is the result of an unartistic data scientist's dreadful
   realization that visualization is one of the most crucial components in
   the data science process, not just a mere afterthought.

   gaining insights is simply a lot easier when you're looking at a
   colored heatmap of a confusion matrix complete with class labels rather
   than a single-line dump of numbers enclosed in brackets. besides, if
   you ever need to present your results to someone (virtually any time
   anybody hires you to do data science), you show them visualizations,
   not a bunch of numbers in excel.

   that said, there are a number of visualizations that frequently pop up
   in machine learning. scikit-plot is a humble attempt to provide
   aesthetically-challenged programmers (such as myself) the opportunity
   to generate quick and beautiful graphs and plots with as little
   boilerplate as possible.

okay then, prove it. show us an example.

   say we use naive bayes in multi-class classification and decide we want
   to visualize the results of a common classification metric, the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve. since the roc is
   only valid in binary classification, we want to show the respective roc
   of each class if it were the positive class. as an added bonus, let's
   show the micro-averaged and macro-averaged curve in the plot as well.

   let's use scikit-plot with the sample digits dataset from scikit-learn.
# the usual train-test split mumbo-jumbo
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import gaussiannb

x, y = load_digits(return_x_y=true)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.33)
nb = gaussiannb()
nb.fit(x_train, y_train)
predicted_probas = nb.predict_proba(x_test)

# the magic happens here
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scikitplot as skplt
skplt.metrics.plot_roc(y_test, predicted_probas)
plt.show()

   [101]roc_curves

   pretty.

   and... that's it. encaptured in that small example is the entire
   philosophy of scikit-plot: single line functions for detailed
   visualization. you simply browse the plots available in the
   documentation, and call the function with the necessary arguments.
   scikit-plot tries to stay out of your way as much as possible. no
   unnecessary bells and whistles. and when you do need the bells and
   whistles, each function offers a myriad of parameters for customizing
   various elements in your plots.

   finally, compare and [102]view the non-scikit-plot way of plotting the
   multi-class roc curve. which one would you rather do?

maximum flexibility. compatibility with non-scikit-learn objects.

   although scikit-plot is loosely based around the scikit-learn
   interface, you don't actually need scikit-learn objects to use the
   available functions. as long as you provide the functions what they're
   asking for, they'll happily draw the plots for you.

   here's a quick example to generate the precision-recall curves of a
   keras classifier on a sample dataset.
# import what's needed for the functions api
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scikitplot as skplt

# this is a keras classifier. we'll generate probabilities on the test set.
keras_clf.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=64, nb_epoch=10, verbose=2)
probas = keras_clf.predict_proba(x_test, batch_size=64)

# now plot.
skplt.metrics.plot_precision_recall_curve(y_test, probas)
plt.show()

   [103]p_r_curves

   you can see clearly here that skplt.metrics.plot_precision_recall_curve
   needs only the ground truth y-values and the predicted probabilities to
   generate the plot. this lets you use anything you want as the
   classifier, from keras nns to nltk naive bayes to that groundbreaking
   classifier algorithm you just wrote.

   the possibilities are endless.

installation

   installation is simple! first, make sure you have the dependencies
   [104]scikit-learn and [105]matplotlib installed.

   then just run:
pip install scikit-plot

   or if you want the latest development version, clone this repo and run
python setup.py install

   at the root folder.

   if using conda, you can install scikit-plot by running:
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-plot
