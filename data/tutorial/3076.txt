   bayesian id136 is a way to get sharper predictions from your data.
   it   s particularly useful when you don   t have as much data as you would
   like and want to juice every last bit of predictive strength from it.

   although it is sometimes described with reverence, bayesian id136
   isn   t magic or mystical. and even though the math under the hood can
   get dense, the concepts behind it are completely accessible. in brief,
   bayesian id136 lets you draw stronger conclusions from your data by
   folding in what you already know about the answer.

   bayesian id136 is based on the ideas of thomas bayes, a
   nonconformist presbyterian minister in london about 300 years ago. he
   wrote two books, one on theology, and one on id203. his work
   included his now famous id47 in raw form, which has since been
   applied to the problem of id136, the technical term for educated
   guessing. the popularity of bayes' ideas was aided immeasurably by
   another minister, [40]richard price. he saw their significance, refined
   them and published them. it would be more accurate and historically
   just to call bayes' theorem the bayes-price rule.

bayesian id136 at the movies


   imagine you are at the movies and a fellow moviegoer drops their
   ticket. you want to get their attention. this is what they look like
   from behind. you can   t tell their gender, only that they have long
   hair. do you call out    excuse me ma   am!    or    excuse me sir!    given what
   you know about men   s and women   s hairstyles in your area, you might
   assume that this is a woman. (in this oversimplification, there are
   only two hair lengths and genders.)

   now consider a variation of the situation where this person is standing
   in line for the men   s restroom. with this additional piece of
   information, you would probably assume that this is a man. this use of
   common sense and background knowledge is something that we do without
   thinking. bayesian id136 is a way to capture this in math so that
   we can make more accurate predictions.

   to put numbers to our cinema dilemma, let   s assume that there are about
   half men and half women at the theater. out of 100 people, 50 are men,
   50 are women. out of the women, half have long hair (25) and the other
   25 have short hair. out of the men, 48 have short hair and 2 have long
   hair. since there are 25 long haired women and 2 long haired men,
   guessing that the ticket owner is a woman is a safe bet.

   out of 100 people in the men   s restroom line, however, there are 98 men
   and two women keeping their partners company. half the women still have
   long hair and half have short hair, but here there are just one of
   each. the proportions of men with long and short hair are the same too,
   but since there are 98 of them, there are now 94 with short hair and 4
   with long. since there is 1 woman with long hair and four men, now the
   safe bet is that the ticket owner is a man. this is a concrete example
   of the principle underlying bayesian id136. knowing a key piece of
   information beforehand - that the ticket owner is in the men   s restroom
   line - allows us to make a better prediction about them.

   to clearly talk about bayesian id136, it is worth our time to
   really clearly define our ideas. unfortunately, this requires using
   math. we   ll avoid going deeper than we have to, but stick with me for a
   few more paragraphs and it will pay off. to lay our foundation, we need
   to quickly mention four concepts: probabilities, conditional
   probabilities, joint probabilities and marginal probabilities.

probabilities


   the id203 of a thing happening is the number of ways that thing
   can happen divided by the total number of things that can happen. the
   id203 that a moviegoer is a woman is 50 women divided by 100
   moviegoers, .5 or 50%. the same holds for men.

   the situation in men   s restroom line breaks down to .02 for women, .98
   for men.

conditional probabilities


   conditional probabilities answer the question    if i know that a person
   is a woman, what is the id203 that she has long hair?   
   conditional probabilities are calculated the same way as straight
   probabilities, but they just look at a subset of all the examples -
   those meeting a certain condition. in this case, p(long hair | woman),
   the id155 that someone has long hair, given that she
   is a woman, is the number of women with long hair, divided by the total
   number of women. this turns out to be .5, whether we are considering
   the men   s restroom line, or the theater overall.

   by the same math, the id155 that someone has long
   hair, given that he is a man, p(long hair | man), is .04, whether or
   not they are in line.

   an important thing to remember about conditional probabilities is that
   p(a | b) is not the same as p(b | a). for example, p(cute | puppy) is
   different than p(puppy | cute). if the thing i   m holding is a puppy,
   the id203 it is cute is very high. if the thing i   m holding is
   cute, the id203 it is a puppy is only medium-low. it might also
   be kitten, a bunny, a hedgehog or even a tiny human.

joint probabilities


   joint probabilities are useful for answering the question,    what is the
   id203 that someone is a woman with short hair?    finding this is a
   two-step process. first, we focus on the id203 that someone is a
   woman, p(woman). then, we bring in the id203 that someone has
   short hair, given that she is a woman, p(short hair | woman). combining
   these by multiplication gives the joint id203, p(woman with short
   hair) = p(woman) * p(short hair | woman). using this approach, we can
   calculate what we already knew--that p(woman with long hair) among all
   moviegoers is .25, but that p(woman with long hair) in the men   s
   restroom line is .01. these are different because p(woman) is different
   in these two cases.

   similarly, p(man with long hair) is .02 among all moviegoers, but .04
   in the men   s restroom line.

   unlike conditional probabilities, joint probabilities don   t care about
   order. p(a and b) is the same as p(b and a). the id203 that i am
   having milk and a jelly donut is the same as the id203 that i am
   having a jelly donut and milk.

marginal probabilities


   the last stop on our fundamentals tour is marginal probabilities. these
   are useful for answering the question    what is the id203 that
   someone has long hair?    to find this, we have to add up the
   probabilities for all the different ways this could happen - the
   id203 of being a man with long hair plus the id203 of being
   a woman with long hair. adding up those two joint probabilities gives
   us p(long hair) of .27 for moviegoers generally, but .05 in the men   s
   restroom line.
