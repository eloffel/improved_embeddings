practical 1: id97

   [brendan shillingford, yannis assael, chris dyer]

   for this practical, you'll be provided with a partially-complete
   ipython notebook, an interactive web-based python computing environment
   that allows us to mix text, code, and interactive plots.

   we will be training id97 models on ted talk and wikipedia data,
   using the id97 implementation included in the python package
   gensim. after training the models, we will analyze and visualize the
   learned embeddings.

setup and installation

   on a lab workstation, clone the practical repository and run the .
   install-python.sh shell script in a terminal to install anaconda with
   python 3, and the packages required for this practical.

   run ipython notebook in the repository directory and open the
   practical.ipynb notebook in your browser.

preliminaries

preprocessing

   the code for downloading the dataset and preprocessing it is prewritten
   to save time. however, it is expected that you'll need to perform such
   a task in future practicals, given raw data. read it and make sure you
   understand it. often, one uses a library like nltk to simplify this
   task, but we have not done so here and instead opted to use regular
   expressions via python's re module.

word frequencies

   make a list of the most common words and their occurence counts. take a
   look at the top 40 words. you may want to use the
   sklearn.feature_extraction.text module's countvectorizer class or the
   collections module's counter class.

   take the top 1000 words, and plot a histogram of their counts. the
   plotting code for an interactive histogram is already given in the
   notebook.

   handin: show the frequency distribution histogram.

training id97

   now that we have a processed list of sentences, let's run the id97
   training. begin by reading the gensim documentation for id97 at
   [76]https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/id97.html, to figure out
   how to use the id97 class. learn embeddings in $\mathbb r^{100}$
   using cbow (which is the default). other options should be default
   except min_count=10 so that infrequent words are ignored. the training
   process should take under half a minute.

   if your trained id97 instance is called model_ted, you should be
   able to check the vocabulary size using len(model_ted.vocab), which
   should be around 14427. try using the most_similar() method to return a
   list of the most similar words to "man" and "computer".

   handin: find a few more words with interesting and/or surprising
   nearest neighbours.

   handin: find an interesting cluster in the id167 plot.

   optional, for enthusiastic students: try manually retrieving two word
   vectors using the indexing operator as described in gensim's
   documentation, then computer their cosine distances (recall it is
   defined as $d(x,y) = \frac{\langle x, y \rangle}{|x||y|}$). you may be
   interested in np.dot() and np.linalg.norm(), see the numpy
   documentation for details. compare this to the distance computed by
   gensim's functions.

comparison to vectors trained on wikitext-2 data

   we have provided downloading/preprocessing code (similar to the
   previous code) for the wikitext-2 dataset. the code uses a random
   subsample of the data so it is comparable in size to the ted talk data.

   repeat the same analysis as above but on this dataset.

   handin: find a few words with similar nearest neighbours.

   handin: find an interesting cluster in the id167 plot.

   handin: are there any notable differences between the embeddings
   learned on data compared to those learned on the ted talk data?

(optional, for enthusiastic students) id91

   if you have extra time, try performing a id116 id91 (e.g. using
   sklearn.cluster.kmeans) on the embeddings, tuning the number of
   clusters until you get interesting or meaningful clusters.

handin

   practical demonstrator your response to these to get signed off.
