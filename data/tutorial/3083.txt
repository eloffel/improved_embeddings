from
       research to
production

   an open source deep learning platform that provides a seaid113ss path
   from research prototyping to production deployment.
   [9]get started

key features &
capabilities

   [10]see all features

hybrid front-end

   a new hybrid front-end seaid113ssly transitions between eager mode and
   graph mode to provide both flexibility and speed.

distributed training

   scalable distributed training and performance optimization in research
   and production is enabled by the torch.distributed backend.

python-first

   deep integration into python allows popular libraries and packages to
   be used for easily writing neural network layers in python.

tools & libraries

   a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries extends pytorch and supports
   development in id161, nlp and more.

quick start
locally

   select your preferences and run the install command. stable represents
   the most currently tested and supported version of pytorch 1.0. this
   should be suitable for many users. preview is available if you want the
   latest, not fully tested and supported, 1.0 builds that are generated
   nightly. please ensure that you have met the prerequisites below (e.g.,
   numpy), depending on your package manager. anaconda is our recommended
   package manager since it installs all dependencies. you can also
   [11]install previous versions of pytorch. note that libtorch is only
   available for c++.
