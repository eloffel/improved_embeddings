   [24]openid4 is an open source (mit) initiative for neural machine
   translation and neural sequence modeling.

                              [simple-attn.png]

   since its launch in december 2016, openid4 has become a collection of
   implementations targeting both academia and industry. the systems are
   designed to be simple to use and easy to extend, while maintaining
   efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

   openid4 has currently 3 main implementations:
     * [25]openid4-lua (a.k.a. openid4): the original project developed
       with [26]luatorch.
       full-featured, optimized, and stable code ready for quick
       experiments and production.
     * [27]openid4-py: an openid4-lua clone using the more modern
       [28]pytorch.
       initially created by the facebook ai research team as an example,
       this implementation is easier to extend and particularly suited for
       research.
     * [29]openid4-tf: a [30]tensorflow alternative.
       the more recent project focusing on large scale experiments and
       high performance model serving using the latest tensorflow
       features.

   all versions are currently maintained.

   common features include:
     * simple general-purpose interface, requiring only source/target
       files.
     * highly configurable models and training procedures.
     * recent research features to improve system performance.
     * extensions to allow other sequence generation tasks such as
       summarization, image-to-text, or speech-recognition.
     * active [31]community welcoming both academic and industrial
       requests and contributions.
