neon

   [121]neon is intel's reference deep learning framework committed to
   [122]best performance on all hardware. designed for ease-of-use and
   extensibility.
     * [123]tutorials and [124]ipython notebooks to get users started with
       using neon for deep learning.
     * support for commonly used layers: convolution, id56, lstm, gru,
       batchnorm, and more.
     * [125]model zoo contains pre-trained weights and example scripts for
       start-of-the-art models, including: [126]vgg, [127]reinforcement
       learning, [128]deep residual networks, [129]image captioning,
       [130]id31, and [131]more.
     * swappable hardware backends: write code once and then deploy on
       cpus, gpus, or nervana hardware

   for fast iteration and model exploration, neon has the fastest
   performance among deep learning libraries (2x speed of cudnnv4, see
   [132]benchmarks).
     * 2.5s/macrobatch (3072 images) on alexnet on titan x (full run on 1
       gpu ~ 26 hrs)
     * training vgg with 16-bit floating point on 1 titan x takes ~10 days
       (original paper: 4 gpus for 2-3 weeks)

   we use neon internally at intel nervana to solve our customers'
   problems across many [133]domains. we are hiring across several roles.
   apply [134]here!

   see the [135]new features in our latest release. we want to highlight
   that neon v2.0.0+ has been optimized for much better performance on
   cpus by enabling intel math kernel library (mkl). the dnn (deep neural
   networks) component of mkl that is used by neon is provided free of
   charge and downloaded automatically as part of the neon installation.

quick install

     * [136]local install and dependencies

   on a mac osx or linux machine, enter the following to download and
   install neon (conda users see the [137]guide), and use it to train your
   first multi-layer id88. to force a python2 or python3 install,
   replace make below with either make python2 or make python3.
    git clone https://github.com/nervanasystems/neon.git
    cd neon
    make
    . .venv/bin/activate

   starting after neon v2.2.0, the master branch of neon will be updated
   weekly with work-in-progress toward the next release. check out a
   release tag (e.g., "git checkout v2.2.0") for a stable release. or
   simply check out the "latest" release tag to get the latest stable
   release (i.e., "git checkout latest")
     * [138]install via pypi

   from version 2.4.0, we re-enabled pip install. neon can be installed
   using package name nervananeon.
    pip install nervananeon

   it is noted that [139]aeon needs to be installed separately. the latest
   release v2.6.0 uses aeon v1.3.0.

   warning

     between neon v2.1.0 and v2.2.0, the aeon manifest file format has
     been changed. when updating from neon < v2.2.0 manifests have to be
     recreated using ingest scripts (in examples folder) or updated using
     [140]this script.

use a script to run an example

    python examples/mnist_mlp.py

selecting a backend engine from the command line

   the gpu backend is selected by default, so the above command is
   equivalent to if a compatible gpu resource is found on the system:
    python examples/mnist_mlp.py -b gpu

   when no gpu is available, the optimized cpu (mkl) backend is now
   selected by default as of neon v2.1.0, which means the above command is
   now equivalent to:
    python examples/mnist_mlp.py -b mkl

   if you are interested in comparing the default mkl backend with the
   non-optimized cpu backend, use the following command:
    python examples/mnist_mlp.py -b cpu

use a yaml file to run an example

   alternatively, a yaml file may be used run an example.
    neon examples/mnist_mlp.yaml

   to select a specific backend in a yaml file, add or modify a line that
   contains backend: mkl to enable mkl backend, or backend: cpu to enable
   cpu backend. the gpu backend is selected by default if a gpu is
   available.

recommended settings for neon with mkl on intel architectures

   the intel math kernel library takes advantages of the parallelization
   and vectorization capabilities of intel xeon and xeon phi systems. when
   hyperthreading is enabled on the system, we recommend the following
   kmp_affinity setting to make sure parallel threads are 1:1 mapped to
   the available physical cores.
    export omp_num_threads=<number of physical cores>
    export kmp_affinity=compact,1,0,granularity=fine

   or
    export omp_num_threads=<number of physical cores>
    export kmp_affinity=verbose,granularity=fine,proclist=[0-<number of physical
 cores>],explicit

   for more information about kmp_affinity, please check [141]here. we
   encourage users to set out trying and establishing their own best
   performance settings.
