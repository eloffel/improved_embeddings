   installation
   oh, i guess i'll start with the boring chapter on installing tensorflow
   on your system to hit the ground running. to make it less boring, check
   out that pretty illustration.
   it's nice right?
   now that you're feeling inspired, check out what this appendix convers:
     * installing tensorflow using docker
     * installing matplotlib

   chapter 1
   [12][ch01_main.png]
   a machine learning odyssey
   this chapter has no code whatsoever.
   it's a beach read, really. let the fundamental concepts of machine
   learning sink in before you begin hacking.
   take a deep breath, and follow along to:
     * machine learning fundamentals
     * data representation and features
     * distance metrics
     * supervised learning
     * unsupervised learning
     * id23
     * theano, caffe, torch, cgt, and tensorflow

   chapter 2
   [13][ch02_main.png]
   tensorflow essentials
   turn up emacs to high gear, and drive freely.
   complete this chapter to be a tensorflow champion. or, something to
   that effect.
   use it as a handy reference to the many functionalities of tensorflow:
     * representing tensors
     * creating operators
     * executing operators with sessions
     * writing code in jupyter
     * using variables
     * saving and loading variables
     * visualizing data using tensorboard

   [15][ch03_main.png]
   id75 and beyond
   you're going to see dots.
   these dots will be connected by a line.
   it's going to be a pretty cool line, i guaratee it.
   let's see how to find these lines:
     * formalizing regression problems
     * id75
     * polynomial regression
     * id173
     * available datasets

   chapter 4
   [16][ch04_main.png]
   a gentle introduction to classification
   you know how people say "don't compare apples to oranges." we'll let
   tensorflow figure out how to do just that.
   before even jumping into neural networks, let's see what we can do from
   a couple simple concepts:
     * formalizing classification problems
     * measuring classification performance (roc curve, precision, recall,
       etc.)
     * using id75 for classification
     * using id28 (including multi-dimensional input)
     * multiclass classifiers (such as softmax regression)

   chapter 5
   [17][ch05_main.png]
   automatically id91 data
   unsupervised learning is a romantic idea.
   in this chapter, we're going on a date with id91 algorithms.
   here's the itinerary:
     * traversing files in tensorflow
     * extracting features from audio
     * id116 id91
     * audio segmentation
     * id91 using a self-organizing map

   chapter 6
   [18][ch06_main.png]
   id48
   i rarely see id48s in intro books.
   that's probably because it's a difficult concept to teach. let's see if
   i did a good job.
   here's what the chapter covers:
     * interpretable models
     * what is a markov model?
     * what is a hidden markov model?
     * forward algorithm
     * viterbi decoding algorithm
     * uses of id48

the neural network paradigm

   chapter 7
   [20][ch07_main.png]
   a peek into autoencoders
   the autoencoder is the simplest neural network that you can start using
   immediately.
   i mean it. open your text editor and let's get started.
   the chapter starts with basic neural network concepts, and then
   introduces autoencoders:
     * neural networks
     * autoencoders
     * batch training
     * variational/denoising/stacked autoencoders

   chapter 8
   [21][ch08_main.png]
   id23
   since you made it this far, i'm going to reward you with a million
   dollars.
   here's how you create a id23 algorithm to outsmart
   the stock market.
   follow along closely:
     * real-world examples
     * formal definitions
     * policy
     * utility
     * applying id23 to the stock market

   chapter 9
   [22][ch09_main.png]
   convolutional neural networks
   the most celebrated progress in neural networks comes from these id98
   architectures.
   here's what you need to know:
     * advantages and disadvantages of neural networks
     * convolutional neural networks
     * preparing images
     * generating filters
     * convolving using filters
     * max-pooling
     * implementing id98 in tensorflow
     * measuring performance
     * tips and tricks to improve performance

   chapter 10
   [23][ch10_main.png]
   recurrent neural networks
   do you ever forget what you ate for breakfast?
   a recurrent neural network might hold on to that memory. it is a neural
   architecture which also uses information propagated from the past.
   the chapter includes:
     * the idea of contextual information
     * recurrent neural networks
     * implementing it
     * a predictive model for timeseries data

   chapter 11
   [24][ch11_main.png]
   sequence-to-sequence models
   chatbots are all the hype these days. or is it spelled chat-bots? chat
   bots?
   i tell you what, a smart chatbot could understand you through your
   spelling mitsakes.
   the chapter includes:
     * examining sequence-to-sequence architecture
     * vector embedding of words
     * implementing a chatbot by using real-world data

   chapter 12
   [25][ch12_main.png]
   utility landscape
   ah, a topic near and dear to my heart (and not coincidentally my phd
   thesis): learning the utility of a situation.
   when people ask "what's the meaning of life?" they're searching for
   value or direction. if we craft values carefuly, we can program robots
   to do our bidding.
   this chapter includes:
     * implementing a neural network for ranking
     * image embedding using vgg16
     * visualizing utility

   chapter 13
   [26][ch13_main.png]
   advanced topics
   i couldn't fit in all i wanted in the book. but, why stop now?
   for example, i haven't even touched upon generative adversial networks!
   how about some multi-modal embeddings? who's hungry for graphical
   network embeddings?
   chapter 11 and all future chapters are free, and will be hosted on the
   [27]github repo.
