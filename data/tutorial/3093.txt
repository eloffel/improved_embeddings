[106]machine learning with tensorflow

   [107]this is the official code repository for [108]machine learning
   with tensorflow.

          warning: the book will be released in a month or two, so this repo
   is a pre-release of the entire code. i will be heavily updating this
   repo in the coming weeks. stay tuned, and follow along! :)

   get started with machine learning using tensorflow, google's latest and
   greatest machine learning library.
