about the technology

   tensorflow, google's library for large-scale machine learning,
   simplifies often-complex computations by representing them as graphs
   and efficiently mapping parts of the graphs to machines in a cluster or
   to the processors of a single machine.

about the book

   machine learning with tensorflow gives readers a solid foundation in
   machine-learning concepts plus hands-on experience coding tensorflow
   with python. you'll learn the basics by working with classic
   prediction, classification, and id91 algorithms. then, you'll
   move on to the money chapters: exploration of deep-learning concepts
   like autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and reinforcement
   learning. digest this book and you will be ready to use tensorflow for
   machine-learning and deep-learning applications of your own.
