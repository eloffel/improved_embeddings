practical deep learning for coders, v3

   looking for the older 2018 courses?: this site covers the new 2019 deep
   learning course. the 2018 courses have been moved to:
   [50]course18.fast.ai. note that the 2019 edition of part 2 (cutting
   edge deep learning) is not yet available, so you   ll need to use the
   2018 course for now (the 2019 edition will be available in june 2019).

getting started

   welcome! if you   re new to all this deep learning stuff, then don   t
   worry   we   ll take you through it all step by step. we do however assume
   that you   ve been coding for at least a year, and also that (if you
   haven   t used python before) you   ll be putting in the extra time to
   learn whatever python you need as you go. (for learning python, we have
   a list of [51]python learning resources available.)

   you might be surprised by what you don   t need to become a top deep
   learning practitioner. you need one year of coding experience, a gpu
   and appropriate software (see below), and that   s it. you don   t need
   much data, you don   t need university-level math, and you don   t need a
   giant data center. for more on this, see our article: [52]what you need
   to do deep learning.

   the easiest way to get started is to just start watching the first
   video right now! on the sidebar just click    lessons    and then click on
   lesson 1, and you   ll be on your way. if you want an overview of the
   topics that are covered in the course, have a look at [53]this article.

using a gpu

   to do nearly everything in this course, you   ll need access to a
   computer with an nvidia gpu (unfortunately other brands of gpu are not
   fully supported by the main deep learning libraries). however, we don   t
   recommend you buy one; in fact, even if you already have one, we don   t
   suggest you use it just yet! setting up a computer takes time and
   energy, and you want all your energy to focus on deep learning right
   now. therefore, we instead suggest you rent access to a computer that
   already has everything you need preinstalled and ready to go. costs can
   be as little as us$0.25 per hour while you   re using it.

   the most important thing to remember: when you   re done, shut down your
   server. you will be renting a distant computer, not running something
   on your own. it   s not enough to close your browser or turn off your own
   pc, those will merely sever the connection between your device and this
   distant server, not shut down the thing for which you   re paying. you
   have to shut this server down using the methods described in the guides
   below. otherwise, you   ll be charged for all the time it runs and get
   surprised with a nasty bill!

   here are some great choices of platforms. click the link for more
   information on each, and setup instructions. currently, our
   recommendations are (see below for details):
     * if you   ve used a command line before: google compute platform,
       because they provide $300 free credit, and have everything
       pre-installed for you
     * if you want to avoid the command-line, try crestle, or paperspace,
       which both work great and don   t cost much
     * if you don   t have a credit card to sign up for the above services,
       use colab, which is free, but has a few minor rough edges and
       incompatibilities.

ready to run:    one-click    jupyter

   these are the easiest to use; they   ve got all the software, data, and
   lessons preinstalled for you. they   re a little less flexible than    full
   servers    (below), but are the simplest way to get started.
     * [54]crestle; (instant approval, no installation required, $0.30 an
       hour)
     * [55]paperspace gradient; (instant approval, no installation
       required, $0.59 an hour; $10 free credit)
     * [56]colab; (instant approval, requires minimal installation, free)
     * [57]sagemaker; (requires wait for approval, not quite    one click      
       but pretty close, $1.26 an hour + storage)
     * [58]kaggle kernels; (instant launch, no setup required, free, not
       always up to date and not as well supported by fast.ai)
     * [59]salamander (instant approval; no installation required;
       includes full terminal access; $0.38 an hour; $75 free credit for
       students)
     * [60]floydhub; (instant approval, no installation required,
       $1.20/hour + $9.00/month (100gb storage), 2 hours free credit)

ready to run: full servers

     * [61]google compute platform ($0.38 an hour + storage, $300 free
       credit)
     * [62]azure; (instant approval; no installation required; $0.90 an
       hour + storage for a vm or $0.18 an hour + storage for [63]low
       priority preemptable instances)

some installation required

   we also have instructions for using these platforms, but they don   t
   have everything preinstalled yet:
     * [64]amazon web services ec2 ($0.9 an hour + storage)

   for those starting out, we highly recommend a jupyter notebooks
   platform (option 1)
     * notebooks are the easiest way to start writing python code and
       experimenting with deep learning.
     * renting a cloud server (option 2) requires environment
       configuration and setup.
     * building a pc requires environment setup and more up-front money.

   (when we release part 2 of the course, we will go into more specific
   details and benefits on both building a pc and renting a server.)

jupyter notebook

   once you   ve finished the steps in one of the guides above, you   ll be
   presented with a screen like this.

   this is the jupyter notebook environment, where you   ll be doing nearly
   all your work in the course, so you   ll want to get very familiar with
   it! you   ll be learning a bit about it during the course, but you should
   probably spend a moment to try out the notebook tutorial.

   your first task, then, is to open this notebook tutorial! to do so,
   click nbs and then dl1 in jupyter, where you   ll then see all the lesson
   notebooks. first, tick the little box on the left of
   00_notebook_tutorial.ipynb then click duplicate.

   you want to avoid modifying the original course notebooks as you will
   get conflicts when you try to update this folder with github (the place
   where the course is hosted). but we also want you to try a lot of
   variations of what is shown in class, which is why we encourage you to
   use duplicates of the course notebooks.

   launch your copy of 00_notebook_tutorial.ipynb and follow the
   instructions!

   when you   re done, remember to shut down your server.

our forums

   got stuck? want to know more about some topic? your first port of call
   should be [65]forums.fast.ai. there are thousands of students and
   practitioners asking and answering questions there. that means that
   it   s likely your question has already been answered! so click the
   little magnifying glass in the top right there, and search for the
   information you need; for instance, if you have some error message,
   paste a bit of it into the search box.

   the forum software we use is called [66]discourse. when you first join,
   it will show you some tips and tricks. there is also this [67]handy
   walk-thru provided by another discourse forum (not affiliated with
   fast.ai).

pytorch and fastai

   we teach how to train [68]pytorch models using the [69]fastai library.
   these two pieces of software are deeply connected   you can   t become
   really proficient at using fastai if you don   t know pytorch well, too.
   therefore, you will often need to refer to the [70]pytorch docs. and
   you may also want to check out the [71]pytorch forums (which also
   happen to use discourse).

   of course, to discuss fastai, you can use our forums, and be sure to
   look through the [72]fastai docs too.

   don   t worry if you   re just starting out   little, if any, of those docs
   and forum threads will make any sense to you just now. but come back in
   a couple of weeks and you might be surprised by how useful you find
   them
