generalization and equilibrium in generative adversarial nets (gans)     a talk
by sanjeev arora

   it has been a while after i reviewed my last paper here for [14]the
   intelligence of information.  i   ve been posting youtube videos with my
   own comments and interpretations of what i see and hear, and as a
   matter of fact it has been rewarding and a somewhat more interactive
   way to present the topics this blog cares about. not to say that it is
   better than the more conceptually demanding and more involved way of
   reviewing written papers; but it is a more dry approach for a broader
   audience. i must also acknowledge that i am not currently in a 100%
   confident position to review the state-of-the-art in edge cutting
   topics in deep learning or machine learning/data science. some of the
   papers i reviewed for this blog in the past were about topics that i
   only later manage to fully comprehend, or at least have some deeper
   lights of what was actually involved. but i am making some progress   

   to continue this trend i would like to share a video again today. this
   time from one other well qualified computer scientist from princeton
   university, [15]dr. sanjeev arora. dr. arora gave this talk about
   generalization and equilibrium in generative adversarial nets (gans) at
   the simons institute. this is another cutting edge topic in current
   deep neural networks research agendas, and obviously it fits proper
   with this blog alma mater.

   hide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   this is an interesting video from an interpretation (represenattion
   learning) point of view about generative adversarial nets. the initial
   remarks about what dr. sanjeev arora termed [17]geoff   s neural net
   hypothesis and its inconsistency with the curse of dimensionality is
   worth the 43 minutes of our/your time watching it. it occurred in the
   first 5 minutes. one corollary of the thinking by dr. arora is that
   real life data distributions are special in some way and that deep
   neural networks are tuned in some way to these distributions, even if
   we do not really know how, as of yet. we might be witnessing something
   deep and fundamental about the nature of networks in complex
   high-dimensional systems displaying similar properties and   . attracting
   each other.

   the issues addressed in the rest of the talk were:
     * generalization: is the real discriminator roughly equal to the
       synthetic discrimator (once it has lost to the generator)?


     * equilibrium: of game-theoretic conceptual source in a 2-player
       game    it may not exist


     * bounded capacity discriminators are weak: this introduces
       limitations for the generalization capacity of the whole
       generator/discriminator set up, as it is properly explained in the
       video.


     *     but partially there is some good news about the number of samples
       > nlogn/    2, and this leading to generalization happening with
       respect to neural distance


     * etc   


   i was a bit surprised by the connection of generative adversarial nets
   and advanced research in game theory, which is a branch of economics.
   but this shouldn   t be so surprising, given the current highly
   quantitative character of cutting edge research in economics. the
   points dr. sanjeev arora talks about in equilibrium conditions for deep
   neural nets reminded me of the difficulty in understanding and have a
   solid grasp of the notion of equilibrium, both form a macroeconomic
   perspective and from a thermodynamics perspective.

   that is it for this last post of the week. i will see if i can get back
   to reviewing good papers, even if the pace of production and my own
   progress in this endeavour to have been put to a bit of a reality check
   stressors lately
