making id23 work

   what are the things-to-know while enabling id23 with
   tensorflow? [51]illia polosukhin, a co-founder of xix.ai, provided
   certain answers to this question, as well as delivered some practical
   insights at [52]tensorbeat 2017.

   as illia puts it, one doesn   t actually have to train data as part of
   [53]id23, but rather drive different types of
   observations form an environment, perform actions, etc.

   to do so, one can employ [54]openai gym, which is a toolkit for
   developing and comparing id23 algorithms. it features
   a library of environments for games, classical control systems, etc. to
   aid developers in creating algorithms of their own. each of the
   environments has the same api. the library also enables users to
   compare / share the results.

   illia demonstrated a sample code of an agent acting within an
   environment.

     [55]reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-acting-in-an-environment

   he also showed the code behind an agent.

          [56]reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-a-random-agent

   so, what makes it all work?

   the set of states and actions, coupled with the rules for transitioning
   from one state to another, make up the [57]markov decision process
   (mdp). one episode of this process (e.g., a single game) produces a
   finite sequence of states, actions, and rewards.

   what one has to define is:
     * a return (a total discounted reward)
     * a policy: the agent   s behavior (deterministic or stochastic)
     * the expected return starting from a particular state (state-value
       function, action-value function)



deep id24

   one of the ways to approach id23 is [58]deep
   id24   a model-free, off-policy technique. what it means is that
   there is no mdp approximation or learning inside the agent.
   observations are stored into replay buffers and are further used as
   training data for the model. being off-policy ensures that an optimal
   learning policy is independent of the agent   s actions.

   illia then demonstrated what the q-network code looks likes.

      [59]reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-q-network-sample-code

   as well as how to run optimization.

   [60]reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-optimization-of-a-q-network

   more examples can be found in [61]this github repo.

   as one of the tricks at hand when training a tensorflow model,
   [62]monitoredsession can be employed for:
     * handling pitfalls of distributed training
     * saving and restoring checkpoints
     * injecting computation into tensorflow training loop via hooks


   [63]al training courses

asynchronous advantage actor-critic

   to enhance id23, the [64]asynchronous advantage
   actor-critic (a3c) algorithm can be used. in contrast to a deep
   id24 network, it makes use of multiple agents represented by
   multiple neural networks, which interact with multiple environments.
   each of the agents interacts with its own copy of the environment and
   is independent of the experience of the other agents.

   furthermore, this algorithm allows for estimating both a value function
   and a policy (a set of action id203 outputs). the agent uses the
   value estimate (the critic) to update the policy (the actor) more
   intelligently than traditional id189. finally, one
   can estimate how different the output is from the expected one.

                              -critic-algorithm

   all the above mentioned can be applied in such spheres as robotics,
   finance, industrial optimization, and predictive assistance.

   (lead data scientist at badoo) also shared how to apply reinforcement
   learning within the gaming industry.
