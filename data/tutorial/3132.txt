exact id136 for probabilistic programs

what is psi?

   [sveq2joint.png] psi is a solver which takes as input a probabilistic
   program and automatically computes the exact id203 density
   function (pdf) represented by that program. to compute the pdf, psi
   uses symbolic id136 techniques. it handles probabilistic programs
   with both discrete and continuous distributions. psi assumes that loops
   in the probabilistic program are of finite length. psi's ability to
   compute exact pdfs is in contrast to almost all existing techniques
   which are approximate in nature (these use sampling or variational
   methods).
   the pdf computed by psi can be used for a variety of queries, including
   computing the id203 of assertions, expectations, performing
   id136, computing differences, quantifying the loss of precision,
   and others. because of this, psi is a useful platform for encoding
   applications from various domains that require probabilistic reasoning.

       for reference, here is the artifact submitted to cav (which was
       approved): [8]artifact with source code, benchmarks and
       documentation. (note: the included version of psi is out-of-date
       and performs significantly worse.)
