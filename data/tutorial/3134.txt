google summer of code 2017     week 1 of integrating gensim with scikit-learn
and keras

   [49]chinmaya pancholi 2017-05-30[50] gensim, [51]student incubator

   this is my first post as part of google summer of code 2017 working
   with [52]gensim. i would be working on the project    gensim integration
   with scikit-learn and keras    this summer.

   i stumbled upon gensim while working on a project which utilized the
   [53]id97 model. i was looking for a functionality to suggest words
   semantically similar to the given input word and gensim   s
   [54]similar_by_word function did it for me! after this, i started to
   dig into gensim   s codebase further and found the library to be slick,
   robust and well-documented. when i came to know that gensim was
   participating in gsoc 2017, i was stoked as i believed this was a
   chance for me to impactfully use my background with natural language
   processing and machine learning by contributing to and improving a
   popular library like gensim. in the past, i have undertaken some
   relevant coursework which includes courses like deep learning, machine
   learning and information retrieval to name a few. these courses not
   only helped me to get a strong theoretical understanding of the domains
   of nlp and ml in general but the associated lab components also gave me
   hands-on development experience to work on a real-world task. as a
   sophomore, i was also an intern at the [55]language technologies
   research center at international institute of information technology,
   hyderabad where i worked on developing an open-domain
   question-answering system using deep learning.

   my first substantial contribution to gensim was [56]pr #1207. the pr
   helped to ensure that a id97 model could be trained again if the
   function _minimize_model did not actually modify the model. after this,
   i worked on [57]pr #1209 which fixed [58]issue #863. this pr added a
   function predict_output_word to id97 class which gave the
   id203 distribution of the central word given the context words as
   input. another task that i worked on was [59]issue #1082 which was
   resolved in [60]pr #1327. the pr fixed the backward-incompatibility
   arising because of the attribute random_state added to lda model in the
   gensim   s 0.13.2 version.

   apart from this, i have already worked to some extent on the
   integration of gensim with scikit-learn and keras in [61]pr #1244 and
   [62]pr #1248 respectively. in pr #1244, i worked on adding a
   scikit-learn wrapper for gensim   s lsi (id45)
   model. this enabled us to use    sklearn-like    api for gensim   s lsi model
   using functions like fit, transform, partial_fit, get_params and
   set_params. pr #1248 added a function get_embedding_layer to gensim   s
   keyedvectors class which simplified incorporating a pre-trained
   id97 model in one   s keras model. hopefully, the learnings from both
   these pull-requests would be helpful while coding up the wrappers for
   the remaining models as well. currently, i am working towards wrapping
   up [63]pr #1201 which enables one to keep track of the training loss
   for id97 model.

   all [64]these previous contributions to gensim have helped me immensely
   in getting comfortable with gensim   s codebase as well as the
   community   s coding standards and practices.

   gensim is a python library for id96, document indexing and
   similarity retrieval with large corpora. the package is designed mainly
   for unsupervised learning tasks and thus, to usefully apply it to a
   real business problem, the output generated by gensim models should go
   to a supervised learning system. presently, the most popular choices
   for supervised learning libraries are scikit-learn (for simpler data
   analysis) and keras (for id158s). the objective of
   my project is to create wrappers around all gensim models to seaid113ssly
   integrate gensim with these libraries. you could take a look at my
   detailed proposal [65]here.

   this work would be a joint project with the [66]shorttext package.
   shorttext is a collection of algorithms for multi-class classification
   for short texts using python. shorttext already has scikit-learn
   wrappers for some of gensim   s models such as latent dirichlet
   allocation model, latent semantic analysis model and random projections
   model. similarly, shorttext also has wrapper implementations for
   integration of various neural network algorithms in keras with gensim.
   however, there are certain differences in the implementation of the
   keras wrappers in shorttext with the implementation planned in gensim.
   for instance, for the wrapper of any gensim model using keyedvectors
   class, shorttext uses a matrix for converting the training input data
   into a format suitable for training the neural network ([67]see here),
   while gensim would be using a keras [68]embedding layer. this not just
   simplifies the way in which we create our keras model (simply create
   the first layer of the model as the keras embedding layer and then the
   remaining keras model) but also uses less memory since we are not using
   any extra matrix. in any case, we can take several cues from the
   wrappers implemented in shorttext while developing wrappers in
   gensim as well. so, a big shout-out to stephen for creating this useful
   package!     

   i would like to thank radim, lev, stephen, ivan and gordon who have all
   helped me tremendously to learn and improve through their valuable
   suggestions and feedback. the gensim community has been really
   forthcoming right from the start and on several occasions, i have been
   guided in the right direction by the members. i am exhilarated to be
   working with gensim and i really hope that the work that i do this
   summer would be useful for gensim users.
