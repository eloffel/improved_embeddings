id3 (gans) explained in layman terms

     * posted by [34]al gharakhanian on december 22, 2016 at 1:00pm

   nips2016 (neural information processing system) is an annual event that
   attracts the best and the brightest of the field of machine learning
   both from academia as well as industry. i attended this event last
   week for the very first time and was blown away by the volume and
   diversity of the presentations. one unusual observation was that a
   large chunk of exhibitors were hedge funds in search of ml talent.

   some of the papers were highly abstract and theoretical while others
   quite pragmatic from the likes of google, facebook. the topics were
   wide-ranging but there were two topics stood out attracting a sizable
   attention.

   the first was    id3    (gans for short), while
   the second was    id23    (rl for short). my plan is to
   cover gans in this post and hope to do the same for rl in a future
   post.

   gan is a relatively new machine learning architecture for neural
   networks pioneered by ian goodfellow and his colleagues at university
   of montreal in 2014. in order to fully understand gans, one has to
   understand the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
   machines. supervised machines are trained and tested based on large
   quantities of    labeled    samples. in other words, they require large
   datasets containing the    features    or    predictors    as well as its
   corresponding labels. as an example, a supervised image
   classifier engine would require a set of images with correct labels
   (e.g. cars, flowers, tables, . . .). unsupervised learners don   t have
   this luxury and they learn on the job as they go. they learn from
   mistakes and try not to make similar errors in the future.

   the disadvantage of supervised machines is their need for large sums of
   labeled data. labeling large number of samples is costly and time
   consuming. unsupervised learners don   t have this disadvantage but they
   tend to be less accurate. naturally there is a strong motivation to
   improve the unsupervised machines and to lessen the reliance on the
   supervised ones. you can view gans and rls means of improving
   unsupervised machines (neural networks).

   the second useful concept to remember is the concept of    generative
   models   . these are models that predict by generating the most likely
   outcome given a sequence of input samples. as an example, a generative
   model can generate the next likely video frame based on the previous
   frames. another example is search engines that try to predict the next
   likely word before it is entered by the user.

   keeping these two concepts in mind, we now can tackle gans. you can
   view a gan as a new architecture for an unsupervised neural network
   able to achieve far better performance compared to traditional nets. to
   be more precise gans are a new way of training a neural net. gans
   contain not one but two independent nets that work separately and act
   as adversaries (see the diagram below). the first neural net is called
   the discriminator (d) and is the net that has to undergo training. d is
   the classifier that will do the heavy lifting during the normal
   operation once the training is complete. the second network is called
   the generator (g) and is tasked to generate random samples that
   resemble real samples with a twist rendering them as fake samples.
   [aaeaaqaaaaaaaajtaaaajdnmywjkywyxlti5mtmtngexms1hmdixltdkndfimjnkn2q3yw
   .png]

   as an example, consider an image classifier d designed to identify a
   series of images depicting various animals. now consider an adversary
   (g) with the mission to fool d using carefully crafted images that look
   almost right but not quite. this is done by picking a legitimate sample
   randomly from training set (latent space) and synthesizing a new image
   by randomly altering its features (by adding random noise). as an
   example, g can fetch the image of a cat and can add an extra eye to the
   image converting it to a false sample. the result is an image very
   similar to a normal cat with the exception of the number of eye.

    during training, d is presented with a random mix of legitimate images
   from training data as well as fake images generated by g. its task is
   to identify correct and fake inputs. based on the outcome, both
   machines try to fine-tune their parameters and become better in what
   they do. if d makes the right prediction, g updates its parameters in
   order to generate better fake samples to fool d. if d   s prediction is
   incorrect, it tries to learn from its mistake to avoid similar mistakes
   in the future. the reward for net d is the number of right predictions
   and the reward for g is the number d   s errors. this process continues
   until an equilibrium is established and d   s training is optimized.

   one of the weaknesses of early gans was stability but we have seen very
   promising work that can alleviate this problem (details are beyond the
   scope of this post). in a way of an analogy, gans act like the
   political environment of a country with two rival political
   parties. each party continuously attempts to improve on its weaknesses
   while trying to find and leverage vulnerabilities in their adversary to
   push their agenda. over time both parties become better operators.

   as for the impact of rls and gans on semiconductors, both new
   architectures need significantly more gates, more cpu cycles, and more
   memory. nothing to complain about.
