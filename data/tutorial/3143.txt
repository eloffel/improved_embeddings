[7]microsoft launches open-source cognitive toolkit 2.0

   june 4, 2017, 8:37 a.m. [8]by: vishakha jha [9]edit

   cognitive toolkit 2.0

   microsoft cognitive toolkit version 2.0, previously known as cntk is
   now available under an open-source license as announced by microsoft on
   june 1. since the beta release of the cognitive toolkit in october
   2016, the technology has been accepted by companies across the world to
   define and train neural networks, which are systems that can learn how
   to perform a task similar to human brain.

   the microsoft cognitive toolkit is a deep-learning toolkit which
   describes neural networks through a directed graph with leaf nodes
   representing input values and other nodes represent matrix operations
   upon their inputs.

   cognitive toolkit 2.0 includes many new features through deep learning
   algorithm which will allow developers to create and evaluate their own
   neural networks that can scale across gpus and other machines on
   massive data sets and it has also improved search relevance. it is
   built with a sophisticated algorithm that offers expressive and
   easy-to-use architecture.

   the toolkit supports keras, a user-friendly open-source neural network
   library used for deep learning applications. the keras api takes a
   user-centric approach to developing ai-enabled applications that could
   help the user with little experience on the subject to get results. it
   enhances training capabilities by including java language bindings used
   for evaluating models and supporting the latest versions of nvidia   s
   deep learning sdk and advanced gpu   s.

   there are also model compression extensions enabling image recognition
   and other cognitive toolkit models to run faster on standard servers,
   smartphones and embedded devices with more modest processing
   capabilities.

   although skype, cortana, bing, xbox and leading data scientists already
   use the cognitive toolkit but now it is part of an initiative to make
   ai technology accessible to everyone. in addition to the cognitive
   toolkit, developers can access a suite of cloud computing applications
   via microsoft azure or apis, via microsoft cognitive services.
