   this is a list of the best resources about ai that i could find on the
   web. it will be the most useful for beginners, people who want to learn
   this field, but don   t know where to start.

   i have developed a strategy for myself, for learning the basics of ai
   in the fastest and most practical way, and i   m sure it will be useful
   to you as well.

   here   s the list of the best resources to begin learning ai with:

general overview of the field, most important topics:

     * artificial intelligence: a modern approach (aima)
       [11]http://www.amazon.com/artificial-intelligence-modern-approach-e
       dition/dp/0136042597
       this is the best book about ai, and one of the best books written
       on any topic. ever. it may be challenging for a complete beginner,
       but it covers most of the topics and fields of ai, and if you will
       read it         you will have a very solid foundations of the field. this
       is definitely a best place to start.
     * artificial intelligence course on edx:

       rtificial-579#.u8ar941dv3s
       more lectures: [13]https://www.youtube.com/user/cs188spring2013
       this is an excellent course from berkeley, series of video
       lectures, a lot of them are based on aima, it is a perfect
       complement to the book, it will make it much more understandable
       and enjoyable to read. plus there   s great practical projects.

lisp         best programming language for ai:

   of all the programming languages you can choose to practice ai there
   are 2 best options: lisp and python. lisp was created specifically for
   creating ai, and it is widely considered to be the most elegant and
   brilliant programming language ever. here   s the best way to learn it:
     * land of lisp(lisp plus some ai):
       [14]http://www.amazon.com/land-lisp-learn-program-game/dp/159327281
       2/
       this is an excellent and very fun introduction to lisp, makes
       learning very enjoyable, understandable, and includes a lot of
       algorithms and basic principles that will be very useful when you
       will be going throuhg aima.
     * mit course based on sicp book:

       4090#t=253
       this is a course on lisp and basics of computer science, based on
       one of the most influential and seminal books in cs            structure
       and interpretation of computer programs   .

machine learning.:

   machine learning is the most    practical    and immediately useful
   subfield of ai, which is great because focusing on learning it will
   allow you immediately benefit from, and apply your knowledge on
   practical projects.

       ing-applications/dp/0596529325

how mind works:

   on the opposite end of a spectrum         here   s some fantastic(and very
   entertaining) books about how human mind works. it is not necessary
   very practical, but they are very exciting and fun to read, and
   obviously understanding of human brain can be very useful. at the very
   least         you will be inspired and enjoy reading them a lot.

       [24]http://www.amazon.com/principles-neural-science-edition-kandel/
       dp/0071390111 this is the best book i could find that goes in depth
       into ns. 2 books above presented the general theories how mind
       works, this one talks about hardcore science, neuro-anatomy and
       such. very interesting, but also very long         i   m still reading it.
