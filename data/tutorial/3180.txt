[86]sonnet

   sonnet is a library built on top of tensorflow for building complex
   neural networks.

installation

   sonnet can be installed from pip, with or without gpu support.

   this installation is compatible with linux/mac os x and python 2.7 and
   3.{4,5,6}. the version of tensorflow installed must be >= 1.5.
   installing sonnet supports the [87]virtualenv installation mode of
   tensorflow, as well as the [88]native pip install.

   to install sonnet, run:
$ pip install dm-sonnet

   sonnet will work with both the cpu and gpu version of tensorflow, but
   to allow for that it does not list tensorflow as a requirement, so you
   need to install tensorflow separately if you haven't already done so.

usage example

   the following code constructs a linear module and connects it to
   multiple inputs. the variables (i.e., the weights and biases of the
   linear transformation) are automatically shared.
import sonnet as snt

# provide your own functions to generate data tensors.
train_data = get_training_data()
test_data = get_test_data()

# construct the module, providing any configuration necessary.
linear_regression_module = snt.linear(output_size=flags.output_size)

# connect the module to some inputs, any number of times.
train_predictions = linear_regression_module(train_data)
test_predictions = linear_regression_module(test_data)
