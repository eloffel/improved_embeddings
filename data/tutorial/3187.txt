[7]id170 is *not* rl

   it's really strange to look back now over the past ten to fifteen years
   and see a very small pendulum that no one really cares about swing
   around. i've spent the last ten years trying to convince you that
   id170 is rl; now i'm going to tell you that was a lie
   :).
   short personal history
   back in 2005, john langford, daniel marcu and i had a workshop paper at
   nips on [8]relating id170 to id23.
   basically the message of that paper is: you can cast structured
   prediction as rl, and then use off-the-shelf rl techniques like
   [9]conservative policy iteration to solve it, and this works pretty
   well. this view arose, for me, main from collins and roark's
   [10]incremental structured id88 model, but i'm sure it dates back
   much further than that (almost certainly there's work from neural nets
   land in the 80s; i'd certainly appreciate pointers!). this led
   [11]eventually to [12]searn, and then in the early 2010s, i went around
   a bunch of places (acl, aaai, icml, etc.), [13]espousing
   [14]connections between id170 and (inverse)
   id23 ([15]slides).
   this kinda sorta caught on in a very small subcommunity.
   one thing i should have realized looking back ten years is that you
   should not try to sell a hammer to hammer manufacturers, but rather to
   people with weird nails. i spent too much time and energy trying to
   convince the "traditional id170" crowd (the crf and m3n
   and id166^struct folks) that the "rl" view of id170 was
   awesome. that was a losing strategy, unfortunately. (although i learned
   a few nights ago at dinner that this might be changing now!)
   but now everything has changed. to some degree, ross, gordon and
   bagnell's [16]dagger is a successful, better successor to searn, and
   for years i had gone around telling everyone dagger is my favorite
   algorithm ever (it consistently outperforms searn's in their---and
   my---experiments, and is really really easy to implement and has
   stronger-ish theory). and then dagger (or more precisely [17]dad) gets
   [18]renamed/rebranded as "[19]scheduled sampling" (though you should
   read marc'aurelio's comment, which is very on point), and now these
   ideas are everywhere, particularly in sequence-to-sequence neural
   transduction models.
   nowadays
   in the past year or two, there's been a [20]flurry of work applying not
   just imitation learning algorithms like dagger to neural models for
   id170 problems, but also just applying straight-up rl
   algorithms (like reinforce, policy gradient, or actor/critic) to them.
   the important point is that while people have tried to do things like
   neural crfs, etc., the basic sequence-to-sequence style model naturally
   fits a search-based id170 (aka rl-ish) view.
   but these tasks are not the same and, in fact, id170 is
   much simpler, and i think we need to develop algorithms that take that
   into account.
   the biggest difference is that in (all or at least almost all)
   id170 problems, conditioned on the input x, the world
   is known, deterministic and therefore reversible and/or
   fully-explorable (modulo limits of computation). this is generally not
   true in rl, and one of biggest challenges in rl is that once you take
   an action, you cannot un-take that action, and you cannot try out other
   alternatives.
   that is to say: computation aside, in id170,
   conditioned on x, you can build out the entire search tree and do
   whatever the heck you want with it. (of course "computation aside"
   makes no sense in a sp setting because the whole difficulty of sp is
   computation.) in fact, one of the big advantages to things like crfs is
   effectively that they do build out the entire search tree, at least
   implicitly, which is possibly precisely because of the limited
   expressivity of features.
   this observation is probably perfectly obvious to most nlp folks. in a
   sense, the [21]semantic [22]parsing [23]crowd has been doing something
   reinforcement-learning like for quite some time. you produce a semantic
   parse, run it against a database, check if you get the correct answer
   or not. if so, positive reward; if not, negative. but no one (as far as
   i know) just produces one parse: you produce a beam of a bunch of
   parses and try them all. this is definitely not something you can do in
   standard rl, but it is something you can do in id170.
   in my mind, this was (and continues to be) one of the major weakness of
   the searn/dagger approach to id170 that continues to be
   a problem in applying standard rl algorithms to id170.
   in a real sense, i think this is something that [24]incremental
   id88, broken [25]laso and not-broken [26]laso-bst, and
   [27]id195laso got right that the more rl-ish approaches got wrong.
   (this continues to be true in bandit id170, which will
   get a separate post in the maybe-near future.) one approach that blends
   the two to some degree is [28]vieira and eisner's recent paper that
   uses id145 and change propogation within lols (which is
   effectively a variant of [29]aggrevate, a follow-on to dagger) to learn
   to prune (it's not obvious to me how to generalize this to other tasks
   yet).
   why the gap?
   i don't think this gap is an accident, and i think there are
   essentially two reasons it exists.
   first, as suggested above, is the question of computation. if you're
   willing to say "i don't care about computation" then you might as well
   put yourself in crf world where life is (relatively) easy, at least if
   you want to do analysis. if you do care about computation, then doing
   the "purely greedy" thing is very natural and then you can say "well i
   know i'm computationally efficient because i'm greedy, and now i can
   focus entirely on the statistical problem." once you're willing to
   spend a bit more computation, you have to figure out how to "charge"
   yourself properly for that computation. that is, you enter a world
   where there's a trade-off between statistics and computation (though
   not in the usual sense) and it's not at all clear how to balance that.
   it's also hard to convince myself that it's better to spend ten times
   longer on a single structured example than to do ten different
   examples. this is a question i've been interested in since [30]my
   dissertation (p44) but have made basically zero progress on:
   [31][thesis.png]
   (note that i don't currently agree with the entirety of this
   passage---in particular, the complexity argument is somewhat
   broken---but i think the basic idea is right.)
   second, i think there's a bit of a looking-under-the-lamppost effect
   that's not easy to ignore. here, the lamppost is mainly a computational
   efficiency lamppost, and secondarily a convenience lamppost. greedy
   search is really fast. even compared to id125 with a beam size of
   k, greedy is often much more than k times faster because you don't have
   bookkeeping overhead. and it's way easier to implement greedy solutions
   than non-greedy, especially in neural land if you want things to be
   efficient on a gpu. and often toolkits have greedy already implemented
   for you. this obviously isn't un-recoverable, but runs into the problem
   of: if i can do 50 sentences greedily on my gpu in the time it would
   take to do beam-10 search for one of the sentences, is the computation
   really going to come off in my favor?
   as always, i'd appreciate pointers to work that i don't know about that
   addresses any of these challenges!

          one of the advantages of rl is that it does not build out the
          whole search tree, so does not require detailed symbolic
          representations of multiple alternatives at the same time.
          neither the brain's neural hardware nor the various fancy-dan
          deep learning networks comfortably accommodate the
          representation of detailed symbolic alternatives, as far as we
          know. so it is well worth pursuing rl and similar methods in
          which the representation of prior context and current
          uncertainty is less necessarily cut-and-dried than in (say)
          crfs.

          i wonder if the argument that "rl does not build out the whole
          search tree" true in practice. most people perform epochs over
          the dataset and therefore reset the world to a start state. the
          agent can then execute a trajectory, different from what it
          tried earlier, and keep doing it to eventually explore the
          entire search space. in fact papers such as trust region policy
          optimization (figure 1 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477.pdf)
          perform multiple rollouts from the same state (to be fair they
          do mention that it works in a simulation). of course this won't
          hold in a real world, you cannot remake a glass jar that a robot
          has accidentally broken while exploring. similarly, you cannot
          just reset to a start state that easily.

          @chris: thanks! i don't know enough about how the brain works to
          say something interesting, but this is cool to think about. in
          eye-tracking, people do look back, for instance, when they get
          garden pathed or whatever, which isn't necessarily maintaining
          multiple hypotheses, but maintaining some sort of uncertainty.
          (like jinho choi's selective branching.)
          @dipendra: agreed, good point. cpi also assumes you can reset
          (which is one reason we chose it), which is totally a fine
          assumption in sp. even if you do ten passes over the data,
          though, you're still only trying a very very small subset of
          possible trajectories. but this definitely goes to the question
          of: would i rather expand more now, or do this sentence again
          later in a few hours?

          there is a lot of psychological evidence about what happens
          during sentence processing, including evidence that there is
          some kind of representation of non-determinism. for example,
          there is marslen-wilson's cohort model
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohort_model). but models like
          this are largely silent on details of the representations used.
          which computational models cannot be.

          hi hal, an interesting blog post!
          you might be interested in our recent paper which adapts the
          lols approach to training id56s:

          lacoste-julien
          [49]arxiv:1706.04499
          it will be presented at the [50]icml 2017 workshop on deep
          id170
          (in case that you are around...).
