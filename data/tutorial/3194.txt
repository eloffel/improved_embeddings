easy-first parser

easy-first dependency parser based on hierarchical tree lstms

   the techniques behind the parser are described in the paper
   [65]easy-first id33 with hierarchical tree lstms. further
   materials could be found [66]here.

required software

     * python 2.7 interpreter
     * [67]pyid98 library

train a parsing model

   the software requires having a training.conll and development.conll
   files formatted according to the [68]conll data format.

   to train a parsing model with for either parsing architecture type the
   following at the command prompt:
python src/parser.py --outdir [results directory] --train training.conll --dev d
evelopment.conll [--extrn path_to_external_embeddings_file]

   we use the same external embedding used in [69]transition-based
   id33 with stack long short-term memory which can be
   downloaded from the authors [70]github repository and [71]directly
   here.

   note 1: the reported test result is the one matching the highest
   development score.

   note 2: the parser calculates (after each iteration) the accuracies
   excluding punctuation symbols by running the eval.pl script from the
   conll-x shared task and stores the results in directory specified by
   the --outdir.

   note 3: the external embeddings parameter is optional and could be
   omitted.

parse data with your parsing model

   the command for parsing a test.conll file formatted according to the
   [72]conll data format with a previously trained model is:
python src/parser.py --predict --outdir [results directory] --test test.conll [-
-extrn extrn.vectors] --model [trained model file] --params [param file generate
 during training]

   the parser will store the resulting conll file in the out directory
   (--outdir).
