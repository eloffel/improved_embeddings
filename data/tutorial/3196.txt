installing-tensorflow-with-gpu

   guide to installing tensorflow with nvidia gpu. use of gpu for compute
   only. tested with gtx 1080 ti. fixes login loop problem. installing
   tensorflow for gtx 1080 ti gpu for computation only.

   steps:
    1. download cuda toolkit 8.0 runfile(local)
       [69]https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

   [70]cuda toolkit 8.0
    2. download cudnn from [71]https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn -> might
       need to register for an account

     * agree to the terms of the cudnn software license agreement
     * download cudnn v5.1 (jan 20, 2017), for cuda 8.0
     * select the cudnn v5.1 library for linux and save the .tgz [72]cudnn
       5.1

    3. navigate to [73]www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx and download the
       runfile to install the 378 driver for gtx 1080 ti (or whichever
       driver suits you):

product type: geforce
product series: geforce 10 series
product geforce gtx 1080 ti
operating system: linux 64-bit

   [74]nvidia 378 driver
    4. run sudo apt-get install build-essential
    5. $ sudo rm /etc/x11/xorg.conf (it's ok if this doesn't exist)
    6. create the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf file with :

$ sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
blacklist-nouveau.conf put:
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0

   then $sudo update-initramfs -u
    7. reboot your computer
    8. on login screen, press ctrl + alt + f1 to open up login as tty1
    9. navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files from steps 1,
       2 and 3
   10. run $ chmod +x cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run
   11. run $ chmod +x nvidia-linux-x86_64-378.13.run
   12. run sudo service lightdm stop
   13. run $sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-* this is to ensure no
       previous nvidia drivers are installed.
   14. run $ sudo ./nvidia-linux-x86_64-378.13.run --no-opengl-files the
       flag is important because installing opengl mucks up the
       installation just continue through the installation untill it asks
       you 'would you like to run the nvidia-xconfig utility...' hit no
       for this
   15. run $sudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run --no-opengl-libs

accept the eula
no to install nvidia accelerated graphics driver for linux-x86_64
yes to install the cuda 8.0 toolkit
enter toolkit location to be  (default): /usr/local/cuda-8.0
yes to install a symbolic link at /usr/local/cuda
yes to install the cuda 8.0 samples
default location for cuda samples location (or wherever you want them)

   16. $ sudo modprobe nvidia
   17. set environment path variables (add to .bashrc):

export path=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:$path
export ld_library_path=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$ld_library_path

   18. run $ source ~/.bashrc to load your new .bashrc
   19. run $ cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version to verify installation
   20. check cuda driver version:

$ nvcc -v

   21. run $ sudo service lightdm start there should be no issues at this
       point with logging in
   22. navigate to the cuda samples we installed in step 15 and run $ make
       (note, this step might take some time)
   23. navigate to: nvidia_cuda-8.0_samples/bin/x86_64/linux/release/ for
       the tests and run:

$ ./devicequery

   to see your graphics card specs and
$ ./bandwidthtest

   to check if its operating correctly.

   both should state they pass
   24. reboot your computer
   25. run:

$ tar -xzvf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v5.1.tgz
$ sudo cp cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
$ sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include/

   26. $ sudo apt-get install libcupti-dev

   -> all cuda dependencies for tensorflow should now be installed

   installing tensorflow downloading tensorflow 27. $ git clone
   https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow (install git with sudo apt
   install git if necessary) 28. $ cd tensorflow
   29. $ git checkout r1.0

   installing bazel (used to build tensorflow from source) 30. $ sudo
   add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
   31. $ sudo apt-get update
   32. $ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
   33. $ echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt
       stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
   34. $ curl https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add
       - (might need to install curl here with sudo apt install curl)
   35. $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bazel

   install dependencies 36.

   a. python 2.7 - $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-dev
   python-pip python-wheel

   b. python 3.5 - $ sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-dev
   python3-pip python3-wheel
   37. navigate to tensorflow directory $ cd tensorflow
   38. configure it $ ./configure configure based on your preferences,
       specify the python version you want. e.g.: /usr/bin/python3 be sure
       to:

say y for installing with cuda support
specify cuda version as 8.0
specify cudnn version as 5
specify comma separated cuda compute capabilities as 3.0

   39. $ bazel build --config=opt --config=cuda
       //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package (this might take a
       while)
   40. build .whl file $
       bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package
       /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
   41. install $ sudo pip3 install
       /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl

   note that the exact filename might be different, but it will still be
   in /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/ if you followed the previous steps.

   if you are using a different version of python, install with its
   corresponding pip instead. 42. verify installation by running python
   after navigating out of tensorflow directory
$ python3

>> import tensorflow as tf
>> hello = tf.constant('hello, tensorflow!')
>> sess = tf.session(config=tf.configproto(log_device_placement=true))
>> print(sess.run(hello))

   log_device_placement should show your gpu
