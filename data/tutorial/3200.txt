   new vm image         updated march 2018!

   i love to write about [11]face recognition, [12]image recognition and
   [13]all the [14]other [15]cool things you can build with machine
   learning. whenever possible, i try to include code examples or even
   [16]write libraries/apis to make it as easy as possible for a developer
   to play around with these fun technologies.

   but the number one question i get asked is    how in the world do i get
   all these open source libraries installed and working on my computer?   

   if you aren   t a long-time linux user, it can be really hard to figure
   out how to get a system fully configured with all the required machine
   learning libraries and tools like tensorflow, keras, opencv, and dlib.
   the majority of the issues that get filed on my own open source
   projects are about how to install these tools. a lot of people get
   stuck while installing everything and give up before ever getting to
   play around with any code. that   s a shame!

   try out machine learning now with this pre-configured ubuntu vm.
   everything is ready to go.

   there   s no reason it should be so hard to try things out in 2017. to
   make it simple for anyone to play around with machine learning, i   ve
   put together a simple virtual machine image that you can download and
   run without any complicated installation steps.

   the virtual machine image has ubuntu linux desktop 16.04 lts 64-bit
   pre-installed with the following machine learning tools:
     * python 3.5
     * opencv 3.2 with python 3 bindings
     * dlib 19.9 with python 3 bindings
     * tensorflow 1.5 for python 3
     * keras 2 for python 3
     * face_recognition for python 3 (for playing around with face
       recognition)
     * pycharm community edition already set up and ready to go for all
       these libraries
     * convenient code examples ready to run, right on the desktop!
     * even the webcam is preconfigured to work inside the linux vm for
       opencv / face_recognition examples (as long as you set up your
       webcam to be accessible in the vmware settings).

   note: this is a desktop vm meant for educational purposes, not a vm
   meant for use on a server. due to licensing and installation
   complications, there   s no gpu acceleration / cuda support provided. so
   you don   t need an nvidia gpu to try this out, but it also won   t take
   advantage of a gpu if you have one.

how to download and run the deep learning vm in 3 simple steps:

    1. [17]download the 7.7gb vm .tar.gz file (hosted on a fast connection
       thanks to the fine people at [18]cydne!). uncompress the file when
       it   s complete. [19]a vm for virtualbox is also available, but the
       performance in virtualbox can be pretty bad. so don   t the
       virtualbox version unless you don   t have any other choice.
    2. you need vmware to run this virtual machine image. if you don   t
       already have vmware installed, download the appropriate version for
       your operating system. windows or linux users should download the
       free [20]vmware workstation player. mac users can grab the free
       [21]vmware fusion 30-day demo.
    3. launch vmware, open the vm image and run it! linux should boot
       right up. see below for the user account password.

tips

    1. the username is    deeplearning    and the password is    deeplearning   .
       you might want to change the password after you log in.
    2. this is a 64-bit virtual machine. you   ll need a 64-bit cpu, circa
       2011 or newer to run it. sorry, but it won   t work if you have an
       older cpu in your computer.
    3. if you launch pycharm community edition from the left sidebar,
       there are several pre-created projects you can open. try the
       face_recognition, opencv or keras projects and run some of the
       demos. right-click on the code window and choose    run    to run the
       current file in pycharm.
    4. if you configure your webcam in vmware settings, you can access
       your webcam from inside the linux virtual machine! try running one
       of the face_recognition webcam demos after setting it up.

   have fun!
