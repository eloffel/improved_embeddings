generative-adversarial-networks

   my [69]blog post on gans and overview of some associated papers.

   id3 (gans) are one of the hottest topics in
   deep learning. from a high level, gans are composed of two components,
   a generator and a discriminator. the discriminator has the task of
   determining whether a given image looks natural (ie, is an image from
   the dataset) or looks like it has been artificially created. the task
   of the generator is to create natural looking images that are similar
   to the original data distribution, images that look natural enough to
   fool the discriminator network.

   the analogy used in the paper is that the generative model is like    a
   team of counterfeiters, trying to produce and use fake currency    while
   the discriminative model is like    the police, trying to detect the
   counterfeit currency   . the generator is trying to fool the
   discriminator while the discriminator is trying to not get fooled by
   the generator.

   as the models train through alternating optimization, both methods are
   improved until a point where the    counterfeits are indistinguishable
   from the genuine articles   .

   the tutorial is written in python, with the tensorflow library, so it
   would be good to have familiarity with tensorflow before taking a look
   at this tutorial.

how to use jupyter notebooks

    1. first step is always to clone the repository.

git clone https://github.com/uclaacmai/generative-adversarial-network-tutorial.g
it

    2. next, we want to make sure we have jupyter notebook installed. you
       can either follow one of two paths. you can either install anaconda
       (which installs python, jupyter notebook, and a bunch of other
       useful computing libraries) or use pip.

     * to install anaconda, take a look at their [70]website, which has
       some pretty great documentation.
     * if you want to install using pip, you'll need to update pip with
       the following code (replace pip with pip3 if using python 3).

   on linux/mac os:
pip install -u pip setuptools

   on windows:
python -m pip install -u pip setuptools

   next, you should be able to run the following.
pip install jupyter

    3. finally, run the following command and a new tab in your browser
       with the jupyter notebook should come up

jupyter notebook
