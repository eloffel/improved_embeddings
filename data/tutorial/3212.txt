darknet: open source neural networks in c

   darknet is an open source neural network framework written in c and
   cuda. it is fast, easy to install, and supports cpu and gpu
   computation. you can find the source on [1]github or you can read more
   about what darknet can do right here:

installing darknet

   darknet is easy to install and run. this post will guide you through
   it.

yolo: real-time id164

   you only look once (yolo) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object
   detection system.

id163 classification

   classify images with popular models like resnet and resnext.

nightmare

   use darknet's black magic to conjure ghosts, ghouls, and wild
   badgermoles. but be warned, ye who enter here: no one is safe in the
   land of nightmares.

id56s in darknet

   recurrent neural networks are all the rage for time-series data and
   nlp. learn how to use them in darknet!

darkgo: go in darknet

   play go using a policy network trained with darknet

tiny darknet

   image classification made tiny.

train a classifier on cifar-10

   learn how to train a classifier from scratch in darknet.

hardware guide: neural networks on gpus (updated 2016-1-30)

   i've had a number of people ask me what hardware i would recommend for
   training neural networks for vision applications. here are some of my
   thoughts.
