software

   the stanford nlp group makes some of our natural language processing
   software available to everyone! we provide statistical nlp, deep
   learning nlp, and rule-based nlp tools for major computational
   linguistics problems, which can be incorporated into applications with
   human language technology needs. these packages are widely used in
   industry, academia, and government.

   this code is actively being developed, and we try to answer questions
   and fix bugs on a best-effort basis.

   all our supported software distributions are written in java. current
   versions of our software from october 2014 forward require java 8+.
   (versions from march 2013 to september 2014 required java 1.6+;
   versions from 2005 to feb 2013 required java 1.5+. the stanford parser
   was first written in java 1.1.) distribution packages include
   components for command-line invocation, jar files, a java api, and
   source code. you can also find us on [8]github and [9]maven. a number
   of helpful people have extended our work, with bindings or translations
   for other languages. as a result, much of this software can also easily
   be used from python (or jython), ruby, perl, javascript, f#, and other
   .net and jvm languages.

   these software distributions are open source, licensed under the
   [10]gnu general public license (v3 or later for stanford corenlp; v2 or
   later for the other releases). note that this is the full gpl, which
   allows many free uses, but does not allow its incorporation (even in
   part or in translation) into any type of [11]proprietary software which
   you distribute. commercial licensing is also available; please
   [12]contact us if you are interested. bug fixes and code contributions
   are very welcome; see the [13]contributing page on [14]our github site.

questions

   have a support question? please ask us on [15]stack overflow using the
   tag stanford-nlp.

   feedback, questions, licensing issues, and bug reports / fixes can also
   be sent to our mailing lists (see immediately below).

mailing lists

   we have 3 mailing lists for this tool, all of which are shared with
   other javanlp tools (with the exclusion of the parser). each address is
   at @lists.stanford.edu:
    1. java-nlp-user this is the best list to post to in order to send
       feature requests, make announcements, or for discussion among
       javanlp users. (please ask support questions on [16]stack overflow
       using the stanford-nlp tag.)
       you have to subscribe to be able to use this list. join the list
       via [17]this webpage or by emailing
       java-nlp-user-join@lists.stanford.edu. (leave the subject and
       message body empty.) you can also [18]look at the list archives.
    2. java-nlp-announce this list will be used only to announce new
       versions of stanford javanlp tools. so it will be very low volume
       (expect 2-4 messages a year). join the list via [19]this webpage or
       by emailing java-nlp-announce-join@lists.stanford.edu. (leave the
       subject and message body empty.)
    3. java-nlp-support this list goes only to the software maintainers.
       it's a good address for licensing questions, etc. for general use
       and support questions, you're better off using stack overflow or
       joining and using java-nlp-user. you cannot join java-nlp-support,
       but you can mail questions to java-nlp-support@lists.stanford.edu.
