reconstruction, pca, svd and autoencoder

   [15]february 3, 2016february 15, 2016 [16]kevin wu[17]2 comments

   autoencoder is one of the most popular way to pre-train a deep network.
   the basic idea is that the input x is encoded in a shrinked layer and
   then the inner layer is used to reconstruct the output layer. if we
   assume a linear inner layer activation function, and we set the lower
   layer with weights w_low and upper layer with weights w_up, then it is
   basically:

   x_recon = x  w_low  w_up

   since they are all linear, a lot of people have found that it is very
   similar to a pca process. and in pca, if you use the first l principal
   components, you can project your original data matrix x into a smaller
   space as x_l. that is how one can do the 2d pca. and this process is
   very similar to the x  w_low, and w_low is just the pca loadings. now
   the question is, can we use pca to reconstruct x? it is actually a
   quite trivial question. it is not written everywhere but i found that
   [18]this blog is very helpful. anyway, if the loadings w_l has the
   dimensions of d by l(l<=d, it transform a vector of d dimension into l
   dimension)

   x_recon = x  w_l  transpose(w_l)

   it seems like w_up in the autoencoder case is just the transpose of
   w_low, in reality, i did find it to be roughly true even for sigmoid
   activation function.

   now, in another field, information retrieval, the svd technique is used
   widely to    provide a dimension reduction    (see [19]this blog). we all
   know that svd provide close information as pca. the right matrix in svd
   is actually the transpose(w_l). but svd can also perform figure
   reconstruction, by using certain amount of singular values. now the
   question is, pca and svd, are they actually just one thing in terms of
   reconstruction?

   i think there must be quite simple proof in math. but how about do an
   experiment? i use a face picture provided by the first blog in pca that
   i mentioned before (with link). the figure looks like this:

   face

   the code is like this:
prcomp(facedata,center=f,scale=f)
n=3
recon = facedata%*%(pc$rotation[,1:n]%*%t(pc$rotation[,1:n]))
image(recon)
n=3
a.svd = svd(facedata)
reconsvd = a.svd$u%*%diag(c(a.svd$d[1:n],rep(0,ncol(facedata)-n)))%*%t(a.svd$v)
image(reconsvd)

   after using only 3 components (or any other arbitrary number), the
   reconstruct picture is like this for both:

   face_recon.png

   the reconstructed figures for pca and svd are identical! that means
   they are very likely to be equivalent.

   and to confirm it, i also plot the two data matrices:

   pcasvd.png

   interesting   .

       svd is closely related to pca.
       svd on x has similar structure as pca in xx^t

            yes, but the whole article is to trying to say, they are not
            just    similar   , they are the same.
