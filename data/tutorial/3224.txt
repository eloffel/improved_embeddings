thang luong's thesis on id4

   this repository contains the latest version of my [87]thesis.

   motivated by my advisor (chris manning)'s suggestion on [88]extreme
   openness, i started sharing my thesis writing since day 1. while it is
   not yet clear how useful it is (smile), you can at least find all of
   the edits made by my advisor, page by page [89]here. thanks chris!

   code, data, and models described in this thesis can be found at our
   [90]stanford id4 project page.

features

   to save your reading time, let me highlight sections that i have put
   effort in writing beside my published papers:
     * chapter 7 - conclusion: this will give you a big picture of what i
       have achieved in my dissertation and how it influences subsequent
       work.
     * chapter 6 - id4 future (especially section 6.3 - future outlook):
       this is where i highlight potential research directions and
       speculate on the future.

   additionally, one can also read:
     * chapter 2 - background: this section, i hope, will be useful for
       any reader who wants to implement id4 by hand like me where i give
       details on things like derivations for lstm gradients.
     * chapter 1 - introduction: i hope to enlighten readers with the
       history of mt from the 17th century until now.
