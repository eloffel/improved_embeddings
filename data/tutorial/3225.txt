announcing gpus for google cloud platform

   cpu-based machines in the cloud are terrific for general purpose
   computing, but certain tasks such as rendering or large-scale
   simulations are much faster on specialized processors. graphics
   processing units (gpus) contain hundreds of times as many computational
   cores as cpus and are great at accelerating risk analysis, studying
   molecular binding or optimizing the shape of a turbine blade. if your
   cpu-based instance feels like a formula one race car but you   re in need
   of a rocket, you   re going to love our new cloud gpus.

   early in 2017, [15]google cloud platform will offer gpus worldwide for
   [16]google compute engine and [17]google cloud machine learning users.
   complex medical analysis, financial calculations, seismic/subsurface
   exploration, machine learning, video rendering, transcoding and
   scientific simulations are just some of the applications that can
   benefit from the highly parallel compute power of gpus. gpus in google
   cloud give you the freedom to focus on solving challenging
   computational problems while accessing gpu-equipped machines from
   anywhere. whether you need gpus for a few hours or several weeks, we   ve
   got you covered.

   google cloud will offer amd firepro s9300 x2 that supports powerful,
   gpu-based remote workstations. we'll also offer nvidia   tesla   p100 and
   k80 gpus for deep learning, ai and hpc applications that require
   powerful computation and analysis. gpus are offered in passthrough mode
   to provide bare metal performance. up to 8 gpu dies can be attached per
   vm instance including custom machine types.

   google cloud gpus give you the flexibility to mix and match
   infrastructure. you   ll be able to attach up to 8 gpu dies to any
   non-shared-core machine, whether you   re using an n1-highmem-8 instance
   with 3 tb of super-fast local ssd or a custom 28 vcpu virtual machine
   with 180 gb of ram. like our vms, gpus will be priced per minute and
   gpu instances can be up and running within minutes from [18]google
   cloud console or from the gcloud command line. whether you need one or
   dozens of instances, you only pay for what you use.

   during an early access program, customers have been running machine
   learning training, seismic analysis, simulations and visualization on
   gpu instances. startup [19]mapd gets excellent results with a
   gpu-accelerated database.
   "these new instances of gpus in the google cloud offer extraordinary
   performance advantages over comparable cpu-based systems and underscore
   the inflection point we are seeing in computing today. using standard
   analytical queries on the 1.2 billion row nyc taxi dataset, we found
   that a single google n1-highmem-32 instance with 8 attached k80 dies is
   on average 85 times faster than impala running on a cluster of 6 nodes
   each with 32 vcpus. further, the innovative ssd storage configuration
   via nvme further reduced cold load times by a factor of five. this
   performance offers tremendous flexibility for enterprises interested in
   millisecond speed at over billions of rows."    todd mostak, mapd founder
   and ceo

   [20]the foundry, a visual effects software provider for the
   entertainment industry has been experimenting with workstations in the
   cloud.
   "at the foundry, we're really excited about vfx in the cloud, and with
   the arrival of gpus on google cloud platform, we'll have access to the
   cutting edge of visualisation technology, available on-demand and
   charged by the minute. the potential ramifications for our industry are
   enormous."    simon pickles, lead engineer, pipeline-in-the-cloud
