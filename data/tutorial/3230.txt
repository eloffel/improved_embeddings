differentiable neural computer (dnc)

   this package provides an implementation of the differentiable neural
   computer, as [78]published in nature.

   any publication that discloses findings arising from using this source
   code must cite    hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic
   external memory", nature 538, 471   476 (october 2016)
   doi:10.1038/nature20101.

introduction

   the differentiable neural computer is a recurrent neural network. at
   each timestep, it has state consisting of the current memory contents
   (and auxiliary information such as memory usage), and maps input at
   time t to output at time t. it is implemented as a collection of
   id56core modules, which allow plugging together the different modules to
   experiment with variations on the architecture.
     * the access module is where the main dnc logic happens; as this is
       where memory is written to and read from. at every timestep, the
       input to an access module is a vector passed from the controller,
       and its output is the contents read from memory. it uses two futher
       id56cores: temporallinkage which tracks the order of memory writes,
       and freeness which tracks which memory locations have been written
       to and not yet subsequently "freed". these are both defined in
       addressing.py.
     * the controller module "controls" memory access. typically, it is
       just a feedforward or (possibly deep) lstm network, whose inputs
       are the inputs to the overall recurrent network at that time,
       concatenated with the read memory output from the access module
       from the previous timestep.
     * the dnc simply wraps the access module and the control module, and
       forms the basic id56core unit of the overall architecture. this is
       defined in dnc.py.

   [79]dnc architecture

train

   the dnc requires an installation of [80]tensorflow and [81]sonnet. an
   example training script is provided for the algorithmic task of
   repeatedly copying a given input string. this can be executed from a
   python interpreter:
$ ipython train.py

   you can specify training options, including parameters to the model and
   optimizer, via flags:
$ python train.py --memory_size=64 --num_bits=8 --max_length=3

# or with ipython:
$ ipython train.py -- --memory_size=64 --num_bits=8 --max_length=3

   periodically saving, or 'checkpointing', the model is disabled by
   default. to enable, use the checkpoint_interval flag. e.g.
   --checkpoint_interval=10000 will ensure a checkpoint is created every
   10,000 steps. the model will be checkpointed to /tmp/tf/dnc/ by
   default. from there training can be resumed. to specify an alternate
   checkpoint directory, use the checkpoint_dir flag. note: ensure that
   /tmp/tf/dnc/ is deleted before training is resumed with different model
   parameters, to avoid shape inconsistency errors.

   more generally, the dnc class found within dnc.py can be used as a
   standard tensorflow id56 core and unrolled with tensorflow id56 ops, such
   as tf.nn.dynamic_id56 on any sequential task.
