course description

   mit's introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to
   machine translation, image recognition, game playing, and more.
   students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms
   and get practical experience in building neural networks in tensorflow.
   course concludes with project proposals with feedback from staff and
   panel of industry sponsors. prerequisites assume elementary calculus
   (i.e. taking derivatives and applying the chain rule) and linear
   algebra (i.e. id127), we'll try to explain everything
   else along the way! experience in python is helpful but not necessary.
   listeners are welcome!

learning and perception

jan kautz; vice president of learning and perception research, nvidia

   speaker bio:
   jan leads the learning & perception research team at nvidia, working
   predominantly on id161 and machine learning problems     from
   low-level vision (denoising, super-resolution, computational
   photography), geometric vision (structure from motion, slam, optical
   flow) to high-level vision (detection, recognition, classification), as
   well as fundamental machine learning algorithms. before joining nvidia
   in 2013, jan was a tenured faculty member at university college london.
   he holds a bsc in computer science from university of erlangen-n  rnberg
   (1999), an mmath from the university of waterloo (1999), received his
   phd from the max-planck-institut f  r informatik (2003), and worked as a
   post-doc at the massachusetts institute of technology (2003-2006). jan
   is particularly interested in computational photography and imaging,
   id161, and computational displays, on which he has published
   many articles at various conferences including acm siggraph,
   eurographics, cvpr, eccv, chi, and many more.

data visualization for machine learning

fernanda viegas; co-director google pair (people+ai research)

   talk title:
   data visualization for machine learning

   talk abstract:
   machine learning is playing an increasingly influential role in the
   world, due to dramatic technical leaps in recent years. but these new
   developments bring their own questions. what is the best way to train
   models and to debug them? how can we understand what is going on under
   the hood of deep neural networks? it turns out that data visualization
   can play a central role in answering these questions. i'll discuss
   recent work that shows how interactive exploration can help people use,
   interpret, and learn about machine intelligence.

   speaker bio:
   i'm a senior researcher at google, where i co-lead the pair (people +
   ai research) initiative and the big picture team. my work in machine
   learning with martin wattenberg, my long-time colleague, focuses on
   improving human/ai interaction with a broader agenda of democratizing
   ai technology. i   m also interested in weaving societal expectations and
   values into the design and evaluation of ai systems.

biologically inspired deep learning

dmitry krotov; mit-ibm watson ai lab

   talk title:
   a biologically plausible learning algorithm for neural networks

   talk abstract:
   in spite of great success of deep learning a question remains to what
   extent the computational properties of deep neural networks (dnns) are
   similar to those of the human brain. the particularly non-biological
   aspect of deep learning is the supervised training process with the
   id26 algorithm, which requires massive amounts of labeled
   data, and a non-local learning rule for changing the synapse strengths.
   in this talk i will describes a learning algorithm that does not suffer
   from these two problems. it learns the weights of the lower layer of
   neural networks in a completely unsupervised fashion. the entire
   algorithm utilizes local learning rules which have conceptual
   biological plausibility. the performance of this algorithm is
   comparable to the performance of standard feedforward networks trained
   end-to-end with a id26 algorithm on simple tasks.

   speaker bio:
   i am member of the research staff at the mit-ibm watson ai lab and ibm
   research in cambridge, ma. prior to this, i was a member of the
   research staff at the institute for advanced study in princeton, nj.
   broadly defined, my research focuses on the computational properties of
   neural networks. particularly, i am interested in implementing ideas
   coming from neurobiology in modern ai systems. in the past, i worked on
   the relationship between models of associative memory (also known as
   hopfield nets) and neural networks used in deep learning. i received a
   phd in physics from princeton university in 2014.

   vision and deep learning, such as image/video processing, analysis, and
   understanding. previously, he was a researcher with huawei noah's ark
   lab, hong kong. lin ma received his ph.d. degree in department of
   electronic engineering at the chinese university of hong kong (cuhk) in
   2013. he received the b. e., and m. e. degrees from harbin institute of
   technology, harbin, china, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, both in
   computer science. he was a finalist to hkis young scientist award in
   engineering science in 2012. he was awarded the microsoft research asia
   fellowship in 2011.
