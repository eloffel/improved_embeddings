amazon lex

conversational interfaces for your applications powered by the same deep
learning technologies as alexa

   [74]get started with amazon lex

   amazon lex is a service for building conversational interfaces into any
   application using voice and text. amazon lex provides the advanced deep
   learning functionalities of automatic id103 (asr) for
   converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (nlu) to
   recognize the intent of the text, to enable you to build applications
   with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational
   interactions. with amazon lex, the same deep learning technologies that
   power amazon alexa are now available to any developer, enabling you to
   quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language,
   conversational bots [75](   chatbots   ).

   id103 and natural language understanding are some of the
   most challenging problems to solve in computer science, requiring
   sophisticated deep learning algorithms to be trained on massive amounts
   of data and infrastructure. amazon lex democratizes these deep learning
   technologies by putting the power of amazon alexa within reach of all
   developers. harnessing these technologies, amazon lex enables you to
   define entirely new categories of products made possible through
   conversational interfaces.

   as a fully managed service, amazon lex scales automatically, so you
   don   t need to worry about managing infrastructure. with amazon lex, you
   pay only for what you use. there are no upfront commitments or minimum
   fees.

benefits

   process of creating your own chatbot in minutes, building
   conversational interfaces into your applications. you supply just a few
   example phrases and amazon lex builds a complete natural language model
   through which your user can interact using voice and text, to ask
   questions, get answers, and complete sophisticated tasks.

seaid113ssly deploy and scale

   with amazon lex, you can build, test, and deploy your chatbots directly
   from the amazon lex console. amazon lex enables you to easily publish
   your voice or text chatbots to mobile devices, web apps, and chat
   services such as facebook messenger, slack, and twilio sms. once
   published, your amazon lex bot processes voice or text input in
   conversation with your end-users. amazon lex is a fully managed service
   so as your user engagement increases, you don   t need to worry about
   provisioning hardware and managing infrastructure to power your bot
   experience.

built in integration with aws

   amazon lex provides built-in integration with aws lambda, aws mobilehub
   and amazon cloudwatch and you can easily integrate with many other
   services on the aws platform including amazon cognito, and amazon
   dynamodb. you can take advantage of the power of the aws platform for

   only charged for the text or speech requests that are made. amazon lex   
   pay-as-you-go pricing and low cost per request make it a cost-effective
   way to build conversational interfaces anywhere. with the amazon lex
   free tier, you can easily try amazon lex without any initial
   investment.

use cases

call center bots

   by using an amazon lex chatbot in your amazon connect call center,
   callers can perform tasks such as changing a password, requesting a
   balance on an account, or scheduling an appointment, without needing to
   speak to an agent. these chatbots use automatic id103 and
   natural language understanding to recognize the intent of the caller.
   they are able to recognize human speech at an optimal (8 khz) telephony
   audio sampling rate, and understand the caller   s intent without
   requiring the caller to speak in specific phrases. amazon lex uses aws
   lambda functions to query your business applications, provide
   information back to callers, and make updates as requested. amazon lex
   chatbots also maintain context and manage the dialogue, dynamically
   adjusting responses based on the conversation.
