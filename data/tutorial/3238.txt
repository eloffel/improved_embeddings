neuro lab - a general id158 model (gann)

   [71]id158

   a general neural network model with variable configuration to
   experiment on for image recognition, id103, sentiment
   analysis e.t.c

   easily experiment on different architectures {input(features) nodes, no
   of hidden layers and output nodes} and training parameters i.e lambda,
   no of iterations (epoch number) e.t.c

   the motivation behind neuro lab is to have one neural network being
   used for any classification problem.

supported python versions

   neuro lab supports python 3+.
