   an introductory overview of numpy, one of the foundational aspects of
   scientific computing in python, along with some explanation of the
   maths involved.

   numpy

   oh the amazing things you can do with numpy.

   numpy is a blazing fast maths library for python with a heavy emphasis
   on arrays. it allows you to do vector and matrix maths within python
   and as a lot of the underlying functions are actually written in c, you
   get speeds that you would never reach in vanilla python.

   numpy is an absolutely key piece to the success of scientific python
   and if you want to get into data science and or machine learning in
   python, it's a must learn. numpy is well built in my opinion and
   getting started with it is not difficult at all.

   this is the second post in a series of posts on scientific python,
   don't forget to check out the others too. an up-to-date list of posts
   in this series is at the bottom of this post.

array basics


   creation

   numpy revolves around these things called arrays. actually nparrays,
   but we don't need to worry about that. with these arrays we can do all
   sorts of useful things like vector and matrix maths at lightning
   speeds. get your id202 on! (just kidding we won't be doing any
   heavy maths)
# 1d array
a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
b = np.array((0, 1, 2, 3, 4))
c = np.arange(5)
d = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 5)

print(a) # >>>[0 1 2 3 4]
print(b) # >>>[0 1 2 3 4]
print(c) # >>>[0 1 2 3 4]
print(d) # >>>[ 0.          1.57079633  3.14159265  4.71238898  6.28318531]
print(a[3]) # >>>3

   the above code shows 4 different ways of creating an array. the most
   basic way is just passing a sequence to numpy's array() function; you
   can pass it any sequence, not just lists like you usually see.

   notice how when we print an array with numbers of different length, it
   automatically pads them out. this is useful for viewing matrices.
   indexing on arrays works just like that of a list or any other of
   python's sequences. you can also use slicing on them, i won't go into
   slicing a 1d array here, if you want more information on slicing, check
   out [36]this post.

   the above array example is how you can represent a vector with numpy,
   next we will take a look at how we can represent matrices and more with
   multidimensional arrays.
# md array,
a = np.array([[11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
              [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
              [21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
              [26, 27, 28 ,29, 30],
              [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]])

print(a[2,4]) # >>>25

   to create a 2d array we pass the array() function a list of lists (or a
   sequence of sequences). if we wanted a 3d array we would pass it a list
   of lists of lists, a 4d array would be a list of lists of lists of
   lists and so on.

   notice how with a 2d array (with the help of our friend the space bar),
   is arranged in rows and columns. to index a 2d array we simply
   reference a row and a column.

   a bit of the maths behind it

   to understand this properly, we should really take a look at what
   vectors and matrices are.

   a vector is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. they are
   often used to represent things such as velocity, acceleration and
   momentum. vectors can be written in a number of ways although the one
   which will be most useful to us is the form where they are written as
   an n-tuple such as (1, 4, 6, 9). this is how we represent them in
   numpy.

   a matrix is similar to a vector, except it is made up of rows and
   columns; much like a grid. the values within the matrix can be
   referenced by giving the row and the column that it resides in. in
   numpy we make arrays by passing a sequence of sequences as we did
   previously.

   [37]numpy maths

   multidimensional array slicing

   slicing a multidimensional array is a bit more complicated than a 1d
   one and it's something that you will do a lot while using numpy.
# md slicing
print(a[0, 1:4]) # >>>[12 13 14]
print(a[1:4, 0]) # >>>[16 21 26]
print(a[::2,::2]) # >>>[[11 13 15]
                  #     [21 23 25]
                  #     [31 33 35]]
print(a[:, 1]) # >>>[12 17 22 27 32]


   as you can see you slice a multidimensional array by doing a separate
   slice for each dimension separated with commas. so with a 2d array our
   first slice defines the slicing for rows and our second slice defines
   the slicing for columns.

   notice that you can simply specify a row or a column by entering the
   number. the first example above selects the 0th column from the array.

   the diagram below illustrates what the given example slices do.

   array properties

   when working with numpy you might want to know certain things about
   your arrays. luckily there are lots of handy methods included within
   the package to give you the information that you need.
# array properties
a = np.array([[11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
              [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
              [21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
              [26, 27, 28 ,29, 30],
              [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]])

print(type(a)) # >>><class 'numpy.ndarray'>
print(a.dtype) # >>>int64
print(a.size) # >>>25
print(a.shape) # >>>(5, 5)
print(a.itemsize) # >>>8
print(a.ndim) # >>>2
print(a.nbytes) # >>>200


   as you can see in the above code a numpy array is actually called an
   ndarray. i don't know why it's called an ndarray, if anyone knows
   please leave a comment! my guess is that it stands for n dimensional
   array.

   the shape of an array is how many rows and columns it has, the above
   array has 5 rows and 5 columns so its shape is (5, 5).

   the 'itemsize' property is how many bytes each item takes up. the data
   type of this array is int64, there are 64 bits in an int64, 8 bits in a
   byte, divide 64 by 8 and you get how many bytes it takes up, which in
   this case is 8.

   the 'ndim' property is how many dimensions the array has. this one has
   2. a vector for example however, has just 1.

   the 'nbytes' property is how many bytes are used up by all the data in
   the array. you should note that this does not count the overhead of an
   array and so the actual space that the array takes up will be a little
   bit larger.
