   at its f8 developer conference in san jose today, facebook is
   announcing the launch of [97]caffe2, a new open source framework for
   deep learning, a trendy type of artificial intelligence (ai). deep
   learning generally involves training id158s on lots
   of data, like photos, and then getting them to make id136s about
   new data.

   today   s announcement builds on facebook   s contributions to the torch
   open source deep learning framework and more recently the [98]pytorch
   framework that the facebook artificial intelligence research (fair)
   group conceived. and last year facebook talked about a system called
   [99]caffe2go.

   but caffe2 is a bit different from pytorch.

      pytorch is great for research, experimentation and trying out exotic
   neural networks, while caffe2 is headed towards supporting more
   industrial-strength applications with a heavy focus on mobile,   
   facebook ai platform engineering lead yangqing jia wrote in a
   [100]comment on hacker news.    this is not to say that pytorch doesn   t
   do mobile or doesn   t scale or that you can   t use caffe2 with some
   awesome new paradigm of neural network, we   re just highlighting some of
   the current characteristics and directions for these two projects. we
   plan to have plenty of interoperability and methods of converting back
   and forth so you can experience the best of both worlds.   

   there are [101]several other open source deep learning frameworks for
   people to use for all kinds of purposes. in 2015 google made a splash
   when it open-sourced its own framework, [102]tensorflow.

   earlier today facebook talked about how it   s using ai for
   [103]augmented reality (ar), among other things. but facebook is also
   using ai in existing products, including [104]id103 in
   oculus and [105]image recognition on facebook.

   public cloud infrastructure provider amazon web services (aws) has
   [106]added experimental support for caffe2 in its deep learning ami
   (amazon machine image). microsoft azure, another public cloud, has
   [107]added caffe2 support to its data science virtual machine (did166).

   nvidia, whose graphics processing units (gpus) can go inside facebook   s
   servers for deep learning, will be helping people learn about caffe2,
   nvidia accelerated computing general manager and vice president ian
   buck wrote in a [108]blog post. qualcomm [109]said it   s working with
   facebook to optimize caffe2 and qualcomm   s snapdragon neural processing
   engine (npe) framework, and intel [110]said it will integrate its math
   kernel library (mkl) into caffe2.
