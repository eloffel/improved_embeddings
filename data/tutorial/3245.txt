readme.rst

   nolearn contains a number of wrappers and abstractions around existing
   neural network libraries, most notably [89]lasagne, along with a few
   machine learning utility modules. all code is written to be compatible
   with [90]scikit-learn.

installation

   we recommend using [92]venv (when using python 3) or [93]virtualenv
   (python 2) to install nolearn.

   to install the latest release of nolearn from the python package index,
   do:
pip install nolearn

   at the time of this writing, nolearn works with the latest versions of
   its dependencies, such as numpy, scipy, theano, and lasagne (the latter
   [94]from git). but we also maintain a list of known good versions of
   dependencies that we support and test. should you run into hairy
   depdendency issues during installation or runtime, we recommend you try
   this same set of tested depdencencies instead:
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnouri/nolearn/0.6.0/requiremen
ts.txt
pip install nolearn

   if you want to install the latest development version of nolearn
   directly from git, run:
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnouri/nolearn/master/requireme
nts.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn.git@master#egg=nolearn==0.7.gi

documentation

   if you're looking for how to use nolearn.lasagne, then there's two
   introductory tutorials that you can choose from:
     * [95]using convolutional neural nets to detect facial keypoints
       tutorial with [96]code
     * [97]training convolutional neural networks with nolearn

   for specifics around classes and functions out of the lasagne package,
   such as layers, updates, and nonlinearities, you'll want to look at the
   [98]lasagne project's documentation.

   nolearn.lasagne comes with a [99]number of tests that demonstrate some
   of the more advanced features, such as networks with merge layers, and
   networks with multiple inputs.

   [100]nolearn's own documentation is somewhat out of date at this point.
   but there's more resources online.

   finally, there's a few presentations and examples from around the web.
   note that some of these might need a specific version of nolearn and
   lasange to run:
     * oliver d  rr's [101]convolutional neural nets ii hands on with
       [102]code
     * roelof pieters' presentation [103]python for image understanding
       comes with nolearn.lasagne code examples
     * benjamin bossan's [104]otto group product classification challenge
       using nolearn/lasagne
     * kaggle's [105]instructions on how to set up an aws gpu instance to
       run nolearn.lasagne and the facial keypoint detection tutorial
     * [106]an example convolutional autoencoder
     * winners of the saliency prediction task in the 2015 [107]lsun
       challenge have published their [108]lasagne/nolearn-based code.
     * the winners of the 2nd place in the [109]kaggle diabetic
       retinopathy detection challenge have published their
       [110]lasagne/nolearn-based code.
     * the winner of the 2nd place in the [111]kaggle right whale
       recognition challenge has published his [112]lasagne/nolearn-based
       code.

support

   if you're seeing a bug with nolearn, please submit a bug report to the
   [113]nolearn issue tracker. make sure to include information such as:
     * how to reproduce the error: show us how to trigger the bug using a
       minimal example
     * what versions you are using: include the git revision and/or
       version of nolearn (and possibly lasagne) that you're using

   please also make sure to search the issue tracker to see if your issue
   has been encountered before or fixed.

   if you believe that you're seeing an issue with lasagne, which is a
   different software project, please use the [114]lasagne issue tracker
   instead.

   there's currently no user mailing list for nolearn. however, if you
   have a question related to lasagne, you might want to try the
   [115]lasagne users list, or use stack overflow. please refrain from
   contacting the authors for non-commercial support requests directly;
   public forums are the right place for these.
