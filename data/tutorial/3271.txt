[91]learning to learn in tensorflow

dependencies

     * [92]tensorflow >=1.0
     * [93]sonnet >=1.0

training

python train.py --problem=mnist --save_path=./mnist

   command-line flags:
     * save_path: if present, the optimizer will be saved to the specified
       path every time the evaluation performance is improved.
     * num_epochs: number of training epochs.
     * log_period: epochs before mean performance and time is reported.
     * evaluation_period: epochs before the optimizer is evaluated.
     * evaluation_epochs: number of evaluation epochs.
     * problem: problem to train on. see [94]problems section below.
     * num_steps: number of optimization steps.
     * unroll_length: number of unroll steps for the optimizer.
     * learning_rate: learning rate.
     * second_derivatives: if true, the optimizer will try to compute
       second derivatives through the id168 specified by the
       problem.

evaluation

python evaluate.py --problem=mnist --optimizer=l2l --path=./mnist

   command-line flags:
     * optimizer: adam or l2l.
     * path: path to saved optimizer, only relevant if using the l2l
       optimizer.
     * learning_rate: learning rate, only relevant if using adam
       optimizer.
     * num_epochs: number of evaluation epochs.
     * seed: seed for random number generation.
     * problem: problem to evaluate on. see [95]problems section below.
     * num_steps: number of optimization steps.

problems

   the training and evaluation scripts support the following problems (see
   util.py for more details):
     * simple: one-variable quadratic function.
     * simple-multi: two-variable quadratic function, where one of the
       variables is optimized using a learned optimizer and the other one
       using adam.
     * quadratic: batched ten-variable quadratic function.
     * mnist: mnist classification using a two-layer fully connected
       network.
     * cifar: cifar10 classification using a convolutional neural network.
     * cifar-multi: cifar10 classification using a convolutional neural
       network, where two independent learned optimizers are used. one to
       optimize parameters from convolutional layers and the other one for
       parameters from fully connected layers.

   new problems can be implemented very easily. you can see in train.py
   that the meta_minimize method from the metaoptimizer class is given a
   function that returns the tensorflow operation that generates the loss
   function we want to minimize (see problems.py for an example).

   it's important that all operations with python side effects (e.g. queue
   creation) must be done outside of the function passed to meta_minimize.
   the cifar10 function in problems.py is a good example of a loss
   function that uses tensorflow queues.
