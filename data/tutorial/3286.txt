deepmind q&a dataset

   hermann et al. (2015) created two awesome datasets using news articles
   for q&a research. each dataset contains many documents (90k and 197k
   each), and each document companies on average 4 questions
   approximately. each question is a sentence with one missing word/phrase
   which can be found from the accompanying document/context.

   the original authors kindly released the scripts and accompanying
   documentation to generate the datasets (see [1]here). unfortunately due
   to instability of [2]waybackmachine, it is often cumbersome to generate
   the datasets from scratch using the provided scripts. furthermore, in
   certain parts of the world, it turned out to be far from being
   straight-forward to access the waybackmachine.

   i am making the generated datasets available here. this will hopefully
   make the datasets used by a wider audience and lead to faster progress
   in q&a research.

id98

     * questions: [4]here
     * stories: [5]here
     * raw html: [6]here

   this dataset contains the documents and accompanying questions from the
   news articles of id98. there are approximately 90k documents and 380k
   questions. i am making available 'questions/', which should be
   sufficient to reproduce the setting from the original paper, and
   'stories/', which can be useful for other uses of this dataset. i am
   also making the raw html files available, but i cannot guarantee that
   these are complete.

daily mail

     * questions: [7]here
     * stories: [8]here
     * raw html: [9]here

   this dataset contains the documents and accompanying questions from the
   news articles of daily mail. there are approximately 197k documents and
   879k questions. i am making available 'questions/', which should be
   sufficient to reproduce the setting from the original paper, and
   'stories/', which can be useful for other uses of this dataset. i am
   also making the raw html files available, but i cannot guarantee that
   these are complete.
