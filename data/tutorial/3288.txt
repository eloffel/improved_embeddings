began: boundary equilibrium id3

   implementation of google brain's [67]began: boundary equilibrium
   id3 in tensorflow.
   began is the state of the art when it comes to generate realistic
   faces.

   [68][128x128.bmp] [69][64x64.bmp]

   figure1a. 128x128 img and 64x64 img. 128x128 img is very impressive.
   you can see set of teeth

   [70][gamma_0.3.bmp] [71][gamma_0.4.bmp] [72][gamma_0.5.bmp]

   figure1b. this is random result from my train model. from gamma 0.3 to
   0.5. no cherry picking. gamma 0.3, nice but bias to women's face. gamma
   0.4, best. gamma 0.5, good texture but hole problem.

   [73][result.gif]

   figure1c. from scratch to 200k iter

implementation detail

   this train model is 64x64. 128x128 will be update. different with
   original paper is train loss update method, learning rate decay. first,
   paper's loss update way is loss_g and loss_d simultaneously. but when i
   tried that way, models are mode collapse. so, this code use altenative
   way. second, learning rate decay is 0.95 every 2000 iter. this
   parameter is just train experienc. you can change or see the paper.

train progress

   if you want to see the train progress download [74]this dropbox folder
   and run "tensorboard --logdir='./'". i uploaded two trained model(64x64
   and 128x128)

   [75][kt.jpg]

   figure2. kt graph. when you train model, reference this result. it
   doesn't reach to 1.0. in my case, it's converge to 0.08

   [76][m_global.jpg]

   figure3. convergence measure(m_global). similar with paper's graph

   [77][gamma_0.4.bmp] [78][decoder.bmp]

   figure4. compare with generator output and decoder output.

usage

   recommend to download trained model [79]this dropbox folder.

make train data

    1. download [80]celeba dataset (img_align_celeba.zip) and unzip to
       'data/celeba/raw'
    2. run ' python ./data/celeba/face_detect.py '

train (refer the main.py began_cmd)

ex) 64x64 img | nz,nh 128 | gamma 0.4
python3 main.py -f 1 -p "began" -trd "celeba" -tro "crop" -trs 64  -z 128 -em 12
8 -fn 64  -b 16 -lr 1e-4 -gm 0.4 -g "0"

ex) 128x128 img | nz,nh 64 | gamma 0.7
python3 main.py -f 1 -p "began" -trd "celeba" -tro "crop" -trs 128 -z 64  -em 64
  -fn 128 -b 16 -lr 1e-4 -gm 0.7 -g "0"

test (refer the main.py and began_cmd)

ex) 64x64 img | nz,nh 128 | gamma 0.4
python3 main.py -f 0 -p "began" -trd "celeba" -tro "crop" -trs 64  -z 128 -em 12
8 -fn 64  -b 16 -lr 1e-4 -gm 0.4 -g "0"

ex) 128x128 img | nz,nh 64 | gamma 0.7
python3 main.py -f 0 -p "began" -trd "celeba" -tro "crop" -trs 128 -z 64  -em 64
  -fn 128 -b 16 -lr 1e-4 -gm 0.7 -g "0"

requirements

     * python 3.5, scipy 0.18.1, numpy 1.11.2
     * tensorflow 1.1.0
