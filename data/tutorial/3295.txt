introduction to id158s and deep learning: a practical
guide with applications in python

   repository for the book introduction to id158s and
   deep learning: a practical guide with applications in python.
     __________________________________________________________________

   deep learning is not just the talk of the town among tech folks. deep
   learning allows us to tackle complex problems, training artificial
   neural networks to recognize complex patterns for image and speech
   recognition. in this book, we'll continue where we left off in
   [87]python machine learning and implement deep learning algorithms in
   [88]pytorch.
     __________________________________________________________________

     * this repository will contain the instructions, code examples, and
       solutions for the hands-on and exercise portions of each chapter.
     * pdf and ebook versions of the book will be available from
       [89]leanpub.

about the book

   machine learning has become a central part of our life     as consumers,
   customers, and hopefully as researchers and practitioners! i appreciate
   all the nice feedback that you sent me about [100]python machine
   learning, and i am so happy to hear that you found it so useful as a
   learning guide, helping you with your business applications and
   research projects. i have received many emails since its release. also,
   in these very emails, you were asking me about a possible prequel or
   sequel.

   initially, i was inclined to write more about the "math" parts, which
   can be a real hurdle for almost everyone without (or even with) a math
   major in college. initially, i thought that writing a book about
   "machine learning math" was a cool thing to do. now, i have ~15
   chapters worth of notes about pre-calculus, calculus, id202,
   statistics, and id203 theory. however, i eventually came to a
   conclusion that there were too many other math books out there,
   already! most of them are far better and more comprehensive and
   accurate than my potential ~500-page introduction to the topics that i
   had in store. after all, i think that the real motivation for learning
   and understanding a subject comes from being excited about it in the
   first place; if you are passionate about machine learning and you
   stumble upon the chain rule in calculus, you wouldn't have any problems
   to find a trusted resource via your favorite search engine these days.

   so, instead of writing that "prequel," let me write about something
   that's built upon the concepts that i introduced in the later chapters
   of [101]python machine learning -- algorithms for deep learning. after
   we coded a multi-layer id88 (a certain kind of feedforward
   id158) from scratch, we took a brief look at some
   python libraries for implementing deep learning algorithms, and i
   introduced convolutional and recurrent neural networks on a conceptual
   level.

   in this book, i want to continue where i left off and want to implement
   deep neural networks and algorithms for deep learning algorithms from
   scratch, using python, numpy, and scipy throughout this educational
   journey. in addition to the vanilla python science-stack, we will
   implement these algorithms in [102]tensorflow, highly performant yet
   very accessible deep learning library for implementing and applying
   deep learning to real-world problems.
