pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial

learning scikit-learn -- an introduction to machine learning in python @
pydata chicago 2016

   this tutorial provides you with an introduction to machine learning in
   python using the popular scikit-learn library.

   this tutorial will teach you the basics of scikit-learn. i will give
   you a brief overview of the basic concepts of classification and
   regression analysis, how to build powerful predictive models from
   labeled data. although it's not a requirement for attending this
   tutorial, i highly recommend you to check out the accompanying github
   repository at
   [72]https://github.com/rasbt/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial 1-2 days
   before the tutorial. during the session, we will not only talk about
   scikit-learn, but we will also go over some live code examples to get
   the knack of scikit-learn's api.

   if you have any questions about the tutorial, please don't hesitate to
   contact me. you can either open an "issue" on github or reach me via
   email at mail_at_sebastianraschka.com. i am looking forward to meeting
   you soon!

schedule

   this repository will contain the teaching material and other info for
   the learning scikit-learn tutorial at the [78]pydata chicago 2016
   conference held aug 26-28.
     * when? fri aug. 26, 2016 at 9:00 - 10:30 am
     * where? room 1

   (i recommend watching the pydata [79]schedule for updates).

obtaining the tutorial material

   if you already have a github account, the probably most convenient way
   to obtain the tutorial material is to clone this github repository via
   git clone https://github.com/rasbt/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorials and
   fetch updates via pull origin master

   if you don   t have an github account, you can download the repository as
   a .zip file by heading over to the github repository
   ([80]https://github.com/rasbt/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial) in your
   browser and click the green    download    button in the upper right.

installation notes and requirements

   please note that installing the following libraries and running code
   alongside is not a hard requirement for attending the tutorial session,
   you will be able to follow along just fine (and probably be less
   distracted :)). now, the tutorial code should be compatible to both
   python 2.7 and python 3.x. but will require recent installations of
     * [81]numpy
     * [82]scipy
     * [83]matplotlib
     * [84]pandas
     * [85]scikit-learn
     * [86]ipython
     * [87]jupyter notebook
     * [88]watermark
     * [89]mlxtend

   please make sure that you have these libraries installed in your
   current python environment prior to attending the tutorial if you want
   to execute the code examples that are executed during the talk. please
   also note that executing these examples during/after the talk is merely
   a suggestion, not a requirement. i highly recommend you to open the
   code/check_environment.ipynb](code/check_environment.ipynb) notebook as
   a jupyter notebook, for instance by the notebook via
jupyter notebook <path-to>/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial/code/check_environment
.ipynb

   and executing the code cells:
