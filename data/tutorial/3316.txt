rocalphago

   (previously known just as "alphago," renamed to clarify that we are not
   affiliated with deepmind)

   this project is a student-led replication/reference implementation of
   deepmind's 2016 nature publication, "mastering the game of go with deep
   neural networks and tree search," details of which can be found [90]on
   their website. this implementation uses python and keras - a decision
   to prioritize code clarity, at least in the early stages.

documentation

   see the [93]project wiki.

current project status

   this is not yet a full implementation of alphago. development is being
   carried out on the develop branch. the current emphasis is on speed
   optimizations, which are necessary to complete training of the
   value-network and to create feasible tree-search. see the
   cython-optimization branch for more.

   selected data (i.e. trained models) are released in our [94]data
   repository.

   this project has primarily focused on the neural network training
   aspect of deepmind's alphago. we also have a simple single-threaded
   implementation of their tree search algorithm, though it is not fast
   enough to be competitive yet.

   see the wiki page on the [95]training pipeline for information on how
   to run the training commands.
