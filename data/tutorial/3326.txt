   how it works?
   1. this is 21 hrs of online live instructor-led course. weekend class:
   7 sessions of 3 hours each.
   2. we have a 24x7 one-on-one live technical support to help you with
   any problems you might face or any clarifications you may require
   during the course.
   3. at the end of the training you will have to undergo a 2-hour live
   practical exam based on which we will provide you a grade and a
   verifiable certificate!

   about the course
   edureka's deep learning with tensorflow course will help you to learn
   the basic concepts of tensorflow, the main functions, operations and
   the execution pipeline. starting with a simple    hello word    example,
   throughout the course you will be able to see how tensorflow can be
   used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of
   error functions. this concept is then explored in the deep learning
   world. you will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural
   networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with
   complex raw data using tensorflow. in addition, you will learn how to
   apply tensorflow for id26 to tune the weights and biases
   while the neural networks are being trained. finally, the course covers
   different types of deep architectures, such as convolutional networks,
   recurrent networks and autoencoders.
   delve into neural networks, implement deep learning algorithms, and
   explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this deep learning
   with tensorflow course.
   - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   who should go for this course?
   the following professionals can go for this course:
   1. developers aspiring to be a 'data scientist'
   2. analytics managers who are leading a team of analysts
   3. business analysts who want to understand deep learning (ml)
   techniques
   4. information architects who want to gain expertise in predictive
   analytics
   5. professionals who want to captivate and analyze big data
   6. analysts wanting to understand data science methodologies
   however, deep learning is not just focused to one particular industry
   or skill set, it can be used by anyone to enhance their portfolio.

   why learn deep learning with tensorflow?
   tensorflow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning.
   tensorflow is a software library for numerical computation of
   mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. nodes in the graph
   represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the
   multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. it was
   created by google and tailored for machine learning. in fact, it is
   being widely used to develop solutions with deep learning.
   machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields
   out there, and deep learning represents its true bleeding edge. deep
   learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks,
   spanning over a vast range of model architectures. traditional neural
   networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden
   layer and one output layer. deep-learning networks are distinguished
   from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or
   so-called more depth. these kinds of nets are capable of discovering
   hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images,
   sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the
   world.
