stanford machine learning course

   02 apr 2013

   stanford   s machine learning course taught by professor andrew ng has
   been made freely available on the web through two sources.

stanford engineering everywhere (see)

   [6]stanford engineering everywhere

   see is a program run by stanford where they make recordings of some of
   their engineering lectures freely available.

   this course consists of youtube videos which are recordings of the
   actual lecture with chalkboards and an audience. there are also
   detailed lecture notes provided along with every lecture, as well as
   review notes and assignments.

   the main advantage to this source for the material is that all of the
   lectures are immediately available, and you can take however long you
   want to go over the material.

   _[7]stanford class - _this is the website for the actual course at
   stanford. i haven   t made use of this page yet (all of the material
   seems to be available on the see page), but i   ve included it just in
   case.

coursera course

   [8]coursera

   this course is run in sessions (with a start date), and you get a
   certificate of completion from the instructor.

   the material has a lot of similarities, but has been modified to be
   more accessible.

   one of the most notable differences in the content is that the youtube
   videos don   t cover neural networks (except for a brief mention),
   whereas the coursera course does.

   if you think you can manage the course schedule, then this is
   definitely the better source for the material.

my posts

   my posts so far are based on the youtube lectures.

   the lecture notes provided for this class are _excellent. _for this
   reason, my posts on these lectures aren   t comprehensive notes on the
   discussion but rather serve the following purposes:
     * to point to all of the relevant reference material that is helpful
       for understanding the lecture, including the course lecture notes,
       review materials, and even lecture notes from other students
       published online.
     * to provide a basic overview of the lecture, and occasionally to
       explain concepts in a way that i find more intuitive.
