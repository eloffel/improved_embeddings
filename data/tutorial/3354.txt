     __________________________________________________________________

important note (09/21/2017):

   this github repository contains the code examples of the 1st edition of
   python machine learning book. if you are looking for the code examples
   of the 2nd edition, please refer to [87]this repository instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

   what you can expect are 400 pages rich in useful material just about
   everything you need to know to get started with machine learning ...
   from theory to the actual code that you can directly put into action!
   this is not yet just another "this is how scikit-learn works" book. i
   aim to explain all the underlying concepts, tell you everything you
   need to know in terms of best practices and caveats, and we will put
   those concepts into action mainly using numpy, scikit-learn, and
   theano.

   you are not sure if this book is for you? please checkout the excerpts
   from the [88]foreword and [89]preface, or take a look at the [90]faq
   section for further information.

additional math and numpy resources

   some readers were asking about math and numpy primers, since they were
   not included due to length limitations. however, i recently put
   together such resources for another book, but i made these chapters
   freely available online in hope that they also serve as helpful
   background material for this book:
     * algebra basics [[139]pdf] [[140]epub]
     * a calculus and differentiation primer [[141]pdf] [[142]epub]

     __________________________________________________________________

     sebastian raschka   s new book, python machine learning, has just been
     released. i got a chance to read a review copy and it   s just as i
     expected - really great! it   s well organized, super easy to follow,
     and it not only offers a good foundation for smart, non-experts,
     practitioners will get some ideas and learn new tricks here as well.
         lon riesberg at [148]data elixir

     superb job! thus far, for me it seems to have hit the right balance
     of theory and practice   math and code!
         [149]brian thomas

     i've read (virtually) every machine learning title based around
     scikit-learn and this is hands-down the best one out there.
         [150]jason wolosonovich

     the best book i've seen to come out of packt publishing. this is a
     very well written introduction to machine learning with python. as
     others have noted, a perfect mixture of theory and application.
         [151]josh d.

     a book with a blend of qualities that is hard to come by: combines
     the needed mathematics to control the theory with the applied coding
     in python. also great to see it doesn't waste paper in giving a
     primer on python as many other books do just to appeal to the
     greater audience. you can tell it's been written by knowledgeable
     writers and not just diy geeks.
         [152]amazon customer

     sebastian raschka created an amazing machine learning tutorial which
     combines theory with practice. the book explains machine learning
     from a theoretical perspective and has tons of coded examples to
     show how you would actually use the machine learning technique. it
     can be read by a beginner or advanced programmer.

scipy 2016

   we had such a great time at [195]scipy 2016 in austin! it was a real
   pleasure to meet and chat with so many readers of my book. thanks so
   much for all the nice words and feedback! and in case you missed it,
   andreas mueller and i gave an introduction to machine learning with
   scikit-learn; if you are interested, the video recordings of [196]part
   i and [197]part ii are now online!

pydata chicago 2016

   i attempted the rather challenging task of introducing scikit-learn &
   machine learning in just 90 minutes at pydata chicago 2016. the slides
   and tutorial material are available at "[198]learning scikit-learn --
   an introduction to machine learning in python."
     __________________________________________________________________

   note

   i have set up a separate library, [199]mlxtend, containing additional
   implementations of machine learning (and general "data science")
   algorithms. i also added implementations from this book (for example,
   the decision region plot, the id158, and sequential
   feature selection algorithms) with additional functionality.

   dear readers,
   first of all, i want to thank all of you for the great support! i am
   really happy about all the great feedback you sent me so far, and i am
   glad that the book has been so useful to a broad audience.

   over the last couple of months, i received hundreds of emails, and i
   tried to answer as many as possible in the available time i have. to
   make them useful to other readers as well, i collected many of my
   answers in the faq section (below).

   in addition, some of you asked me about a platform for readers to
   discuss the contents of the book. i hope that this would provide an
   opportunity for you to discuss and share your knowledge with other
   readers:

[200]google groups discussion board

   (and i will try my best to answer questions myself if time allows! :))

     the only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. it is never
     of any use to oneself.

examples and applications by readers

   once again, i have to say (big!) thanks for all the nice feedback about
   the book. i've received many emails from readers, who put the concepts
   and examples from this book out into the real world and make good use
   of them in their projects. in this section, i am starting to gather
   some of these great applications, and i'd be more than happy to add
   your project to this list -- just shoot me a quick mail!

contact

   i am happy to answer questions! just write me an [299]email or consider
   asking the question on the [300]google groups email list.

   if you are interested in keeping in touch, i have quite a lively
   twitter stream ([301]@rasbt) all about data science and machine
   learning. i also maintain a [302]blog where i post all of the things i
   am particularly excited about.
