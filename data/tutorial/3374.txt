welcome to the alphago replication wiki

   here you can learn more about how this project is structured, and a
   little about how deepmind's alphago itself works.

   for details, see the list of pages in the sidebar on the right.

how alphago works

   [59]https://www.deepmind.com/alpha-go.html

   deepmind's alphago is a combination of [60]id169
   (mcts) with [61]convolutional neural networks. there are three networks
   actively contributing to finding a move:
     * the policy network guesses where an expert would play. think of
       this network as memorizing patterns that it has seen others play
       but without any sense of the value of playing there.
     * the value network estimates the id203 of winning from the
       current position. it is perhaps analogous to an expert's
       'intuition' of preferring one position to another.
     * a second fast policy network that is used to simulate playouts to
       the end of the game. it is not a particularly strong player, but is
       orders of magnitude faster than the first policy network.

   together, these can be used to choose a move - by playing out a short
   series of reasonable moves then evaluating the results, then picking
   the best option. this is what alphago's mcts does - it simply follows
   the search tree in the most promising directions, where how 'promising'
   a branch is is a combination of expert policy and estimated value.

   the fast policy network is not what you would think of as a typical
   neural network - it is more like [62]multinomial id28 to
   choose the next move. this rollout policy is not nearly as good as the
   deeply-learned policy, but it is much much faster. since the good
   policy function is so slow, it is only used to search ahead about 20
   moves. normally the value function alone could evaluate how good the
   board looks after those 20 moves, but alphago's value function is
   augmented using this fast rollout all the way to the end of the game
   and simply seeing who wins.

   the networks here aren't just processing stone positions or images of
   boards. a given board position is preprocessed into features that the
   neural network can make better use of. part of the success of alphago
   is attributable to carefully choosing which features to use. more
   complex features can be informative but at the expense of having to
   compute them for each position in the search tree.

   the other big development contributing to alphago's success is [63]how
   these networks are trained using a combination of supervised and
   id23.
