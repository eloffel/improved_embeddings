pylearn2: a machine learning research library

   warning :

     this project does not have any current developer. we will continue
     to review pull requests and merge them when appropriate, but do not
     expect new development unless someone decides to work on it.

     there are other machine learning frameworks built on top of theano
     that could interest you, such as: [81]blocks, [82]keras and
     [83]lasagne.

   pylearn2 is a library designed to make machine learning research easy.

   pylearn2 has online [84]documentation. if you want to build a local
   copy of the documentation, run

     python ./doc/scripts/docgen.py

   more documentation is available in the form of commented examples
   scripts and ipython notebooks in the "pylearn2/scripts/tutorials"
   directory.

   pylearn2 was initially developed by david warde-farley, pascal lamblin,
   ian goodfellow and others during the winter 2011 offering of
   [85]ift6266, and is now developed by the lisa lab.

quick start and basic design rules

     * installation instructions are available [86]here.
     * subscribe to the [87]pylearn-users google group for important
       updates. please write to this list for general inquiries and
       support questions.
     * subscribe to the [88]pylearn-dev google group for important
       development updates. please write to this list if you find any bug
       or want to contribute to the project.
     * read through the documentation and examples mentioned above.
     * pylearn2 should not force users to commit to the whole library. if
       someone just wants to implement a model, they should be able to do
       that and not need to implement a trainingalgorithm. try not to
       write library features that force users to buy into the whole
       library.
     * when writing reference implementations to go in the library,
       maximize code re-usability by decomposing your algorithm into a
       trainingalgorithm that trains a model on a dataset. it will
       probably do this by minimizing a cost. in fact, you can probably
       use an existing trainingalgorithm.

highlights

     * pylearn2 was used to set the state of the art on mnist, cifar-10,
       cifar-100, and svhn. see pylearn2.models.maxout or
       pylearn2/scripts/papers/maxout
     * pylearn2 provides a wrapper around alex krizhevsky's extremely
       efficient gpu convolutional network library. this wrapper lets you
       use theano's symbolic differentiation and other capabilities with
       minimal overhead. see pylearn2.sandbox.cuda_convnet.
