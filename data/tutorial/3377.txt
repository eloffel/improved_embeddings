scikit-neuralnetwork

   deep neural network implementation without the learning cliff! this
   library implements multi-layer id88s, auto-encoders and (soon)
   recurrent neural networks with a stable future proof    interface that's
   compatible with scikit-learn for a more user-friendly and pythonic
   interface. it's a wrapper for powerful existing libraries such as
   lasagne currently, with plans for blocks.

   note: this project is possible thanks to the [74]nucl.ai conference on
   july 18-20. join us in vienna!

features

   by importing the sknn package provided by this library, you can easily
   train deep neural networks as regressors (to estimate continuous
   outputs from inputs) and classifiers (to predict discrete labels from
   features).

   [81]docs/plot_activation.png

   thanks to the underlying lasagne implementation, the code supports the
   following neural network features     exposed in an intuitive and
   [82]well documented api:
     * id180     sigmoid, tanh, rectifier, softmax, linear.
     * layer types     convolution (greyscale and color, 2d), dense
       (standard, 1d).
     * learning rules     sgd, momentum, nesterov, adadelta, adagrad,
       rmsprop, adam.
     * id173     l1, l2, dropout, and batch id172.
     * dataset formats     numpy.ndarray, scipy.sparse, pandas.dataframe and
       iterators (via callback).

   if a feature you need is missing, consider opening a [83]github issue
   with a detailed explanation about the use case and we'll see what we
   can do.

installation & testing

a) download latest release [recommended]

   if you want to use the latest official release, you can do so from pypi
   directly:
> pip install scikit-neuralnetwork

   this will install the latest official lasagne and theano as well as
   other minor packages too as a dependency. we strongly suggest you use a
   [84]virtualenv for python.

b) pulling repositories [optional]

   if you want to use the more advanced features like convolution, pooling
   or upscaling, these depend on the latest code from lasagne and theano
   master branches. you can install them manually as follows:
> pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwor
k/master/requirements.txt

   once that's done, you can grab this repository and install from
   setup.py in the exact same way:
> git clone https://github.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork.git
> cd scikit-neuralnetwork; python setup.py develop

   this will make the sknn package globally available within python as a
   reference to the current directory.

running automated tests

   [85]docs/console_tests.png

   then, you can run the samples and benchmarks available in the examples/
   folder, or launch the tests to check everything is working:
> pip install nose
> nosetests -v sknn.tests

   we strive to maintain 100% test coverage for all code-paths, to ensure
   that rapid changes in the underlying backend libraries are caught
   automatically.

getting started

   the library supports both regressors (to estimate continuous outputs
   from inputs) and classifiers (to predict discrete labels from
   features). this is the sklearn-compatible api:
from sknn.mlp import classifier, layer

nn = classifier(
    layers=[
        layer("rectifier", units=100),
        layer("softmax")],
    learning_rate=0.02,
    n_iter=10)
nn.fit(x_train, y_train)

y_valid = nn.predict(x_valid)

score = nn.score(x_test, y_test)

   the [86]generated documentation as a standalone page where you can find
   more information about parameters, as well as examples in the [87]user
   guide.

demonstration

   to run the example that generates the visualization above using our
   sknn.mlp.classifier, just run the following command in the project's
   root folder:
> python examples/plot_mlp.py --params activation

   there are multiple parameters you can plot as well, for example
   iterations, rules or units. the datasets are randomized each time, but
   the output should be an image that looks like this...
