unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative
adversarial networks

alec radford, [82]luke metz, [83]soumith chintala

   all images in this paper are generated by a neural network. they are
   not real.

   full paper here: [84]http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

   ###other implementations of dcgan
     * [85]torch
     * [86]chainer
     * [87]tensorflow

   ##summary of dcgan we
     * stabilize id3 with some architectural
       constraints
          + replace any pooling layers with strided convolutions
            (discriminator) and fractional-strided convolutions
            (generator).
          + use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator
          + remove fully connected hidden layers for deeper architectures.
            just use average pooling at the end.
          + use relu activation in generator for all layers except for the
            output, which uses tanh.
          + use leakyrelu activation in the discriminator for all layers.
     * use the discriminator as a pre-trained net for cifar-10
       classification and show pretty decent results.
     * generate really cool bedroom images that look super real
     * to convince you that the network is not cheating:
          + show the interpolated latent space, where transitions are
            really smooth and every image in the latent space is a
            bedroom.
          + show bedrooms after one epoch of training (with a 0.0002
            learning rate), come on the network cant really memorize at
            this stage.
     * to explore what the representations that the network learnt,
          + show deconvolution over the filters, to show that maximal
            activations occur at objects like windows and beds
          + figure out a way to identify and remove filters that draw
            windows in generation.
               o now you can control the generator to not output certain
                 objects.
     * because we are tripping
          + smiling woman - neutral woman + neutral man = smiling man.
            whuttttt!
          + man with glasses - man without glasses + woman without glasses
            = woman with glasses. omg!!!!
     * learnt a latent space in a completely unsupervised fashion where
       rotations are linear in this latent space. whhhaaatt????!!!!!!
     * figure 11, trained on id163 has a plane with bird legs. so
       cooool.

bedrooms after 5 epochs

   generated bedrooms after five epochs of training. there appears to be
   evidence of visual under-fitting via repeated textures across multiple
   samples.

bedrooms after 1 epoch

   generated bedrooms after one training pass through the dataset.
   theoretically, the model could learn to memorize training examples, but
   this is experimentally unlikely as we train with a small learning rate
   and minibatch sgd. we are aware of no prior empirical evidence
   demonstrating memorization with sgd and a small learning rate in only
   one epoch.

walking from one point to another in bedroom latent space

   interpolation between a series of 9 random points in z show that the
   space learned has smooth transitions, with every image in the space
   plausibly looking like a bedroom. in the 6th row, you see a room
   without a window slowly transforming into a room with a giant window.
   in the 10th row, you see what appears to be a tv slowly being
   transformed into a window.

forgetting to draw windows

   top row: un-modified samples from model. bottom row: the same samples
   generated with dropping out    window    filters. some windows are removed,
   others are transformed into objects with similar visual appearance such
   as doors and mirrors. although visual quality decreased, overall scene
   composition stayed similar, suggesting the generator has done a good
   job disentangling scene representation from object representation.
   extended experiments could be done to remove other objects from the
   image and modify the objects the generator draws.
