learning id23 (with code, exercises and solutions)

   [17]skip all the talk and go directly to the github repo with code and
   exercises.

why study id23

   id23 is one of the fields i   m most excited about.
   over the past few years amazing results like [18]learning to play atari
   games from raw pixels and [19]mastering the game of go have gotten a
   lot of attention, but rl is also widely used in robotics, image
   processing and natural language processing.

   combining id23 and deep learning techniques works
   extremely well. both fields heavily influence each other. on the
   id23 side deep neural networks are used as function
   approximators to learn good representations, e.g. to process atari game
   images or to understand the board state of go. in the other direction,
   rl techniques are making their way into supervised problems usually
   tackled by deep learning. for example, rl techniques are used to
   implement attention mechanisms in image processing, or to optimize
   long-term rewards in conversational interfaces and neural translation
   systems. finally, as id23 is concerned with making
   optimal decisions it has some extremely interesting parallels to human
   psychology and neuroscience (and many other fields).

   with lots of open problems and opportunities for fundamental research i
   think we   ll be seeing multiple id23 breakthroughs in
   the coming years. and what could be more fun than teaching machines to
   play starcraft and doom?

how to study id23

   there are many excellent id23 resources out there.
   two i recommend the most are:
     * [20]david silver   s id23 course
     * [21]richard sutton   s & andrew barto   s id23: an
       introduction (2nd edition) book.

   the latter is still work in progress but it   s ~80% complete. the course
   is based on the book so the two work quite well together. in fact,
   these two cover almost everything you need to know to understand most
   of the recent research papers. the prerequisites are basic math and
   some knowledge of machine learning.

   that covers the theory. but what about practical resources? what about
   actually implementing the algorithms that are covered in the
   book/course? that   s where this post and the [22]github repository comes
   in. i   ve tried to implement most of the standard reinforcement
   algorithms using python, [23]openai gym and tensorflow. i separated
   them into chapters (with brief summaries) and exercises and solutions
   so that you can use them to supplement the theoretical material above.
   [24]all of this is in the github repository.

   some of the more time-intensive algorithms are still work in progress,
   so feel free to contribute. i   ll update this post as i implement them.
