getting started with pattern

   posted on [20]may 28, 2014 by [21]textminermay 28, 2014
   [22]deep learning specialization on coursera

   we have talked about [23]nltk and [24]textblob, now it   s time to
      getting started with pattern   .
   [ins: :ins]

   about pattern

   according [25]pattern official website:

     pattern is a web mining module for the python programming language.

     it has tools for data mining (google, twitter and wikipedia api, a
     web crawler, a html dom parser), natural language processing
     (part-of-speech taggers, id165 search, id31,
     id138), machine learning (vector space model, id91, id166),
     network analysis and canvas visualization.

   pattern is not only one of [26]text processing python nlp tools, but a
   [27]text data mining tool which including crawler, parser and etc. but
   in this article we will focus on the [28]text analysis modules from
   pattern.

   installing pattern

   the simplest way to install pattern is using pip:

   $ pip install pattern

   this will automatically download and install pattern from the pypi
   repository.

   another way to install pattern from the source code: [29]pattern 2.6.
   just download it and unzip it, then:

   $ cd pattern-2.6
   $ python setup.py install

   note that pattern requires python 2.5+, not support for python 3 yet.
   the module has no external dependencies, except lsa in the
   pattern.vector module, which requires numpy.

   pattern modules
   pattern includes a lot of modules:
     * [30]pattern.web
     * [31]pattern.db
     * [32]pattern.en | [33]es | [34]de | [35]fr | [36]it | [37]nl
     * [38]pattern.search
     * [39]pattern.vector
     * [40]pattern.graph
     * [41]pattern.metrics
     * [42]canvas.js

   here we will just focus on the english [43]text analysis module
   pattern.en.

   text analysis module pattern.en

   the pattern.en module can be used for english [44]text processing, like
   word tokenize, sentence tokenize(sentence segmentation), pos
   tagging(part-of-speech tagger), english grammar(indefinite article,
   pluralization + singularization, comparative + superlative),
   [45]id31, parser(identifies nouns, adjectives..), id138
   interface and etc. we will tell you how to use them in python one by
   one.

   1) [46]word id121 and [47]sentence segmentation

   the tokenize methods in pattern.en supports word id121 and
   sentence id121 for english text:

   >>> from pattern.en import tokenize
   >>> word_tokenize_test =    this   s pattern word tokenize   
   >>> tokenize(word_tokenize_test)
   [   this    s pattern word tokenize   ]

   >>> sent_tokenize_test =    id121 is the process of breaking a
   stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful
   elements called tokens. the list of tokens becomes input for further
   processing such as parsing or id111. id121 is useful both
   in linguistics (where it is a form of text segmentation), and in
   computer science, where it forms part of lexical analysis.   
   >>> result = tokenize(sent_tokenize_test)
   >>> result
   [   id121 is the process of breaking a stream of text up into
   words , phrases , symbols , or other meaningful elements called tokens
   .   ,    the list of tokens becomes input for further processing such as
   parsing or id111 .   ,    id121 is useful both in linguistics
   ( where it is a form of text segmentation ) , and in computer science ,
   where it forms part of lexical analysis .   ]
   >>> len(result)
   3
   >>>

   2) [48]id52

   the tag method from pattern.en can be used id52 for english
   text, the part-of-speech tags is followed id32 ii tag set, can
   be found the details here: [49]id32 ii tag set

   >>> from pattern.en import tag
   >>> pos_tagging_test =    in corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging
   (id52 or post), also called grammatical tagging or word-category
   disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus)
   as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its
   definition, as well as its context   i.e. relationship with adjacent and
   related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. a simplified form of
   this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification
   of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.   
   >>> tagged_result = tag(pos_tagging_test)
   >>> tagged_result

   3   [50]indefinite article

   according wikipedia:

     an indefinite article indicates that its noun is not a particular
     one (or ones) identifiable to the listener. it may be something that
     the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or its precise
     identity may be irrelevant or hypothetical, or the speaker may be
     making a general statement about any such thing. english uses a/an,
     from the old english forms of the number    one   , as its primary
     indefinite article. the form an is used before words that begin with
     a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in an
     hour), and a before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if
     spelled with a vowel, as in a european).

   in pattern.en module, you can use the referenced method to get the
   indefinite article:

   >>> from pattern.en import referenced
   >>> referenced(   book   )
      a book   
   >>> referenced(   hour   )
      an hour   
   >>>

   4) [51]word singularize

   >>> from pattern.en import singularize
   >>> singularize(   books   )
      book   
   >>> singularize(   wolves   )
      wolf   

   5) [52]word pluralize

   >>> from pattern.en import pluralize
   >>> pluralize(   wolf   )
      wolves   
   >>> pluralize(   book   )
      books   
   >>>

   6   [53]word comparative

   >>> from pattern.en import comparative
   >>> comparative(   bad   )
      worse   
   >>> comparative(   good   )
      better   
   >>>

   7) [54]word superlative

   >>> from pattern.en import superlative
   >>> superlative(   bad   )
      worst   
   >>> superlative(   good   )
      best   
   >>>

   8) [55]id31

     id31 (also known as opinion mining) refers to the use
     of natural language processing, text analysis and computational
     linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in source
     materials. generally speaking, id31 aims to determine
     the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic or
     the overall contextual polarity of a document. the attitude may be
     his or her judgment or evaluation (see appraisal theory), affective
     state (that is to say, the emotional state of the author when
     writing), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say,
     the emotional effect the author wishes to have on the reader).

   the pattern.en sentiment() function returns a (polarity,
   subjectivity)-tuple for the given sentence, based on the adjectives it
   contains, where polarity is a value between -1.0 and +1.0 and
   subjectivity between 0.0 and 1.0.

   >>> from pattern.en import sentiment
   >>> sentiment(   iphone 5 is best smartphone in the world   )
   (1.0, 0.3)
   >>> sentiment(   the car is bad   )
   (-0.6999999999999998, 0.6666666666666666)
   >>>

   9) [56]modality

   >>> from pattern.en import parse, sentence
   >>> from pattern.en import modality
   >>> s =    some amino acids tend to be acidic while others may be basic.   
   # weaseling
   >>> s = parse(s, lemmata=true)
   >>> s = sentence(s)
   >>> modality(s)
   0.1111111111111111
   >>>

   10) [57]parse

   >>> from pattern.en import parse
   >>> parse(   parsing or syntactic analysis is the process of analysing a
   string of symbols, either in natural language or in computer languages,
   according to the rules of a formal grammar. the term parsing comes from
   latin pars (orationis), meaning part (of speech).   )

   we just told 10 [58]text process methods here, you can check other
   methods by the official pattern guide. if you want use pattern in other
   programming languages like java, php, ruby, we strongly recommend you
   try our [59]text analysis api on mashape.
