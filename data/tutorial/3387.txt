   tokenizers is used to divide strings into lists of substrings. for
   example, sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences
   and word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings.

   tokenizing text into sentences

   sentence tokenize also known as [34]sentence boundary disambiguation,
   sentence boundary detection, [35]sentence segmentation, here is the
   definition by wikipedia:

     sentence boundary disambiguation (sbd), also known as sentence
     breaking, is the problem in natural language processing of deciding
     where sentences begin and end. often natural language processing
     tools require their input to be divided into sentences for a number
     of reasons. however sentence boundary identification is challenging
     because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. for example, a period
     may denote an abbreviation, decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email
     address     not the end of a sentence. about 47% of the periods in the
     wall street journal corpus denote abbreviations. as well, question
     marks and exclamation marks may appear in embedded quotations,
     emoticons, computer code, and slang. languages like japanese and
     chinese have unambiguous sentence-ending markers.

   there are many nlp tools include the sentence tokenize function, such
   as opennlp   nltk, textblob, mbsp and etc. here we will tell the details
   [36]sentence segmentation by nltk.

   how to use sentence tokenize in nltk?

   after [37]installing nltk and nltk_data , you can launch python and
   import sent_tokenize tool from nltk:

   >>> text =    this   s a sent tokenize test. this is sent two. is this sent
   three? sent 4 is cool! now it   s your turn.   
   >>> from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
   >>> sent_tokenize_list = sent_tokenize(text)
   >>> len(sent_tokenize_list)
   5
   >>> sent_tokenize_list
   [   this   s a sent tokenize test.   ,    this is sent two.   ,    is this sent
   three?   ,    sent 4 is cool!   ,    now it   s your turn.   ]
   >>>

   sent_tokenize uses an instance of punktsentencetokenizer from the nltk.
   tokenize.punkt module. this instance has already been trained on and
   works well for many european languages. so it knows what punctuation
   and characters mark the end of a sentence and the beginning of a new
   sentence.

   sent_tokenize is one of instances of punktsentencetokenizer from the
   nltk.tokenize.punkt module. tokenize punkt module has many pre-trained
   tokenize model for many european languages, here is the list from the
   nltk_data/tokenizers/punkt/readme file:

     pretrained punkt models     jan strunk (new version trained after
     issues 313 and 514 had been corrected)

     most models were prepared using the test corpora from kiss and
     strunk (2006). additional models have
     been contributed by various people using nltk for sentence boundary
     detection.

     for information about how to use these models, please confer the
     id121 howto:

     and chapter 3.8 of the nltk book:

     there are pretrained tokenizers for the following languages:

     the corpora contained about 400,000 tokens on average and mostly
     consisted of newspaper text converted to
     unicode using the codecs module.

     kiss, tibor and strunk, jan (2006): unsupervised multilingual
     sentence boundary detection.
     computational linguistics 32: 485-525.

        - training code    -

     # import punkt
     import nltk.tokenize.punkt

     # make a new tokenizer
     tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.punkt.punktsentencetokenizer()

     # read in training corpus (one example: slovene)
     import codecs
     text = codecs.open(   slovene.plain   ,   ur   ,   iso-8859-2   ).read()

     # train tokenizer
     tokenizer.train(text)

     # dump pickled tokenizer
     import pickle
     out = open(   slovene.pickle   ,   wb   )
     pickle.dump(tokenizer, out)
     out.close()

              

   there are total 17 european languages that nltk support for sentence
   tokenize, and you can use them as the following steps:

   >>> import nltk.data
   >>> tokenizer = nltk.data.load(   tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle   )
   >>> tokenizer.tokenize(text)
   [   this   s a sent tokenize test.   ,    this is sent two.   ,    is this sent
   three?   ,    sent 4 is cool!   ,    now it   s your turn.   ]

   here is a spanish sentence tokenize example:
   >>> spanish_tokenizer =
   nltk.data.load(   tokenizers/punkt/spanish.pickle   )
   >>> spanish_tokenizer.tokenize(   hola amigo. estoy bien.   )
   [   hola amigo.   ,    estoy bien.   ]
   >>>

   tokenizing text into words

   tokenizing text into words in nltk is very simple, just called
   [38]word_tokenize from nltk.tokenize module:

   >>> from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
   >>> word_tokenize(   hello world.   )
   [   hello   ,    world   ,    .   ]
   >>> word_tokenize(   this   s a test   )
   [   this   ,       s   ,    a   ,    test   ]

   actually, word_tokenize is a wrapper function that calls tokenize by
   the treebankwordtokenizer, here is the code in nltk:

   # standard word tokenizer.
   _word_tokenize = treebankwordtokenizer().tokenize
   def word_tokenize(text):
         """
         return a tokenized copy of *text*,
         using nltk's recommended word tokenizer
         (currently :class:`.treebankwordtokenizer`).
         this tokenizer is designed to work on a sentence at a time.
         """
         return _word_tokenize(text)

   another equivalent call method like the following:
   >>> from nltk.tokenize import treebankwordtokenizer
   >>> tokenizer = treebankwordtokenizer()
   >>> tokenizer.tokenize(   this   s a test   )
   [   this   ,       s   ,    a   ,    test   ]

   except the treebankwordtokenizer, there are other alternative word
   tokenizers, such as punktwordtokenizer and wordpunkttokenizer.

   punkttokenizer splits on punctuation, but keeps it with the word:

   >>> from nltk.tokenize import punktwordtokenizer
   >>> punkt_word_tokenizer = punktwordtokenizer()
   >>> punkt_word_tokenizer.tokenize(   this   s a test   )
   [   this   ,       s   ,    a   ,    test   ]

   wordpuncttokenizer splits all punctuations into separate tokens:

   >>> from nltk.tokenize import wordpuncttokenizer
   >>> word_punct_tokenizer = wordpuncttokenizer()
   >>> word_punct_tokenizer.tokenize(   this   s a test   )
   [   this   ,          ,    s   ,    a   ,    test   ]

   you can choose any word tokenizer in nltk for your using purpose.

       does the sentence_tokenizer only identify punctuation as the tend
       of a sentence or is it also possible to identify a sentence when
       punctuation is missing?
       do you have any rules or tools to recommend?
