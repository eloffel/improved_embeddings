about

stephanie is an open-source platform built specifically for voice-controlled
application as well as to automate daily tasks imitating much of an virtual
assistant's work.

control with your voice.

   use your voice to ask for information, update social networks, get
   weather updates, live football scores, movies information restaurant
   suggestions, writing a note, or even chit-chatting for fun, and many
   more.

listening to your voice

   stephanie can be configured to various levels of listening to ensure
   your privacy stays intact, as well as can be used with any audio
   recording device such as inbuilt voice recorder or even connect your
   phone to use it as voice capturing device, i personally use bluetooth
   voice recorder.

completely open source

   take the actual code, and transform it to any form as needed, can be
   configured to use with any kind of minimal device, or just write your
   own modules to extend the functionality of the application using simple
   as f*** guide.

history

inspiration behind stephanie.

     *

inspired by jarvis
       the initial idea came from jarvis as shown in iron-man movies, a
       kind of all-in-one virtual assistant software, which laid the
       foundations to build this software.
     *

jasper project
       jasper project hosted in github also helped me to clear out some
       doubts, and helped me in further understanding of the assistant
       management software, inspiring me to build stephanie from scratch
       to incoporate it's usage using minimal hardware and software
       requirements unlike using rasberry pi and a better library to
       integrate with developers.
     *

concerns toward privacy
       even though there are some amazing assitants like siri, cortana and
       so on, i felt that there was a need for an open-source project so
       that privacy of users stays intact, and stephanie provides a robust
       layer with 'wake-up-engine' setting to reduce privacy concerns to a
       huge extent.
     *

developer api
       stephanie provides a stupidly simple api which could be used by
       other developers to make their own modules, or even inject 3rd
       party modules made by other developers by following some really
       easy conventions. i'd rather call stephanie more of a framework
       than an application because of it's really simply api.
     *

ultimate goal
       the ultimate goal of this project is to create a general awareness
       among all sorts of people irrespective of their career background
       to get them interested in 'building something cool', that's why
       installation is made quite simpler but not the simplest to help
       general public learn programming in a very different way where they
       could feel they are making something cool.

a little about 'me'

   a note to yourself - write some stupid stuff to show how professional
   you are.

   alright so jokes aside, i just think programming is one of the fields
   which is more about creativity than anything, though i strongly believe
   that an individual must be formal, disciplined and utmost professional
   when needed, while your inner weirdness shouldn't be compromised but
   accepted, it's not wrong to have fun in certain situations. work is the
   most important part of any individual's life, what's the point if you
   don't have fun in what you always dreamt of as a kid,
   so yeah, again i'll probably be updating the software ever so often, to
   make sure it stays up-to-date with current technology, you can come say
   me "hi" in any of the social media links, but just don't be formal,
   imagine i am one of your co-mate, college-mate, room-mate, mate,
   whereas for any formal enquiries kindly contact me at
   "ugupta41@gmail.com".
   arguably the worst "about me" section ever, but oh well, atleast you
   can feel a little bit home.
   cheers,
   slapbot.
