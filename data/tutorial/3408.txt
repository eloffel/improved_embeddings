   pytorch implementation of relational networks - [82]a simple neural
   network module for relational reasoning

   implemented & tested on sort-of-clevr task.

sort-of-clevr

   sort-of-clevr is simplified version of [83]clevr.this is composed of
   10000 images and 20 questions (10 relational questions and 10
   non-relational questions) per each image. 6 colors (red, green, blue,
   orange, gray, yellow) are assigned to randomly chosen shape (square or
   circle), and placed in a image.

   non-relational questions are composed of 3 subtypes:
    1. shape of certain colored object
    2. horizontal location of certain colored object : whether it is on
       the left side of the image or right side of the image
    3. vertical location of certain colored object : whether it is on the
       upside of the image or downside of the image

   theses questions are "non-relational" because the agent only need to
   focus on certain object.

   relational questions are composed of 3 subtypes:
    1. shape of the object which is closest to the certain colored object
    2. shape of the object which is furthest to the certain colored object
    3. number of objects which have the same shape with the certain
       colored object

   these questions are "relational" because the agent has to consider the
   relations between objects.

   questions are encoded into a vector of size of 11 : 6 for one-hot
   vector for certain color among 6 colors, 2 for one-hot vector of
   relational/non-relational questions. 3 for one-hot vector of 3
   subtypes.

   [84][sample.png]

   i.e., with the sample image shown, we can generate non-relational
   questions like:
    1. what is the shape of the red object? => circle (even though it does
       not really look like "circle"...)
    2. is green object placed on the left side of the image? => yes
    3. is orange object placed on the upside of the image? => no

   and relational questions:
    1. what is the shape of the object closest to the red object? =>
       square
    2. what is the shape of the object furthest to the orange object? =>
       circle
    3. how many objects have same shape with the blue object? => 3

requirements

     * python 2.7
     * [85]numpy
     * [86]pytorch
     * [87]opencv

usage

$ ./run.sh

   or
$ python sort_of_clevr_generator.py

   to generate sort-of-clevr dataset and
 $ python main.py

   to train.

modifications

   in the original paper, sort-of-clevr task used different model from
   clevr task. however, because model used clevr requires much less time
   to compute (network is much smaller), this model is used for
   sort-of-clevr task.

result

   relational networks (20th epoch) id98 + mlp (without rn, 100th epoch)
   non-relational question 99% 66%
   relational question 89% 66%

   id98 + mlp occured overfitting to the training data.

   relational networks shows far better results in relational questions
   and non-relation questions.
