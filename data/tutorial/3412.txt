machine learning slides

   i created these slides for my machine learning course that i teach at
   [88]loyola university chicago. these slides are mostly based on
   sebastian raschka's [89]python machine learning book. please see
   sebastian's github [90]repository for additional course materials such
   as the full set of equations used in the text and the code samples.

   note: be sure to download the [91]code directory into the same place
   where you cloned this repository. some slides will not compile without
   it!

acknowledgements

   i am grateful to sebastian for providing the latex source for the
   equations used in the book.
