   [3]why should one learn machine learning from scratch rather than just
   learning to use the available libraries?

   manager: okay, we need a system for detecting pedestrians in real time
   on the road!

   engineer: i   m sure there   s an r package that does it! alternatively, we
   can use scikit-selfdrivingcar or something. i bet we can get it done
   the next week!

   a few hours of googling later   

   engineer: apparently, there   s nothing like that. let   s do some heavy
   lifting - we will use scikit-visionmagic, download a dataset for it in
   .csv format from kaggle, call a bunch of standard methods from tutorial
   and ship it to production!

   next day:

   engineer: uuuh, there   s no readily available datasets, no
   out-of-the-box libraries   sigh. alright, let   s use keras and someone   s
   project from github!

   a few denigrating comments from stackoverflow later   

   engineer: okay, i   ve managed to run it on our data, but this model
   gives us some weird artifacts that were not reported in the
   instructions   guess, i   ll have to learn keras deeper and try to fix
   that.

   a few questions on quora later:

   manager: hey, how   s that pedestrian thing going?

   engineer: pretty good, just a few more minor fixes!

   *muffed sound of crash in the background*

   engineer: turns out this model was good only for demonstration! i   ll
   have to write my own in tensorflow   

   a few days of copy-pasting tutorial code later:

   manager: dude, we are in no rush, but you   ve told us that you   d be done
   by now.

   engineer: yeah, there were some complications, need to make sure
   everything goes smoothly after the release.

   do you hear that sound? that   s the sound a gradient makes when it
   explodes [9][1]

   engineer: this pre-implemented id168 is a mess! and i will have
   to write a couple of my custom layers, and a id168, and the
   id173 that   s not shipped in the available library   so many
   things to study.

   one ml course later.

   engineer: turns out the receptive field was too narrow   if only i took a
   class on deep learning   

   engineer: oh, that batch id172 thing really rocks! why don   t
   they write it in scikit-learn tutorial?

   one goodfellow   s book later.

   engineer: finally! i   ve broken a ton of things on my own and made a ton
   of mistakes that could be avoided, but hey, that   s the fun of learning!

   engineer: alright, it works, the simulations look pretty good!

   deployment engineer: great! but your system requires 24gb of memory and
   can   t process more than 2 frames per second on a high-end titan card.
   we can   t use it in a car.

   engineer: damn it! it looks like i   ll need a fast id136 method and
   reduced memory consumption   if only i knew the computational complexity
   of every part of my network and the amount of parameters like they
   teach in the algorithms course   and what   s about that fp16 thing
   anyway?..

   manager: we have run out of funding and everyone is fired.

   fin.

   the moral of the story is that you can   t outgoogle good fundamental
   education and relevant technical knowledge.
