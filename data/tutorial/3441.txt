qa-srl: question-answer driven id14
use natural language to annotate natural language

   we use question-answer pairs to model verbal predicate-argument
   structure. the questions start with wh-words (who, what, where, what,
   etc.) and contains a verb predicate in the sentence; the answers are
   phrases in the sentence. for example:
   ucd finished the 2006 championship as dublin champions , by beating st
   vincents in the final .
   finished who finished something? ucd
   what did someone finish? the 2006 championship
   what did someone finish something as? dublin champions
   how did someone finish something? by beating st vincents in the final
   beating who beat someone? ucd
   when did someone beat someone? in the final
   who did someone beat? st vincents

   *the newswire data does not contain the original sentences. you will
   need to download and run the following [15]python script with the
   conll-2009 english training data to get the complete data.
