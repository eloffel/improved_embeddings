a primer in adversarial machine learning     the next advance in ai

   summary:  what comes next after deep learning?  how do we get to
   artificial general intelligence?  adversarial machine learning is an
   emerging space that points to that direction and shows that agi is
   closer than we think.

   deep learning, convolutional neural nets (id98s) have given us dramatic
   improvements in image, speech, and text recognition over the last two
   years.  they suffer from the flaw however that [36]they can be easily
   fooled by the introduction of even small amounts of noise, random or
   intentional.  this phenomenon can result in the id98 misclassifying an
   image and yet having a very high degree of confidence.

    [37] [adversarial1.png?width=600]

   in this example (szegedy et al., 2014) the addition of a tiny bit of
   noise to the original image caused the id98 to misclassify this panda as
   a gibbon with 99% confidence.

   even more concerning, researchers have shown that completely random
   nonsense images can be misclassified by id98s with very high confidence
   as objects recognizable to humans, even though a human would clearly
   recognize that there was no image there at all (e.g. labeling white
   noise static as the image of a cat).


   what   s the problem?

   as image and text processing become more pervasive in our applications,
   not only is there the possibility for unintentional error, there is the
   potential for outright fraud.

   consider two rising security applications, spam filtering and retinal
   identification.  it is possible for a knowledgeable adversary to
   exploit this weakness to defeat a id98 spam filter.  it was originally
   believed that the spammer would have to have deep knowledge of the
   original system but it   s recently been shown that even cleverly
   introduced random noise in the spam message, undetectable to the
   reader, can be used to defeat id98 spam filters.

   [38][retinalscan.jpg?width=200] similarly with retinal images.
   although retinal images are believed to be highly specific to
   individuals, how do we know that the id98 is correctly identifying that
   retinal image is actually yours?  an adversary could introduce
   undetectable amounts of noise in the image resulting in
   misidentification.

   a third possibility is to intentionally poison say an intrusion
   detection system.  these systems are designed to constantly retrain on
   the most current system observations.  if those system observations are
   intentionally tainted with noise designed to defeat the id98
   recognition, the system will be trained to make incorrect conclusions
   about whether a malevolent intrusion is occurring.


   adversarial machine learning (aml)

   adversarial machine learning is an emerging area in deep neural net
   (dnn) research.  although the problems of noise and misclassification
   have been recognized for a decade, only in the last 12 to 24 months
   have major advances been made.  it   s important to understand that aml
   is an emerging area.  industrial strength applications aren   t ready
   today but they are close.


   [39][battlingrobots.jpg?width=250] the basic concept

   the basic concept of aml is to have two separate id98s battle it out.
   the first id98 is known as the discriminator.  its task is to correctly
   classify the image.  the second and adversary id98 is the generator.
   its task is to produce images that will fool the discriminator.  this
   architecture is often also called id3
   (gans).

   we   ll stick with image processing for this example.  suppose we want to
   train our gan to recognize 18^th century paintings.  this is completely
   unsupervised with the system simply being shown a large sample of these
   paintings.  remember that id98s reduce images through a series of layers
   to simple numerical vectors that describe edges, colors, and the like
   and can also create images in the reverse process by simply starting
   with a random selection of these numerical vectors.

    [40] [18thcentpaintings.png?width=600]

   as the contest begins, the generator feeds images which it has created
   and are therefore false to the discriminator which sees these images
   along with true images.

   the discriminator wants to be good at this and optimizes itself not to
   be fooled by the generator.  the generator also wants to be good at
   fooling the discriminator and optimizes itself to produce images that
   the discriminator can   t tell are false.  eventually the generator
   produces such realistic images that the discriminator only has a 50/50
   chance of being correct and the gan optimization is complete.

   i   m sure you recognized that the generator-produced images in this
   example play the same role as the noise in description of id98 failures
   and that this procedure effectively trains against the noise.


   an unexpected bonus     getting humans out of the process

   the current state of ai has advanced to general image, text, and speech
   recognition, and tasks like steering the car or winning a game of
   chess.  basically the eyes, ears, arms, and legs of ai, but not yet
   [41]agi, artificial general intelligence.

   among the barriers to be overcome is the continued requirement for a
   human data scientist to be involved in the modeling process.  id98s do
   an excellent job of image processing, but only when they are supervised
   and given tagged examples from which to learn.
    1. the first bonus from adversarial machine learning is that the data
       set is untagged and the process is unsupervised.
    2. the second bonus is in the design of the loss (fitness) function.
       the design of an appropriate id168 that basically tells the
       id98 whether it is getting warmer or colder after each iteration is
       still a complex task accomplished by data scientists.  with aml
       this is removed and replaced by the evolutionary process of the two
       systems attempting to optimize against one another.
    3. the third bonus is interpretability.  up to this point id98s have
       been true black boxes with data scientists unable to discern the
       purpose of each layer or algorithm.  aml offers the opportunity to
       train the layers individually and develop a hierarchy of layers
       that allow the ds to directly view and understand the role of each
       layer.

   this is as close as we have yet come to [42]having machines learn by
   themselves without human intervention.


   aml brings us a step closer to artificial general intelligence

   now that we are on the brink of achieving unsupervised, self-optimizing
   machine learning, we are several steps closer to machines that learn
   like humans from their experience of the world.

   our machine learning to this point shows deductive reasoning (from
   prediction to observation) and inductive reasoning (from the
   observation to the generalization).  what we don   t have yet is
   abductive reasoning in which the machine takes incomplete information
   about the world and takes action based on the likeliest possible
   explanation for the group of observations, an educated guess.

   but aml offers a path forward for the machine to demonstrate human-like
   prediction and planning based on its own experience of the world.  in a
   thought experiment suggested by yan lecun and soumith chintala, both
   doing ai research at facebook, they propose to show several video
   frames of a billiards game to their aml and have it learn the rules of
   physics describing what will happen next     to anticipate.  they plan to
   augment this experiment by training their aml on images set a few
   inches apart like binocular vision.  in essence, to let it learn about
   the 3d world.  from this they expect their aml to develop the    common
   sense    that, for example, it cannot walk out a door without first
   opening it or how far someone would have to reach across a table to
   grasp an object.

   another step down the path toward agi.

          metaphysically aesthetically pleasing concept too: brain
          analogy: left hemisphere vs right hemisphere? building ai
          introspection? a small step for man, a giant leap for ai!

          thanks for this article bill, i really enjoyed it. i read your
          previous article about id23 and liked it a lot
          too. i'll definitely keep on the lookout for more of your
          articles in the future.
