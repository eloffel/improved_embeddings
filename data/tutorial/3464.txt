overview

   this repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular
   id23 algorithms. these are meant to serve as a
   learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from
     * [86]id23: an introduction (2nd edition)
     * [87]david silver's id23 course

   each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above
   textbook and/or course. in addition to exercises and solution, each
   folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary,
   and links to the relevant readings.

   all code is written in python 3 and uses rl environments from
   [88]openai gym. advanced techniques use [89]tensorflow for neural
   network implementations.
