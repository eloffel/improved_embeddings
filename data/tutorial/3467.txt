deep learning tutorials

   deep learning is a new area of machine learning research, which has
   been introduced with the objective of moving machine learning closer to
   one of its original goals: artificial intelligence. deep learning is
   about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that
   help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. the
   tutorials presented here will introduce you to some of the most
   important deep learning algorithms and will also show you how to run
   them using theano. theano is a python library that makes writing deep
   learning models easy, and gives the option of training them on a gpu.

   the easiest way to follow the tutorials is to [92]browse them online.
