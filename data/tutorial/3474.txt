graph auto-encoders

   this is a tensorflow implementation of the (variational) graph
   auto-encoder model as described in our paper:

   t. n. kipf, m. welling, [76]variational graph auto-encoders, nips
   workshop on bayesian deep learning (2016)

   graph auto-encoders (gaes) are end-to-end trainable neural network
   models for unsupervised learning, id91 and link prediction on
   graphs.

   [77](variational) graph auto-encoder

   gaes have successfully been used for:
     * link prediction in large-scale relational data: m. schlichtkrull &
       t. n. kipf et al., [78]modeling relational data with graph
       convolutional networks (2017),
     * matrix completion / recommendation with side information: r. berg
       et al., [79]graph convolutional matrix completion (2017).

   gaes are based on id197 (id197s), a recent class
   of models for end-to-end (semi-)supervised learning on graphs:

   t. n. kipf, m. welling, [80]semi-supervised classification with graph
   convolutional networks, iclr (2017).

   a high-level introduction is given in our blog post:

   thomas kipf, [81]id197 (2016)

installation

python setup.py install

requirements

     * tensorflow (1.0 or later)
     * python 2.7
     * networkx
     * scikit-learn
     * scipy

run the demo

python train.py

data

   in order to use your own data, you have to provide
     * an n by n adjacency matrix (n is the number of nodes), and
     * an n by d feature matrix (d is the number of features per node) --
       optional

   have a look at the load_data() function in input_data.py for an
   example.

   in this example, we load citation network data (cora, citeseer or
   pubmed). the original datasets can be found here:
   [82]http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/projects/lbc/ and here (in a
   different format): [83]https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid

   you can specify a dataset as follows:
python train.py --dataset citeseer

   (or by editing train.py)

models

   you can choose between the following models:
     * id197_ae: graph auto-encoder (with id197 encoder)
     * id197_vae: variational graph auto-encoder (with id197 encoder)

  title={variational graph auto-encoders},
