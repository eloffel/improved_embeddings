planetoid

introduction

   this is an implementation of planetoid, a graph-based semi-supervised
   learning method proposed in the following paper:

   [78]revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. zhilin
   yang, william w. cohen, ruslan salakhutdinov. icml 2016.

   please cite the above paper if you use the datasets or code in this
   repo.

run the demo

   we include the citeseer dataset in the directory data, where the data
   structures needed are pickled.

   to run the transductive version,
python test_trans.py

   to run the inductive version,
python test_ind.py

   you can refer to test_trans.py and test_ind.py for example usages of
   our model.

models

   the models are implemented mainly in trans_model.py (transductive) and
   ind_model.py (inductive), with inheritance from base_model.py. you
   might refer to the source files for detailed api documentation.

prepare the data

transductive learning

   the input to the transductive model contains:
     * x, the feature vectors of the training instances,
     * y, the one-hot labels of the training instances,
     * graph, a dict in the format {index: [index_of_neighbor_nodes]},
       where the neighbor nodes are organized as a list. the current
       version only supports binary graphs.

   let l be the number of training instances. the indices in graph from 0
   to l - 1 must correspond to the training instances, with the same order
   as in x.

inductive learning

   the input to the inductive model contains:
     * x, the feature vectors of the labeled training instances,
     * y, the one-hot labels of the labeled training instances,
     * allx, the feature vectors of both labeled and unlabeled training
       instances (a superset of x),
     * graph, a dict in the format {index: [index_of_neighbor_nodes]}.

   let n be the number of both labeled and unlabeled training instances.
   these n instances should be indexed from 0 to n - 1 in graph with the
   same order as in allx.

preprocessed datasets

   datasets for citeseet, cora, and pubmed are available in the directory
   data, in a preprocessed format stored as numpy/scipy files.

   the dataset for diel is available at
   [79]http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lbing/data/emnlp-15-diel/emnlp-15-diel.tar.g
   z. we also provide a much more succinct version of the dataset that
   only contains necessary files and some (not very well-organized)
   pre-processing code here at
   [80]http://cs.cmu.edu/~zhiliny/data/diel_data.tar.gz.

   the nell dataset can be found here at
   [81]http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhiliny/data/nell_data.tar.gz.

   in addition to x, y, allx, and graph as described above, the
   preprocessed datasets also include:
     * tx, the feature vectors of the test instances,
     * ty, the one-hot labels of the test instances,
     * test.index, the indices of test instances in graph, for the
       inductive setting,
     * ally, the labels for instances in allx.

   the indices of test instances in graph for the transductive setting are
   from #x to #x + #tx - 1, with the same order as in tx.

   you can use cpickle.load(open(filename)) to load the numpy/scipy
   objects x, y, tx, ty, allx, ally, and graph. test.index is stored as a
   text file.

hyper-parameter tuning

   refer to test_ind.py and test_trans.py for the definition of different
   hyper-parameters (passed as arguments). hyper-parameters are tuned by
   randomly shuffle the training/test split (i.e., randomly shuffling the
   indices in x, y, tx, ty, and graph). for the diel dataset, we tune the
   hyper-parameters on one of the ten runs, and then keep the same
   hyper-parameters for all the ten runs.
