open-sourcing deepmind lab

   deepmind's scientific mission is to push the boundaries of ai,
   developing systems that can learn to solve any complex problem without
   needing to be taught how. to achieve this, we work from the premise
   that ai needs to be general. agents should operate across a wide range
   of tasks and be able to automatically adapt to changing circumstances.
   that is, they should not be pre-programmed, but rather, able to learn
   automatically from their raw inputs and reward signals from the
   environment. there are two parts to this research program: (1)
   designing ever-more intelligent agents capable of more-and-more
   sophisticated cognitive skills, and (2) building increasingly complex
   environments where agents can be trained and evaluated.

   the development of innovative agents goes hand in hand with the careful
   design and implementation of rationally selected, flexible and
   well-maintained environments. to that end, we at deepmind have invested
   considerable effort toward building rich simulated environments to
   serve as     laboratories    for ai research. now we are open-sourcing our
   flagship platform,  deepmind lab, so the broader research community can
   make use of it.

   deepmind lab is a fully 3d game-like platform tailored for agent-based
   ai research. it is observed from a first-person viewpoint, through the
   eyes of the simulated agent. scenes are rendered with rich science
   fiction-style visuals. the available actions allow agents to look
   around and move in 3d. the agent   s    body    is a floating orb. it
   levitates and moves by activating thrusters opposite its desired
   direction of movement, and it has a camera that moves around the main
   sphere as a ball-in-socket joint tracking the rotational look actions.
   example tasks include collecting fruit, navigating in mazes, traversing
   dangerous passages while avoiding falling off cliffs, bouncing through
   space using launch pads to move between platforms, playing laser tag,
   and quickly learning and remembering random procedurally generated
   environments. an illustration of how agents in deepmind lab perceive
   and interact with the world can be seen below:
   [dmlab-blog-figure1-161202-r01%2520%25281%2529%2520%25281%2529%2520%252
   81%2529%2520%25281%2529.width-400_ffoa6qw.png]
   at each moment in time, agents observe the world as an image, in
   pixels, rendered from their own first-person perspective. they also may
   receive a reward (or punishment!) signal. the agent can activate its
   thrusters to move in 3d and can also rotate its viewpoint along both
   horizontal and vertical axes.

   artificial general intelligence research in deepmind lab emphasizes
   navigation, memory, 3d vision from a first person viewpoint, motor
   control, planning, strategy, time, and fully autonomous agents that
   must learn for themselves what tasks to perform by exploring their
   environment. all these factors make learning difficult. each are
   considered frontier research questions in their own right. putting them
   all together in one platform, as we have, represents a significant new
   challenge for the field.

   deepmind lab is highly customisable and extendable. new levels can be
   authored with off-the-shelf editor tools. in addition, deepmind lab
   includes an interface for programmatic level-creation. levels can be
   customised with gameplay logic, item pickups, custom observations,
   level restarts, reward schemes, in-game messages and more. the
   interface can be used to create levels in which novel map layouts are
   generated on the fly while an agent trains. these features are useful
   in, for example, testing how an agent copes with unfamiliar
   environments. users will be able to add custom levels to the platform
   via github. the assets will be hosted on github alongside all the code,
   maps and level scripts. our hope is that the community will help us
   shape and develop the platform going forward.

   deepmind lab has been used internally at deepmind for some time
   ([35]example). we believe it has already had a significant impact on
   our thinking concerning numerous aspects of intelligence, both natural
   and artificial. however, our efforts so far have only barely scratched
   the surface of what is possible in deepmind lab. there are
   opportunities for significant contributions still to be made in a
   number of mostly still untouched research domains now available through
   deepmind lab, such as navigation, memory and exploration.

   as well as facilitating agent evaluation, there are compelling reasons
   to think that it may be fundamentally easier to develop intelligence in
   a 3d world, observed from a first-person viewpoint, like deepmind lab.
   after all, the only known examples of general-purpose intelligence in
   the natural world arose from a combination of evolution, development,
   and learning, grounded in physics and the sensory apparatus of animals.
   it is possible that a large fraction of animal and human intelligence
   is a direct consequence of the richness of our environment, and
   unlikely to arise without it. consider the alternative: if you or i had
   grown up in a world that looked like space invaders or pac-man, it
   doesn   t seem likely we would have achieved much general intelligence!
