introduction to natural language processing (nlp)

   getting started with natural language processing and nlp text analysis

natural language processing summary

   the field of study that focuses on the interactions between human
   language and computers is called natural language processing, or nlp
   for short. it sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial
   intelligence, and computational linguistics ([11]wikipedia).

      natural language processing is a field that covers computer
   understanding and manipulation of human language, and it   s ripe with
   possibilities for newsgathering,    anthony pesce said in [12]natural
   language processing in the kitchen.    you usually hear about it in the
   context of analyzing large pools of legislation or other document sets,
   attempting to discover patterns or root out corruption.   

what is natural language processing?

   nlp is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning
   from human language in a smart and useful way. by utilizing nlp,
   developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such
   as id54, translation, id39,
   relationship extraction, id31, id103, and
   topic segmentation.

      apart from common word processor operations that treat text like a
   mere sequence of symbols, nlp considers the hierarchical structure of
   language: several words make a phrase, several phrases make a sentence
   and, ultimately, sentences convey ideas,    john rehling, an nlp expert
   at meltwater group, said in [13]how natural language processing helps
   uncover social media sentiment.    by analyzing language for its meaning,
   nlp systems have long filled useful roles, such as correcting grammar,
   converting speech to text and automatically translating between
   languages.   

   [14]nlp is used to analyze text, allowing machines to [15]understand
   how human   s speak. this human-computer interaction enables real-world
   applications like [16]automatic text summarization, [17]sentiment
   analysis, [18]topic extraction, [19]id39,
   [20]parts-of-speech tagging, [21]relationship extraction, [22]id30,
   and more. nlp is commonly used for [23]id111, [24]machine
   translation, and [25]automated id53.

   nlp is characterized as a hard problem in computer science. human
   language is rarely precise, or plainly spoken. to understand human
   language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how
   they   re [26]linked together to create meaning. despite language being
   one of the easiest things for humans to learn, the ambiguity of
   language is what makes natural language processing a difficult problem
   for computers to master.

what can developers use nlp algorithms for?

   nlp algorithms are typically based on machine learning algorithms.
   instead of hand-coding large sets of rules, nlp can rely on machine
   learning to automatically learn these rules by analyzing a set of
   examples (i.e. a large corpus, like a book, down to a collection of
   sentences), and making a statical id136. in general, the more data
   analyzed, the more accurate the model will be.
     * summarize blocks of text using [27]summarizer to extract the most
       important and central ideas while ignoring irrelevant information.
     * create a chat bot using [28]parsey mcparseface, a language parsing
       deep learning model made by [29]google that uses point-of-speech
       tagging.
     * automatically generate keyword tags from content using [30]autotag,
       which leverages lda, a technique that discovers topics contained
       within a body of text.
     * identify the type of entity extracted, such as it being a person,
       place, or organization using [31]id39.
     * use [32]id31 to identify the sentiment of a string of
       text, from very negative to neutral to very positive.
     * reduce words to their root, or stem, using [33]porterstemmer, or
       break up text into tokens using [34]tokenizer.

open source nlp libraries

   these libraries provide the algorithmic building blocks of nlp in
   real-world applications. algorithmia provides a [35]free api endpoint
   for many of these algorithms, without ever having to setup or provision
   servers and infrastructure.
     * [36]apache opennlp: a machine learning toolkit that provides
       [37]tokenizers, sentence segmentation, [38]part-of-speech tagging,
       [39]named entity extraction, [40]chunking, [41]parsing, coreference
       resolution, and more.
     * [42]natural language toolkit (nltk): a python library that provides
       modules for processing text, classifying, tokenizing, id30,
       tagging, parsing, and more.
     * [43]standford nlp: a suite of nlp tools that provide
       [44]part-of-speech tagging, the [45]named entity recognizer,
       [46]coreference resolutionsystem, [47]id31, and more.
     * [48]mallet: a java package that provides [49]latent dirichlet
       allocation, document classification, id91, id96,
       information extraction, and more.

a few nlp examples

     * use [50]summarizer to automatically summarize a block of text,
       exacting topic sentences, and ignoring the rest.
     * generate keyword topic tags from a document using [51]lda (latent
       dirichlet allocation), which determines the most relevant words
       from a document. this algorithm is at the heart of the [52]auto-tag
       and [53]auto-tag url microservices.
     * [54]id31, based on stanfordnlp, can be used to
       identify the feeling, opinion, or belief of a statement, from very
       negative, to neutral, to very positive. often, developers with use
       an algorithm to [55]identify the sentiment of a term in a sentence,
       or use [56]id31 to analyze social media.

   [57]nlp algorithms can be extremely helpful for web developers,
   providing them with the turnkey tools needed to create advanced
   applications, and prototypes.

example natural language processing use cases

   nlp algorithms are typically based on machine learning algorithms.
   instead of hand-coding large sets of rules, nlp can rely on machine
   learning to automatically learn these rules by analyzing a set of
   examples (i.e. a large corpus, like a book, down to a collection of
   sentences), and making a statical id136. in general, the more data
   analyzed, the more accurate the model will be.

   social media analysis is a great example of nlp use. brands track
   conversations online to understand what customers are saying, and glean
   insight into user behavior.

      one of the most compelling ways nlp offers valuable intelligence is by
   tracking sentiment     the tone of a written message (tweet, facebook
   update, etc.)     and tag that text as positive, negative or neutral,   
   [58]rehling said.

   build your own social media monitoring tool
    1. start by using the algorithm [59]retrieve tweets with keyword to
       capture all mentions of your brand name on twitter. in our case, we
       search for mentions of algorithmia.
    2. then, pipe the results into the [60]id31 algorithm,
       which will assign a sentiment rating from 0-4 for each string
       (tweet).

   similarly, facebook uses nlp to track trending topics and popular
   hashtags.

      hashtags and topics are two different ways of grouping and
   participating in conversations,    chris struhar, a software engineer on
   news feed, said in [61]how facebook built trending topics with natural
   language processing.    so don   t think facebook won   t recognize a string
   as a topic without a hashtag in front of it. rather, it   s all about
   nlp: natural language processing. ain   t nothing natural about a
   hashtag, so facebook instead parses strings and figures out which
   strings are referring to nodes     objects in the network. we look at the
   text, and we try to understand what that was about.   

   it   s not just social media that can use nlp to it   s benefit. publishers
   are hoping to use nlp to improve the quality of their online
   communities by leveraging technology to    auto-filter the offensive
   comments on news sites to save moderators from what can be an
      exhausting process   ,    francis tseng said in [62]prototype winner using
      natural language processing    to solve journalism   s commenting problem.

   other practical uses of nlp include [63]monitoring for malicious
   digital attacks, such as phishing, or [64]detecting when somebody is
   lying.

   use nlp to build your own rss reader

   you can [65]build a machine learning rss reader in less than 30-minutes
   using the follow algorithms:
    1. [66]scraperss to grab the title and content from an rss feed.
    2. [67]html2text to keep the important text, but strip all the html
       from the document.
    3. [68]autotag uses [69]id44 to identify
       relevant keywords from the text.
    4. [70]id31 is then used to identify if the article is
       positive, negative, or neutral.
    5. [71]summarizer is finally used to identify the key sentences.

recommended nlp books for beginners

     * [72]speech and language processing:    the first of its kind to
       thoroughly cover language technology     at all levels and with all

       outdated material, this edition updates every chapter and expands
       the content to include emerging areas, such as id31.   
     * [75]statistical language learning (language, speech, and
       communication):    eugene charniak breaks new ground in artificial
       intelligenceresearch by presenting statistical language processing
       from an artificial intelligence point of view in a text for
       researchers and scientists with a traditional computer science
       background.   
     * [76]natural language processing with python: analyzing text with
       the natural language toolkit
          this is a book about natural language processing. by    natural
       language    we mean a language that is used for everyday
       communication by humans; languages like english, hindi or
       portuguese. at one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word
       frequencies to compare different writing styles.
     * [77]speech and language processing, 2nd edition 2nd edition
          an explosion of web-based language techniques, merging of distinct
       fields, availability of phone-based dialogue systems, and much more
       make this an exciting time in speech and language processing. the
       first of its kind to thoroughly cover language technology     at all
       levels and with all modern technologies     this text takes an
       empirical approach to the subject, based on applying statistical
       and other machine-learning algorithms to large corporations. the
       authors cover areas that traditionally are taught in different
       courses, to describe a unified vision of speech and language
       processing.   
     * [78]introduction to information retrieval
          as recently as the 1990s, studies showed that most people
       preferred getting information from other people rather than from
       information retrieval systems. however, during the last decade,
       relentless optimization of information retrieval effectiveness has
       driven web search engines to new quality levels where most people
       are satisfied most of the time, and web search has become a
       standard and often preferred source of information finding. for
       example, the 2004 pew internet survey (fallows, 2004) found that
       92% of internet users say the internet is a good place to go for
       getting everyday information.    to the surprise of many, the field
       of information retrieval has moved from being a primarily academic
       discipline to being the basis underlying most people   s preferred
       means of information access.   

nlp tutorials

     * [79]natural language processing tutorial:    we will go from
       id121 to feature extraction to creating a model using a

     * [80]basic natural language processing:    in this tutorial
       competition, we dig a little    deeper    into id31.
       people express their emotions in language that is often obscured by
       sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very
       misleading for both humans and computers.   
     * [81]an nlp tutorial with roger ebert:    natural language processing
       is the process of extracting information from text and speech. in
       this post, we walk through different approaches for automatically
       extracting information from text   keyword-based, statistical,
       machine learning   to explain why many organizations are now moving
       towards the more sophisticated machine-learning approaches to
       managing text data.

       processing (nlp) is a field of computer science, artificial
       intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the
       interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. in
       1950, alan turing published an article titled    computing machinery
       and intelligence    which proposed what is now called the turing test
       as a criterion of intelligence. starting in the late 1980s,
       however, there was a revolution in nlp with the introduction of
       machine learning algorithms for language processing.
