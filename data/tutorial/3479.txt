tutorial: natural language processing in python

   this repo contains material for a workshop on natural language
   processing with python.

audience

   the target audience of this workshop are students, researchers,
   developers, hobbyists and anyone interested in knowing more about
   natural language processing and text analytics.

   some very basic knowledge of python is assumed (e.g. if you have seen
   some python script before, you're good to go), but no previous nlp
   knowledge is required.

presentations

   different versions of this workshop have been delivered at different
   events:
     * pycon uk 2016: 3h session (slides
       presentations/2016-pyconuk-slides.pdf)
     * pycon ireland 2016: 1.5h session (slides
       presentations/2016-pyconie-slides.pdf)
     * pycon italy 2017: 3.5h session (slides
       presentations/2017-pyconitaly-slides.pdf)

environment set up

   the code has been tested with python 3.4 and 3.5. support for python
   2.7 is best-effort, if you find an issue please report it.

   this paragraph describes how to set up your environment locally.

   step 1 - clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/bonzanini/nlp-tutorial
cd nlp-tutorial

   step 2 - create and activate a python virtual environment:
virtualenv nlp-venv
source nlp-venv/bin/activate

   step 2 (alternative) - create a conda environment:
conda create --name nlp-venv python=3.5
source activate nlp-venv

   step 3 - install libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

   this will download and install nltk, scikit-learn and jupyter (plus
   dependencies).

   nltk requires some data to be installed separately (more details on
   [75]the nltk website).

   from the command line, you can download the required packages:
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords reuters

   alternatively, from a python interactive shell:
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()

   then use the gui to select the requires packages (punkt, stopwords,
   reuters).

   tip: even if you can use "all" as package name to install all the nltk
   data, it's not a great thing to do over a flakey conference wi-fi. this
   will download approx. 2gb and if we all do it at the same time we'll
   kill the conference wi-fi :)

   finally - run jupyter:
jupyter notebook

   in order to test that your environment is correctly set. please open
   the notebook "00 environment test" and follow the instructions.

matplotlib backend issues

   there might be a few issues related to matplotlib backends as described
   [76]on their documentation, especially on macos.

   by editing/creating the file ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc with the
   following line:
backend: tkagg

   the issue should be fixed. if not, please refer to the [77]matplotlib
   docs
