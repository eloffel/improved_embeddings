18 places to find data sets for data science projects

   this is the fifth post in a series of posts on how to build a data
   science portfolio. you can find links to the other individual posts in
   this series at the bottom of the post.
   [64]build an enviable data science portfolio

   if you   ve ever worked on a personal data science project, you   ve
   probably spent a lot of time browsing the internet looking for
   interesting data sets to analyze. it can be fun to sift through dozens
   of data sets to find the perfect one, but it can also be frustrating to
   download and import several csv files, only to realize that the data
   isn   t that interesting after all. luckily, there are online
   repositories that curate data sets and (mostly) remove the
   uninteresting ones.

   in this post, we   ll walk through several types of data science
   projects, including data visualization projects, data cleaning
   projects, and machine learning projects, and identify good places to
   find data sets for each. whether you want to strengthen your [65]data
   science portfolio by showing that you can visualize data well, or you
   have a spare few hours and want to practice your machine learning
   skills, we   ve got you covered.

data sets for data visualization projects

   a typical data visualization project might be something along the lines
   of    i want to make an infographic about how income varies across the
   different states in the us   . there are a few considerations to keep in
   mind when looking for a good data set for a data visualization project:
     * it shouldn   t be messy, because you don   t want to spend a lot of
       time cleaning data.
     * it should be nuanced and interesting enough to make charts about.
     * ideally, each column should be well-explained, so the visualization
       is accurate.
     * the data set shouldn   t have too many rows or columns, so it   s easy
       to work with.

   a good place to find good data sets for data visualization projects are
   news sites that release their data publicly. they typically clean the
   data for you, and also already have charts they   ve made that you can
   replicate or improve.

1. fivethirtyeight

   [fivethirtyeight.jpg]

   [66]fivethirtyeight is an incredibly popular interactive news and
   sports site started by [67]nate silver. they write interesting
   data-driven articles, like [68]   don   t blame a skills gap for lack of
   hiring in manufacturing    and [69]   2016 nfl predictions   .

   fivethirtyeight makes the data sets used in its articles available
   online on [70]github.

   [71]view the fivethirtyeight data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [72]airline safety     contains information on accidents from each
       airline.
     * [73]us weather history     historical weather data for the us.
     * [74]study drugs     data on who   s taking adderall in the us.

2. buzzfeed

   [buzzfeed.png]

   [75]buzzfeed started as a purveyor of low-quality articles, but has
   since evolved and now writes some investigative pieces, like [76]   the
   court that rules the world    and [77]   the short life of deonte hoard   .

   buzzfeed makes the data sets used in its articles available on github.

   [78]view the buzzfeed data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [79]federal surveillance planes     contains data on planes used for
       domestic surveillance.
     * [80]zika virus     data about the geography of the zika virus
       outbreak.
     * [81]firearm background checks     data on background checks of people
       attempting to buy firearms.

3. socrata opendata

   [socrata.jpeg]

   [82]socrata opendata is a portal that contains multiple clean data sets
   that can be explored in the browser or downloaded to visualize. a
   significant portion of the data is from us government sources, and many
   are outdated.

   you can explore and download data from opendata without registering.
   you can also use visualization and exploration tools to explore the
   data in the browser.

   [83]view socrata opendata

   here are some examples:
     * [84]white house staff salaries     data on what each white house
       staffer made in 2010.
     * [85]radiation analysis     data on what milk products in what
       locations in the us were radioactive.
     * [86]workplace fatalities by us state     the number of workplace
       deaths across the us.

data sets for data processing projects

   sometimes you just want to work with a large data set. the end result
   doesn   t matter as much as the process of reading in and analyzing the
   data. you might use tools like [87]spark or [88]hadoop to distribute
   the processing across multiple nodes. things to keep in mind when
   looking for a good data processing data set:
     * the cleaner the data, the better     cleaning a large data set can be
       very time consuming.
     * the data set should be interesting.
     * there should be an interesting question that can be answered with
       the data.

   a good place to find large public data sets are cloud hosting providers
   like [89]amazon and [90]google. they have an incentive to host the data
   sets, because they make you analyze them using their infrastructure
   (and pay them).

4. aws public data sets

   [aws.jpg]

   amazon makes large data sets available on its [91]amazon web services
   platform. you can download the data and work with it on your own
   computer, or analyze the data in the cloud using [92]ec2 and hadoop via
   [93]emr. you can read more about how the program works [94]here.

   amazon has a page that lists all of the data sets for you to browse.
   you   ll need an aws account, although amazon gives you a [95]free access
   tier for new accounts that will enable you to explore the data without
   being charged.

   [96]view aws public data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [97]lists of id165s from google books     common words and groups of
       words from a huge set of books.
     * [98]common crawl corpus     data from a crawl of over 5 billion web
       pages.
     * [99]landsat images     moderate resolution satellite images of the
       surface of the earth.

5. google public data sets

   [google.jpg]

   much like amazon, google also has a cloud hosting service, called
   [100]google cloud platform. with gcp, you can use a tool called
   [101]bigquery to explore large data sets.

   google lists all of the data sets on a page. you   ll need to sign up for
   a gcp account, but the first 1tb of queries you make are [102]free.

   [103]view google public data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [104]usa names     contains all social security name applications in
       the us, from 1879 to 2015.
     * [105]github activity     contains all public activity on over 2.8
       million public github repositories.
     * [106]historical weather     data from 9000 noaa weather stations from
       1929 to 2016.

6. wikipedia

   [wikipedia.jpg]

   [107]wikipedia is a free, online, community-edited encyclopedia.
   wikipedia contains an astonishing breadth of knowledge, containing
   pages on everything from the [108]ottoman-habsburg wars to [109]leonard
   nimoy. as part of wikipedia   s commitment to advancing knowledge, they
   offer all of their content for free, and regularly generate dumps of
   all the articles on the site. additionally, wikipedia offers edit
   history and activity, so you can track how a page on a topic evolves
   over time, and who contributes to it.

   you can find the various ways to download the data on the wikipedia
   site. you   ll also find scripts to reformat the data in various ways.

   [110]view wikipedia data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [111]all images and other media from wikipedia     all the images and
       other media files on wikipedia.
     * [112]full site dumps     of the content on wikipedia, in various
       formats.

data sets for machine learning projects

   when you   re working on a machine learning project, you want to be able
   to predict a column from the other columns in a data set. in order to
   be able to do this, we need to make sure that:
     * the data set isn   t too messy     if it is, we   ll spend all of our
       time cleaning the data.
     * there   s an interesting target column to make predictions for.
     * the other variables have some explanatory power for the target
       column.

   there are a few online repositories of data sets that are specifically
   for machine learning. these data sets are typically cleaned up
   beforehand, and allow for testing of algorithms very quickly.

7. kaggle

   [kaggle.jpg]

   [113]kaggle is a data science community that hosts machine learning
   competitions. there are a variety of externally-contributed interesting
   data sets on the site. kaggle has both live and historical
   competitions. you can download data for either, but you have to sign up
   for kaggle and accept the terms of service for the competition.

   you can download data from kaggle by entering a [114]competition. each
   competition has its own associated data set. there are also
   user-contributed data sets found in the new [115]kaggle data sets
   offering.

   [116]view kaggle data sets
   [117]view kaggle competitions

   here are some examples:
     * [118]satellite photograph order     a data set of satellite photos of
       earth     the goal is to predict which photos were taken earlier than
       others.
     * [119]manufacturing process failures     a data set of variables that
       were measured during the manufacturing process. the goal is to
       predict faults with the manufacturing.
     * [120]multiple choice questions     a data set of multiple choice
       questions and the corresponding correct answers. the goal is to
       predict the answer for any given question.

8. uci machine learning repository

   [uci.gif]

   the [121]uci machine learning repository is one of the oldest sources
   of data sets on the web. although the data sets are user-contributed,
   and thus have varying levels of documentation and cleanliness, the vast
   majority are clean and ready for machine learning to be applied. uci is
   a great first stop when looking for interesting data sets.

   you can download data directly from the uci machine learning
   repository, without registration. these data sets tend to be fairly
   small, and don   t have a lot of nuance, but are good for machine
   learning.

   [122]view uci machine learning repository

   here are some examples:
     * [123]email spam     contains emails, along with a label of whether or
       not they   re spam.
     * [124]wine classification     contains various attributes of 178
       different wines.
     * [125]solar flares     attributes of solar flares, useful for
       predicting characteristics of flares.

9. quandl

   [quandl.png]

   [126]quandl is a repository of economic and financial data. some of
   this information is free, but many data sets require purchase. quandl
   is useful for building models to predict economic indicators or stock
   prices. due to the large amount of available data sets, it   s possible
   to build a complex model that uses many data sets to predict values in
   another.

   [127]view quandl data sets.

   here are some examples:
     * [128]entrepreneurial activity by race and other factors     contains
       data from the kauffman foundation on entrepreneurs in the us.
     * [129]chinese macroeconomic data     indicators of chinese economic
       health.
     * [130]us federal reserve data     us economic indicators, from the
       federal reserve.

data sets for data cleaning projects

   sometimes, it can be very satisfying to take a data set spread across
   multiple files, clean them up, condense them into one, and then do some
   analysis. in data cleaning projects, sometimes it takes hours of
   research to figure out what each column in the data set means. it may
   sometimes turn out that the data set you   re analyzing isn   t really
   suitable for what you   re trying to do, and you   ll need to start over.

   when looking for a good data set for a data cleaning project, you want
   it to:
     * be spread over multiple files.
     * have a lot of nuance, and many possible angles to take.
     * require a good amount of research to understand.
     * be as    real-world    as possible.

   these types of data sets are typically found on aggregators of data
   sets. these aggregators tend to have data sets from multiple sources,
   without much curation. too much curation gives us overly neat data sets
   that are hard to do extensive cleaning on.

10. data.world

   [datadotworld.png]

   [131]data.world describes itself at    the social network for data
   people   , but could be more correctly describe as    github for data   .
   it   s a place where you can search for, copy, analyze, and download data
   sets. in addition, you can upload your data to data.world and use it to
   collaborate with others.

   in a relatively short time it has become one of the    go to    places to
   acquire data, with lots of user contributed data sets as well as
   fantastic data sets through data.world   s partnerships with various
   organizations includeing a large amount of data from the us federal
   government.

   one key differentiator of data.world is the tools they have built to
   make working with data easier     you can write sql queries within their
   interface to explore data and join multiple data sets. they also have
   sdk   s for r an python to make it easier to acquire and work with data
   in your tool of choice (you might be interested in reading our
   [132]tutorial on the data.world python sdk.)

11. data.gov

   [datagov.jpg]

   [134]data.gov is a relatively new site that   s part of a us effort
   towards open government. data.gov makes it possible to download data
   from multiple us government agencies. data can range from government
   budgets to school performance scores. much of the data requires
   additional research, and it can sometimes be hard to figure out which
   data set is the    correct    version. anyone can download the data,
   although some data sets require additional hoops to be jumped through,
   like agreeing to licensing agreements.

   you can browse the data sets on data.gov directly, without registering.
   you can browse by topic area, or search for a specific data set.

   [135]view data.gov data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [136]food environment atlas     contains data on how local food
       choices affect diet in the us.
     * [137]school system finances     a survey of the finances of school
       systems in the us.
     * [138]chronic disease data     data on chronic disease indicators in
       areas across the us.

12. the world bank

   [worldbank.jpg]

   [139]the world bank is a global development organization that offers
   loans and advice to developing countries. the world bank regularly
   funds programs in developing countries, then gathers data to monitor
   the success of these programs.

   you can browse world bank data sets directly, without registering. the
   data sets have many missing values, and sometimes take several clicks
   to actually get to data.

   [140]view world bank data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [141]world development indicators     contains country level
       information on development.
     * [142]educational statistics     data on education by country.
     * [143]world bank project costs     data on world bank projects and
       their corresponding costs.

13. /r/datasets

   [reddit.jpg]

   [144]reddit, a popular community discussion site, has a section devoted
   to sharing interesting data sets. it   s called the [145]datasets
   subreddit, or /r/datasets. the scope of these data sets varies a lot,
   since they   re all user-submitted, but they tend to be very interesting
   and nuanced.

   you can browse the subreddit [146]here. you can also see the most
   highly upvoted data sets [147]here.

   [148]view top /r/datasets posts

   here are some examples:
     * [149]all reddit submissions     contains reddit submissions through
       2015.

       gameshow jeopardy.
     * [151]new york city property tax data     data about properties and
       assessed value in new york city.

14. academic torrents

   [at-logo.png]

   [152]academic torrents is a new site that is geared around sharing the
   data sets from scientific papers. it   s a newer site, so it   s hard to
   tell what the most common types of data sets will look like. for now,
   it has tons of interesting data sets that lack context.

   you can browse the data sets directly on the site. since it   s a torrent
   site, all of the data sets can be immediately downloaded, but you   ll
   need a [153]bittorrent client. [154]deluge is a good free option.

   [155]view academic torrents data sets

   here are some examples:
     * [156]enron emails     a set of many emails from executives at enron,
       a company that famously went bankrupt.
     * [157]student learning factors     a set of factors that measure and
       influence student learning.
     * [158]news articles     contains news article attributes and a target
       variable.

bonus: streaming data

   it   s very common when you   re building a data science project to
   download a data set and then process it. however, as online services
   generate more and more data, an increasing amount is generated in
   real-time, and not available in data set form. some examples of this
   include data on tweets from [159]twitter, and stock price data. there
   aren   t many good sources to acquire this kind of data, but we   ll list a
   few in case you want to try your hand at a streaming data project.

15. twitter

   [twitter.png]

   [160]twitter has a good streaming api, and makes it relatively
   straightforward to filter and stream tweets. you can get started
   [161]here. there are tons of options here     you could figure out what
   states are the happiest, or which countries use the most complex
   language. we also recently wrote an article to get you started with the
   twitter api [162]here.
