deep learning with tensorflow in python

   the following problems appeared in the first few assignments in
   the udacity course deep learning (by google). the descriptions of the
   problems are taken from the assignments.

classifying the letters with notmnist dataset

   let   s first learn about simple data curation practices, and familiarize
   ourselves with some of the data that are going to be used for deep
   learning using tensorflow. the notmnist dataset to be used with python
   experiments. this dataset is designed to look like the classic mnist
   dataset, while looking a little more like real data: it   s a harder
   task, and the data is a lot less    clean    than mnist.

preprocessing

   first the dataset needs to be downloaded and extracted to a local
   machine. the data consists of characters rendered in a variety of fonts
   on a 28  28 image. the labels are limited to    a    through    j    (10
   classes). the training set has about 500k and the testset 19000
   labelled examples. given these sizes, it should be possible to train
   models quickly on any machine.

   let   s take a peek at some of the data to make sure it looks sensible.
   each exemplar should be an image of a character a through j rendered in
   a different font. display a sample of the images downloaded.

   now let   s load the data in a more manageable format. let   s convert the
   entire dataset into a 3d array (image index, x, y) of floating point
   values, normalized to have approximately zero mean and standard
   deviation ~0.5 to make training easier down the road. a few images
   might not be readable, we   ll just skip them. also the data is expected
   to be balanced across classes. let   s verify that. the following output
   shows the dimension of the ndarray for each class.
(52909, 28, 28) (52911, 28, 28) (52912, 28, 28) (52911, 28, 28) (52912, 28, 28)
(52912, 28, 28) (52912, 28, 28) (52912, 28, 28) (52912, 28, 28) (52911, 28, 28)

   now some more preprocessing is needed:
    1. first the training data (for different classes) needs to be merged
       and pruned.
    2. the labels will be stored into a separate array of integers from 0
       to 9.
    3. also let   s create a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning.
    4. finally the data needs to be randomized. it   s important to have the
       labels well shuffled for the training and test distributions to
       match.

   after preprocessing, let   s peek a few samples from the training
   dataset and the next figure shows how it looks.

   here is how the validation dataset looks (a few samples chosen).

   here is how the test dataset looks (a few samples chosen).

trying a few off-the-self classifiers

   let   s get an idea of what an off-the-shelf classifier can give us on
   this data. it   s always good to check that there is something to learn,
   and that it   s a problem that is not so trivial that a canned solution
   solves it. let   s first train a simple logisticregression model
   from sklearn (using default parameters) on this data
   using 5000 training samples.

   the following figure shows the output from the id28
   model trained, its accuracy on the test dataset (also the confusion
   matrix) and a few test instances classified wrongly (predicted labels
   along with the true labels) by the model.

   im14.png

deep learning with tensorflow

   now let   s progressively train deeper and more accurate
   models using tensorflow. again, we need to do the following
   preprocessing:
    1. reformat into a shape that   s more adapted to the models we   re going
       to train: data as a flat matrix,
    2. labels as 1-hot encodings.

   now let   s train a multinomial id28 using
   simple stochastic id119.

   tensorflow works like this:

   first we need to describe the computation that is to be performed: what
   the inputs, the variables, and the operations look like. these get
   created as nodes over a computation graph.

   then we can run the operations on this graph as many times as we want
   by calling session.run(), providing it outputs to fetch from the graph
   that get returned.
    1. let   s load all the data into tensorflow and build the computation
       graph corresponding to our training.
    2. let   s use stochastic id119 training (with ~3k steps),
       which is much faster. the graph will be similar to batch gradient
       descent, except that instead of holding all the training data into
       a constant node, we create a placeholder node which will be fed
       actual data at every call of session.run().

id28 with sgd

   the following shows the fully connected computation graph and the
   results obtained.

   nn_no_hidden.png

   im14_5

   im15

neural network with sgd

   now let   s turn the id28 example with sgd into a 1-hidden
   layer neural network with rectified linear units nn.relu() and 1024
   hidden nodes. as can be seen from the below results, this model
   improves the validation / test accuracy.

   im16

   im17

id173 with tensorflow

   previously we trained a id28 and a neural network model
   with tensorflow. let   s now explore the id173 techniques.

   let   s introduce and tune l2id173 for both logistic and neural
   network models. l2  amounts to adding a penalty on the norm of the
   weights to the loss. in tensorflow, we can compute the l2loss for
   a tensor t using nn.l2_loss(t).

   the right amount of id173 improves the validation / test
   accuracy, as can be seen from the following results.

l2 regularized id28 with sgd

   the following figure recapitulates the simple network without anyt
   hidden layer, with softmax outputs.

   nn_no_hidden.png

   the next figures visualize the weights learnt for the 10 output neurons
   at different steps using sgd and l2 regularized loss
   function (with   =0.005). as can be seen below, the weights learnt are
   gradually capturing the different features of the letters at the
   corresponding output neurons.

   im18.png

   as can be seen, the test accuracy also gets improved
   to 88.3% with l2 regularized id168 (with   =0.005).

   im19.png

   the following results show the accuracy and the weights learnt for
   couple of different values of    (0.01 and 0.05 respectively). as can be
   seen, with higher values of   , the id28 model tends
   to underfit and test accuracy decreases.


   im20 im21

l2 regularized neural network with sgd

   the following figure recapitulates the neural network with a single
   hidden layer with 1024 nodes, with relu intermediate outputs.
   the l2 id173s applied on the id168 for the weights
   learnt at the input and the hidden layers are   1 and   2, respectively.


   nn_hidden.png

   the next figures visualize the weights learnt for 225 randomly selected
   input neurons (out of 28  28) at different steps
   using sgd and l2 regularized id168 (with   1 =   2 = 0.01). as
   can be seen below, the weights learnt are gradually capturing (as the
   sgd steps increase) the different features of the letters at the
   corresponding output neurons.
   im22
   im23.png
   im24
   im26
   im27
   im28
   im29
   im30
   if the id173 parameters used are   1=  2=0.005, the test
   accuracy increases to 91.1%, as shown below.
   im25.png

overfitting

   let   s demonstrate an extreme case of overfitting. restrict your
   training data to just a few batches. what happens?

   let   s restrict the training data to n=5 batches. the following figures
   show how it increases the training accuracy to 100% (along with
   a visualization of a few randomly-picked input weights learnt) and
   decreases the validation and the test accuracy, since the model is
   not generalized enough.


   im31

   im32

   im33 im34 im35

   im36 im37

   im38

dropouts

   introduce dropout on the hidden layer of the neural network. remember:
   dropout should only be introduced during training, not evaluation,
   otherwise our evaluation results would be stochastic as
   well. tensorflow provides nn.dropout() for that, but you have to make
   sure it   s only inserted during training.

   what happens to our extreme overfitting case?

   as we can see from the below results, introducing a dropout
   rate of 0.4 increases the validation and test accuracy by reducing
   the overfitting.


   im39

   im40

   im41

   im42 im43

   im44

   im45

   im46

   till this point the highest accuracy on the test dataset using a single
   hidden-layer neural network is 91.1%. more hidden layers can be used /
   some other techniques (e.g., exponential decay in learning rate can be
   used) to improve the accuracy obtained (to be continued   ).
