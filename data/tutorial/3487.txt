introduction

   deep learning has been the most researched and talked about topic in
   data science recently. and it deserves the attention it gets, as some
   of the recent breakthroughs in data science are emanating from deep
   learning. it   s predicted that many deep learning applications will
   affect your life in the near future. actually, i think they are already
   making an impact.

   however, if you have been looking at deep learning from the outside, it
   might look difficult and intimidating. terms like tensorflow, keras,
   gpu based computing might scare you. but,  let me tell you a secret
   quietly     it is not difficult! while cutting edge deep learning will
   take time and effort to follow, applying them in simple day to day
   problems is very easy.

   it is also fun. i kind of re-discovered the fun and curiosity of a
   child while applying deep learning. through this article, i will
   showcase 6 such applications     which might look difficult at the
   outset, but can be achieved using deep learning implementation in less
   than an hour. this article is written to showcase these ground-breaking
   works and give you a taste of how they work.

   let   s start!


   p.s. we assume that you would know basics of python. if not, just
   follow [98]this tutorial and then you can start from here again.

1. applications using existing apis

   apis are nothing but a software running on the other side of the
   internet in a remote pc which can be accessed locally. for example, you
   plug in bluetooth speakers to your laptop even if your machine might
   have inbuilt speakers. so, we are able to access the speaker remotely
   while sitting on our laptop.

   apis work on similar concept     some one has already done the hard work
   for you. you can use it to solve the problem at hand quickly. for more
   details on api, [99]read here.

   i   ll list out some advantages and disadvantages of building apps using
   api.


1.1.1 advantages of deep learning api   s

     * a usual deep learning application requires heavy computation power
       in terms of gpu   s and data storage / processing. so you can set a
       workstation of your own (or use any of the cloud services) and use
       any system locally to access the workstation and run your
       applications.
     * local system is not burdened by the computations
     * new functionalities can be integrated easily


1.1.2 disadvantages of deep learning api   s

     * building an api may not be effective in terms of cost. an api
       requires both time and resources to develop and maintain, which is
       somewhat tedious.
     * you are limited by the internet connection. if you connection fails
       anytime, the whole system breaks down.
     * your application is exposed security wise, as anyone can access it
       easily. here you have to put extra security layers like username
       and password to access the service and limiting how many times you
       can access in a duration

   if you want to know more about what api   s are, check out [100]this blog

   let   s start with our applications!


1.2 colorize photos using deep learning (algorithmia api)

   automated image colorization has been a topic of interest among the
   id161 community. it seems surreal to get a colorful photo of
   a black and white image. imagine a 4-year old picking up a crayon and
   gets engrossed in his coloring book! could we teach an artificial agent
   do the same and just    imagine    stuff?

   of course, this is a hard problem! this is because we as humans get
      trained    each and every day by seeing how things are colored in real
   life. we might not notice but our brain is capturing each moment of our
   lives and extracting meaningful information from it, such as sky is
   blue and grass is green. this is hard to model in an artificial agent.

   a [101]recent study shows that if we train a neural network enough on a
   large number of the especially prepared dataset, we can essentially get
   a model which could    hallucinate    colors in a grayscale image. here   s a
   demonstration of an image colorizer:

   to practically implement this, we use an api developed by
   [102]algorithmia.

   requirements and specifications:
     * python (2 or 3)
     * internet connection (for calling api endpoint)
     * 12 algorithmia credits (although credits are paid, algorithmia
       provides 5000 credits free on signup)


   step 1: register on [103]algorithmia and get your own api key. you can
   find your api key in your profile


   step 2: install algorithmia by typing
pip install algorithmia


   step 3: select a photo you want to colorize and upload it to the data
   folder provided by algorithmia.


   step 4: create a file locally and name it trial1.py . open it and write
   the code as below. notice that you have to insert the location of your
   image in data folder and api key
import algorithmia
 input = {
"image": "data://     " # set location of your own image
}
 client = algorithmia.client(         ) #insert your own api key
 algo = client.algo('deeplearning/colorfulimagecolorization/1.1.5')
 print algo.pipe(input)


   step 5: open command prompt and run your code by typing    python
   trial.py   . the resulting output will be automatically saved in your
   data folder. here   s what i got:

   [input-200x300.jpeg]

   [output-200x300.png]









   that is it     you have just created a simple application which acts as a
   child and can fill in colors in images! exciting stuff.


1.3 building a chatbot (watson api)

   watson is a great example to show what an artificial agent can achieve.
   you may have heard the story of [104]watson beating humans at a
   question and answering game. although watson uses an ensemble of many
   techniques for working, deep learning still is a core part of its
   learning process, especially in natural language processing. here we
   would use one of the many applications of watson, to build a
   conversation service, aka chatbot. a chatbot is an agent that respond
   as humans do on common questions. it can be an excellent point of
   contact to customers and respond to them in a timely manner.

   here we would use one of the many applications of watson, to build a
   conversation service, a.k.a chatbot. a chatbot is an agent that respond
   as humans do on common questions. it can be an excellent point of
   contact to customers and respond to them in a timely manner.

   here   s a [105]demonstration of the platform:

   requirements and specifications:
     * python (2 or 3)
     * internet connection (for calling api endpoint)
     * an active bluemix account (trial period lasts for 30 days)

   let   s see a step-by-step example of how to build a simple chatbot with
   watson.


   step 1: register on [106]bluemix and activate your conservation
   services to get your credentials


   step 2: open terminal and run command as below:
pip install requests responses
pip install --upgrade watson-developer-cloud


   step 3: make a file trial.py and copy the following code in it.
   remember to put your own credentials in it.
import json
from watson_developer_cloud import conversationv1

conversation = conversationv1(
username='your service username',
password='your service password',
version='2016-09-20')

# replace with your own workspace_id
workspace_id = 'your workspace id'

response = conversation.message(workspace_id=workspace_id, message_input={
'text': 'what\'s the weather like?'})
print(json.dumps(response, indent=2))


   step 4: save your file and run it by typing in console    python
   trial.py   . you will get an output in the console which would be the
   response of watson for your input.

     input: show me what   s nearby

     output: i understand you want me to locate an amenity. i can find
     restaurants, gas stations and restrooms nearby.

   if you want to build a full-fledged project of conversation service
   with animated car dashboard (as shown in the above gif), view [107]this
   github repository.

   a chatbot and an application to color images in under a few minutes    
   not bad     


1.4 news aggregator based on sentiment (aylien api)

   sometimes we want to see only the good in the world. how cool would it
   be to filter out all the bad news when reading a newspaper and only see
      good    news!

   with advanced [108]natural language processing techniques (one of which
   is deep learning), this is becoming increasingly possible. you can now
   filter out news by sentiment and present it to the readers.

   we will see and application of this using aylien   s news api. below are
   the screenshots of [109]the demo. you can build your own custom query
   and check out the result for yourself.

   let   s see an implementation of this in python

   requirements and specifications:
     * python (2 or 3)
     * internet connection (for accessing api endpoint)


   step 1: register for an account on [110]aylien website.


   step 2: get api_key and app_id from your profile when you login

   step 3: install aylien news api by going in your terminal and typing
pip install aylien_news_api


   step 4: create a file    trial.py    and copy the following code
import aylien_news_api
from aylien_news_api.rest import apiexception

# configure api key authorization: app_id
aylien_news_api.configuration.api_key['x-aylien-newsapi-application-id'] = ' 3f3
660e6'
# configure api key authorization: app_key
aylien_news_api.configuration.api_key['x-aylien-newsapi-application-key'] = ' ec
d21528850dc3e75a47f53960c839b0'

# create an instance of the api class
api_instance = aylien_news_api.defaultapi()

opts = {
  'title': 'trump',
  'sort_by': 'social_shares_count.facebook',
  'language': ['en'],
  'published_at_start': 'now-7days',
  'published_at_end': 'now',
  'entities_body_links_dbpedia': [
    'http://dbpedia.org/resource/donald_trump',
    'http://dbpedia.org/resource/hillary_rodham_clinton'
  ]
}

try:
    # list stories
    api_response = api_instance.list_stories(**opts)
    print(api_response)
except apiexception as e:
    print("exception when calling defaultapi->list_stories: %s\n" % e)


   step 5: save the file and run it by typing    python trial.py   . the
   output will be a json dump as follows:
{'clusters': [],
'next_page_cursor': 'aojbub0uu3rvcnkgmzqwnze5ntc=',

   woah! i can visualize a chatbot at your service and a service like
   alexa reading you news of your interest now! i am sure, you will be as
   excited about deep learning by now!


2. open source applications

   the best thing that   s helping the research community right now is its
   open source mindset. researchers are ready to share whatever they
   achieved so that deep learning research would grow, and as a result,
   its growing leaps and bounds! here i mention some of the open source
   contributions and their variants which have been created from research
   papers.


2.1.1 advantages of open source applications

     * as the applications are open sourced, you can see each and every
       detail of the application and easily customize them if you want
     * many developers from different organizations and experiences
       collaborate in the application. this makes the application better
       than the original version. also, as many people can use it, it can
       be considered as constantly tested and hence more ready for use.


2.1.2 disadvantages of open source applications

     * there might be less    ownership    in an open-source product, as there
       is no organization backing them. so if they break no one is to
       blame!
     * there are obvious licensing issues included and many companies
       would not prefer to release their projects as    openly   .

   note: for open sourced applications, i would recommend you to go
   through their official repository. this is because some of them are
   still in infancy stage and may break for unknown reasons

   let   s look at some open source applications!


2.2 sentence correction with deep learning

   the systems nowadays can easily detect and correct spelling mistakes,
   but correcting a grammatical error is a bit harder. to improve on this
   a bit, we can use deep learning to correct these sentences for us. this
   repository is an attempt especially for that.

   here   s a sequence predicting neural network was trained on a corpus of
   grammatically wrong sentences along with its corrected counterpart. the
   trained model shows promising results for sentence correction. here   s
   an example below:

   input:    kvothe went to market   
   output:    kvothe went to the market   

   you can check out a demo on the site: [111]http://atpaino.com/dtc.html

   the model still fails to correct all the sentences, but with more
   training data and efficient deep learning algorithms, the results could
   be improved.

   requirements:
     * python (2 or 3)
     * gpu (optionally for faster training)


   step 1: install tensorflow from [112]their official website. also,
   download the repository from github and save it locally from
   [113]https://github.com/atpaino/deep-text-corrector


   step 2: download the dataset ([114]cornell movie-dialogs corpus) and
   extract it in your working directory


   step 3: create the training data by running the command
python preprocessors/preprocess_movie_dialogs.py --raw_data movie_lines.txt \
               --out_file preprocessed_movie_lines.txt

   and create train, validation and test files and save them in the
   current working directory


   step 4: now train the deep learning model by:
python correct_text.py --train_path /movie_dialog_train.txt \
               --val_path /movie_dialog_val.txt \
               --config defaultmoviedialogconfig \
               --data_reader_type moviedialogreader \
               --model_path /movie_dialog_model


   step 5: the model requires some time to train. after training, you can
   test it by:
python correct_text.py --test_path /movie_dialog_test.txt \
               --config defaultmoviedialogconfig \
               --data_reader_type moviedialogreader \
               --model_path /movie_dialog_model \
               --decode


2.3 convert male portraits to female and vice-versa with deep learning

   before i speak anything on the application, just observe the following
   results:

   [example_female_to_male.jpg]

   here the first image is converted into second by a deep learning model!
   this is really a fun application to show what deep learning can do! in
   its core, the application uses gan (generative adversarial network),
   which a type of deep learning which is capable to new examples on its
   own.

   requirements:
     * python (3.5+)
     * tensorflow (r0.12+)
     * gpu (optional for faster training)

   just a warning before you implement this. training a model takes too
   long if you are not using a gpu. even with a high-end gpu (nvidia
   geforce gtx 1080), the training takes 2 hours for one image.


   step 1: download the repository and extract it locally
   [115]https://github.com/david-gpu/deep-makeover


   step 2: download the    align&cropped images    from [116]celeba dataset.
   create a datasets folder by name    dataset    and extract all images in it


   step 3: train the model by:
python3 dm_main.py --run train

   and then test it by passing the image you want to convert
python3 dm_main.py --run id136 image.jpg


2.4 build a deep id23 bot to play flappy bird

   you may have played flappy bird sometime in the past. for those who
   don   t know, it was an extremely addictive android game in which the aim
   was to keep flying the bird in air by avoiding obstacles.

   in this application, a flappy bird bot is created by using advanced
   id23 techniques. here   s a demo of a trained bot.

   [flappy_bird_demp.gif]


   requirements:
     * python (2 or 3)
     * tensorflow (0.7+)
     * pygame
     * opencv-python

   implementing this is easy, as most of the nuts and bolts are included.


   step 1: download the [117]official repository.


   step 2: make sure you have all the dependencies installed. once you
   have, run the command as below.
python deep_q_network.py


3. other notable resources

   we have just scratched the surface of what a deep learning model is
   capable of. there are many research papers being released every day
   which gives rise to many such applications. now it   s a matter of who
   thinks the idea first!

   i   ll list out some of the links and resources which i found worth
   looking at

       great article. also a new generation platforms are coming up which
       allows building deep learning models using gui drag and drop. one
       such example is deepcognition.ai . it could be very useful for the
       beginners.

       thank you so much for this helpful information     
       but why not the developers just put the trained model on the app
       itself so that the user use the app with no need for internet
       connection.

            [178]august 17, 2017 at 4:39 pm
            the trained models are a bit compute heavy, and smaller
            systems like mobile can   t handle it efficiently. so apis are
            preferable over local systems.
