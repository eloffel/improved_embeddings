5 more deep learning applications a beginner can build in minutes (using
python)

   [97]faizan shaikh, february 22, 2017

introduction

   deep learning is fundamentally changing everything around us. a lot
   of people think that you need to be an expert to use power of deep
   learning in your applications. however, that is not the case.

   in my previous article, i discussed [98]6 deep learning
   applications which a beginner can build in minutes. it was
   heart-warming for me to see hundreds of readers getting motivated by
   it. so i thought of following up from my previous article with a few
   more applications of deep learning. if you missed out on my previous
   article, i would suggest you should go through it.

   in this article, we will learn how to build applications like automatic
   image tagging, apparel recommendation, music generation using deep
   learning and many more. and you will be able to build any of these
   applications with in minutes!

   p.s. the article assumes, you know the basics of python. if not, just
   follow [99]this tutorial and then you can start from here again.

   3. other notable resources


1. deep learning applications using existing api

1.1 automatic image tagging (clarifai api)

   image tagging is one of the first applications of deep learning that
   showed breakthrough results. unlike textual data, an image is a lot
   harder to comprehend for a machine. the machine requires a deeper
   understanding of the pixel data. therefore we use image tagging to
   essentially summarize the image and tell us which categories the image
   and its underlying objects belong to.

   that   s why we use image tagging to essentially summarize the image.
   this tells us which categories the image belongs to and what are its
   underlying objects.

   below is an example of predicted tags given to an image which was found
   through deep learning.

   now, let us look at how to build the above tagging feature for every
   image using an api provided by clarifai.

   requirements and specifications
    1. python (2 or 3)
    2. internet connection (for accessing api endpoint)


     * step 1: register on clarifai website and get your own api key. you
       can then find your api credentials on the [100]developer page


     * step 2: install clarifai client for python by going to the terminal
       and typing

pip install clarifai


     * step 3: configure your system with clarifai client

clarifai config

   here,  you will be asked to provide your client id and client secret
   respectively. you can find these on the developer page itself.


     * step 4: now create a file    application.py    and insert the code
       below to tag the image. remember to replace <your_image> in the
       code with the path of the image you want to tag.

from clarifai.rest import clarifaiapp

app = clarifaiapp()
app.tag_files(['<your_image>.jpg'])

   then run the code by
python application.py

   you will get an output as follows
{
    "status": {
      "code": 10000,
      "description": "ok"
    },
    "outputs": [
      {
        "id": "ea68cac87c304b28a8046557062f34a0",
        "status": {
          "code": 10000,
          "description": "ok"
        },
        "input": {
          "id": "ea68cac87c304b28a8046557062f34a0",
          "data": {
            "image": {
              "url": "https://samples.clarifai.com/metro-north.jpg"
            }
          }
        },
        "data": {
          "concepts": [
            {
              "id": "ai_hlmqfqbf",
              "name": "train",
              "app_id": null,
              "value": 0.9989112
            },
...

   this is a json output showing a response of the prediction. here, you
   can find the relevant tags in outputs->data-> concept->name .


1.2 apparels recommender (indico api)

   id126s are becoming a great asset day by day. as the
   number of products is increasing, intelligently targeting specific
   consumers who would be willing to buy the product is essential. deep
   learning can help us in this genre too!

   i am not a fashion buff, but i have seen people    waste    so much time
   choosing which clothes to wear. how great would it be if we could have
   an artificial agent know our preferences and suggest us the perfect
   outfit!

   fortunately, with deep learning this is possible.

   you can find a demo of this application [101]here.

   [shirt3-150x150.jpg]

   the [102]official article describes this in more detail. now let   s find
   out how can you build this recommender system at your end.

   requirements and specifications
    1. python 2
    2. internet connection (for accessing api endpoint)


     * step 1: register on [103]indico website and get your own api key.


     * step 2: install indicoio client for python by going to command
       prompt and typing

pip install indicoio


     * step 3: download the repository from github (here   s [104]the link),
       extract it and go to    matching_clothes    folder.


     * step 4: now in the    main.py    file, insert the code below. remember
       to replace your_api_key with your own which you got in step 1.

import indicoio
from indicoio.custom import collection

indicoio.config.api_key = 'your_api_key'

   and at the end, replace the part    if __name__ ==    __main__       with below
   code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    train = generate_training_data("clothes_match_labeled_data_1.txt")
    collection = collection("clothes_collection_1")

    for sample in tqdm(train):
        print sample
        collection.add_data(sample)
    collection.train()
    collection.wait()

   and run this code by
python main.py

   you will get an output like this
{u'label1': 0.0183739774, u'label2': 0.8100245667, u'label3': 0.1102390038, u'la
bel4': 0.060105865800000005, u'label5': 0.0012565863}

   which shows the id203 of match as shown in the example above.


2. open source deep learning applications

2.1 music generation using deep learning

   music generation is one of the coolest applications of deep learning.
   if this application is used meticulously, it can bring breakthroughs in
   the industry.

   music, just like most of the things in nature, is harmonic. it has
   patterns which our mind catches and makes sense of. these patterns of
   music can be taught to a computer and then can be used to create new
   music rhythms. this is the formula behind music generation.

   [105]this open source application was built keeping in mind this
   concept. below is an example of what it could generate.

   iframe:
   [106]https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fapi
   .soundcloud.com%2ftracks%2f257030102&show_artwork=true&maxwidth=500&max
   height=750

   now let   s look at how we can replicate the results!

   requirements:
    1. python (2 or 3)


     * step 1: install the dependencies

   first, install theano. note that you have to install the bleeding edge
   version of theano, which is required for this. you can find the
   installation instructions [107]here.

   then install keras by the below code
pip install keras

   you would have to change backend of keras from tensorflow to theano.
   follow the instructions given [108]here.

   the final dependency is of music21. for installation, refer [109]this
   link.


     * step 2: now create music by running the below command

python generator.py 128


2.2 detecting    not safe for work    images

   although censorship is indeed a controversial topic, it is still a
   vital component for filtering out offensive adult content from the
   viewers. the inventors of this application focused on filtering out one
   of the main type of nfsw content, identification of pornographic
   images. a score is returned, which shows the intensity of nfsw, which
   can be used to filter out images above a certain threshold.

   below shows the images and their corresponding nfsw score as given by
   the application.

   let   s look at how to build one such application

   requirements:
    1. python 2


     * step 1: install [110]docker in your system and build an image using
       command below

docker build -t caffe:cpu https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bvlc/caffe/master/do
cker/standalone/cpu/dockerfile


     * step 2: download repository from github and extract it (here   s the
       [111]link)


     * step 3: go to your downloaded folder and run the below command in
       terminal. give path of the image you want to analyze.

docker run --volume=$(pwd):/workspace caffe:cpu python ./classify_nsfw.py --mode
l_def nsfw_model/deploy.prototxt --pretrained_model nsfw_model/resnet_50_1by2_ns
fw.caffemodel <your_image>.jpg


2.3 super resolution

   we often see in movies that when you zoom in to an image, you can view
   even the finest detail which can be used to catch a criminal or get a
   crucial evidence.

   iframe:
   [112]https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhf_56sxrgk?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750

   in reality, this is not the case.when you zoom in, the image often gets
   blurry and not much can be seen. to cope up with this (and to make the
   dream a reality), we can use deep learning to increase the resolution
   of an image, which can help us to get clarity on zooming in.

   this application is the depiction of the same. here is its sample
   output.

   now let   s look at how to build this


   requirements
    1. python 3


     * step 1: install [113]docker in your system.


     * step 2: open the .bashrc file and write the below line of code

alias enhance='function ne() { docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/`dirname ${@:$#}`":/ne
/input -it alexjc/neural-enhance ${@:1:$#-1} "input/`basename ${@:$#}`"; }; ne'


     * step 3: now to enhance your image, just insert the name of your
       image in the below code

enhance --zoom=1 --model=repair <your_image>.jpg


3. other notable resources

   deep learning constantly amazes me. with countless applications in the
   making, the race for making use of this technology is becoming rampant
   in the industry. before signing off, i would like to mention some of
   the resources which might be inspirational to you.
