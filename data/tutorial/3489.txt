how to read most commonly used file formats in data science (using python)?

   [97]ankit gupta, march 2, 2017

introduction

   if you have been part of the [98]data science (or any data!) industry,
   you would know the challenge of working with different data types.
   different formats, different compression, different parsing on
   different systems     you could be quickly pulling your hair! oh and i
   have not talked about the unstructured data or semi-structured data
   yet.

   for any data scientist or data engineer, dealing with different formats
   can become a tedious task. in real-world, people rarely get neat
   tabular data. thus, it is mandatory for any data scientist (or a data
   engineer) to be aware of different file formats, common challenges in
   handling them and the best / efficient ways to handle this data in real
   life.

   this article provides common formats a data scientist or a data
   engineer must be aware of. i will first introduce you to different
   common file formats used in the industry. later, we   ll see how to read
   these file formats in [99]python.

   p.s. in rest of this article, i will be referring to a data scientist,
   but the same applies to a data engineer or any data science
   professional.

1. what is a file format?

   a file format is a standard way in which information is encoded for
   storage in a file. first, the file format specifies whether the file is
   a binary or ascii file. second, it shows how the information is
   organized. for example, comma-separated values (csv) file format stores
   tabular data in plain text.

   to identify a file format, you can usually look at the file extension
   to get an idea. for example, a file saved with name    data    in    csv   
   format will appear as    data.csv   . by noticing    .csv    extension we can
   clearly identify that it is a    csv    file and data is stored in a
   tabular format.

   [101][csv.png]


2. why should a data scientist understand different file formats?

   usually, the files you will come across will depend on the application
   you are building. for example, in an image processing system, you need
   image files as input and output. so you will mostly see files in jpeg,
   gif or png format.

   as a data scientist, you need to understand the underlying structure of
   various file formats, their advantages and dis-advantages. unless you
   understand the underlying structure of the data, you will not be able
   to explore it. also, at times you need to make decisions about how to
   store data.

   choosing the optimal file format for storing data can improve the
   performance of your models in data processing.

   now, we will look at the following file formats and how to read them in
   python:
     * comma-separated values
     * xlsx
     * zip
     * plain text (txt)
     * json
     * xml
     * html
     * images
     * hierarchical data format
     * pdf
     * docx
     * mp3
     * mp4


3. different file formats and how to read them in python

3.1 comma-separated values

   comma-separated values file format falls under spreadsheet file format.

what is spreadsheet file format?

   in spreadsheet file format, data is stored in cells. each cell is
   organized in rows and columns. a column in the spreadsheet file can
   have different types. for example, a column can be of string type, a
   date type or an integer type. some of the most popular spreadsheet file
   formats are comma separated values ( csv ), microsoft excel spreadsheet
   ( xls ) and microsoft excel open xml spreadsheet ( xlsx ).

   each line in csv file represents an observation or commonly called a
   record. each record may contain one or more fields which are separated
   by a comma.

   sometimes you may come across files where fields are not separated by
   using a comma but they are separated using tab. this file format is
   known as tsv (tab separated values) file format.

   the below image shows a csv file which is opened in notepad.

   [df_1.png]


   reading the data from csv in python

   let us look at how to read a csv file in python. for loading the data
   you can use the    pandas    library in python.
import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv(   /home/loan_prediction/train.csv   )

   above code will load the train.csv file in dataframe df.


3.2 xlsx files

   xlsx is a microsoft excel open xml file format. it also comes under the
   spreadsheet file format. it is an xml-based file format created by
   microsoft excel. the xlsx format was introduced with microsoft office
   2007.

   in xlsx data is organized under the cells and columns in a sheet. each
   xlsx file may contain one or more sheets. so a workbook can contain
   multiple sheets.

   the below image shows a    xlsx    file which is opened in microsoft excel.

   [df_2.png]

   in above image, you can see that there are multiple sheets present
   (bottom left) in this file, which are customers, employees, invoice,
   order. the image shows the data of only one sheet        invoice   .


   reading the data from xlsx file

   let   s load the data from xlsx file and define the sheet name. for
   loading the data you can use the pandas library in python.
import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_excel(   /home/loan_prediction/train.xlsx   , sheetname =
      invoice   )

   above code will load the sheet    invoice    from    train.xlsx    file in
   dataframe df.


3.3 zip files

   zip format is an archive file format.

what is archive file format?

   in archive file format, you create a file that contains multiple files
   along with metadata. an archive file format is used to collect multiple
   data files together into a single file. this is done for simply
   compressing the files to use less storage space.

   there are many popular computer data archive format for creating
   archive files. zip, rar and tar being the most popular archive file
   format for compressing the data.

   so, a zip file format is a lossless compression format, which means
   that if you compress the multiple files using zip format you can fully
   recover the data after decompressing the zip file. zip file format uses
   many compression algorithms for compressing the documents. you can
   easily identify a zip file by the .zip extension.


   reading a .zip file in python

   you can read a zip file by importing the    zipfile    package. below is
   the python code which can read the    train.csv    file that is inside the
      t.zip   .
import zipfile
archive = zipfile.zipfile('t.zip', 'r')
df = archive.read('train.csv')

   here, i have discussed one of the famous archive format and how to open
   it in python. i am not mentioning other archive formats. if you want to
   read about different archive formats and their comparisons you can
   refer this [102]link.


3.4 plain text (txt) file format

   in plain text file format, everything is written in plain text.
   usually, this text is in unstructured form and there is no meta-data
   associated with it. the txt file format can easily be read by any
   program. but interpreting this is very difficult by a computer program.

   let   s take a simple example of a text file.

   the following example shows text file data that contain text:
   in my previous article, i introduced you to the basics of apache spark, differe
nt data representations
(rdd / dataframe / dataset) and basics of operations (transformation and action)
. we even solved a machine
learning problem from one of our past hackathons. in this article, i will contin
ue from the place i left in
my previous article. i will focus on manipulating rdd in pyspark by applying ope
rations
(transformation and actions).   

   suppose the above text written in a file called text.txt and you want
   to read this so you can refer the below code.
text_file = open("text.txt", "r")
lines = text_file.read()


3.5 json file format

   javascript object notation(json) is a text-based open standard designed
   for exchanging the data over web. json format is used for transmitting
   structured data over the web. the json file format can be easily read
   in any programming language because it is language-independent data
   format.

   let   s take an example of a json file

   the following example shows how a typical json file stores information
   of employees.
{
   "employee": [

      {

         "id":"1",

         "name": "ankit",

         "sal": "1000",

      },
      {

         "id":"2",

         "name": "faizy",

         "sal": "2000",

      }

   ]

}


   reading a json file

   let   s load the data from json file. for loading the data you can use
   the pandas library in python.
import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_json(   /home/kunal/downloads/loan_prediction/train.json   )


3.6 xml file format

   xml is also known as extensible markup language. as the name suggests,
   it is a markup language. it has certain rules for encoding data. xml
   file format is a human-readable and machine-readable file format. xml
   is a self-descriptive language designed for sending information over
   the internet. xml is very similar to html, but has some differences.
   for example, xml does not use predefined tags as html.

   let   s take the simple example of xml file format.

   the following example shows an xml document that contains the
   information of an employee.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<contact-info>

<name>ankit</name>

<company>anlytics vidhya</company>

<phone>+9187654321</phone>

</contact-info>

   the     <?xml version=   1.0   ?>    is  a  xml declaration at the start of the
   file (it is optional). in this deceleration, version specifies the xml
   version and encoding specifies the character encoding used in the
   document. <contact-info> is a tag in this document. each xml-tag needs
   to be closed.


   reading xml in python

   for reading the data from xml file you can import xml.etree.
   elementtree library.

   let   s import an xml file called train and print its root tag.
import xml.etree.elementtree as et
tree = et.parse('/home/sunilray/desktop/2 sigma/train.xml')
root = tree.getroot()
print root.tag


3.7 html files

   html stands for hyper text markup language. it is the standard markup
   language which is used for creating web pages. html is used to describe
   structure of web pages using markup. html tags are same as xml but
   these are predefined. you can easily identify html document subsection
   on basis of tags such as <head> represent the heading of html document.
   <p>    paragraph    paragraph in html. html is not case sensitive.

   the following example shows an html document.
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>page title</title>
</head>
<body><h1>my first heading</h1>
<p>my first paragraph.</p></body>
</html>

   each tag in html is enclosed under the angular bracket(<>).  the
   <!doctype html> tag defines that document is in html format. <html> is
   the root tag of this document.  the <head> element contains heading
   part of this document. the <title>, <body>, <h1>, <p> represent the
   title, body, heading and paragraph respectively in the html document.


   reading the html file

   for reading the html file, you can use beautifulsoup library. please
   refer to this tutorial, which will guide you how to parse html
   documents. [103]beginner   s guide to web scraping in python (using
   beautifulsoup)


3.8 image files

   image files are probably the most fascinating file format used in data
   science. any id161 application is based on image processing.
   so it is necessary to know different image file formats.

   usual image files are 3-dimensional, having rgb values. but, they can
   also be 2-dimensional (grayscale) or 4-dimensional (having intensity)    
   an image consisting of pixels and meta-data associated with it.

   each image consists one or more frames of pixels. and each frame is
   made up of two-dimensional array of pixel values. pixel values can be
   of any intensity.  meta-data associated with an image, can be an image
   type (.png) or pixel dimensions.

   let   s take the example of an image by loading it.
from scipy import misc
f = misc.face()
misc.imsave('face.png', f) # uses the image module (pil)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(f)
plt.show()

   [df_31.png]

   now, let   s check the type of this image and its shape.
type(f) , f.shape
numpy.ndarray,(768, 1024, 3)

   if you want to read about image processing you can refer this article.
   this article will teach you image processing with an example    
   [104]basics of image processing in python


3.9 hierarchical data format (hdf)

   in hierarchical data format ( hdf ), you can store a large amount of
   data easily. it is not only used for storing high volumes or complex
   data but also used for storing small volumes or simple data.

   the advantages of using hdf are as mentioned below:
     * it can be used in every size and type of system
     * it has flexible, efficient storage and fast i/o.
     * many formats support hdf.

   there are multiple hdf formats present. but, hdf5 is the latest version
   which is designed to address some of the limitations of the older hdf
   file formats. hdf5 format has some similarity with  xml. like xml, hdf5
   files are self-describing and allow users to specify complex data
   relationships and dependencies.

   let   s take the example of an hdf5 file format which can be identified
   using .h5 extension.

   [img3.png]

   read the hdf5 file

   you can read the hdf file using pandas. below is the python code can
   load the train.h5 data into the    t   .

   t = pd.read_hdf(   train.h5   )


3.10 pdf file format

   pdf (portable document format) is an incredibly useful format used for
   interpretation and display of text documents along with incorporated
   graphics. a special feature of a pdf file is that it can be secured by
   a password.

   here   s an example of a pdf file.

   [pdf.png]
   reading a pdf file

   on the other hand, reading a pdf format through a program is a complex
   task. although there exists a library which do a good job in parsing
   pdf file, one of them is pdfminer. to read a pdf file through pdfminer,
   you have to:
     * download pdfminer and install it through the [105]website
     * extract pdf file by the following code

pdf2txt.py <pdf_file>.pdf


3.11 docx file format

   microsoft word docx file is another file format which is regularly used
   by organizations for text based data. it has many characteristics, like
   inline addition of tables, images, hyperlinks, etc. which helps in
   making docx an incredibly important file format.

   the advantage of a docx file over a pdf file is that a docx file is
   editable. you can also change a docx file to any other format.

   here   s an example of a docx file:

   [doc.png]

   reading a docx file

   similar to pdf format, python has a community contributed library to
   parse a docx file. it is called python-docx2txt.

   installing this library is easy through pip by:
pip install docx2txt

   to read a docx file in python use the following code:
import docx2txt
text = docx2txt.process("file.docx")


3.12 mp3 file format

   mp3 file format comes under the multimedia file formats. multimedia
   file formats are similar to image file formats, but they happen to be
   one the most complex file formats.

   in multimedia file formats, you can store variety of data such as text
   image, graphical, video and audio data. for example, a multimedia
   format can allow text to be stored as rich text format (rtf) data
   rather than ascii data which is a plain-text format.

   mp3 is one of the most common audio coding formats for digital audio. a
   mp3 file format uses the mpeg-1 (moving picture experts group     1)
   encoding format which is a standard for lossy compression of video and
   audio. in lossy compression, once you have compressed the original
   file, you cannot recover the original data.

   a mp3 file format compresses the quality of audio by filtering out the
   audio which can not be heard by humans. mp3 compression commonly
   achieves 75 to 95% reduction in size, so it saves a lot of space.

   mp3 file format structure

   a mp3 file is made up of several frames. a frame can be further divided
   into a header and data block. we call these sequence of frames an
   elementary stream.

   a header in mp3 usually, identify the beginning of a valid frame and a
   data blocks contain the (compressed) audio information in terms of
   frequencies and amplitudes. if you want to know more about mp3 file
   structure you can refer this [106]link.


   reading the multimedia files in python

   for reading or manipulating the multimedia files in python you can use
   a library called [107]pymedia.


3.13 mp4 file format

   mp4 file format is used to store videos and movies. it
   contains multiple images (called frames), which play in form of a video
   as per a specific time period. there are two methods for interpreting a
   mp4 file. one is a closed entity, in which the whole video is
   considered as a single entity. and other is mosaic of images, where
   each image in the video is considered as a different entity and these
   images are sampled from the video.

   here   s is an example of mp4 video

   [mp4.png]
   reading an mp4 file

   mp4 also has a community built library for reading and editing mp4
   files, called moviepy.

   you can install the library from this [108]link. to read a mp4 video
   clip, in python use the following code.
from moviepy.editor import videofileclip
clip = videofileclip(   <video_file>.mp4   )

   you can then display this in jupyter notebook as below
ipython_display(clip)


end notes

   in this article, i have introduced you to some of the basic file
   formats, which are used by data scientist on a day to day basis. there
   are many file formats i have not covered. good thing is that i don   t
   need to cover all of them in one article.

   i hope you found this article helpful. i would encourage you to explore
   more file formats. good luck! if you still have any difficulty in
   understanding a specific data format, i   d like to interact with you in
   comments. if you have any more doubts or queries feel free to drop in

       hi ankit,
       thanks for a well researched article, it was quite useful. is there
       a repository where i can access the data files (xls, xmls and
       others) used in this example?
       thanks,

       i liked the article. would like to ask if it would be possible to
       update the article with the pros and cons of using json, xml, or a
       database manager to store data. i   m doing an application in python
       and we are debating this very question     which file format is best
       for our needs (as well as we know them anyway).
       my thoughts so far are:
       csv: simple, reliable for a few thousand records, but not suited to
       complex data relationships.
       json: simple to use and read (human), can handle more complex
       relationships, good choice when csv won   t due.
       xml: not as simple, but not difficult. still human readable. can
       work with thousands of records. will handle more complex data like
       accounting (gnucash for example).
       database manager: most complicated solution, takes more work to
       implement, but can work with millions of records. lets user query
       the data to find relationships and present them in an orderly
       manner.
       other thoughts?
