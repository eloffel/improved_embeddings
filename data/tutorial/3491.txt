extracting information from reports using id157 library in
python

   [97]yogesh kulkarni, march 29, 2017

introduction

   many times it is necessary to extract key information from reports,
   articles, papers, etc. for example names of companies     prices from
   financial reports, names of judges     jurisdiction from court judgments,
   account numbers from customer complaints, etc.

   these extractions are part of id111 and are essential in
   converting unstructured data to a structured form which are later used
   for applying analytics/machine learning.

   such entity extraction uses approaches like    lookup   ,    rules    and
      statistical/machine learning   . in    lookup    based approaches, words
   from input documents are searched against pre-defined data dictionary.
   in    rules    based approach, pattern searches are made to find key
   information. whereas in    statistical    approach supervised-unsupervised
   methods are used to extract the information.

      regular expression (regex)    is one of the    rules    based pattern search
   method.


basic syntax

   python supports id157 by the library called    re   (though
   it   s not fully perl-compatible). instead of regular strings, search
   patterns are specified using raw strings    r   , so that backslashes and
   meta characters are not interpreted by python but sent to regex
   directly.

   go through the following table of basic syntax.
   abc      letters                        {m}       m repetitions
   123      digits                         {m,n}     m to n repetitions
   \d     any digit                      *         zero or more repetitions
   \d     any non-digit character        +         one or more repetitions
   .      any character                  ?         optional character
   \.     period                         \s        any whitespace
   [abc]  only a, b, or c                \s        any non-whitespace character
   [^abc] not a, b, nor c                ^   $       starts and ends
   [a-z]  characters a to z              (   )       capture group
   [0-9]  numbers 0 to 9                 (a(bc))   capture sub-group
   \w     any alphanumeric character     (.*)      capture all
   \w     any non-alphanumeric character (abc|def) matches abc or def

   go through the following python sample code for usage of regex.
import re
regex = r"([a-za-z]+) (\d+)"
text = "june 24" match =
re.search(regex, text) if
match:
    #   match.group() or match.group(0) always returns the fully matched string
i.e. "june 24"
print "match: %s" % (match.group(0))
    #   match.group(1) match.group(2), ... will return the capture groups in ord
er
print "month: %s" % (match.group(1)) # "june"     print "day: %s" %
(match.group(2)) # "24" else:
    # if re.search() does not match, then none is returned
print "the regex pattern does not match. :("

   instead of    re.search   , which returns all the exact matches,
      re.findall()    can be used to return all captured groups.    re.sub    is
   used to substitute another pattern as a replacement for the given
   search pattern. for performance reasons, it is recommended to compile
   the pattern first using    re.compile    and then use the regex object for
   searching, as shown below.
regex = re.compile(r"(\w+) lamb")
text = "mary had a little lamb"
result = regex.search(text)

   more information about regex usage in python can be found at [98]regex
   one and in [99]this av article.


use cases

   imagine writing code for searching telephone numbers like
   +91-9890251406 in a document, with multiple variations in format. with
   validations, the code will typically be surely more than 10 lines
   (sample [100]here[101]). but with regex, it   s just about 2/3 of lines
   of code, and with high customizability.

   following are some of the frequently occurring scenarios where regex
   can offer substantial help. please note that the examples shown could
   have alternate ways of getting same results, especially by using meta
   characters such as    /d    for    [0-9]    representing digits. in most of the
   examples, expressive and simplistic patterns are used here just for
   clarity and understandability.

finding email

      ^[a-za-z0-9_\-][102][email protected][a-za-z0-9_\-]+\.[a-za-z0-9_\-]   
   [103][email protected]
      @\w+.\w+    domain within email


finding telephone number

      ([0-9]{3}-){2}[0-9]{4}[^0-9]*$             xxx-xxx-xxxx
      ([0-9]{3}.){2}[0-9]{4}[^0-9]*$             xxx.xxx.xxxx
      [0-9]{10}[^0-9]*$                          xxxxxxxxxx
      \\([0-9]{3}\\)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}[^0-9]*$     (xxx)xxx-xxxx


   the first two cases differ only in    -   or    .     and thus can combined
   using    (-|\.)   

   a sample code for more elaborate phone number is as follows:
phoneregex = re.compile(r'''(
    (\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?                       # area code
    (\s|-|\.)?                                     # separator
    (\d{3})                                           # first 3 digits
    (\s|-|\.)                                        # separator
    (\d{4})                                           # last 4 digits
    (\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*(\d{2,5}))?  # extension
    )''', re.verbose)


finding date

      \d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}    xx-xx-xxxx without checking digits
      ([2-9]|1[0-2]?)-[0-3][1-9]-[1-2][9|0][0-9]{2}[^0-9]*$    xx-xx-xxxx with
   stricter usage
      ([2-9]|1[0-2]?)/[0-3][1-9]/[1-2][9|0][0-9]{2}    xx/xx/xxxx
      [1-2][9|0][0-9]{2}/([2-9]|1[0-2]?)/[0-3][1-9]    xxxx/xx/xx


   the date pattern used above are only numeric. there are other usages
   such as    27-mar-1973    or    27 march 1973   . i would leave this as an open
   quiz and would want the panelist to think about their regex patterns!!


finding account /credit card number

      ([0-9]{4}-){3}[0-9]{4}    xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
      [0-9]{16}                 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


adding linked information

   citations in search papers or judgments have pre-defined formats and
   they refer to an external document. it is possible to append the
   hyperlink information by replacing the citation text.

   for example, us legal judgments citation looks like    17 u.s.c.    107   .
   the pattern is : text    u.s.c.   , another space, a    mark, another space,
   a set of numbers, and optionally, a year inside a parenthetical. it can
   be replaced with a    <a href    /a>    hyper link to actual judgment it
   refers to.

   tools for development, testing and debugging

   although regex is powerful but it can get complicated for non-trivial
   tasks. more challenging it would be if you must understand (and debug)
   regex by someone else!

   there are quite a few friendly utilities which help in development and
   testing of regex. try [104]regex 101[105]. it gives facility to put
   your own text and try regex pattern.

   here is one sample text to try on phone number, account number, date
   patterns, mentioned before.
   +919890251406 01110100 555.867.5309 01101000

   9890251406 1.4142135623 01101001 27/3/1973 987-01-6661

   01110011 202.555.9355 00100000 01101001 91-020-25898963

   912025898963 3.1415926535897932384626433832795 666-

   12-4895 01100001 202-555-9355 27-03-1973 00100000

   01101000 (555) 867-5309 27-mar-1973 2.718281828459 555-

   867-5309 01100101 01110011 01110011 555/867-5309

   sites like [106]regexper give visual representation of the regex search
   pattern for better understanding. refer to the below visualization for
   phoneregex search pattern mentioned earlier, used for phone numbers.

   once regex gives acceptable matches, the pattern can be used in
   programs. after good enough practice one can directly code the search
   patterns in the program itself.

   all the regex patterns used here, with some minor modifications, can be
   used in programming language like python, perl, java, etc. it can also
   be used in some of the popular text editors for find-replace
   functionality, like microsoft word (keep    use wildcard    option on),
   openoffice and in ides like pycharm. read the comprehensive information
   about regex [107]here[108].


end note

   regex is a versatile, portable and powerful way of extracting key
   information from textual data. mastery over it can help automate many
   mundane tasks. although, at times, it can get complicated and hard to
   develop-debug but owing to its immense capabilities it has become a
   must weapon in every programmer   s armour, especially for text analytics
   data scientists.

   let me conclude by giving a food for thought: can regex be used to
   solve a crossword puzzle?

       your regex can   t find some usual emails: [130][email protected]
       [131][email protected] [132][email protected].0.1 there are also
       less usual but valid emails     some examples in wikipedia
       ([133]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/email_address#examples)
       but there can be so many unusual and valid emails so there is no
       universal regex which can find all of them :/

       nice article. but there is a bug in phone regex.
       phoneregex.search(   (123)123456-7890   ) would match, which is wrong.
       also email doesn   t accept this type email    a@c.d   , which it should.
