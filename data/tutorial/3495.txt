why are gpus necessary for training deep learning models?

   [97]faizan shaikh, may 18, 2017

introduction

   most of you would have heard exciting stuff happening using deep
   learning. you would have also heard that deep learning requires a lot
   of hardware. i have seen people training a simple deep learning model
   for days on their laptops (typically without gpus) which leads to an
   impression that deep learning requires big systems to run execute.

   however, this is only partly true and this creates a myth around deep
   learning which creates a roadblock for beginners. numerous people have
   asked me as to what kind of hardware would be better for doing deep
   learning. with this article, i hope to answer them.

   note: i assume that you have fundamental knowledge of deep learning
   concepts. if not, you should go through [98]this article.

fact #101: deep learning requires [del: a lot of :del] hardware

   when i first got introduced with deep learning, i thought that deep
   learning necessarily needs large datacenter to run on, and    deep
   learning experts    would sit in their control rooms to operate these
   systems.

   [inside_suite.jpg]

   this is because every book that i referred or every talk that i heard,
   the author or speaker always say that deep learning requires a lot of
   computational power to run on. but when i built my first deep learning
   model on my meager machine, i felt relieved! i don   t have to take over
   google to be a deep learning expert     

   this is a common misconception that every beginner faces when diving
   into deep learning. although, it is true that deep learning needs
   considerable hardware to run efficiently, you don   t need it to be
   infinite to do your task. you can even run deep learning models on your
   laptop!

   just a small disclaimer; the smaller your system, more is the time you
   will need to get a trained model which performs good enough. you may
   basically look like this:


   let   s just ask ourselves a simple question; why do we need more
   hardware for deep learning?

   the answer is simple, deep learning is an algorithm     a software
   construct. we define an id158 in our favorite
   programming language which would then be converted into a set of
   commands that run on the computer.

   if you would have to guess which components of neural network do you
   think would require intense hardware resource, what would be your
   answer?

   a few candidates from top of my mind are:
     * preprocessing input data
     * training the deep learning model
     * storing the trained deep learning model
     * deployment of the model

   among all these, training the deep learning model is the most intensive
   task. lets see in detail why is this so.


training a deep learning model

   when you train a deep learning model, two main operations are
   performed:
     * forward pass
     * backward pass

   in forward pass, input is passed through the neural network and after
   processing the input, an output is generated. whereas in backward pass,
   we update the weights of neural network on the basis of error we get in
   forward pass.

   both of these operations are essentially id127s. a
   simple id127 can be represented by the image below

   here, we can see that each element in one row of first array is
   multiplied with one column of second array. so in a neural network, we
   can consider first array as input to the neural network, and the second
   array can be considered as weights of the network.

   this seems to be a simple task. now just to give you a sense of what
   kind of scale deep learning     vgg16 (a convolutional neural network of
   16 hidden layers which is frequently used in deep learning
   applications) has ~140 million parameters; aka weights and biases. now
   think of all the id127s you would have to do to pass
   just one input to this network! it would take years to train this kind
   of systems if we take traditional approaches.


how to train your neural net faster?

   we saw that the computationally intensive part of neural network is
   made up of multiple id127s. so how can we make it
   faster?

   we can simply do this by doing all the operations at the same time
   instead of doing it one after the other. this is in a nutshell why we
   use gpu (graphics processing units) instead of a cpu (central
   processing unit) for training a neural network.

   to give you a bit of an intuition, we go back to history when we proved
   gpus were better than cpus for the task.

   before the boom of deep learning, google had a extremely powerful
   system to do their processing, which they had specially built for
   training huge nets. this system was monstrous and was of $5 billion
   total cost, with multiple clusters of cpus.

   now researchers at stanford built the same system in terms of
   computation to train their deep nets using gpu. and guess what; they
   reduced the costs to just $33k ! this system was built using gpus, and
   it gave the same processing power as google   s system. pretty impressive
   right?


                   google              stanford
   number of cores 1k cpus = 16k cores 3gpus = 18k cores
   cost            $5b                 $33k
   training time   week                week

   we can see that gpus rule. but what exactly is the difference between a
   cpu and a gpu?


difference between cpu and gpu

   to understand the difference, we take a classic analogy which explains
   the difference intuitively.

   suppose you have to transfer goods from one place to the other. you
   have an option to choose between a ferrari and a freight truck.

   ferrari would be extremely fast and would help you transfer a batch of
   goods in no time. but the amount of goods you can carry is small, and
   usage of fuel would be very high.

   a freight truck would be slow and would take a lot of time to transfer
   goods. but the amount of goods it can carry is larger in comparison to
   ferrari. also, it is more fuel efficient so usage is lower.

   so which would you chose for your work?

   obviously, you would first see what the task is; if you have to pick up
   your girlfriend urgently, you would definitely choose a ferrari over a
   freight truck. but if you are moving your home, you would use a freight
   truck to transfer the furniture.

   here   s how you would technically differentiate the two:

   here   s another video which would make your concept even clearer.

   note: gpu is mostly used for gaming and doing complex simulations.
   these tasks and mainly graphics computations, and so gpu is graphics
   processing unit. if gpu is used for non-graphical processing, they are
   termed as gpgpus     general purpose graphics processing unit


brief history of gpus     how did we reach here

   now, you might be asking this question that why are gpus so much rage
   right now. let us travel through a brief history of development of gpus

   basically a gpgpu is a parallel programming setup involving gpus & cpus
   which can process & analyze data in a similar way to image or other
   graphic form. gpgpus were created for better and more general graphic
   processing, but were later found to fit scientific computing well. this
   is because most of the graphic processing involves applying operations
   on large matrices.

   the use of gpgpus for scientific computing started some time back in
   2001 with implementation of id127. one of the first
   common algorithm to be implemented on gpu in faster manner was lu
   factorization in 2005. but, at this time researchers had to code every
   algorithm on a gpu and had to understand low level graphic processing.

   in 2006, nvidia came out with a high level language cuda, which helps
   you write programs from graphic processors in a high level language.
   this was probably one of the most significant change in they way
   researchers interacted with gpus


which gpu to use today?

   here i will quickly give a few know-hows before you go on to buy a gpu
   for deep learning.

   scenario 1:

   the first thing you should determine is what kind of resource does your
   tasks require. if your tasks are going to be small or can fit in
   complex sequential processing, you don   t need a big system to work on.
   you could even skip the use of gpus altogether. so, if you are planning
   to work mainly on    other    ml areas / algorithms, you don   t necessarily
   need a gpu.


   scenario 2:

   if your task is a bit intensive, and has a handle-able data, a
   reasonable gpu would be a better choice for you. i generally use my
   laptop to work on toy problems, which has a slightly out of date gpu (a
   2gb nvidia gt 740m). having a laptop with gpu helps me run things
   wherever i go. there are a few high end (and expectedly heavy) laptops
   with nvidia gtx 1080 (a 8 gb vram) which you can check out at the
   extreme.


   scenario 3:

   if you are regularly working on complex problems or are a company which
   leverages deep learning, you would probably be better off building a
   deep learning system or use a cloud service like aws or floydhub. we at
   analytics vidhya built a deep learning system for ourselves, for which
   we shared our specifications. here   s [101]the article.


   scenario 4:

   if you are google, you probably need another datacenter to sustain!
   jokes aside, if your task is of a bigger scale than usual, and you have
   enough pocket money to cover up the costs; you can opt for a gpu
   cluster and do multi-gpu computing. there are also some options which
   may be available in the near future     like tpus and faster fpgas, which
   would make your life easier.


the future looks exciting

   as mentioned above, there is a lot of research and active work
   happening to think of ways to accelerate computing. google is expected
   to come out with tensorflow processing units (tpus) later this year,
   which promises an acceleration over and above current gpus.

   similarly intel is working on creating faster fpgas, which may provide
   higher flexibility in coming days. in addition, the offerings from
   cloud service providers (e.g. aws) is also increasing. we will see each
   of them emerge in coming months.

       additionally i am using my laptop for dl learning purpose which
       does not have gpu..!
       for learning the concept and trying things     like keras with
       theano, you don   t need gpu.. yes some warnings will popup but still
       you can ahead and execute your code/module and learn..

       good article. i wanted to know if gpus are useful only for deep
       learnings or they can be useful for other modeling techniques such
       as simple regression, or gbm/xgboost, randomforest etc.
       also, if i have a gpu on my laptop, what do i need to do in my code
       to utilise the gpu. for eg, suppose i have a randomforest code in r
       with me and now i want to run the code using gpu for this. what
       kind of changes, if any would i need to make in my code?

            thanks akrsrivastava!
            practically speaking, any algorithm which can be parallelized
            can be run on gpus. for example, you can have a id79
            implemented on gpu. on the flipside, that implementation has
            to be written in a specific language that can be compiled by
            gpu. most of the libraries abstract this, and give an api like
            interface for you to run your code on.
            take an example of tensorflow     so tensorflow for gpu has been
            written to be compatible with nvcc, which is a compiler for
            nvidia gpu. when you write code, the interface seems similar
            to what you would see for a cpu code, but in the backend the
            actual code generated is very different for both.
            simply speaking, use a library in r/python which can run
            algorithms on gpu

            although there are efforts for supporting other gpu vendors
            for deep learning, they are still not as developed as the
            libraries for nvidia. so answer your question, yes you can use

            i would still prefer gpu   s. just consider the scale what gpu
            can give you. an nvidia titanx has 3072 cores whereas a
            general intel i7 has 4 cores. so you would need at least 250
            i7 machines to match the power (considering that one i7 core
            is more powerful than one gpu core)

          we at analytics vidhya built a deep learning system for ourselves   
       so basically yes, you do need large compute resources to train
       anything but trivial training and test cases     
       this is my real worry, that the next generation of ml will only be
       available to those who own, or have access to the data, and the
       resources to wield significant compute to that data. the ml wave
       will generate a bigger digital divide between the powerful, and
       those unable to afford those compute resources. back to the old
          mainframe    days.

            hi! interesting insights but i beg to differ. as the
            requirements increase so the cost of resources will decrease.
            after all, the producers would want that their consumers to
            purchase right? consider this, in the older days, personal
            computer was a big thing and not all could afford. and then
            mobiles came, which now acts as a proxy for pc with almost the
            same compute.

       hi! you mentioned aws and floydhub as potential solutions for fast
       training or training more complex models. at goodailab, we are
       building a platform called tensorport that basically gives you best
       of both worlds. aws is a pain to setup, and floydhub has limited
       capabilities when it comes to scaling to more than one instance /
       distributed computing.
       we can deploy a cluster of gpu machines in second, without any
       infra setup, but we still have a very user friendly and intuitive
       interface. check it out: [163]http://www.tensorport.com

       can nvidia quadro m2000 graphics cards be used for deep learning?
       if yes, how will be the performance?

            hi, i suppose it can be used. i personally use a 2gb nvidia
            gtx 720, and its ok for smaller toy projects. but i prefer
            jumping on to 12gb nvidia titax x of av for serious
            experiments

       does higher cpu cores or frequency matters? if so, which is more
       important?

            well that will depend upon the kind of dataset you are working
            on. if you have a bigger amount of dataset, you should
            definitely make a switch to gpus
