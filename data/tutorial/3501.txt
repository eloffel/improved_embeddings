readme.md

   extraction and pre-processing of summarization datasets from the new
   york times annotated corpus ([69]ldc2008t19).

installation

   this library was developed and tested under python 3.4. feel free to
   send me errors or pull requests for extending compatibility to earlier
   versions of python.

   we depend on [70]nltk for first-pass sentence splitting and [71]spacy
   for verb detection via part-of-speech tagging.
$ pip3 install nltk
$ pip3 install spacy

usage

   the typical flow for constructing a summarization dataset consists of:
     * reading the compressed nyt corpus on disk and caching documents
       with the required topics and summaries in a [72]shelf. this is
       skipped if the shelf already exists.
     * filtering these documents as per summary properties like length and
       degree of extractiveness and pre-processing them to resolve errors
       and artifacts.
     * splitting the filtered dataset into a train/dev/test partition and
       caching it for further experimentation.

   this flow is illustrated in main.py with all relevant parameters
   exposed as command-line arguments. to get started, run:
main.py --help
