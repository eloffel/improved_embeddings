neural image captioning (nic)

   neural image captioning implementation with keras based on [71]show and
   tell.

   [72]alt tag

instructions

   to train from zero using the iapr2012 dataset:
     * download iapr2012 dataset from [73]here
     * move the downloaded file to the datasets/iapr_2012/ directory
     * untar the file:

     tar xvf iaprtc12.tgz

extract/download image features

to extract:

     * edit the file train.py by changing the flag extract_image_features
       to true.

to download:

     * download the image features:
     * download the extracted image features from [74]here
     * move them do datasets/iapr_2012/preprocessed_data/ directory
     * start training by running the script

     python3 train.py

notes

     * extracting the image features might take 1-2 hours in a gtx860m.
     * training 50 epochs should give you reasonable results.
     * i will provide pre-trained models in coco soon (hopefully)

     *    2019 github, inc.
