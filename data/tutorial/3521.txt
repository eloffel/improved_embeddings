   fair         advancing the field of machine intelligence

   facebook artificial intelligence researchers (fair) seek to understand
   and develop systems with human level intelligence by advancing the
   longer-term academic problems surrounding ai.

   fair research covers the full spectrum of topics related to ai, and to
   deriving knowledge from data: theory, algorithms, applications,
   software infrastructure and hardware infrastructure.

introduction

   the idea of intelligent machines has fascinated people for centuries.
   and while it may seem like something out of science fiction, people
   today use artificial intelligence every day in their smartphones,
   houses, cars and more. it   s becoming more and more prevalent in our
   world.

   at facebook, ai is used for translation of text between languages, to
   describe images for visually impaired people, and more.

   in the below video, facebook   s ai research head, yann lecun, explains
   some of the key concepts that make all of this possible and why you
   should care.

machine learning

   can you tell the difference between a car and a dog? that   s probably
   easy for you, but it   s very complex to teach computers how. the process
   is called machine learning, and with the right algorithms we can train
   a computer to recognize objects in images. check out this video to
   learn how it works         right down to the pixels.

   artificial intelligence is all about math. for example: gradient
   descent is a mathematical technique used while training a computer. by
   calculating how every adjustment in the training will affect the
   accuracy of the final result, we can teach computers to distinguish
   between objects in images (like a car and a dog) with lower levels of
   error. this video explains how.

deep learning

   when you look at a dog, you immediately know it   s a dog. but computers
   work differently. to understand an image, intelligent machines need to
   complete several steps, or    layers    of processing to identify all the
   features that make up the whole. this is deep learning. watch this
   video for a window into how computers    think.

back propagation

   with deep learning, a computer performs several layers of processing in
   order to identify objects in an image. as this happens, it   s important
   to know how each layer of processing specifically affects the end
   result. an algorithm called back propagation makes this possible.

convolutional neural networks

   in an image, the same object can appear in many different
   positions         for example, a dog can be lying down or standing up,
   jumping or facing backward. this makes it very difficult for a computer
   to recognize a dog in all its possible forms. to do so, we use
   convolutional neural networks         a way of structuring a deep learning
   system inspired by the architecture of the human brain. with multiple
   detectors that each recognize a specific part of the dog, computers can
   better recognize that object. this also works for text recognition,
   speech understanding, and is part of many self-driving cars.

what is learnable?

   ai also addresses one of the central questions that we as humans
   grapple with: what is intelligence? philosophers and scientists have
   struggled with this question for ages. the answer is elusive and
   mysterious, yet this central attribute makes us uniquely human.

   concurrently, ai also prompts the large philosophical and theoretical
   question: what is learnable? and since mathematical theorems tell us
   that a single learning machine cannot learn all possible tasks
   efficiently, we also get a sense of what cannot possibly be learned
   regardless of how much resources you throw at it.

   in this way, ai machines are very much like us. we don   t always excel
   at being general learning machines. our human brains are incredibly
   specialized, despite their apparent adaptability. still current ai
   systems are very far from having the seemingly general intelligence
   that humans possess.

   in ai, we generally think about three types of learning:
     * id23         this is focused on the problem of how an
       agent ought to act in order to maximize its rewards, and it   s
       inspired by behaviorist psychology. in a particular situation, the
       machine picks an action or a sequence of actions, and gets a
       reward. this is frequently used when teaching machines to play and
       win games, like chess, backgammon, go, or simple video games. one
       issue is that in its purest form, id23 requires
       an extremely large number of trials to learn even simple tasks.
     * supervised learning         essentially, we tell the machine what the
       correct answer is for a particular input: here is the image of a
       car, the correct answer is    car.    it is called supervised learning
       because the process of an algorithm learning from the labeled
       training dataset is similar to showing a picture book to a young
       child. the adult knows the correct answer and the child makes
       predictions based on previous examples. this is the most common
       technique for training neural networks and other machine learning
       architectures. an example might be: given the descriptions of a
       large number of houses in your town together with their prices, try
       to predict the selling price of your own home.
     * unsupervised learning / predictive learning         much of what humans
       and animals learn, they learn it in the first hours, days, months,
       and years of their lives in an unsupervised manner: we learn how
       the world works by observing it and seeing the result of our
       actions. no one is here to tell us the name and function of every
       object we perceive. we learn very basic concepts, like the fact
       that the world is three-dimensional, that objects don   t disappear
       spontaneously, that objects that are not supported fall. we do not
       know how to do this with machines at the moment, at least not at
       the level that humans and animals can. our lack of ai technique for
       unsupervised or predictive learning is one of the factors that
       limits the progress of ai at the moment.

   these approaches are often used in ai, but there are many problems that
   are inherently difficult for any computing device. this is why even if
   we build machines with super-human intelligence, they will still have
   limited abilities. they may beat us at chess, but not be smart enough
   to get in out of the rain.

jobs of the future

   as ai, machine learning, and intelligent robots become more pervasive,
   there will be new jobs in manufacturing, training, sales, maintenance,
   and fleet management of these robots. ai and robots will enable the
   creation of new services that are difficult to imagine today. but it   s
   clear that health care and transportation will be among the first
   industries to be completely transformed by it.

   for young people, just sorting out their career goals, ai offers a
   wealth of opportunities. so how do we prepare for jobs that don   t yet
   exist?

   if you   re a student:
     * math and physics classes are where one learns the basic methods for
       ai, machine learning, data science, and many of the jobs of the
       future. take all the math class you can possibly take, including
       calc i, calc ii, calc iii, id202, id203, and
       statistics. computer science, too, is essential; you   ll need to
       learn how to program. engineering, economics, and neuroscience are
       also helpful. you may also want to consider some areas of
       philosophy, such as epistemology, which is the study of what is
       knowledge, what is a scientific theory, and what does it mean to
       learn.
     * the goal in these classes is not simple rote memorization. students
       must learn how to turn data into knowledge. this includes basic
       statistics, but also how to collect and analyze data, be aware of
       possible biases, and to be alert to techniques to prevent
       self-delusion through biased data manipulation.
     * find a professor in your school who can help you make your ideas
       concrete. if their time is limited, you can also look toward senior
       phd students or postdocs to work with.
     * apply to phd programs. forget about the    ranking    of the school for
       now. find a reputable professor who works on topics that you are
       interested in, or pick a person whose papers you like or admire.
       apply to several phd programs in the schools of these professors
       and mention in your letter that you   d like to work with that
       professor, but would be open to work with others.
     * engage with an ai-related problem you are passionate about. start
       reading the literature on the problem and try to think about it
       differently than what was done before. before you graduate, try to
       write a paper about your research or release a piece of open source
       code.
     * apply for industry-focused internships to get hands-on experience
       on how ai works in practice.

   you can get a broad idea of what deep learning is about by going
   through tutorial lectures that are available online. there are plenty
   of online materials, tutorials, and courses on machine learning,
   including udacity or coursera lectures.

the future

   increasingly, human intellectual activities will be performed in
   conjunction with intelligent machines. our intelligence is what makes
   us human, and ai is an extension of that quality.

   on the way to building truly intelligent machines, we are discovering
   new theories, new principles, new methods, and new algorithms that have
   applications and will improve our everyday life today, tomorrow, and
   next year.

   fair   s long term goal is to understand intelligence and build
   intelligent machines. that   s not merely a technology challenge, it   s a
   scientific question. what is intelligence, and how can we reproduce it
   in machines? ultimately, that quest is humanity   s quest. the answers to
   these questions will help us not just build intelligent machines, but
   develop keener insight into how the mysterious human mind and brain
   work. hopefully, it   ll also help us all better understand what it means
   to be human.
