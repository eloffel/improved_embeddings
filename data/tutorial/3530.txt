naked tensor

   this is a bare bones example of tensorflow, a machine learning package
   published by google. you will not find a simpler introduction to it.

   in each example, a straight line is fit to some data. values for the
   slope and y-intercept of the line that best fit the data are determined
   using id119. if you do not know about id119,
   check out the [80]wikipedia page.

   [81]alt text

   after creating the required variables, the error between the data and
   the line is defined. the definition of the error is plugged into the
   optimizer. tensorflow is then started and the optimizer is repeatedly
   called. this iteratively fits the line to the data by minimizing the
   error.

   read the scripts in this order:
     * serial.py
     * tensor.py
     * bigdata.py

serial.py

   the purpose of this script is to illustrate the nuts and bolts of a
   tensorflow model. the script makes it easy to understand how the model
   is put together. the error between the data and the line is defined
   using a for loop. because of the way the error is defined, the
   calculation runs in serial.

tensor.py

   this script goes a step farther than serial.py although it actually
   requires fewer lines of code. the outline of the code is the same as
   before except this time the error is defined using tensor operations.
   because tensors are used, the code can run in parallel.

   you see, each point of data is treated as being independent and
   identically sampled. because each point of data is assumed to be
   independent, the calculations are too. when you use tensors, each point
   of data is run on separate computing cores. there are 8 points of data,
   so if you have a computer with eight cores it should run almost eight
   times faster.

bigdata.py

   you are one buzzword away from being a professional. instead of fitting
   a line to just eight datapoints, we will now fit a line to 8-million
   datapoints. welcome to big data.

   there are two major changes in the code. the first is bookkeeping.
   because of all the data, the error must be defined using placeholders
   instead of actual data. later in the code, the data is fed through the
   placeholders. the second change is that because we have so much data,
   only a sample of data is fed into the model at any given time. each
   time an operation of id119 is called, a new sample of data
   is fed into the model. by sampling the dataset, tensorflow never has to
   deal with the entire dataset at once. this works surprisingly well and
   there is [82]theory that says it is okay to do this. there are a few
   conditions that the theory says are important, like the step size must
   decrease with each iteration. for now, who cares! it works.

conclusion

   as you worked through the scripts, you hopefully saw how the error can
   be anything you wanted it to be. it could be the error between a set of
   images and a convolutional neural network. it could be the error
   between classical music and a recurrent neural network. let your
   imagination run wild. once the error is defined, you can use tensorflow
   to try and minimize it.

   that's it. hopefully you found this tutorial enlightening.
