grokking deep learning

anyone can learn to code and understand deep learning

   posted by iamtrask on august 17, 2016

   if you passed high school math and can hack around in python, i want to
   teach you deep learning.

   edit: 50% coupon code: "mltrask" (expires august 26)

   i've decided to write a [5]deep learning book in the same style as my
   blog, teaching deep learning from an intuitive perspective, all in
   python, using only numpy. i wanted to make the lowest possible barrier
   to entry to learn deep learning.

   here's what you need to know:
       high school math (basic algebra)
       python... the basics

   the problem with most entry level deep learning resources these days is
   that they either assume advanced knowledge of calculus, id202,
   differential equations, and perhaps even id76, or they
   just teach a "black box" framework like torch, keras, or tensorflow
   (where you just hit "train" but you don't actually know what's going on
   under the hood). both have their appropriate audience, but i don't
   believe that either are appropriate for your average python hacker
   looking for a 101 on the fundamentals.

   my solution is to teach deep learning from an intuitive standpoint,
   just like i've done in the other posts on this blog. everything you
   need to know to understand deep learning will be explained like you
   would to a 5 year old, including the bits and pieces of id202
   and calculus that are necessary. you'll learn how neural networks work,
   and how to use them to classify images, understand language (including
   machine translation), and even play games.

   at the time of writing, i think that this is the only deep learning
   resource that is taught this way. i hope you enjoy it.

   who this book is not for: people who would rather be taught using
   formulas. individuals with advanced mathematical backgrounds should
   choose another resource. this book is for an introduction to deep
   learning. it's about lowering the barrier to entry.
