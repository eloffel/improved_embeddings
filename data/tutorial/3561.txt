   if you read [15]the first article in this series, you   re already on
   your way to upping your math game. maybe some of those funny little
   symbols are starting to make sense.

   also be sure to check out [16]parts 3, [17]4, [18]5, [19]6 and [20]7.

   but here   s another dirty little secret nobody tells you about ai:

     you don   t actually need that much math to get started.

   if you   re a developer or sys-admin you probably already use a lot of
   libraries and frameworks that you know little about. you don   t have to
   understand the inner workings of web-scraping to use [21]curl. the same
   is true with ai. there are number of frameworks and projects that make
   it easy to get going fast without needing a data science phd.

   don   t get me wrong. the math helps you feel confident about what   s
   going on behind the scenes. it allows you to read research papers and
   advanced books like ian goodfellow   s [22]deep learning without your
   eyes glazing over. so keep studying the books i gave you in the last
   article. but if you want to start using ai, you can do that today.

   let   s get started with some practical projects.
   [1*ib1_anm-rqkm9we4eaz30g.jpeg]

   my approach to learning is very similar to the excellent approach
   outlined in [23]the first twenty hours. we all know the 10,000 hour
   rule. to truly master a skill you need to put in a lot of time. but
   we   re not there yet. we   re just getting started. right now we   re trying
   to get from    this sucks    to    this is so much fun!   

   the basics of the approach are simple:
     * pick a project.
     * get past self-crippling beliefs.
     * try lots of stuff and fail fast.
     * practice.

   easy, right? so let   s go!

pick a project

   first off, you need a project that will really motivate you to get out
   of your comfort zone.
   [1*rsd5lqygvih0yzpsjmiayw.png]

   how does [24]a project with a prize of one million dollars and a chance
   to make an impact on lung cancer research sound?

   kaggle is the place for machine learning. right now they   re hosting a
   contest with a $1 million purse to improve classification of lung
   cancer lesions. anyone can enter, including you.

   now i know what you   re thinking. there   s no chance that i win this.
   this is a contest for heavy hitters. glad you brought that up, because
   that brings us to step two:

get over self-crippling beliefs

   the most important step in learning anything new is to shut down that
   little voice of self-doubt in your head as fast as possible. the first
   twenty hours advocates removing distractions, practicing on the clock
   and a number of other techniques. throw in meditation, affirmations or
   heavy drinking. whatever works. just do whatever it takes to get that
   voice to go away so you can focus. if you need a self-help book to get
   over the hump, try [25]you are a badass, a fun, funny, sarcastic
   masterpiece!
   [1*kcut1ti85g0mrawcvy2olw.jpeg]

   here   s the deal: you do suck right now. but that   s ok! you won   t for
   long.

   feeling confused and frustrated is always the first stage of learning.
   so rather than beating yourself up, see it as a sign that you   re on the
   right track. you   re learning something awesome!

   you probably won   t win the competition, but so what? focus on getting a
   competent entry submitted before the deadline. not everyone can win a
   marathon, but finishing one is a hell of an accomplishment in and of
   itself, right?

   and you know what? you just might win. seriously.

   as an amateur you   re not burdened by years of theory and ideas that
   weigh down the professionals. just remember the story about [26]the
   student who solved two unsolvable math problems after finding them on
   the blackboard and mistaking them for homework assignments. the truth
   is data science is more art than science. it   s a field that attracts
   polymaths with all kinds of eclectic backgrounds. so get in there and
   try stuff.

   who knows what will happen?

   maybe you   ll see something the experts missed, make a real impact on
   cancer detection and take home some serious money to boot!

try lots of stuff and fail fast

   if you   re a dev-ops guy, you know this mantra. it applies to learning
   too. what i do is grab a bunch of samples of books and start skimming
   them quickly to see which ones make the most sense to me. each person
   has a different style, so some books will work for one person and not
   another. pick the one that works best for you.
   [1*pgbyzlqqgrf7ll83x0hhwq.jpeg]

   there are a few books on machine learning out there, like [27]real
   world machine learning. unfortunately, because the field is so new,
   most of the books are just starting to come out this year. you can
   pre-order [28]deep learning: a practitioners approach or [29]hands-on
   machine learning with scikit-learn and tensorflow.

   but you don   t have to wait. let me introduce you to my friend
   [30]safari books online. for forty bucks a month you can read as many
   books as you want and you get access to books in progress before
   they   re released, including the two listed above.

   i   m going to save you some time though. right now it   s totally
   unnecessary to learn how to code deep learning systems from scratch in
   python, r, or java. you need tools to get you rolling with deep
   learning fast so you can start working on your contest entry.

   you want [31]keras with either [32]tensorflow or [33]theano.
   [1*lbjjmgofnj_6vetddyaviq.jpeg]

   you don   t even need to set it up yourself. grab [34]this sweet
   all-in-one deep learning docker image.

   frankly, it doesn   t matter whether you use tensorflow or theano.
   they   re basically engines for running machine learning. at this point
   in your education, both are equal, so pick one.

   keras is a library of machine learning frameworks created by a top
   notch google ai researcher. i had the good fortune of meeting the
   creator of keras this weekend, [35]francois chollet. he described keras
   as the key to    democratizing ai.    he said that    deep learning is mature
   but it   s not yet widely disseminated   you don   t have to be an ai
   researcher to use keras.    instead you can just start playing around
   with all kinds of state of the art algorithms right away.

   if you   ve already got a mac or linux rig with a good nvidia graphics
   card you   re good to go. if you don   t, considering picking up an
   alienware. i recommend the mid-range [36]aurora series. you don   t need
   a kick-ass processor. you need an ssd, a secondary spinning disk to
   dump data to, 16   64gb of memory and the best nvidia card(s) you can
   afford. focus all your cash on the cards, as they really accelerate
   deep learning. you   ll need to reformat it with linux and get the latest
   binary drivers. unfortunately, the open source ones won   t cut it for
   the latest chipsets. they   ll likely boot to a black screen. [37]fix
   that like this.

   there are also [38]some tutorials [39]out there for building your own
   rig if you   re a do-it-yourselfer. also, i just added [40]my own
   tutorial in part three!

   lastly, you can use the [41]aws, [42]google or [43]azure cloud, but gpu
   compute in the cloud can get expensive quick. better to buy than lease
   until you know what you   re doing.

practice

   now you   re ready to get started. here   s [44]a super-simple example for
   getting started with keras.

   you are going to need an approach to the competition. once again, i   m
   going to save you some time.

   the most effective method of tagging and studying images at the moment
   is known as a [45]convolutional neural net (id98). google, facebook,
   pinterest, and amazon all use them for image processing and tagging.
   you might as well start with the best-practice, right?
   [1*hz4qadyaupyf1ztbg7kusg.jpeg]

   in fact, if you head over the competition itself, [46]get the data set,
   and [47]check out the tutorial, you   ll see that it walks you through
   slicing and dicing the images and using a id98 with keras and tensorflow
   backend. voila!

   frankly, you could do a lot worse than just implementing the tutorial
   and messing around with the parameters for a few weeks to see what you
   get.

   after that get crazy. throw different parameters and algorithms at it.
   experiment and have fun. maybe you   ll stumble across something the
   experts missed!

   if you   re ready to try something more advanced after that, there are
   some great posts on [48]the kaggle data science bowl 2017 board. turns
   out data scientists are not above sharing some of their secret sauce.
   [49]check out this one, which helps you start exploring the data, which
   is a series of anonymized ct scans.

   [50]this one is more advanced and currently the most popular post on
   the board for good reason. it helps you do    pre-processing,    which is
   basically scrubbing and massaging the data to make it easier for neural
   nets to deal with more fluidly. it actually turns the 2d images into 3d
   images! super cool!

   frankly, if you type out all this code yourself and get it running,
   you   re already kicking serious ass. this approach to programming is
   called    the hard way,    i.e., just type in the code without thinking
   about it until you understand it. there is even [51]a series of books
   on python and other languages that take this approach to learning, and
   it may work for you.

   one warning: someone posted a perfect score in the competition already.
   he did it in a clever way, [52]by studying the leader boards and
   effectively doubling his training set size. it   s perfectly legal, but
   it won   t really help your goal, which is to learn about how to run
   neural nets against a training set for a good cause. i   d skip this
   approach for now, and focus on running keras against the ct scans.

   that   s it! with any luck you   ll help redefine cancer research and take
   home some cash too. not a bad day   s work.

   but even if you don   t win, you   ll be well on your way to learning how
   to use ai in the real world.

   whatever happens, remember to have fun!

   missed them:
