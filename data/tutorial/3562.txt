   if you   re like me, you   re fascinated with ai.

   maybe you   d love to dig deeper and get an image recognition program
   running in [15]tensorflow or [16]theano? perhaps you   re a kick-ass
   developer or systems architect and you know computers incredibly well
   but there   s just one little problem:

   you suck at math.

   that   s all right! i share your dirty little secret and i have some
   books and websites that will really help you get rolling fast.

   like many folks, my love of intelligent machines didn   t come from
   calculus class. it sprang from science fiction. i remember reading
   [17]   i, robot    one beautiful summer evening and imagining ways to trip
   up asimov   s [18]three rules of robotics. as i watched masterpieces like
   [19]2001: a space odyssey and [20]ghost in the shell, it seemed that
   any day a [21]gestalt consciousness might surge up from the glittering
   sea of information and declare itself sentient. when i grew up and
   started publishing [22]my own sci-fi i imagined ai as a pervasive,
   ambient force that   s always there, like electricity, touching every
   aspect of life.

   turns out, we have a few things to figure out before general ai can pop
   from the primordial digital goo. mostly nothing ever came of the early
   ai promises in the 80   s and 90   s. hype never lived up to reality and
   [23]ai winter followed ai winter.

   all that changed in the last few years with the sudden success of
   [24]deep learning.

   maybe you saw the story in the new york times that showed how
   [25]google transformed its translation services [26]almost overnight
   delivering accuracy that rivaled professional translators? in a mere
   nine months they outpaced what the platform managed in the seven
   previous years combined.

   perhaps you read about [27]the kid who built a self-driving car in his
   freaking garage with open source tools? you might have also seen this
   amazing slide below that shows how dl ripped through the [28]id163
   image recognition competition in just a few years, dropping the error
   rate from 25% to something that performs better than humans in 2017.
   [1*lf6nwh79jpp6lrja4jyusq.jpeg]

   no matter how you cut it, ai solves big, intractable problems that have
   eluded us for decades. we know how to drive a car yet we can   t tell
   machines how to do it. but we can let machines figure it out for
   themselves. for once a technology coming out of silicon valley is not
   just hype. it   s real. ai is hot for good reasons.

   top ai researchers are [29]earning more than nfl starting quarterbacks
   and you want to get in on the gold rush. then again, you probably saw
   [30]the big scary stories that ai will eat all the jobs and as a
   traditional software engineer or sys-admin you want to make sure you
   have the skills to compete in an ai-centric world. no problem. there
   are tons of tutorials out there. you just have to get started, right?

   then you get to a passage like the one below in [31]ian goodfellow   s
   seminal deep learning book and you have no idea what he is talking
   about at all.
   [1*w7bm0cdehohvbuztrgumxq.jpeg]

   uh-oh.

   the problem is you have to understand a nested layer of logic, terms,
   symbols and ideas that are all interrelated but you have no foundation
   for any of it. so it basically sounds like an alien language. you
   probably understand all the text leading up to it but the rest is just
   gibberish. it can turn really disheartening fast.

   but have no fear! all is not lost.

   i   m here to help you wade through the swamp with some books that will
   get you crunching numbers like a savant. all right, well maybe you
   won   t be [32]daniel tammet, but you can put aside those painful
   memories of times-table memorization and get cranking. you can learn
   math as an adult.

   i   ve tried to read a number of ai texts and tutorials. i understand the
   concepts intuitively. they make perfect sense to me. it   s just that
   when i see a string of symbols my brain glazes over and i have no idea
   what i   m reading. as a systems architect for much of my life i didn   t
   need much math. there are ip subnet cheat sheets and as long as i knew
   how far electricity could reasonably travel along the length of cables
   i could cut them and crimp them appropriately. for most of my life, i
   needed to understand how systems get setup, how they work together and
   how they stay running. systems administration is very boolean. it
   either works or it doesn   t. but ai and math works on a different side
   of the brain.

   what i needed were some primers written for adults that treat you like
   one. i also want books that answer questions about why math works. in
   school, your reason for learning was probably    shut up and do it or
   else.    but as an adult you need more. you want to know how things work
   too.
   [1*8r0poygjyzff9oirohvpsa.jpeg]

   the very first book you need is [33]mathematics: a very short
   introduction by timothy gowers.

   this book breaks down the    why    of math beautifully. it relates the
   subject to the real world, gets into the philosophy and then quickly
   leaves the philosophy behind because you don   t really need to
   understand whether fractions actually exist in nature or at the
   platonic level. instead, timothy helped me understand that math is an
   abstraction layer. it breaks problems down into simpler, cleaner steps.
   the complexity of working out a model that precisely simulates particle
   interaction in a box would need to take into account an insane amount
   of real world physics properties like magnetic interference, gravity,
   the force of the collision, the particles initial direction and speed
   as well as much, much more. it turns out life is a complex series of
   algorithms. but here   s the trick. in practice you don   t need a perfect
   model. instead, math looks to break the problem down into its essential
   components. what are the critical factors? math gives you a general
   abstraction of the problem that can work with other problem sets as
   well. in essence, the numbers themselves don   t matter all that much.
   they are just variables. math boils down to variables and rules. you
   can learn those variables and rules!
   [1*coanbwz-zkgnk0jifk0xwa.jpeg]

   while you   re reading the book you will want to have [34]this website   s
   handy dandy guide to the major math symbols. you can also pick up
   [35]this super concise guide for engineers called mathematical notation
   by edward r. scheinerman. if you   re like me, you   ll have to see these
   symbols hundreds of times before they stick. you may find yourself
   forgetting various symbols the second you turn the page! not to worry.
   this cheat sheet is perfect. take a deep breath, slow down and go
   through the symbols one by one until you start to understand that
   string of crazy looking glyphs. even if you have to look up every
   symbol a thousand times do it! there are no shortcuts to learning in
   life. you just have to do the work.

   now there are two other strong contenders for getting your math
   foundation built. the first is [36]mathematics for the nonmathemetician
   by morris kline. the second is the [37]no bullshit guide to math and
   physics by ivan savov. each appeals to a different mindset. i prefer
   the very short intro because it gets down to brass tacks quickly and
   still manages to stay very relate-able. the    math for
   nonmathematicians    book is much longer and goes into more detail about
   the history of math and how it works in the world. some people will
   really enjoy that approach. the    no bullshit guide    is quick and gets
   right into the equations fast with no answer as to why anything works
   the way it does. it   s basically a primer on the rules. that will appeal
   to folks who have less of a philosophical bent.
   [1*ketxkhzaptzkse0wfevopa.jpeg]

   the next book you will want is [38]algebra unplugged by jim loats and
   kenn amdahl. now there are a few typos in the book but i don   t find
   them all that distracting. i appreciate the book   s approach to gentle
   learning that quickly accelerates. some people get worked into a lather
   over typos but you   ve got bigger challenges to worry about. you   re
   trying to learn math when your brain isn   t quite as plastic as it once
   was in your youth! so let the typos go and see the big picture here.
   this book will really help you get moving in the right direction.

   after you   ve got the math down you   ll want to dig into [39]make your
   own neural network by tariq rashid. it also has some typos, but there
   is a [40]great github repo with updates that fixes most of them. this
   book is incredibly gentle and intuitive. it seems to anticipate your
   objections and fears the second you have them! the author is uncanny in
   how he spots your resistance as it happens. the book walks through only
   the math you need for neural networks specifically. it then works
   through python, assuming you know nothing about programming. finally it
   gets you coding your own neural network from scratch. now while there
   are certainly tools out there that will work better for professional
   programs, it helps to try your hand at your own first, so you
   understand the basics.
   [1*jmp2sn0agrv6ofhsq52yww.jpeg]

   after that book, you   ll want to start browsing the web. there are
   awesome new tutorials coming out every single day. maybe check out
   [41]tensorflow for poets or [42]recurrent neural networks for artists.

   medium itself is awesome for learning about ai. for example, check out
   [43]this article on a roundup of various classes you can take to get
   deeper than you could on your own. then again, maybe you   re not the
   class taking type and prefer to work through things yourself? no
   problem. instead, check out [44]this eight part series from ai
   researcher arthur juliani. there is also this one called [45]machine
   learning is fun, another great series right here on your favorite site.

   lastly, you may want to move on to a more advanced book, confident in
   your ability to understand more challenging concepts. that book is the
   one i already mentioned earlier, [46]ian goodfellow   s deep learning
   book, which you can read online or [47]grab yourself a hard copy on
   amazon.

   that   s all for now. feel free to add your own books in the comments.
   everyone learns a little differently and there are bound to be other
   books worth sharing.
