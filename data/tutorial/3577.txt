   not really, but this article is definitely the most mathematically
   involved we   ve got on ayoai so far :)

     __________________________________________________________________

     this is the sixth entry in my [17]journey to extend my knowledge of
     artificial intelligence in the year of 2016. learn more about my
     motives in this [18]introduction post.

     this blog post assumes sound knowledge of the id28
     algorithm. you can learn more about said algorithm in my [19]first
     blog post.
     __________________________________________________________________

   it   s been a while since my last article (work), but with summer
   approaching lenny and i are going full speed, so expect articles on
   interesting machine learning algorithms (eg. recurrent and
   convolutional neural networks), our recent work with using machine
   learning to analyze fmri scans, and new research papers from
   institution/companies like google   s [20]deepmind we are going to learn
   about at our trip to [21]icml 2016 next month. keep your eyes peeled
   for some more philosophical write-ups on ai, too!

   keep your eyes peeled!

   today i want to build on my very first article about logistic
   regression. in particular, i want to discuss the
   statistical/probabilistic interpretation of id28, which
   i felt was missing from explanations and lectures provided by certain
   online courses like andrew ng   s machine learning one (which is still
   wonderful). i will discuss the intuition behind the id28
   model formulated in the previous [22]article.

   update: the work presented in this article was part of my submission
   for my school mathematics coursework. since i submitted it, and don   t
   want to be caught plagiarizing myself (heh), i   ve replaced the rest of
   the article with images of each page in the pdf. you can skip the intro
   and the conclusion + visualization through programming.

   once i get my ib results         around july         i   ll put the post back up.
