     this is the seventh entry in my [16]journey to extend my knowledge
     of artificial intelligence in the year of 2016. learn more about my
     motives in this [17]introduction post.

     today we take a detour from computer science and mathematical
     algorithms to explore ideas philosophical issues and ideas regarding
     artificial intelligence. hope you enjoy!

   adapted from my ib philosophy coursework submission on the same topic.

   artificial intelligence, in its recent and historical developments, has
   never failed to challenge our understanding of the human
   condition   especially the nature of our mind. the problem of the mind
   and body, a branch/sub-topic in philosophy, is a prime example. that
   is, how are our minds (y   know, that thing we use to think and feel)
   relate to our bodies (the physical part of us). it almost intuitively
   seems that these are two and separate but affect each other in a causal
   relationship. we just seem to have this private, intangible part of us
   and this public, physical part.

   yet, though intuitive, as a very popular belief of many historical
   philosophers, we can   t be sure if this is true nowadays with
   progression in science   specifically that of machine learning. machine
   learning is a sub-field in artificial intelligence that deals with the
   number-crunching code and algorithms that make a computer learn and act
   on acquired knowledge. the most recent compelling example is alphago, a
   machine learning program created by deepmind (a startup acquired by
   google/alphabet) that won in a match against world champ lee sedol in
   go   a chinese board game.

   go is not your regular board game, though. chess was pretty easy for
   a.i. to master; a simple tree search would suffice because the game has
   a limited number of moves. but go? it   s a bit different; think
   trillions of moves. and it   s not just the vast number of possibilities
   that makes go immensely difficult for computers, it   s the level of
   high-order abstract thinking (and even imagination and intuition) that
   makes it difficult for people as well. sometimes the most effective
   plays/moves in go are the ones which require a lot of advanced planning
   and aren   t obvious when looking at the board. put simply, it   s
   definitely known to be one of the hardest games to get good at. sorry,
   chess!

   so with all this being said   with this level of intuition, abstract
   thinking, and mental capacity required   it might suffice to say: one
   would need a mind to play the game of go. lee sedol has a mind
   (presumably, we   ll even question the validity of this claim later on.)
   more importantly, though, we want to know: can a.i. have minds? if they
   can play the game of go, does that mean they have some sort of mental
   process that we can call a mind?

   well, it obviously depends on how we define the    mind    and define its
   relationship to the body. that   s right   can you articulate what exactly
   that comfortable and familiar private mode of thought you have actually
   is and where it exists? is it physical (just like the code of alphago)?
   non-physical?

   by exploring how we define the mind in the context of alphago and this
   artificial intelligence case study, we in turn also question what it
   means to be human, and the nature of the human condition.

   intimidating stuff

   alphago vs. lee sedol, march 2016
   [19]https://www.google.com/search?q=alphago+lee+sedol&espv=2&biw=1440&b
   ih=778&site=webhp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&ved=0ahukewifknq54zdnahwboi

   7prxm6m%3a

   let   s start with the most intuitive (i would think) approach for
   defining the mind. such an approach states that there are, in a sense,
   two separate dimensions that make up our person. one such dimension is
   physical, and the other is non-physical. the physical dimension is, of
   course, our body   not just our hands, legs, and arms but also our brain.
   that   s right, we assert that the brain does not influence our mental
   states and thought process. very anti-science, but you may see the
   justification for it soon. our non-physical or intangible dimension is
   where these mental states/thought process/emotions instead do
   occur   which is the mind. we thus say that the mind and body are
   separate.

   it is said that, though separate, the mind and body can interact with
   each other. we see evidence of this in lee sedol, in fact. when
   battling against an opponent, he uses his the mind to decide where the
   stone (game piece) should go. said mind induces an action in the body
   to actually move the stone from one location extended in space-time to
   a different location extended in space-time. when lee sedol loses the
   match   which has to first register/observe through his sensory
   capabilities   emotions such as dismay are invoked in his mind.

   so, this notion is called    dualism    (pretty aptly titled). ren  
   descartes, one of the most famous philosophers in the 17th century,
   created his own theory of dualism   a very popular one today   called
      cartesian dualism   .

     i think therefore i am         descartes, one of the most famous
     philosophy quotes

   cartesian dualism, like regular dualism, states that the mind and body
   are separate substances that have a mutually causal relationship.
   descartes has a more concrete definition of the two, though. he states
   that the mind exists on a separate plane (that is, not the same
   plane/realm of reality that the world is in) that is immaterial, not
   affected by any laws of physics, and private to the person. the body is
   obviously the opposite of this.

   descartes was extremely religious. all of his theories really center
   around this, including cartesian dualism. descartes believed that
   humans were the only creatures in the universe to have minds, with
   other animals being confined to solely the physical realm. this is
   supposedly because (and this claim is clearly subject to criticism) god
   chose it to be that way. do remember, however, that this was the 17th
   century and every philosopher must be evaluated in context of the
   beliefs/scientific development/thinking of their era. don   t get me
   wrong   he was definitely a smart guy. does    cartesian    ring a bell to
   you in any other field aside from philosophy? if you guessed
   mathematics, you   re right! descartes invented the cartesian plane.

   descartes would obviously ridicule the notion that alphago might have a
   mind. to him, alphago is nothing but a bunch of lines of computer
   programming instructions, which is really just physical (ultimately
   everything on your computer is stored on your memory/storage as a
   physical representation).
   [1*pnsn6vzse300neha-gyybq.jpeg]
   ren   descartes, a famous and brilliant philosopher (and
   mathematician!)   
   [20]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/frans_hals_-_po
   rtret_van_ren%c3%a9_descartes.jpg

   i sincerely believe that descartes    ability to prosper in philosophy
   was severely handicapped by these religious constraints he needed to
   introduce. because, once you probe deeper, you start to notice some
   really gaping holes in cartesian dualism.

   first of all, if all animals and alphago alike are purely physical
   beings without minds awarded by some arbitrary god (apologies for the
   loaded rhetoric!), what stops humans from being the same? or, what
   stops the others from also having minds? perhaps our mental states are
   just more advanced than, for example, a gorilla   s, just like a
   gorilla   s is more advanced than an ant   s. our more powerful mental
   faculties cannot and do not imply that we have a completely different
   makeup to other creatures in the universe.

   the scientific evidence is, of course, not present to support any of
   the claims about an intangible mind existing. with that being said,
   it   s not like we can scientifically observe anything that lies outside
   of our physical realm. either way, the claim is unsubstantiated.

   this actually isn   t the biggest flaw, though. something that descartes
   (and almost every dualist out there to be frank) fails to logically
   assert is how the mind and the body can affect each other and interact.
   if the mind is on a separate    plane    than the body   one being physical
   and the other being non-physical   how is it possible for this to occur?
   when lee sedol   s mind is forming the strategy of where to move the next
   stone, how does it enable his hand and the atomic makeup of his hand to
   actually move it? remember that, in a non-physical realm there would
   be: no laws of physics, no momentum, and no quantities that relate to
   the functioning of our world at all. so how is this possible? i have no
   idea. but let   s see what descartes says.

   descartes points to the    pineal gland   . this gland is an interface for
   the mind to work with the body and the body to work with the mind   it   s
   a real gland in our brain! yet, there is obviously no evidence that
   this interface exists. the pineal gland serves a completely separate
   purpose in the brain and i   m not even sure, to be honest, how descartes
   came to choose it for his theory.

   ok, let   s continue attacking some of descartes claims      perhaps his
   weakest argument is the logic he proposes for the mind and the body
   being two separate substances. he does this through the following
   deduction:

     1. the mind is more important than the body is to us

     2. leibniz law is a valid principle in logic that states if object a
     has a single different property to object b, then a     b

   now:

     substitute a for the mind and b for the body. the different property
     a and b have is their importances to us.

   therefore:

     the mind and the body are not equal.

   this actually commits a fallacy called the    masked man fallacy   , which
   is an invalid use of leibniz law. let me demonstrate this through
   another example. let   s say that a masked man has recently robbed a
   bank, and some people are speculating that it is your friend bob
   (doesn   t matter if you don   t have a friend named bob, just imagine!)
   with the same logic descartes uses, we can quickly    conclude    that bob
   must not be the masked man:

     premise 1: i know who bob is.

     premise 2: i do not know who the masked man is

     conclusion: therefore, bob is not the masked man.

     the premises may be true and the conclusion false if bob is the
     masked man and the speaker does not know that. thus the argument is
     a fallacious one.

      [21]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masked-man_fallacy

   yeah, i don   t think so.

   anyways, time to move on from dualism. it really does seem that the
   main issue is this whole notion of the mind and immaterial, so why not
   just focus on the body and physical realm?

   for that, we turn to eliminative materialism. for many of the computer
   scientists reading, you   ll finally find some sanity in this whole
   philosophy thing      eliminative materialism is very scientific, but
   perhaps   as you   ll soon find out   painstakingly so. with materialism, we
   introduce nothing new, unfamiliar, or unfounded (such as a mind) in
   terms of science. yes, though we often throw around the term    mind   
   when referring to our internal mode of thought, we really are just
   referring to the brain. because, y   know, let   s not forget that the
   brain is where all of our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, disposition,
   etc. is scientifically supposed to originate first.

   here   s the issue though   in doing this, we acknowledge that what is
   mental is just physical. if you can concede that our mind is really
   just physical then you   re perfectly okay with that. but are you okay
   with its implications? if all of our thoughts, emotions, beliefs,
   disposition, etc. is from the brain, then they are simply the product
   of a biochemical machine. that   s right   the brain is an organ (i
   think!). it is controlled, ultimately, by the atoms (and thus
   quarks/leptons) that make it up and any sort of reactions that occur.
   because, in our physical universe, everything that occurs has to be the
   result of something that occurred before it (the law of causality.)
   when we think, is that just a bunch of chemical reactions and
   electrical impulses going crazy? does that mean that our beliefs are
   not really ours (as in, our persona) but the cooperation of a bunch of
   atomic particles? because of causality, is everything we do and stand
   for pre-determined?

   yes. if we conform to eliminative materialism, then we start to quickly
   realize that everything about us just reduces (thus    eliminates   ) to
   the thinks that make us! as a result, we lack any sort of free will or
   agency. lee sedol   s mastery of go and his emotions after a shocking
   loss are just the result of neurons, axons, cortices, etc. lee sedol,
   and every other human out there, is no different to alphago; both of us
   are purely physical beings. alphago has a digital machine powering it,
   and i have a biochemical machine powering it. in this case, it just so
   happens that my biochemical machine   through many many years of
   evolution   is more complex than the digital machine, which we have
   designed in a short amount of time. for this reason, alphago seemingly
   has less agency than we do.

   that   s the kind of definition of personhood and the human condition
   that pure scientific reasoning gives you. it makes life meaningless,
   and our innovations like alphago equally so. although it really does
   seem like we have free will, materialists state that the brain creates
   a very compelling illusion through its years of evolution.

   maybe they   re not wrong; maybe we just have to accept this absurdity.
   oh man.

   science has constantly disproved folk theories over the years; one such
   example is the flat earth belief (which some lunatics still think is
   true). maybe the notion of the mind is just another one that will be
   even more concretely shut down with advancements in neuroscience.

   but, maybe not. the implications of eliminative materialism cannot be
   considered a weaknesses   they   re something we just have to deal with.
   that doesn   t stop us, however, from finding weaknesses in it!

   the greatest weakness of any materialist theory is the failure to
   explain qualia. qualia is the subjective experiences of every day
   actions and perceptions. listening to music is equivalent to the
   transfer of sound waves from a wire to your eardrums (i   m pretty sure).
   but, to me         and maybe to you as well         it   s so much more than that;
   it   s places, atmospheres, moments, and just in general the subjective
   experience of listening to music. if these sensory events reduce to
   purely mechanical, replicable actions, how can this uniquely intangible
   experience emerge? materialists have not figured out a way to address
   qualia, with famous philosopher paul churchland even outright denying
   it. the inability to fit the qualia is perhaps one of the biggest flaws
   in any mind-body theory.
   [1*gz6yav-bh_gx51fjaljleg.png]
   qualia!

      emerge       i like that word. this might be a good segue to our next
   theory (and my favorite one at that): emergentism! emergentism states
   that, instead of a mind and a body being distinct substances that
   originate separately, the mind emerges from the body.

   for this emergence to occur, there are basic constraints that have to
   be satisfied; for example, the brain or heart is needed to facilitate
   this emergence, but lee sedol   s legs aren   t. that   s for a human. for a
   computer, we could suggest that the cpu and algorithm are examples of
   the basic constraints.

   the substance that emerges is always greater in complexity and
   abstraction than the collective individual parts that make it up. when
   we pair a biochemical machine and an organ together, we get   
   consciousness, speech, and a disposition! we get lee sedol! when we
   pair a computer processor and running code together, we get alphago
   similarly. emergent properties are the properties of the emergent
   substance that do not exist in the individual parts (like consciousness
   or free will). alphago is not able to achieve either of these, but this
   can be attributed to its less advanced makeup. our progression in
   artificial intelligence over 70+ or so years can   t compensate for the
   billions of years of human evolution.

   with this being said, lee sedol and alphago do actually have one
   similar (but not equal) individual part: neural networks. neural
   networks   literally deep, complex networks of neurons and
   neurotransmitters   is supposedly how our nervous system, most of our
   sensory perception capabilities, and even thought process (maybe?)
   works. a digital implementation of neural networks (called    artificial
   neural networks   ) is how most advanced machine learning and artificial
   intelligence programs like alphago work.
   [1*hkmjxhe1vv9ldn9l2uadhg.jpeg]
   [24]http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/neural-net-he
   ad.jpg

   it may be suggested, in fact, that neural networks could be the most
   fundamental constraint for the emergence of minds. how? scientific
   evidence!

   researchers at mit university, around 16 years ago, hypothesized that
   neural networks were the basis of mental faculties. people used to
   believe that the brain was a large volume of separate instructions that
   coordinated together to power us humans. however, when said researchers
   found that animal brains could learn to adapt to changes   they could use
   the auditory cortex to see after signals were redirected as such   neural
   networks were denoted as the    one learning algorithm   . without neural
   networks it   s questionable if we could still have a lot of faculties
   like language, thought, and autonomy. this hypothesis has continued to
   stay prominent with the development of programs like alphago that used
   digital implementations of neural networks
   [1*lfwafhbt9rlnkgkbergdna.gif]
   artificial neural
   networks         [25]http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/net.gif

   the mind emerging from the fundamental requirement of neural networks
   is known as    connectionism   . there   s a lot that we don   t know yet about
   connectionism, and this mostly stems from the fact that we don   t have a
   complete comprehension of neural networks either. also, artificial
   neural networks are tiny compared to real ones; think tens of thousands
   of neurons for something like alphago compared to trillions for a human
   like lee sedol. this discrepancy could be a reason for the emergent
   mind and emergent properties not being equal (in terms of the actual
   substance and complexity) between humans/lee sedol and alphago. maybe,
   once we start to introduce much deeper and more complex artificial
   neural networks we could achieve mild forms of consciousness. a bit of
   a jump here, but a cool thought nonetheless. of course, there   s a
   massive difference between tens of thousands and trillions. either way,
   it is strange that, though alphago does not have some of the faculties
   we do, it is better in some areas (highlighted by beating lee sedol in
   the match) than we are. i wonder if this demonstrates some sort of
   misunderstanding in the development of digital neural networks.

   connectionism and the whole mind body conundrum are very thought
   provoking. i hope that, in this article, you not just learned about the
   potential nature of artificial intelligence but more importantly    the
   nature of us! this is useful knowledge to have, not just because it
   makes you question what you are but more importantly because we are on
   the brink (perhaps within 50+ years) of developing superintelligence
   and after that maybe even artificial general intelligence. these
   philosophical issues are only going to get more relevant, and it   s
   important that we start to dip our toes in.

   the day artificial intelligence obtains consciousness, i   ll be sitting
   here saying:    told ya so!
