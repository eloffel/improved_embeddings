queryreformulator

   a query reformulation framework based on deep id23.
     * [75]paper: task-oriented query reformulation with reinforcement
       learning
     * [76]slides

dataset and other files

   the datasets and auxiliary files can be [77]downloaded here. they are
   under bsd 3 license.
     * msa_dataset.hdf5: ms academic dataset: a query is the title of a
       paper and the ground-truth documents are the papers cited within.
     * msa_corpus.hdf5: ms academic corpus: each document consists of a
       paper title and abstract.
     * jeopardy_dataset.hdf5: jeopardy dataset: queries are jeopardy! tv
       show questions and answers are the wikipedia articles whose title
       is the answer.
     * jeopardy_corpus.hdf5: jeopardy corpus: all the english wikipedia
       articles (5.9m documents).
     * trec-car_dataset.hdf5: [78]trec-car dataset: a query is wikipedia
       article title + a section within that article. ground-truth
       documents are paragraphs within that section.
     * trec-car_corpus.hdf5: trec-car corpus: half of the english
       wikipedia paragraphs, except abstracts.
     * d_cbow_pdw_8b_norm.pkl: a python dictionary containing 374,000
       pretrained id27s from the [79]id97 tool.

accessing the dataset

   the datasets are stored in the hdf5 format.

   we provide wrapper classes to access them: dataset_hdf5.py and
   corpus_hdf5.py

   the queries and documents can be accessed using the python code below
   (h5py package is required):
#get training, validation and test lists of queries and relevant documents:

import dataset_hdf5
dt = dataset_hdf5.datasethdf5('path/to/the/dataset.hdf5')

queries_train, queries_valid, queries_test = dt.get_queries()
doc_titles_train, doc_titles_valid, doc_titles_test = dt.get_doc_ids()


# iterate over all documents in the corpus:

import corpus_hdf5
cp = corpus_hdf5.corpushdf5('path/to/the/corpus.hdf5')

for i, text in enumerate(cp.get_text_iter()):
    print 'text:', text
    print 'title:', cp.get_article_title(i)

running the model

   after changing the properties in the parameters.py file to point to
   your local paths, the model can be trained using the following command:
theano_flags='floatx=float32' python run.py

   if you want to use a gpu:
theano_flags='floatx=float32,device=gpu0' python run.py

training times

   each minibatch iteration should take approximately 1 second on a k80
   gpu. it should take 800,000 iterations (7-10 days) to reach a recall@40
   of 47.6% in the trec-car dataset. it is normal that the model starts to
   select terms only after iteration 50,000.

dependencies

   to run the code, you will need:
     * python 2.7
     * [80]numpy
     * [81]scikit learn
     * [82]theano 0.9
     * [83]nltk
     * [84]h5py
     * [85]pylucene 6.2 or higher

   we recommend that you have at least 32gb of ram. if you are going to
   use a gpu, the card must have at least 6gb.

   note: if you are using theano 1.0 you will probably see a
   "nulltypegraderror". switching back to theano 0.9 fixes this problem.
