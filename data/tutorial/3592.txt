description

   from interactions between friends, colleagues, or political leaders to
   the activities of corporate or government organizations, complex social
   processes underlie almost all human endeavor. the emerging field of
   computational social science is concerned with the development of new
   mathematical models and computational tools for understanding and
   reasoning about such processes from noisy, missing, or uncertain
   information. computational social science is an inherently
   interdisciplinary area, situated at the intersection of computer
   science, statistics, and the social sciences, with researchers from
   traditionally disparate backgrounds working together to answer
   questions arising in sociology, political science, economics, public
   policy, journalism, and beyond. in the first half of this tutorial, i
   will provide an overview of computational social science, emphasizing
   recent research that moves beyond the study of small-scale, static
   snapshots of networks, and onto nuanced, data-driven analyses of the
   structure, content, and dynamics of large-scale social processes. i
   will focus on commonalities of these social processes, as well as
   differences between the types of modeling tasks typically prioritized
   by computer scientists and social scientists. i will then discuss
   bayesian latent variable modeling as a methodological framework for
   understanding and reasoning about complex social processes, and provide
   a brief overview of bayesian id136. in the second half of this
   tutorial, i will concentrate specifically on political science. i will
   discuss data sources, acquisition methods, and research questions, as
   well as the mathematical details of several models recently developed
   by the political methodology community. these models, which draw upon
   research in machine learning and natural language processing, not only
   serve as examples of the outstanding methodological work being done in
   the social sciences, but also demonstrate how ideas originally
   developed by computer scientists can be adapted and used to answer
   substantive questions that further our understanding of society.
