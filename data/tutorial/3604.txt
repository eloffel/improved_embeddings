sgid4

   sgid4 is an open-source framework for id4 (id4)
   and other sequence prediction tasks. the tool provides a flexible
   platform which allows pairing id4 with various other models such as
   language models, length models, or bag2seq models. it supports
   rescoring both n-best lists and lattices. a wide variety of search
   strategies is available for complex decoding problems.

   sgid4 is compatible with multiple id4 implementations based on
   [79]theano ([80]blocks) and [81]tensorflow (the [82]extended id195
   tutorial and [83]tensor2tensor).
     * syntactically guided id4 (id4 lattice
       rescoring)
     * id4 support in theano (blocks) and tensorflow (tensor2tensor)
     * n-best list rescoring with id4
     * integrating external id165 posterior probabilities used in mbr
     * ensemble id4 decoding
     * forced id4 decoding
     * integrating language models (kneser-ney, nplm, id56lm)
     * different search algorithms (beam, a*, depth first search,
       greedy...)
     * target sentence length modelling
     * bag2sequence models and decoding algorithms
     * joint decoding with word- and subword/character-level models
     * hypothesis recombination
     * heuristic search
     * extensions to id4 training in blocks (reshuffling, fixing and
       customizing id27s, ...)
     * neural word alignment (blocks/theano only)
     * ...
