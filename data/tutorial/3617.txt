what

   this is the modern hebrew dependency treebank which was created and
   used in my [2]phd thesis.

description

   the dependency treebank is converted from mila's [3]hebrew constituency
   treebank (v2). the guidelines and conversion process are discussed in
   chapter 5 of the thesis. the tagset is detailed in chapter 4. the
   parts-of-speech tags are automatically assigned using the ben-gurion
   hebrew pos-tagger by meni adler.

  data format

   the files are based on the conll format.

   the columns are:
      index word lemma(empty) cpos pos morph parent prel empty empty

   where cpos and pos are coarse-grained and fine-grained parts-of-speech
   tags, morph is a |-separated list of extra features, parent is the
   index of the parent token and prel is the label of the parent relation.
   the lemma field is always empty.

   one notable difference is that the index and parent columns are not
   integers but floating point numbers.

   the floating point representation is needed in order to encode
   token-segmentation information. an index of the form 3.0 indicates that
   the word is the first part of the third token, and 3.2 indicates that
   the word is the third part of the third token. for example, the
   sentence                       will be represented as:
      1.0           
      2.0   
      2.1   
      2.2       

   the script [4]renumber.py can be used to convert the data to
   integer-based indexing, making the data compatible with the conll
   format while losing the original token information. (usage: renumber.py
   < in > out)

  files

   the treebank files are in the [5]data directory.
     * data/*.utf8 files are in utf8 encoding, others are plain ascii with
       hebrew represented using the wacky id68 scheme of the
       hebrew constituency treebank.
     * data/sentences.* are the raw sentences, having gone minor
       id121 but no token segmentation.
     * data/autotags.* have automativally assigned pos-tags (but gold
       segmentation)
     * data/autosegs.* have automatically assigned pos-tags and
       automatically assigned token segmentation. these files do not
       contain parent information. these files represent the expected
       input to the parser in a real-world parsing scenario.
     * data/*.train*, *.dev*, *.test* train/dev/test sets.
     * for completeness, please don't use:
          + data/goldtags.* gold tagging and segmentation. the pos column
            is manually converted from the tb tagset (!!miss!! means
            analysis is not in the lexicon, !!unk!! means the word is not
            in the lexicon). the 9th column is the original tb tag.

                                    license

   the files are distributed under the [6]gpl v3 license.

   if you use this software in an academic publication, it would be nice
   of you to cite my phd thesis "automatic syntactic processing of modern
   hebrew", yoav goldberg, 2011.
