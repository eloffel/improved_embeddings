   giving an academic talk

   [1]jonathan shewchuk

   these are my opinions on how to give a talk (using presentation
   software or transparencies) in computer science or mathematics,
   distilled for my students and for students attending graphics lunch. i
   go to conferences, see the same mistakes repeated by many a speaker,
   and write my reactions here. you are welcome to disagree with my
   opinions, as long as you think each issue through for yourself.

                               preparing the talk

   your slides. the plain absurdity of modern academic talks would be
   glaring if we hadn't all pickled in it for so long. recall the last one
   you attended. the speaker flashed a slide full of words on the screen
   and talked. did you read and understand the slide? did you hear every
   word spoken? no, you had to make a decision about what to miss.

   recall the last talk you gave. i bet you made the same mistake. ask
   yourself: why are you projecting a slide that virtually guarantees that
   your audience will stop listening to you? if you expect them to listen,
   why are you showing slides that they won't have time to read? like
   circumcision or christmas fruitcake, we do it out of tradition, not
   because it isn't nasty.

   [explain.gif] if you want to be a great speaker, you must first accept
   the fact that a slide with more than twelve words on it is usually
   counterproductive. next, accept that this means you will have to
   prepare harder than the 99% of your colleagues who are still babbling
   to fill the time while the audience puzzles over their slides.

   how do you stamp out those excess words? first, your new modus operandi
   is to express all your ideas in pictures. resort to text only where
   illustrations fail you. as an exercise, try to make a talk where the
   only text is the slide titles, and perhaps a few two-word labels on
   figures. even if you don't quite succeed (i never do), you'll learn a
   lot about presentation by trying.

   second, examine your unconscious belief that the purpose of slides is
   to remind you what to say. once upon a time, speakers prepared index
   cards. today, speakers project their index cards (as a list of bullet
   points) and make their audiences read them. please understand that this
   is a hostile act. go back to index cards. some presentation programs
   let you write notes that appear only on your laptop screen.

   as an exercise, imagine this scenario. you are projecting a slide that
   has nothing but a title, say    advantages of matrix projection.    you
   have in your hand (or on your laptop screen, but not on the big screen)
   a list reminding you of all the points you want to make. you simply
   talk to your audience, just like [2]abraham lincoln delivering the
   gettysburg address. can you see how much better this is than bullet
   points? now imagine if you had an apt illustration for each item on
   your list, and simply showed them (under the same title) one by one as
   you spoke.

   in summary, minimize words and maximize pictures. your slides are not
   there to remind you what to say. bullet points make your audience feel
   your talk is in [3]bullet time. here are a few other tips.
     * most talks i attend use fonts that are too small. your academic
       colleagues are all nearsighted. i use 38 point text and 42   50 point
       titles. as wise speakers rarely put more than twelve words on a
       slide, there's plenty of room.
     * projected slides, unlike printed documents, do not need margins.
       yet most speakers put wide bands of empty space on the border of
       every slide. i feel that they are taunting the audience:    i could
       have used a readable font and big pictures, but i decided to do
       extra work to make them illegible.   
     * use only sans-serif fonts. they're easier to see from the back of
       the room. (exception: math fonts usually have serifs.)
     * simplicity is the best aesthetic. your audience has very little
       time to absorb what's on your slide, especially with you nattering
       on all the time. some people put accretions like project logos, the
       talk title, and the conference name on every page. don't.
     * for slides with formulae, one of my favorite tricks is to add
       arrows and labels pointing to the variables in a formula, reminding
       the audience what each one means. few people will remember
       nomenclature that you defined on a previous slide.
     * a talk of 30 minutes or more needs to be broken into sections, with
       a title slide or an outline slide demarcating each new section.
       (for shorter talks, use your judgment. outline slides and the
       accompanying speeches are boring, so keep both short.) the goal of
       the title slides is to alert your audience to transitions and
       changes of subject, and to tell it in advance what all the
       individual slides in the section will add up to. (a problem
       description? an algorithm? a proof? an empirical demonstration of
       your idea's wonderfulness? an evisceration of all previous work on
       the topic?)

   [ideas.gif] your organization. the most common mistake is to spend too
   much time on technical details, and too little time setting the
   context. a talk of 30 minutes or less should be an advertisement for
   the paper, not a replacement. your goal is to convince your listeners
   that they must read your paper. this is a very ambitious goal. focus on
   the big picture issues.
     * why is the problem you are solving worth solving?
     * what is the core difference between your method and all those that
       came before? this is really a two-part question (which most
       speakers screw up by answering only the second part).
          + what does your method accomplish that no previous method
            accomplishes?
          + what algorithmic or methodological idea enables your method to
            accomplish more?
     * what is the evidence that your method is better in some
       circumstances? (and what are those circumstances?)
     * what is the one big idea that you want people to leave your talk
       with? if you try to get across five ideas, you will usually impart
       none. if you choose one main idea and focus on advertising it, you
       will usually succeed.    [4]give them something to take home.   

   these big picture ideas should also be foremost in your mind when you
   write a paper. they are so important, i'm not going to say anything
   more about organization. put these issues first when you put your talk
   together, and you'll already be one of the best speakers at the
   conference.

   i will let someone else say something about organization, though. i
   like the following quote from [5]herman haverkort's defunct blog enough
   to excerpt it here.

     we got explained two models of giving a talk: the clew model and the
     onion model.

     the clew is a logical, linear argument building up to a conclusion
     at the end of the talk, like a clew unwinding until you finally come
     to the core. miss one step in the talk and you lose the plot and
     miss the point. and yes indeed, this is exactly what happens when i
     listen to most conference talks and some lectures. in a three days'
     conference, i actually follow the first five minutes of one or two
     dozen talks. that is more or less it. after those five minutes, i
     get lost. i miss a    slide    because i am still thinking about the
     previous one, get distracted by some random personal associations i
     had with something the speaker said, or simply doze off because the
     speaker has a tiring accent.

     the onion talk starts with the main message, and adds depth in
     successive layers around it, always returning to the main message
     between layers. since the main message and the main ideas are
     repeated often, a listener can still follow most of the talk even
     after dozing off for a minute. also the talk does not get screwed up
     near the end when the speaker is running out of time, because by
     then, the most important things have been said already and the
     speaker has no reason to hurry.

   the final pass. when your slides are done, go through them and examine
   each slide's title carefully. do the titles emphasize the right things?
   i bet you can improve at least half of them. the job of each title is
   to set the context and tell listeners what your words are trying to
   accomplish. when audience members wake up mid-talk and try to pay
   attention again, the first thing they'll do is look at your current
   slide's title. make sure it tells them why you're babbling on about
   grommets right now.

                                giving the talk

   [laser.gif] practice. it's obvious, but lots of people still don't do
   it. give a practice talk (even if you're alone) before you give a
   public one. better yet, give three.

   pointers. i really, truly despise laser pointers, but this is because
   most people use them badly. astonishingly badly. buy an old-fashioned
   telescoping pointer   they're much easier to follow with the eye. they
   also force you to move around. speakers with laser pointers tend to
   roost in one spot, like barnacles excreting glue, for their entire
   talk. because a telescoping pointer forces you to gesture and walk,
   your voice will become more dynamic as well.

   of course, there are some venues where the screen is too big for a
   physical pointer. rule: if you must use a laser pointer, when you point
   at something, hold the pointer steady. most people try to circle an
   object instead of pointing at it. guess what? nobody has a clue what
   you're pointing at! i have sat in conferences and watched one speaker
   after another after another do this, all oblivious to the fact that
   their audience has no idea what they're indicating. if you just saw the
   screen and not the speakers, you'd think the speakers were
   breakdancing.

   (little-known literary fun fact: according to dante, the third circle
   of hell is the home of those who use the mouse and cursor to point at
   things.)

   laptops. before the session, remember to turn off your laptop's screen
   saver. as well as any application that might try to download the latest
   version of realplayer mid-talk. (this is not a hypothetical
   occurrence.)

   [laptop.gif] another way speakers make themselves look goofy is by
   staring at their laptops' screens while speaking. it's human nature for
   your audience to follow your eyes, so use human nature to your
   advantage. when you look at the projection screen, the audience's eyes
   will follow yours and their attention will be where you want it. when
   you look at the audience, they will listen to what you say. when you
   look at your laptop screen, your audience will be distracted; they'll
   neither hear what you're saying nor see what you want them to look at.
   try to place your laptop screen where you can't see it.

   opening. begin a talk by introducing yourself by name, even if you've
   just been introduced   unless you've received an unusually long and clear
   introduction. the session chairs who introduce people at conferences
   often garble the names or fail to use the microphone. people are
   finishing off conversations while the chair introduces you. the people
   in the back of the room probably didn't hear the introduction, even if
   it sounded clear to you.

   if the talk is important enough (e.g. a job talk), have your spiel
   memorized for the first few slides, so you get a smooth start no matter
   how flustered and tired you are. (of course, never memorize a whole
   talk, as you'd sound terribly stilted.)

   nonverbal communication. an infamous study by nalini ambady and robert
   rosenthal, [6]   half a minute: predicting teacher evaluations from thin
   slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness,    shows that
   students can predict a teacher's ratings with significant accuracy
   after watching a 30-second silent video clip of the teacher at work.
   resist the urge to attribute this to the superficiality of students'
   ratings. what is the nonverbal magic that an audience recognizes so
   quickly?

   i believe they are seeing communication uncluttered by extraneous
   motion, facial expressions, fidgeting, utterances, and other nonverbal
   behaviors so subtle that the speaker is entirely unaware of doing them.
   a faint, transient facial expression or a brief unconscious twitch of
   the arm are enough to rob a speaker's words of their force, and even
   break an audience's attention. but how can you fix this?

   your mental focus. i believe that the secret is in where you habitually
   place your attention. when you speak, most of your attention is on what
   you are saying. but if you've rehearsed decently, you'll have some
   mental room left over, and other thoughts will fill the vacuum. if you
   could listen to a speaker's thoughts, you might hear    am i going too
   fast?    or    are they understanding this?    or    how do i look?    or worse
   yet,    i wonder if they like me.    any thought regarding whether the
   audience approves of you or not is the worst place to put your mental
   focus. it's like beseeching god to make you a loser.

   one of the biggest epiphanies of my life is a fact that probably seems
   counterintuitive to most people who think for a living: if you're
   already thinking of what to say next while somebody is still speaking
   to you, you will appear socially inept and they won't like you. when
   you're the one speaking, there's a similar principle: if you're in your
   head, you will look awkward and speak awkwardly.

   great speakers   like great leaders   habitually focus on the right things,
   which means almost anything outside their own egos. perhaps the best
   place to focus your attention is on the sensations in your own body:
   how do my legs feel? will i feel more relaxed if i breathe just a
   little deeper? am i enjoying the rhythm of my voice as i speak?
   (ideally, these aren't verbal thoughts; they're felt perceptions.) the
   next best place is on the sensations in the bodies of your audience. of
   course, you can't know for sure what they feel, but you can empathize
   and try to guess. don't do it in a    do they like me?    way; your
   attention should be on their welfare. try to open your body to physical
   pleasure and connection.

   this focus on physical sensation has several benefits. it clarifies
   your communication: fidgeting and misleading gestures attenuate; your
   voice and rhythm improve; and you slow down your motions and speech.
   your focus on your body gives you more presence in the eyes of the
   audience, and you marshall energy toward projecting your message with
   congruent body language. your focus on the sensations of your audience
   makes them feel connected to you. this sensate focus awakens your
   limbic system, while leaving your cerebral cortex free to do the
   talking.

   if you're not a natural, it takes discipline to change your habits and
   permanently refocus your attention. academics, especially
   mathematicians, are not known for being in their bodies. let it be
   something you practice not just when you give a formal talk, but during
   your day-to-day socializing. learning to habitually place your
   attention outside your ego and on your body sensations and the people
   around you will not only make you a better speaker; it will improve
   your relationships with everyone.

   speaking. good speaking has rhythm. ever hear an entire talk delivered
   in a uniform, unchanging cadence, as if the whole speech was one long
   paragraph? i've heard lots of those. choose key points in your talk
   where you wish to bestow extra emphasis. (if you followed my advice on
   preparation, you know what these points are.) then decide how you will
   emphasize them. sometimes i do this by speaking with a particularly
   slow and deliberate voice. sometimes i say outright,    here's the most
   important idea in this talk.   

   silence can be articulate. leave a long pause right after making a key
   point. let it sink in.

   there are two mental adjustments that will help you speak fluidly. the
   first is a mental focus on body sensations, discussed above. the second
   is to give yourself permission to take as long as you like to think of
   what to say next. this is easy to say, but hardly anybody internalizes
   this attitude. do you ever find yourself saying    uhhhhh   ? if so, you
   don't really believe you have permission. some part of you is afraid of
   losing your audience if you don't fill the silence.

   tell yourself that there's no hurry, no need to fill empty spaces with
   sound, and certainly no need to get to the end of your slides.
   (structure your talk so this is true!) the audience is too busy trying
   to understand your slide to care how long it takes you to think of the
   next sentence. trust yourself. think patiently. the right words come
   faster if you don't force them. demand your right to remain silent.

   never meta-comment on your speaking. how often have you heard a speaker
   say,    i guess i'm running out of time; i'll just go through this
   quickly   ? did you hear a single word he said after that? silently
   decide what to do; don't burden your audience with it.

   [closing.gif] closing. always end your talk by saying    thank you.    it
   is not pretentious   you are doing the audience a favor. if you do not
   cue the audience so they know when to applaud, they will be confused
   and irritated. like most social rituals, the thanks-applause sequence
   comforts everyone. do not ask for questions until you complete it.

   that's all! most everything else, especially aesthetics, is learned
   through practice and feedback. i could go on, but by trying to teach
   more i'd teach less. same goes for you.
