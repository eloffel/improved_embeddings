1000-topic clueweb'12 lda models

   we used [1]mammoth to train a 1000-topic lda model on the full
   700m-document clueweb12 collection using a truncated vocabulary of
   100,000 terms.
   the trained model is available for download [2]here (gzipped: 609mb,
   uncompressed: 2gb). the file structure looks something like this:
   0 0.001 0.002 0.00001 0.3 0.001
   1 0.500 0.698 0.99998 0.1 0.899
   2 0.499 0.300 0.00001 0.2 0.100

   features (terms) are represented as rows and topics as columns. each
   row's first column states the feature number (corresponding to the
   [3]dictionary).
   the remaining columns represent the id203 of that feature for the
   respective topic. the probabilities per column add up to 1.

   if you would like to refer to the dataset, it was originally described
   and used in:
     * [4]r. jagerman, c. eickhoff and m. de rijke. computing web-scale
       topic models using an asynchronous parameter server.
