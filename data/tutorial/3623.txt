automatic summarisation of scientific papers

   have you ever had to do a literature review as part of a research
   project and thought "i wish there was a quicker way of doing this"?
   this code aims to create that quicker way by developing a
   supervised-learning based extractive summarisation system for the
   summarisation of scientific papers.

   for more information on the project, please see:

   ed collins, isabelle augenstein, sebastian riedel. [86]a supervised
   approach to extractive summarisation of scientific papers. to appear in
   proceedings of conll, july 2017.

   scientific papers. ucl meng thesis, may 2017.

code description

   the various code files and folders are described here. note that the
   data used is not uploaded here but nonetheless the repository is still
   over 1gb in size.
     * analysis - a folder containing code used to analyse the generated
       summaries and create various pretty graphs. it is not essential to
       the functioning of the summarisers and will not work without the
       data.
     * data - where all data should be stored. in the folder utility_data
       are things such as stopword lists, permitted titles and a count of
       how many different papers each word occurs in (used for tf-idf;
       calculated automatically by
       datatools/datapreprocessing/cspubsumext_creator.py.
     * datatools - contains files for manipulating and preprocessing the
       data. there are two particularly important files in this folder.
       useful_functions.py contains many important functions used to run
       the system. datapreprocessing/cspubsumext_creator.py will take the
       parsed papers which are produced by the code in datadownloader and
       preprocess them into the form used to train the models in the
       research automatically.
     * evaluation - contains code to evaluate summaries and calculate the
       id8-l metric, with thanks to [87]hapribot.
     * models - contains the code which constructs and trains each of the
       supervised learning modules that form the core of the summarisation
       system. all written in tensorflow.
     * summarisers - contains the code which takes the trained models and
       uses them to actually create summaries of papers.
     * visualisations - contains code which visualises summaries by
       colouring them and saving them as html files. this is not essential
       to run the system.
     * id97 - contains the code necessary to train the id97 model
       used for id27s. the actual trained id97 model is not
       uploaded because it is too large.
     * datadownloader - contains code to download and parse the original
       xml paper files into the format currently used by this system -
       where each section title is delineated by "@&#" so the paper can
       easily be read and split into constituent sections by reading the
       whole paper as a string and splitting the string on this symbol
       which is very unlikely to ever occur in the text. the important
       file is acquire_data.py.

running the code

   before attempting to run this code you should setup a suitable
   virtualenv using python 2.7. install all of the requirements listed in
   requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt.

   to download the dataset and preprocess it into the form used to train
   the models in the paper, first run datadownloader/acquire_data.py. this
   will download all of the papers and parse them into the form used -
   with sections separated by a special symbol - "@&#" - so that the
   papers can be read as strings then split into sections and titles by
   splitting on this symbol.

   to turn these downloaded papers into training data, run
   datatools/datapreprocessing/cspubsumext_creator.py. this will take a
   while to run depending on your machine and number of cores (~2 hours on
   late 2016 macbook pro with dual core i7) but will handle creating all
   of the necessary files to train models. these are stored by default in
   data/training_data/, with there being an individual json file for each
   paper and a single json file called all_data.json which is a list of
   all of the individual items of training data. this code now uses the
   ultra-fast ujson library which reads the data much faster than the
   previous version which used pickle.

   all of the models and summarisers should then be usable.

   be sure to check that all of the paths are correctly set! these are in
   datadownloader/acquire_data.py for downloading papers, and in
   datatools/useful_functions.py otherwise.

   note: the code in
   datatools/datapreprocessing/abstractnetpreprocessor.py is still
   unpleasently inefficient and is still currently used in the summarisers
   themselves. the next code update will fix this and streamline the
   process of running the trained summarisers.

other notes

   if you have read or are reading the meng thesis or conll paper
   corresponding to this code, then safnet = summarisernet, sfnet =
   summarisernetv2, snet = lstm, saf+f ens = ensemblesummariser, s+f ens =
   ensemblev2summariser.
