   [11]nvidia gtc conference 2017 was an excellent source for all the
   effort on work on health care in deep learning. deep learning experts
   such as [12]ian goodfellow, [13]jeremy howard and others shared their
   perspective on deep learning. top medical schools ([14]mount sinai,
   nyu, massachusetts general hospital, etc.) and [15]kaggle         lung cancer
   bowl winners explained their modeling strategies. coming back to our
   series, in the last article we talked about basic deep-learning on text
   and image data. in this article we will focus on the medical images and
   their formats.

   this article is structured into 3 parts         medical images and their
   components, medical image formats and their format conversions. the
   goal is to develop knowledge to help us with our ultimate
   goal         medical image analysis with deep learning.

medical images & components

   a very good resource for this discussion is [16]the paper published by
   michele larobina & loredana murino from, institute of bio structures
   and bioimaging (ibb), italy. this is part of the national research
   council (cnr). it is the largest public research facility in italy.
   another good source of reference is the paper    [17]working with the
   dicom and nifti data standards in r   .

   what is a medical image? : a medical image is an representation of the
   internal structure or function of an anatomic region. it is in the form
   of an array of picture elements called pixels (2 dimensional) or voxels
   (3 dimensional) . it is a discrete representation resulting from a
   sampling or reconstruction process that maps numerical values to
   positions of the space. the number of pixels used to describe the
   field-of-view of a certain acquisition modality is an expression of the
   detail with which the anatomy or function can be depicted. what the
   numerical value of the pixel expresses depends on the imaging modality,
   the acquisition protocol, the reconstruction, and eventually, the
   post-processing. (source: [18]link)

   medical image components
   [1*xmudt1ncfl4lubamaj1f1w.png]
   medical image components

   medical images have 4 key constituents         pixel depth, photometric
   interpretation,metadata and pixel data. these constituents are
   responsible for the size and resolution of the image.

   pixel depth or bit depth or color depth is the number of bits used to
   encode the information of each pixel. for example, an 8-bit raster can
   have 256 unique values that range from 0 to 255.
   [1*cxnartakp4hhzsbotyo0ba.png]
   source:
   [19]http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-ima
   ges/bit-depth-capacity-for-raster-dataset-cells.htm

   photometric interpretation specifies how the pixel data should be
   interpreted for the correct image display as a monochrome or color
   image. to specify if color information is or is not stored in the image
   pixel values, we introduce the concept of samples per pixel, also known
   as number of channels. monochrome images have one sample per pixel and
   no color information stored in the image. a scale of shades of gray
   from black to white is used to display the images. the number of shades
   of gray depends clearly from the number of bits used to store the
   sample that, in this case, coincide with the pixel depth. clinical
   radiological images, like x-ray computed tomography (ct) and magnetic
   resonance (mr) images have a gray scale photometric interpretation.
   nuclear medicine images, like positron emission tomography (pet) and
   single photon emission tomography (spect), are typically displayed with
   a color map or color palette. [source: [20]link]

   metadata is the information that describe the image. it can seem
   strange, but in any file format, there is always information associated
   with the image beyond the pixel data. this information called metadata
   is typically stored at the beginning of the file as a header and
   contains at least the image matrix dimensions, the spatial resolution,
   the pixel depth, and the photometric interpretation.

   pixel data         this is the section where the numerical values of the
   pixels are stored. according to the data type, pixel data are stored as
   integers or floating-point numbers using the minimum number of bytes
   required to represent the values

     image size = header size(includes metadata)+ rows* columns * pixel
     depth * (number of frames)

medical image formats

   there are 6 predominant formats for radiology images         dicom (digital
   imaging and communications in medicine) , nifti (neuroimaging
   informatics technology initiative) , par/rec (philips mri scanner
   formats), analyze (mayo medical imaging), [21]nrrd (nearly raw raster
   data) and mnic.
   [1*pchhsdfl1grgednfsgpwkq.png]
   medical image formats as of may 2017

   of these 5, dicom and nifti are the more popular ones.

dicom format basics

   dicom stands for digital imaging and communications in medicine. dicom
   is standard created by the national electrical manufacturers
   association (nema). it defines a standard for handling, storing,
   printing and transmitting information in medical imaging. these are the
   format of files that you can expect right off a scanner or hospital
   [22]pacs (picture archiving and communication system).

   it includes a file format and a network communications protocol that
   uses tcp/ip to communicate between entities that are capable of
   receiving image and patient data in dicom format.

   a dicom file consists of a header and the image data in the same file
   (*.dcm). the size of the header depends on how much header information
   is provided. the header contains information such the patient id,
   patient name, modality and other information. it defines also how many
   frames are contained and in which resolutions. this is used by image
   viewers to display the image. for a single acquisition there will be a
   lot of dicom files.

   source: [23]https://www.leadtools.com/sdk/medical/dicom-spec1

   a python library to read dicom files is [24]pydicom. refer to the code
   sample in the part 1 of this article.
   [25]medical image analysis with deep learning         i
   analyzing images and videos, and using them in various applications
   such as self driven cars, drones etc. with   medium.com

   a r-package for reading dicom data is    [26]oro.dicom   .
   [1*qm-sv1rt4v3lurhrwnlvba.png]

nifti format basics

   i remember nifti was originally created for neuroimaging. the nifti
   format was envisioned by the neuroimaging informatics technology
   initiative (nifti) as a replacement for the analyze 7.5 format. it has
   it   s origin in the field of neuro-imaging but can be used in other
   fields as well. a major feature is that the format contains two affine
   coordinate definitions which relates each voxel index (i,j,k) to a
   spatial location (x,y,z).

   a python library to read nifti files is [27]nibabel. a r-package for
   reading nifti data is    [28]oro.nifti   .

differences between dicom and nifti

   the main difference between dicom and nifti is that the raw image data
   in nifti is saved as a 3d image, where in dicom you have 2d image
   slices. this makes nifti more preferable for some machine learning
   applications over dicom, because it is modeled as a 3d image. handling
   a single nifti file instead of several hundreds of dicom is easier.
   nifti stores 2 files per 3d image as opposed to dozens in dicom.

nrrd format basics

   the flexible nrrd format includes a single header file and image
   file(s) that can be separate or combined. a nrrd header accurately
   represents n-dimensional raster information for scientific
   visualization and medical image processing. national alliance for
   medical image computing ([29]na-mic) has developed a way of using the
   nrrd format to represent diffusion weighted images (dwi) volumes and
   diffusion tensor images (dti).nrrd dwi and nrrd dti data can be read
   into 3d slicer, to visually confirm that the orientation of the tensors
   is consistent with expected neuroanatomy[l[30]ink]

   the general format of a nrrd file (with attached header) is:
   [1*b2sfniv1ehmhklunciajkg.png]
   source : [31]http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html#general.1

minc format basics

   minc stands for medical imaging netcdf toolkit. the minc file format
   development was started in 1992 at montreal neurological institute
   (mni). currently there is active work going on at mcgill   s brain
   imaging center ([32]bci). the first version of minc format (minc1) was
   based on the standard [33]network common data format (netcdf).

   minc2 switched from netcdf to [34]hierarchical data format version 5
   (hdf5). hdf5 supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is
   designed for flexible and efficient i/o and for high volume and complex
   data. these added features helped minc2 to work with large and complex
   data-sets.

   some comparisons obtained from research papers in headers of these
   formats.

format conversions

dicom to nifti

   a popular tool for converting dicom to nifti is [35]dicom2nii. a python
   library to read and write nifti files is [36]nibabel. if one would like
   to convert dicom to nifti, there are tools for automatic conversion
   (e.g. [37]dcm2nii). python 2 library    [38]dcmstack    allows series of
   dicom images to be stacked into multi-dimensional arrays. these arrays
   can be written out as nifti files with an optional header extension
   (the dcmmeta extension) containing a summary of all the meta data from
   the source dicom files. a newer library [39]dicom2nifti is available
   for python 3. i would also recommend the reader to check out the nipy
   project.

dicom to minc

   minc team at [40]bic has developed a tool to convert from dicom to minc
   images. this program is written in c and the github repo is [41]here.

nifti or analyze to minc

   minc team at [42]bic has developed another tool to convert from nifti
   or analyze images to minc images. this program is called nii2mnc. a
   list of conversion tools by bic including nii2mnc is [43]here.

conclusions

   as we see there are several formats of storing imaging and utilizing
   them for deep learning. our goal is to use the best format that will
   enable us to get all features we need for our convolutional neural net
   (id98) to predict accurately.

   in the next article we will discuss how to segment the lungs from a ct
   scan using one of the formats.
