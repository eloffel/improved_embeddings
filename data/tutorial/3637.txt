     there once was a drunk man who wandered far too close to a cliff.
     from where he stands, one step forward would send the drunk man over
     the edge. he takes random steps, either towards or away from the
     cliff. at any step, his id203 of taking a step away is 2/3 and
     a step towards the cliff is 1/3.

     what is his chance of escaping the cliff?

stochastic processes, id93, & markov chains

   this classic problem is a wonderful example of topics typically
   discussed in advanced statistics, but are simple enough for the novice
   to understand. the problem falls into the general category of
   stochastic processes, specifically a type of random walk called a
   markov chain.

   let   s go over what all these terms mean, just in case you   re curious.

   a stochastic process is a random process that describes the evolution
   of a system over a unit such as time.

   a random walk describes a path derived from a series of random steps on
   some mathematical space, in our case we   ll use integers to describe the
   drunkards movement in relation to the cliff.

   a markov chain is a random walk that maintains the memoryless property.
   in other words, each step, or id203, in the system is independent
   of the previous. in our scenario, each step the drunk man takes
   maintains the same id203 of moving forwards or backwards whether
   he   s on the cliff   s edge or many steps away from it.

starter calculations

   let   s get a feel for how these probabilities play out by crunching some
   numbers.
   [1*vpctrvqplg5wbhraiibzaw.png]

   imagine the drunk man is standing at 1 on a number line. at zero he
   falls off the cliff. each number increasing from 0 represents how many
   steps he is from the cliff.

   let   s visualize the walk in a chart of probabilities.

   the man starts 1 step away from the cliff with a id203 of 1. the
   probabilities of moving toward the cliff is 1/3 and the id203 of
   stepping away from the cliff is 2/3.

   we   ll place 1/3 at the intersection of 1st step taken, 0 distance from
   cliff and 2/3 at 1st step taken, 2 steps from cliff.
   [1*h2u9nfzzjjszdkvdfzb6rg.png]
   possible probabilities after drunkards first 2 steps

   the branch ends when the man falls off the cliff, leaving us with the
   righthand path to continue. the man has the option of stepping forward
   to 1 or backwards to 3 on the imaginary number line.

   since he maintains the initial probabilities at each step, we can
   multiply the current id203 by 1/3 for forward and 2/3 for
   backward movement.

   the possible 3 step paths and probabilities are:
   [1*ljkt_f8hzsvr68hqzost_q.png]
   possible probabilities after drunk man   s first 3 steps

   if we total the paths that end with the man falling off the cliff (i.e.
   the zero column) we find that after three steps the drunkard has 1/3 +
   2/27 = 11/27 or 40.7% chance of doom.
   [1*gl7wx3ixn5slikjai4ovfw.png]

   when we add the 4 and 5 step paths an interesting pattern emerges. it
   seems that the man can only fall off the cliff on odd numbered steps.
   also after 5 steps we see that the id203 of falling off the cliff
   has creeped up to 0.44 (1/3 + 2/27 + 8/243).

deriving a formula

   this problem is only one of many variations. the probabilities 1/3 and
   2/3 might as well have been any other probabilities summing to 1.

   now that we have an idea of how it works, let   s generalize the problem.

   let the id203 of stepping right be some value p and the
   id203 of stepping left be 1     p (since 1     p + p = 1) where p is
   between 0 and 1.
   [1*cfcwpqcrredifv0abakezg.png]

   define the id203 of falling off the cliff from 1 as p1. this is
   of interest since it is always the prerequisite step for falling off
   the cliff.

   the id203 p1 is
     * the id203 of stepping immediately left to 0 (which is 1     p)

   or (+)
     * the id203 of stepping right to 2 (p) and the id203, p2,
       of reaching 0 from a path originating from 2.

   combining the above information we obtain the following formula for p1:
   [1*-jqdce1aw4vnafhtsv-uoa.png]

what is p2?

   p2 is the id203 of falling off the cliff on a path originating
   from 2 steps away. in order to fall off the cliff you have to move from
   2     1 and from 1     0.

   because each step in the walk is independent, we know that moving from
   2     1 is the same as the id203 calculation used to obtain p1 the
   only difference is we are shifted one step to the right. but this is
   inconsequential since the memoryless property holds, meaning it is the
   same mathematically as moving from 1     0.

   therefore the id203 of moving from 2     1 is p1.

   then we must move from 1     0, which is the exact definition of p1.
   hence p2 is the same as p1   p1, or p1-squared. making this substitution
   for p2 in the formula for p1, we obtain:
   [1*qzxpai-n-gyfmwj54rdhha.png]
   formula describing the man   s chance of falling off cliff, p1

solving for p1, the id203 of eventual doom

   now we have a quadratic to solve. all these p   s are a little confusing,
   so i   ll temporarily let p1=x to make the equation look more familiar to
   us.
   [1*kskdshswr7cdekdpiiqyzw.png]

   a little rearranging and we have the standard form of a quadratic:
   [1*akfz23pksaimzhsu0xmhag.png]

   when p=0, p1=x=1. this makes sense. when the id203 of moving
   right is zero, we have a 100% chance of falling off the cliff.

   when p=1, p1=x=0, meaning that when the id203 of moving right is
   100%, we are guaranteed not to fall off the cliff.

   so what about the probabilities between p=0 and p=1? such as our
   original scenario of p=2/3?

   this is where solving the above quadratic comes in handy. when you do
   so, you   ll obtain two solutions:
   [1*y4pq101ivm-ifja_szk7aw.png]

   when we plug p=1/2 into the second solution, we find that the two
   solutions agree, since (1     1/2)/(1/2) also equals 1.

   if we plug in a value for p that is less than 1/2, such as 1/4 we find
   that the probabilities are invalid since they are greater than 1.
   [1*_vclitlgiqmd1rshmspjca.png]
   example of an invalid id203

what does this mean to us?

   this means that we should model this problem with a piecewise function,
   where values for p less than 1/2 are modeled by x=1, values larger than
   1/2 are modeled by (1     p)/p, and p=1/2 can be modeled by either
   equation since they both yield x=1.

back to our original scenario

   given a id203 of 2/3 of stepping away from the cliff, and since
   2/3 is greater than 1/2, we   ll plug it into the second solution to find
   the id203 that the drunk man will fall off the cliff.
   [1*71khwqy53kl-vi7safbj0g.png]

   so even with a id203 of 2/3 of stepping away from the cliff, the
   drunk man still has a 50% chance of falling off the cliff! that   s a
   pretty surprising result!

the most surprising result

   in fact, if his id203 of stepping away from the cliff is less
   than or equal to 1/2, our function defaults to the p1=x=1 solution.
   meaning that even at a 1/2 chance of stepping in either direction he is
   guaranteed to eventually fall off the cliff! there is no escaping it.

   turns out that being drunk and standing near a cliff is a
   mathematically bad idea to say the least
