beginning machine learning     a few resources [subjective]

   i   ve been meaning to write this post for a while now, because many
   people following the scikit-learn video tutorials and the ml group are
   asking for direction, as in resources for those who are just starting
   out.

   so, i decided to put up a short and subjective list with some of the
   resources i   d recommend for this purpose. i   ve used some of these
   resources when i started out with ml. practically, there are unlimited
   free resources online. you just have to search, pick something, and
   start putting in the work, which is probably one of the most important
   aspects of learning and developing [26]any skill.

   since most of these resources involve knowledge of programming
   (especially python), i am assuming you have decent skills. if you
   don   t, i   d suggest learning to program first. i   ll write a post about
   that in the future, but until then, you could start, hands-on, with the
   free [27]sololearn platform.

   the following resources include, but are not limited to books, courses,
   lectures, posts, and jupyter notebooks, just to name a few.

   in my opinion, skill development with more than one type of resource
   can be fruitful. spreading yourself too thin by trying to learn from
   too many places at once could be detrimental though. to illustrate,
   here   s what i think of a potentially good approach to study ml in any
   given day (and i   d try to do skill development 6-7 days a week, for
   several hours each day):

       1-2 hours reading from a programming book and coding along
       1 hour watching a lecture, or a talk, or reading a research paper
       30 minutes to 1 hour working through a course
       optional: reading 1-2 posts.

   this would be a very intensive approach and it may lead to good
   results. these results are dependent of good sleep     in terms of
   quality (at night, at the right hours) and quantity (7-8 hours
   consistently).

   now, the short-list   

starter resources

    1. a few courses

   1.1. machine learning with python     from [28]cognitiveclass.ai

   i put this on the top of the list because it not only goes through the
   basics of ml such as supervised vs. unsupervised learning, types of
   algorithms and popular models, but it also provides labs, which are
   jupyter notebooks where you practice what you learned during the video
   lectures. if you pass all weekly quizes and the final exam, you   ll
   obtain a free course certificate. i took this course a while ago.

   1.2. intro to machine learning     from [29]udacity

   taught by sebastian thrun and katie malone, this is a ~10-week,
   self-paced, very interactive course. the videos are very short, but
   engaging; there are more than 400 videos that you have to go through. i
   specifically like this one because it is very hands-on and engaging, so
   it requires your active input. i enjoyed going through the enron
   dataset.

   1.3. machine learning     from [30]udacity

   taught by michael littman, charles isbell, and pushkar kolhe, this is a
   ~4-month, self-paced course, offered as cs7641 at georgia tech and it   s
   part of their online masters degree.

   1.4. principles of machine learning     from [31]edx, part of a microsoft
   program

   taught by dr. steve elston and cynthia rudin. it   s a 6-week,
   intermediate level course.

   1.5. machine learning crash course     from [32]berkeley

   a 3-part series going through some of the most important concepts of
   ml. the accompanying graphics are    stellar    and aid the learning
   process tremendously.

   of course, there are many more ml courses on these online learning
   platforms and on other platforms as well (do a search with your
   preferred search engine).

   if you   re ml savvy, you may be wondering why i am not mentioning ng   s
   [33]course. it   s not that i don   t recommend it; on the contrary, i do.
   but i   d suggest going through it only after you have a solid knowledge
   of the basics.

   additionally, here are the materials from [34]stanford and [35]mit   s
   two courses on machine learning. some video lectures can be found in
   their youtube playlists. other big universities provide their courses
   on the open on youtube or via other video sharing platforms. find one
   or two and go through them diligently.
    2. books

   2.1. [36]python for data analysis     wes mckiney

       to lay the foundation of working with ml related tools and libraries

   2.2. [37]python machine learning     sebastian raschka

       reference book.

   2.3. [38]introduction to machine learning with python     andreas muller
   and sarah guido

       i   ve been using this book as inspiration material in my ml youtube
   [39]video series.

   going through these books hands-on (coding along) is critical. each of
   them have their github repository of jupyter notebooks, which makes it
   even easier to get your hands on the code.

   strong ml skills imply solid knowledge of the mathematics, statistics
   and id203 theory behind the algorithms, atop of the programming
   skills. once you get the conceptualized knowledge of ml, you should be
   studying the complexities of it.

   [40]here   s a list of free books and resources to help you along. it is
   relevant to ml and data mining, deep learning, natural language
   processing, neural networks, id202 (!!!), and id203 and
   statistics (!!!).
    3. videos and playlists

   3.1. luis serrano     [41]a friendly introduction to machine learning

       one of the most well explained video tutorials that i went through.
   no wonder luis teaches with udacity. his other videos on neural
   networks bring the same level of quality!

   3.2. [42]roshan     machine learning     video series

       from setting up the environment to hands-on. [43]notebooks are also
   available.

   3.3. machine learning with scikit-learn (scipy 2016)     [44]part 1 and
   [45]part 2

       taught, hands-on, by muller and raschka. notebooks are available in
   the description of the videos. similar videos by these authors are
   available in the    recommended    section (on the right of the video).

   at this point i realized i   ve been using the word    hands-on    way too
   much. but that   s okay. i guess you get the point.

   3.4. machine learning with python     [46]sentdex playlist

       sentdex needs no introduction. his current ml playlist consists of 72
   videos.

   3.5. machine learning with scikit-learn     [47]cristi vlad playlist

   this is my own playlist. it currently has 27 videos and i   m posting new
   ones every few days. i   m working with scikit-learn on the cancer
   dataset and i explore different ml algorithms and models.

   3.6. [48]machine learning apis by example     google developers

       presented at the 2017 google i/o conference.

   3.7. [49]practical introduction to machine learning     same hames

       tutorial from 2016 pycon australia.

   3.8. [50]machine learning recipes     with josh gordon

       from google developers.

   to find similar channels you can search for anything related to
      pycon   ,    pydata   ,    enthought python   , etc. i also remind you that many
   top universities and companies posts their courses, lectures, and talks
   on their video channels. look them up.
    4. others

   4.1. [51]machine learning 101     from bigml

      in this page you will find a set of useful articles, videos and blog
   posts from independent experts around the world that will gently
   introduce you to the basic concepts and techniques of machine
   learning.   

   4.2. [52]learning machine learning     elitedatascience

   4.3. [53]top-down learning path: machine learning for software
   engineers

       a collection of resources from a self-taught software engineer, nam
   vu, who purposed to study roughly 4 hours a night.

   4.4. [54]machine learning mastery     by dr. jason brownlee

concluding thoughts

   to reiterate, there is an unlimited number of free and paid resources
   that you can learn from. to try to include too many is futile and could
   be counterproductive. here i only presented a few personal picks and i
   suggested ways to search for others if these do not appeal to you.

   remember, to be successful in skill development, i   d recommend an
   eclectic approach by learning and practicing from a combination of
   different types of resources at the same time (just a few) for a couple
   of hours everyday.

   learning from courses, hands-on lectures, talks, and presentations,
   books (hands-on) and jupyter notebooks is a very demanding and
   intensive approach that could lead to good results if you are
   consistent. good sleep is crucial for skill development. enjoy the
   ride!

       those look like great resources. i believe that python has good
       id202 libraries, so it should work well as a machine
       learning language. my (limited) expeditions into machine learning
       so far have used octave, which seems like a reasonably easy way to
       prototype stuff. python is probably a good way to get beyond the
       prototype, though i   d be interested in views on how well it scales.
       i guess you can implement map reduce or spark in any language,
       though i   m not aware of an existing implementation in python.

            i believe andrew ng uses octave a lot in the coursera ml
            course. i   ve only worked with it a little bit. i   d say python
            (and to some extent r) is the way to go for machine learning
            and deep learning projects. it scales well, imo.

       i believe along with ml, people should also understand the basics
       of math. it the most important stuff to get better understanding of
       algorithms.
