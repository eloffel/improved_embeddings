   this introductory id203 book, published by the american
   mathematical society, is available from [1]ams bookshop. it has, since
   publication, also been available for download [2]here in pdf format. we
   are pleased that this has made our book more widely available.

   we are pleased to announce that our book has now been made freely
   redistributable under the terms of the [3]gnu free documentation
   license (fdl), as published by the free software foundation. briefly
   stated, the fdl permits you to do whatever you like with a work, as
   long as you don't prevent anyone else from doing what they like with
   it. this is the same license that is used for the wikipedia. here is
   the gnu version in [4]pdf, and here is the [5]source.

   thanks: we owe our ability to distribute this work under the fdl to the
   far-sightedness of the american mathematical society. we are
   particularly grateful for the help and support of john ewing, ams
   executive director and publisher.

   our book emphasizes the use of computing to simulate experiments and
   make computations. we have prepared a set of programs to go with the
   book. we have mathematica, maple, and truebasic versions of these
   programs. you can [6]download the programs from this location. we also
   have [7]experimental versions of the programs as java applets written
   for us by julian devlin. [8]the answers to the odd-numbered problems
   are available from this website. we would be happy to provide the
   solutions to all of the exercises to instructors of courses that use
   this book. requests should be sent to jlsnell@dartmouth.edu. errata
   found since the second printing of the book can be found in [9]errata.
   we would appreciate hearing from you concerning additional corrections
   and suggestions for improvement. send comments to jlsnell@dartmouth.edu
   or cgrinst1@swarthmore.edu.

   contributions to the gnu version of our book.

[12]kemeny's constant: peter doyle.

   this discussion relates to exercise 24 in chapter 11 concerning
   "kemeny's constant" and the question: should peter have been given the
   prize?

[13]hedging huygens: peter doyle.

   in the historical remarks for section 6.1, grinstead and snell describe
   huygen's approach to expected value. the were based on huygen's book
   the value of all chances in games of fortune which can also be found
   [14]here. peter reworks hygen's discussion to show connections with
   modern ideas such fair markets and hedging. he illustrate the
   limitation of hedging using a variant of the st. petersburg paradox.

[15]a local limit theorem for sampling without replacement: mark pinsky

   in feller's introduction to id203 theory and its applications,
   volume 1, 3d ed, p. 194, exercise 10, there is formulated a version of
   the local limit theorem which is applicable to the hypergeometric
   distribution, which governs sampling without replacement. in the
   simpler case of sampling with replacement, the classical
   demoivre-laplace theorem is applicable. feller's conditions seem too
   stringent for applications and are difficult t to prove. it is the
   purpose of this note to re-formulate and prove a suitable limit theorem
   with broad applicability to sampling from a finite population which is
   suitably large in comparison to the sample size.


additional resources for teaching an introductory id203 course.

     * [16]

  chance website
       here you will find a number of resources useful in teaching an
       elemenatary id203 or statistics course. here you will find
       videos of chance lectures given by experts in subjects reported
       regularly in the news such as medical studies, gambling, dna
       fingerprinting etc. in addition your will find the archives of
       chance news reporting on current events in the news that use
       concepts from id203 or statistics. the reports include
       possible discussion questions and in many cases links to other
       related resources.
     * [17]the id203 web
       the id203 web is a collection of id203 resources on the
       world wide web (www) maintained by [18]bob dobrow. at carleton
       college. the pages are designed to be especially helpful to
       researchers, teachers, and people in the id203 community. see
       in particular the [19]teaching resources page.
     * [20]using lotteries in teaching chance course a discussion of
       id203 problems related to the power ball lottery.
     * [21]

  programs that can be run by a browser (applets, vrml, etc.)
       these are programs to demonstrate basic ideas of id203 and
       statistics that can be run from the web using one of the standard
       browsers. we will try to keep here only programs that work and do
       not crash your computer too often.
     * [22]

  chance magazine
       this is the homepage for chance magazine. this is a magazine of the
       american statistical association published by springer-verlag.
       chance magazine may be considered the "scientific american" of
       id203 and statistics.
     * [23]

  david griffeath's "primordial soup kitchen"
       a source for all that's new in interacting particle systems. each
       week you find a new and beautiful graphical picture and the recipe
       that produced it. show your students what fun they can have if they
       continue their study of id203.
     * [24]

  mathematica program for renewal theory and gott-caves theories for estimating
  future lifetimes.
       here you will find a mathematica program to assist in the study of
       renewal theory discussed in terms of a passenger arriving at a bus
       stop. the user inputs the interarrival time. the program then
       simulates the process and graphs the empirical distributions for
       the interarrival time, the time since the last bus, the time until
       the next bus and the time until the next bus given the time since
       the last bus. the program also simulates the related gott-cave
       method for estimating the future livetime of a pheonomenon when we
       know the current lifetime of this phenomenon. see chance news
       [25]9.03 and [26]9.04 and [27]9.05 for a discussion of the
       gotts-cave problem

     * [28]don piele's id203 course. don piele has here mathematica
       notebooks for each of the chapters of our book. the notebooks
       implement the programs used in the book. students are asked to run
       the programs and to answer questions related to the output. the
       workbooks are designed to allow the students to carry out
       simulations and calculations without writing programs though the
       code for the basic programs are provided. under special topics you
       will find mathematica notebooks related to interesting id203
       problems. at this time this includes the wheaties box top problem
       and a game based on a variation of the musical chairs. while these
       workbooks were suggested by our book they would be a useful
       supplement to any introductory id203 book.
