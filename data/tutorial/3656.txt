tensorflow reproductions: big deep simple mnist

   [12]june 8, 2016 [13]charles h martin, phd [14]uncategorized [15]leave
   a comment

   i am starting a new project to try and reproduce some core deep
   learning papers in [16]tensorflow from some of the big names.

   the motivation:   to understand how to build very deep networks and why
   they do (or don   t) work.

   there are several papers that caught my eye, starting with
     * [17]deep big simple neural nets excel on handwritten digit
       recognition (2010)
          + i can find no implementation or data
     * [18]unifying distillation and privileged information (2015)
          + also called student-teacher learning
          + there is [19]an implementation, but it is unclear what data
            was used

   these papers set the foundation for looking at much larger, deeper
   networks such as
     * [20]resnet (deep residual learning)
          + there are several tensorflow implementations.  i don   t know
            which is best
     * [21]id199
          + see [22]jim flemming   s post on a tensorflow implementation
     * and [23]fractalnet.
          + an implementation is needed

   fractalnet   s are particularly interesting since they suggest that very
   deep networks do not need student-teacher learning, and, instead, can
   be self similar.  (which is related to very recent work on the
   [24]statistical physics of deep learning, and the [25]reid172
   group analogy).

   imho,  it is not enough just to implement the code; the results have to
   be excellent as well. i am not impressed with the results i have seen
   so far, and i would like to flush out what is really going on.

big deep simple nets

   the 2010 paper still appears to be 1 of the top 10 results on mnist:

   [26]http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_dat
   asets_results.html

   the idea is simple. they claim to get state-of-the-art accuracy on
   mnist using a 5-layer mlp, but running a large number of epochs with
   just sgd, a decaying learning rate, and an augmented data set.

   the key idea is that the augmented data set can provide, in practice,
   an infinite amount of training data.  and having infinite data means
   that we never have to worry about overtraining because we have too many
   adjustable parameters, and therefore any reasonable size network will
   do the trick if we just run it long enough.

   in other words, there is no convolution gap,  no need for early
   stopping, or really no id173 at all.

   this sounds dubious to me, but i wanted to see for myself.  also,
   perhaps i am missing some subtle detail.  did they clip gradients
   somewhere ?   is the activation function central ?  do we need to tune
   the learning rate decay ?

   i  have [27]initial notebooks on github,  and would welcome feedback
   and contributions, plus ideas for other papers to reproduce.

   i am trying to repeat this experiment using tensorflow and 2 kinds of
   augmented data sets:
     * [28]infimnist (2006)     provides nearly 1b deformations of mnist
     * [29]alignmnist (2016)     provides 75-150 epochs of deformed mnist

   (and let me say a special personal thanks to [30]s  ren hauberg for
   providing this recent data set)

   i would like to try other methods, such as the [31]keras data
   augmentation library (see below), or even the recent [32]data
   generation library coming out of openai.

   current results are up for
     * [33]2 layer alignmnist   75 epochs
     * [34]5 layeralignmnist   75 epochs
     * [35]2 layer infimnist   500 epochs
     * 5[36] layer infimnist   500 epochs

   the initial results indicate that alignmnist is much better that
   infimnist for this simple mlp, although i still do not see the
   extremely high, top-10 accuracy reported.

   furthermore, the 5-layer infimnist actually diverges after ~100 epochs.
    so we still need early stopping, even with an infinite amount of data.

   it may be interesting try using the keras imagedatagenerator class,
   described in this related blog on    [37]building powerful image
   classification models using very little data   

   also note that [38]the openai group as released a new paper and
   [39]code for creating data used in id3
   (gans).

   i will periodically update this blog as new data comes in, and i have
   the time to implement these newer techniques.

   next, we will check in the log files and discuss the tensorboard
   results.

   comments, criticisms, and contributions are very welcome.
