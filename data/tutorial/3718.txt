   the deep learning benchmarks

   see: [75]https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/101

   [del: come back here on june 15th, 2016. :del]
   a bit delayed due to y'know -- a lot of co-ordination among groups.

networks

images

     * inceptionv3-batchnorm ([76]http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567 ,
       [77]https://gist.github.com/soumith/e18a56b847a8905a84fffb1f32b06db
       8, [78]https://github.com/moodstocks/inception-v3.torch)
     * alexnet-owt
     * vgg-d
     * resnet-50 ( [79]http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 ,
       [80]https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch )

video

     * c3d - a vgg-style 3d net ( [81]http://vlg.cs.dartmouth.edu/c3d/ )

audio

     * deepspeech2 - convnet + id56 + fc (
       [82]http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595 )
     * msr's 5 layer fc net (
       [83]https://github.com/alexey-kamenev/benchmarks )

text

     * small id56 lstm (
       [84]https://github.com/karpathy/char-id56/blob/master/train.lua#l38-
       l48 )
     * large id56 lstm ( big-lstm in [85]http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02410 )

platform

     * initially multi-gpu with (1 to 4 titan-x cards)
     * however, multi-machine, custom hardware, other gpu cards such as
       amd, cpus etc. can and should be accommodated, we will work this
       out after the initial push.

metrics

     * round-trip time for 1 epoch of training (will define an epoch size
       separately for each network)
     * maximum batch-size that fits (to show and focus on the extra memory
       consumption that the framework uses)

frameworks

   everyone who wants to join-in, but i thought an initial set that is
   important to cover would be:
     * caffe
     * chainer
     * cntk
     * mxnet
     * neon
     * theano
     * tensorflow
     * torch

scripts format

     * emit json output (so that the readme -- or jekyll website can be
       auto-generated, similar to
       [86]http://autumnai.com/deep-learning-benchmarks )

guarantees

     * i will personally to the best of my abilities make sure that the
       benchmarking is fair and unbiased. the hope is that the community
       at large will watch these and point-out / fix mistakes.

governance

     * the benchmarks will be placed at
       [87]https://github.com/deepmark/deepmark and other key community
       members / organizations who want ownership will be welcome to join
       in proposing new benchmarks that get relevant as the field
       progresses.
