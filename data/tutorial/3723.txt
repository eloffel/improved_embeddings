darkforest, the facebook go engine

   update[12/11/2017] darkforestgo has been incorporated into elf
   [96]platform.

   update: the training code is open source now. see below for detailed
   instructions.

   darkforest is a go game engine powered by deep learning and developed
   at facebook ai research.
     * [97]it has a stable rank of 5d on the kgs servers
     * [98]pure policy network achieves a stable rank of 3d on kgs
     * [99]it received the 3rd place in the kgs go tournament
     * [100]it received the 2nd place in uec computer go cup

   we hope that releasing the source code and pre-trained [101]models are
   beneficial to the community.

   details of the engine are given in our [102]paper and [103]poster, and
   if you use our engine in future research, cite our paper:

   [104]architecture

   although darkforest is standalone and does not depend on external
   libraries, some portions of the tactics and pattern code were inspired
   by the pachi [105]engine.

build

   dependencies:
    1. install [106]torch7.
    2. [107]install cuda / cudnn
    3. install a few packages

luarocks install class
luarocks install image
luarocks install tds
luarocks install cudnn

   this program supports 1 to 4 gpus.

   then just compile with the following command:
sh ./compile.sh

   gcc 4.8+ is required. depending on the location of your c++ compiler,
   please change the script accordingly. tested in centos 6.5 and ubuntu
   14.04, 15.04.

   install gcc-4.9 as a second compiler and create symlink as:
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 /usr/local/cuda/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-4.9 /usr/local/cuda/bin/g++

   during the installation of torch and cudnn, either change the build
   script or replace symlink at /usr/bin/cc with:
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 /usr/bin/cc

   more info at
   ([108]http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6622454/cuda-incompatible-with
   -my-gcc-version)

   after the compilation cc symlink can be reverted back to latest
   version.

   if you get errors like:
these bindings are for version 5005 or above ...

   download latest cudnn from nvidia at
   ([109]https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download), registration
   required.

usage

   step 1: download the models.

   create ./models directory and download trained [110]models.

   step 2: first run the gpu server
cd ./local_evaluator
sh id98_evaluator.sh [num_gpu] [pipe file path]

     * num_gpu the number of gpus (1-8) you have for the current machine.
     * pipe file path the path that the pipe file is settled. default is
       /data/local/go. if you have specific other path, then you need to
       specify the same when running id98playermctsv2.lua

   example: sh id98_evaluator.sh 4 /data/local/go

   step 3: run the main program
cd ./id98playerv2
th id98playermctsv2.lua [options]

   see id98playerv2/id98playermctsv2.lua for a lot of options. for a simple
   first run (assuming you have 4 gpus), you could use:
th id98playermctsv2.lua --num_gpu [num_gpu] --time_limit 10

   or (if you want to use a set of plausibly good parameters):
th id98playermctsv2.lua --use_formal_params --num_gpu [num_gpu] --time_limit 10

   to load an existing game up to move 23:
th id98playermctsv2.lua [other_options] --setup_board "/path/to/sgf 23"

   when you are in the interactive environment, type
     * clear_board to clear the board
     * genmove b to genmove the black move.
     * play w q4 to play a move at q4 for specific color.
     * quit to quit.

   a complete game may look like:
clear_board
[mcts initialization ...]
place_free_handicap 3
genmove b
[mcts generates moves..e.g., it returns q16]
play w d4
genmove b
[mcts generates moves...]
quit

   for more commands, please use command list_commands, check the details
   of [111]gtp protocol or take a look at the source code.

training

   to train the policy network from scratch, please run ./train.sh. 1 gpu
   is needed. please install torchnet first (e.g., luarocks install
   torchnet).

differences with the award-winning versions

   the difference between this open source version (a) and that in
   kgs/competitions (b) is the following:
     * (a) runs on a single machine and uses pipe as client/server
       communications. (b) uses thrift rpc services as a way to
       communicate.
     * (b) uses more computational resources.
     * we might have tuned parameters for (b) extensively, but not for
       (a). we will give the tip of parameter tuning soon.

troubleshooting

   q: my program hanged on genmove/quit, what happened? a: make sure you
   run the gpu server under ./local_evaluator, the server remains active
   and the pipe file path matches between the server and the client.

   if you have any questions or find any bugs, please open a github issue
   by clicking "issues" tab and then click "new issue".

code overview

   the system consists of the following parts.
     * ./id98playerv2 lua (terminal) interface for go.

    1. id98playerv3.lua run pure-did98 player
    2. id98playermctsv2.lua run player with did98 + mcts

     * ./board things about board and its evaluations. board data
       structure and different playout policy.
     * ./mctsv2 implementation of id169
     * ./local_evaluator simple gpu-based server. communication with
       search threads via pipe.
     * ./utils simple utilities, e.g., read/write sgf files.
     * ./test test utilities.
     * ./train training code
     * ./dataset dataset used for training. please download them [112]here
       and save to the ./dataset directory.
     * ./models all pre-trained models. please download them [113]here and
       save to the ./models directory.
     * ./sgfs some exemplar sgf files.
