pid56

   a fast implementation of recurrent neural network layers in cuda.

introduction

   for a gpu, the largest source of on-chip memory is distributed among
   the individual register files of thousands of threads. for example, the
   nvidia titanx gpu has 6.3 mb of register file memory, which is enough
   to store a recurrent layer with approximately 1200 activations.
   persistent kernels exploit this register file memory to cache recurrent
   weights and reuse them over multiple timesteps.

   avoiding reloading layer weights multiple times makes persistent
   kernels very efficient at low batch sizes.

performance

   [89]titanx performance

   performance of the cuda implementation is approximately 15x faster than
   an id56 implementation using cublas for gemm operations at a mini-batch
   size of 4. there is still some room to improve performance compared
   with our previous implementation, which was written directly in
   assembly. a cuda implementation has the advantage that it is much
   easier to support more types of gpus.

limitations in the current release

     * no support for gru or lstm layer types
     * these may be added in the future. we would welcome pull requests
       that add support.
     * the maximum layer size is determined by the selected gpu
     * 1152 for titanx/m40
     * 1792 for gp100
          + 2432 in 16-bit floating point
     * only the following gpus are supported (titanx/m40, geforce 1080
       gtx, gp100)
     * support for new gpus can be enabled by determining good tile sizes
       and adding them to recurrent_ops.cu .
     * the layer size must be a multiple of 4.
     * the mini-batch size must be 3 or greater.
     * the input data must be 16-byte aligned.

interface

   the c language interface is in [90]include/persistent_id56.h. it
   supports gpu execution, and you can specify the cuda stream if running
   on the gpu. we took care to ensure that the library does not perform
   memory allocation internally, in order to avoid synchronizations and
   overheads caused by memory allocation.

   the interface is modeled after the recurrent layer interface in cudnn
   v5 to make it easy to integrate with frameworks that already interface
   with cudnn. the cudnn interface is more general than the capabilities
   provided by this library, and api calls that attempt to use unsupported
   features will return pid56_not_supported, see the limitations section
   for details.

implementation

   see [91]include/pid56/detail/id56/recurrent_ops_kernels.h for the kernel
   implementations.

compilation

   pid56 has been tested on ubuntu 14.04 and osx 10.10. windows is not
   supported at this time.

   first get the code:
git clone https://github.com/baidu-research/persistent-id56.git
cd persistent-id56

   create a build directory:
mkdir build_local

   run scons and build:
scons mode=release install=true

   the c library should now be built along with test executables.

contributing

   we welcome improvements from the community, please feel free to submit
   pull requests.
