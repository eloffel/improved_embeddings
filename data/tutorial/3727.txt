   editor's note: cloud speech api is now generally available. learn more.

   following our announcements from gcp next in march, we   re excited to
   share updates about [15]cloud platform expansion and [16]machine
   learning. today we   re launching two new machine learning apis into open
   beta and expanding our footprint in the united states.

cloud machine learning apis enter open beta

   [17]google cloud platform unlocks the capability for enterprises to
   process unstructured data through machine learning. today, we   re
   announcing two new cloud machine learning products that are entering
   beta: [18]cloud natural language and [19]cloud speech apis.

   we spend a lot of time thinking about how [20]computer systems can
   [21]read in order [22]to process human language in [23]intelligent
   ways. for example, we most recently open-sourced syntaxnet (which
   includes [24]parsey mcparseface), a natural language model that
   analyzes the grammatical structure of text with the [25]best accuracy,
   speed and scale.

   the new [26]google cloud natural language api in open beta is based on
   our natural language understanding research. cloud natural language
   lets you easily reveal the structure and meaning of your text in a
   variety of languages, with initial support for english, spanish and
   japanese. it includes:
     * id31: understand the overall sentiment of a block of
       text
     * entity recognition: identify the most relevant entities for a block
       of text and label them with types such as person, organization,
       location, events, products and media
     * syntax analysis: identify parts of speech and create dependency
       parse trees for each sentence to reveal the structure and meaning
       of text

   the new api is optimized to meet the scale and performance needs of
   developers and enterprises in a broad range of industries. for example,
   digital marketers can analyze online product reviews or service centers
   can determine sentiment from transcribed customer calls. we   ve also
   seen great results from our alpha customers, including british online
   marketplace [27]ocado technology.

   to see cloud natural language api in action, check out our [28]demo
   that uses cloud natural language to analyze top stories from the new
   york times.
   "google   s cloud natural language api has shown it can accelerate our
   offering in the natural language understanding area and is a viable
   alter native to a custom model we had built for our initial use case."-
   dan nelson, head of data, ocado technology

   [29]cloud speech api will also enter open beta today. enterprises and
   developers now have access to speech-to-text conversion in over 80
   languages, for both apps and iot devices. cloud speech api uses the
   voice recognition technology that has been powering your favorite
   products such as google search and google now.

   more than 5,000 companies signed up for speech api alpha, including:
     * [30]hyperconnect, a video chat app with over 50 million downloads
       in over 200 countries, uses a combination of our cloud speech and
       [31]translate api to automatically transcribe and translate
       conversations between people who speak different languages.
     * [32]voicebase, a leader in speech analytics as a service, uses
       speech api to let developers surface insights and predict outcomes
       from call recordings.

   this beta version adds new features based on customer feedback from
   alpha, such as:
     * word hints: custom words or phrases by context can be added to api
       calls to improve recognition. useful for both command scenarios
       (e.g., a smart tv listening for    rewind    and    fast-forward    when
       watching a movie) and adding new words to the dictionary (e.g.,
       recognizing names that may not be common in a specific language)
     * asynchronous calling: the api has been substantially simplified
       with new asynchronous calls that make developing voice-enabled apps
       easier and faster

   to use our newest machine learning apis in open beta and see more
   details about pricing, check out [33]cloud natural language and
   [34]cloud speech on our website.

google cloud platform expands on the north american west coast

   for cloud platform customers on the west coast of north america and
   canada, we   re pleased to announce our oregon cloud region (us-west1) is
   now open for business. this region initially includes three of our core
   offerings: [35]google compute engine, [36]google cloud storage and
   [37]google container engine, and features two compute engine zones to
   support high availability applications.

   our initial testing shows that users in cities such as vancouver,
   seattle, portland, san francisco and los angeles can expect to see a
   30-80% reduction in latency for applications served from us-west1,
   compared to us-central1.

   one industry where latency is critical is gaming. players of today   s
   premium games expect twitch-fast networks to enable immersive,
   real-time gaming experiences. [38]multiplay is a unique video game
   hosting specialist behind many of today   s top aaa games. multiplay   s
   games hosted out of the new us-west1 data center ensures that players
   in the western region of north america have a consistent, fast user
   experience on top of google cloud platform.
   "regional latency is a major factor in the gaming experience. google
   cloud platform   s network is one of the best we   ve worked with, from a
   tech perspective but also in terms of the one-on-one support we   ve
   received from the team."- paul manuel, director of multiplay game
   services

   and as we announced in march, tokyo will be coming online later this
   year and we will announce more than 10 additional regions in 2017. for
   a current list of gcp regions, please have a look at the [39]cloud
   locations page.
