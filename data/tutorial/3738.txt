bayareadlschool

   this repository contains the slides and exercises for the theano
   tutorial at the [75]deep learning school in stanford, september 24-25,
   2016.

installation instructions

   the tutorials are written in python, using [76]theano. they are
   designed to be run locally on a laptop, without using a gpu.

python and dependencies

   the simplest way to install a python software stack with most
   dependencies is to use [77]anaconda.

   for windows users, please use the python 2.7 version (or use a conda
   environment with python 3.4), as theano does not support pyton 3.5 on
   windows yet.

   first, download and execute the installer. you can install it as a user
   (you do not have to use sudo). we recommend that you let the installer
   make anaconda the default python version.

   then, in a terminal:
$ conda update conda

additional steps for windows

   these additional steps are required for windows:
     * download [78]git, and execute the installer. this will be necessary
       to get the latest version of theano and fuel. we recommand you
       select "use git from the windows command prompt" option, so you can
       execute all the following command lines from the regular windows
       cmd shell.
     * install a c++ compiler and python dll. from a shell:
conda install mingw libpython

optional: additional step to display the graphics

   if you do not follow these steps, the pydotprint command will raise an
   exception and fail, but the other functionalities of theano would still
   work.

on ubuntu/debian

$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
$ pip install pydot-ng

on fedora, centos, red hat enterprise

$ sudo yum install graphviz
$ pip install pydot-ng

on macos

     * download graphviz from
       [79]http://www.graphviz.org/download_macos.php
     * then, from a terminal:
$ pip install pydot-ng

on windows

     * download graphviz from
       [80]http://www.graphviz.org/download_windows.php
     * add to the path environment variable the directory where the
       binaries were installed, by default c:\program files
       (x86)\graphviz2.38\bin
     * then, from a terminal:
pip install pydot-ng

theano

   there have been some improvement and bug fixes since the last release,
   so we will use the latest development version from github.

   use --user if you installed anaconda for all users and only want to
   install theano for the current user.
$ pip install git+git://github.com/theano/theano.git [--user]

   note

   if you are using windows and selected "use git from git bash only" when
   installing git, or if the command above failed because git is not
   available in the path, then you need to run the command line above from
   the "git bash" terminal instead of the regular windows command prompt.

fuel

   the lstm tutorial relies on [81]fuel for on-the-fly data processing. we
   install the development version of fuel from github.
$ pip install git+git://github.com/mila-udem/fuel.git [--user]

   if the command above failed with
.. error:: could not find a local hdf5 installation.
you may need to explicitly state where your local hdf5 headers and
library can be found by setting the ``hdf5_dir`` environment
variable or by using the ``--hdf5`` command-line option.

   run the following command and try again
$ conda install h5py pytables

   or, on macos
$ brew install homebrew/science/hdf5

get and run these tutorials

   first, clone this repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/lamblin/bayareadlschool.git

   to use the jupyter notebooks, you have to launch the jupyter server on
   the base directory:
$ jupyter notebook bayareadlschool

   a new window or tab should open in your web browser. if it does not (or
   if you want to use it in a different browser), the previous command
   should mention a url you can open, probably [82]http://localhost:8888/.
   from there, you can navigate to the .ipynb files.
