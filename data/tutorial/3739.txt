   this is a collection of 15 basic descriptive statistics key terms,
   explained in easy to understand language, along with an example and
   some python code for computing simple descriptive statistics.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [37]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   statistics, though a central set of tools for data science, are often
   overlooked in favor of more solidly technical skills like programming.
   even machine learning learning algorithms, with their reliance on
   mathematical concepts such as algebra and calculus -- not to mention
   statistics! -- are often treated at a higher level than is required to
   appreciate the underlying math, leading, perhaps, to "data scientists"
   who lack a fundamental understanding of one of the key aspects of their
   profession.

   this post won't resolve the discrepancy between knowing and not knowing
   the absolute basics of statistics. however, if you are unable to fully
   understand the basic descriptive statistics terminology included
   herein, you are definitely lacking foundational knowledge that is
   needed to build a whole series of much more robust and useful
   professional concepts on top of.

   statistics header

   so here is a collection of 15 basic descriptive statistics key terms,
   explained in easy to understand language. a comprehensive example
   follows, which includes a bit of python code. note that, as a basic
   introduction, mathematical representations and descriptions of the
   terms herein have been intentionally omitted.

   1. descriptive statistics

   descriptive statistics are a collection of statistical tools which are
   used to quantitatively describe or summarize a collection of data.
   descriptive statistics aim to summarize, and as such can be
   distinguished from inferential statistics, which are more predictive in
   nature.

   2. population

   a population is a selected individual or group representing the full
   set of members of a certain group of interest.

   3. sample

   a sample is a subset drawn from a larger population. if this drawing is
   accomplished in such a manner that each member of the population has an
   equitable chance of selection, the result is referred to as a random
   sample.

   4. parameter

   a parameter is a value which is generated from a population. if i had
   all the data of all humans on earth and generated the mean age, this
   value would be a parameter.

   5. statistic

   a statistic is a value which is generated from a sample. if i
   calculated the mean age of a subset of humans on planet earth (much
   more feasible), this value would be a statistic. hence, the discipline
   of statistics.

   6. generalizability

   generalizability refers tot he ability to draw conclusions about the
   characteristics of the population as a whole based on the results of
   data collected from a sample. this is ability is not a given, and
   depends heavily on the nature of sample collection, sample size, and
   various other factors.

   7. distribution

   a distribution is the arrangement of data by the values of one variable
   in order, from low to high. this arrangement, and its characteristics
   such as shape and spread, provide information about the underlying
   sample.

   8. mean

   mean, along with median and mode, is one of the 3 major measures of
   central tendency, which collectively evaluate an important and basic
   aspect of a distribution. the simple arithmetic average of a
   distribution of variable values (or scores), the mean provides a
   single, concise numerical summary of a distribution. the mean is also
   likely the most common statistics encountered in general research.
   population mean is denoted   , while sample mean is denoted x  .

   9. median

   the median is the score of a distribution residing at the 50th
   percentile, separating the top and bottom 50 percent of scores. the
   median is useful for both splitting a set of distribution scores in
   half and helping to identify the skew of a distribution.

   10. mode

   the mode is simply the score which appears most frequently in the
   distribution. multimodal refers to a distribution with more than one
   mode; bimodal refers to a distribution with 2 modes.

   11. skew

   when there are more scores toward one end of the distribution than the
   other, this results in skew. when the scores of a distribution are more
   clustered at the high end, the relatively fewer number of scores on the
   low end result in a tail, with the scenario being referred to as
   negative skew. positive skew is when a distribution shows a tail at its
   high end.

   in general, in a negatively skewed distribution, we would expect the
   mean to be less than the median, while in a positively skewed
   distribution, we would expect the mean to be greater than the median.

   12. range

   one of the most important measures of dispersion, the range is the
   difference between the maximum and minimum values of a distribution.

   13. variance

   variance is the statistical average of the dispersion of scores in a
   distribution. variance is not often used on its own, but can be a
   useful calculation on the way to a more descriptive statistical
   measurement, such as standard deviation.

   14. standard deviation

   the standard deviation of a distribution is the average deviation
   between individual distribution scores and the distribution's mean.
   individually, the standard deviation provides a good measure of how
   spread out a disquisitions scores are. when considered alongside the
   mean, these 2 measures provides a good overview of the distribution of
   scores.

   15. interquartile range (iqr)

   the iqr is the difference between the score delineating the 75th
   percentile and the 25th percentile, the third and first quartiles,
   respectively.


   below is a simple python module for computing much of the descriptive
   statistics discussed above, followed by an example.

descriptive statistics for distribution:

[ 1  4  5  6  8  8  9 10 10 11 11 13 13 13 14 14 15 15 15 15]

number of scores: 20
number of unique scores: 11
sum: 210
min: 1
max: 15
range: 14
mean: 10.5
median: 11.0
mode: 15
variance: 16.15
standard deviation: 4.01870625948
1st quartile: 8.0
3rd quartile: 14.0
distribution skew: -0.714152479663
