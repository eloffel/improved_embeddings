named entity extraction[27]  

   named entity extraction task aims to extract phrases from plain text
   that correpond to entities. polyglot recognizes 3 categories of
   entities:
     * locations (tag: i-loc): cities, countries, regions, continents,
       neighborhoods, administrative divisions    
     * organizations (tag: i-org): sports teams, newspapers, banks,
       universities, schools, non-profits, companies,    
     * persons (tag: i-per): politicians, scientists, artists, atheletes    

languages coverage[28]  

   the models were trained on datasets extracted automatically from
   wikipedia. polyglot currently supports 40 major languages.

example[30]  

   entities inside a text object or a sentence are represented as chunks.
   each chunk identifies the start and the end indices of the word
   subsequence within the text.
from polyglot.text import text

blob = """the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has warned that iran pos
es a "threat to the entire world"."""
text = text(blob)

# we can also specify language of that text by using
# text = text(blob, hint_language_code='en')

   we can query all entities mentioned in a text.
text.entities

[i-org([u'israeli']), i-per([u'benjamin', u'netanyahu']), i-loc([u'iran'])]

   or, we can query entites per sentence
for sent in text.sentences:
  print(sent, "\n")
  for entity in sent.entities:
    print(entity.tag, entity)

the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has warned that iran poses a "thre
at to the entire world".

i-org [u'israeli']
i-per [u'benjamin', u'netanyahu']
i-loc [u'iran']

   by doing more careful inspection of the second entity benjamin
   netanyahu, we can locate the position of the entity within the
   sentence.
benjamin = sent.entities[1]
sent.words[benjamin.start: benjamin.end]

wordlist([u'benjamin', u'netanyahu'])
