   in an age when technology companies routinely introduce new forms of
   everyday magic, one problem that remains seemingly unsolved is that of
   long-form transcription. sure, voice dictation for documents has been
   conquered by nuance's dragon software. our phones and smart home
   devices can understand fairly complex commands, thanks to
   [37]self-teaching recurrent neural nets and other 21st century wonders.
   however, the task of providing accurate transcriptions of long blocks
   of actual human conversation remains beyond the abilities of even
   today's most advanced software.

   when solved on a broad scale, it is a problem that might unlock vast
   archives of oral histories, make podcasts easier to consume for
   speed-readers (tl;dl), and be a world-changing boon for journalists
   everywhere, liberating precious hours of sweet life. it could make
   youtube text-searchable. it would be a fantasy come true for
   researchers. it would usher a dystopia for others, providing a [38]new
   form of textual panopticon. (though with mattel's
   [39]voice-recognition-driven hello barbie that listens to the children
   playing with it, the dystopia might already be here.) researchers say
   that functional transcription is only a matter of time, though the
   amount of time remains a very open question.

     the task of providing accurate transcriptions of long blocks of
     actual human conversation remains beyond the abilities of even
     today's most advanced software.

   "we used to joke that, depending who you ask, id103 is
   either solved or impossible," says gerald friedland, the director of
   the audio and multimedia lab at the international computer science
   institute, affiliated with uc berkeley. "the truth is somewhere in
   between." the range of answers about the future of speaker-independent
   transcription of spontaneous human speech suggests that the joke falls
   into the category it's funny 'cuz it's true.

   "if you have people transcribe conversational speech over the
   telephone, the error rate is around 4 percent," says xuedong huang, a
   senior scientist at microsoft, whose [40]project oxford has provided a
   public api for budding voice recognition entrepreneurs to play with.
   "if you put all the systems together   ibm and google and microsoft and
   all the best combined   amazingly the error rate will be around 8
   percent." huang also estimates commercially available systems are
   probably closer to 12 percent. "this is not as good as humans," huang
   admits, "but it's the best the speech community can do. it's about as
   twice as bad as humans."

   however, huang is quick to add that this error rate is phenomenal when
   compared to where the field was just five years ago. and it's here
   where he begins to get audibly excited.

   xd huang has been researching the problem of voice recognition for over
   30 years, first at tsinghua university in beijing in the early '80s.
   "we had this dream of having a natural conversation with a computer,"
   huang says, recounting a long series of "magic moments" and benchmarks,
   at [41]raj reddy's pioneering lab at carnegie mellon, and beginning at
   microsoft in 1995. huang covered the progress, co-authoring a paper
   with reddy and dragon systems' jim baker in a the january 2014 issue of
   communications of acm titled "[42]a historical perspective on speech
   recognition."

   "ten years ago, it was probably an 80 percent [error] rate!" he says.
   "to have an error reduction from 80 percent [down to] 10 percent and
   now we're approaching 8 percent! if we can keep the trend for the next
   two or three years, something magic is absolutely going to happen.
   predictions are always hard, but based on historical data, tracking
   records of the community, not one person... in the next two or three
   years, i think we will be approaching human parity in transcribing
   speech over a typical mobile phone setting."

   carl case, a research scientist on the machine learning team at baidu,
   works on the chinese web giant's own id103 system,
   [43]deep speech.

   "we've made some very good progress in deep speech with
   state-of-the-art speech systems in english and chinese," case says.
   "but i still think there's work to do to go from 'works for some people
   in some contexts' to actually just works the same way you and i can
   have this conversation, having never met, over a relatively noisy phone
   line and have no problem understanding one another." case and his
   associates have been testing their technology in windy cars, with music
   playing in the background, and under other adverse conditions. like
   their colleagues at microsoft, they have released their api to the
   public, partly in the name of science, and partly because the more
   users it has, the better it gets.

economy of words

   for freelancers and other types who want transcriptions and can't
   afford the $1 minute rate of traditional transcriptionists, solutions
   exist. however, none of them are exactly perfect. programmer (and
   occasional wired contributor) andy baio [44]wrote a script to slice an
   audio interview into one-minute chunks, upload the pieces to amazon's
   mechanical turk, and outsource the job of transcribing those one-minute
   chunks to a platoon of humans. it saves money, but there's a
   not-insignificant amount of prep and clean-up required. ([45]casting
   words seems to have built a business model on the same technique,
   though it lands right back at the $1 per minute rate.) for an easier to
   operate crowdsourced interface, there is also the sharing-economy-era
   site [46]transcribeme, transcriptions provided by a small army of
   manual transcribers, heeding the company's call to "monetize your
   downtime."

   a freely available [47]voice transcription tool is likewise built-in to
   google docs for those who would care to experiment. you can play
   recorded audio on your computer, and the system will do its best to
   make the proper text appear in a google doc. for the five phone
   interviews conducted for this article, recorded via skype, only one
   subject spoke slowly and clearly enough to even register as
   recognizably transcribed text, with an error rate of roughly 15
   percent. those who only want to transcribe podcasts might have better
   luck.

   where currently available transcription technology can't handle
   multiple voices or background chaos, reliable software like nuance's
   dragon [48]naturallyspeaking (also an outgrowth of reddy's lab at
   carnegie mellon) has become quite capable at trained single voices.
   david byron, editorial director of speech technology magazine suggests
   a technique called "parroting": listening to a recording in real-time
   and repeating its text back into the microphone for the software to
   transcribe. it saves some typing, but is far from instantaneous   and
   still forces interviewers to relive their most awkward interview
   moments.

speech impediments

   one person who has doubts about the imminent arrival of long-form
   transcription technology is roger zimmerman, chief of research and
   development at [49]3play media, perhaps the only company currently
   offering a commercial application for automated long-form
   transcription. using a combination of apis provided by vendors
   zimmerman said he could not disclose, 3play's initial transcriptions
   average around 80 percent accuracy   sometimes much more, sometimes much
   less   and are corrected by human transcribers before being sent to
   customers. "id103 technology is not anywhere near human
   capability," zimmerman says, "and won't be for many, many years, my
   guess is decades still."

   "humans do not speak like text," says zimmerman, who has been working
   with speech technology since the 1980s, when he landed a job at the
   voice processing corporation, an offshoot of mit. "i've hesitated, i've
   corrected, i've gone back and repeated, and to the extent that you have
   disorganized spontaneous speech, the language model is unsuited for
   that. it's the weak component. it's the component of the system now
   that's dependent on fundamental artificial intelligence. what they've
   done with acoustic modeling is signal processing-oriented, and it is
   well framed, these new deep neural networks, they understand what
   they're doing when they decode an acoustic signal, but they don't
   really understand what a language model needs to do to mimic human
   languaging process. they're using number-crunching to address a much
   higher artificial intelligence problem which has really not been solved
   yet."

   but "it's not *thaaat *hard," suggests jim glass, a senior research
   scientist at mit who leads the spoken language systems group and who
   serves as an advisor to 3play. glass says, in fact, that the technology
   is already here. "the way to think of this problem is [to ask] what
   error rate is tolerable for your needs, so if you're skimming through
   the transcript and could jump back to the audio to verify it, you might
   be willing to tolerate a certain amount of errors. the technology is
   good enough today to do that. it would take somebody to decide that
   they want to make that capability available."

   "part of the problem historically with speech technology is companies
   figuring out how to make money off of it, and i don't know if they've
   figured out how to do that yet," glass says. he points out that there
   are toolkits available for developers who would like to play with the
   nascent technology.

enriching discussion

   the piece that has yet to be combined into commercially available
   transcription like google voice is known as "two party diarization," a
   speaker-independent system that can determine who is speaking and what
   they are saying. one person speaking clearly is one thing, but two
   people engaging in lively discourse is another entirely. and it is a
   problem that has been solved, in part, at least in the bounds of
   scientific research. there is a whole field devoted to it, "rich
   transcription." in 2012, the institute of electrical and electronics
   dedicated a whole issue of their journal, transactions on audio,
   speech, and language processing, to "[50]new frontiers in rich
   transcription."

     part of the problem historically with speech technology is companies
     figuring out how to make money off of it, and i don't know if
     they've figured out how to do that yet.

   jim glass, senior research scientist at mit

   over a relatively clean phone line, technology could identify the
   speaker about 98 percent of the time, says gerald friedland, who headed
   the diarization project at the nonprofit icsi, as the group
   participated in trials run by the national institute of standards and
   technology. running the [51]meeting recorder project to test group
   recording situations, icsi confirmed that once the microphone is no
   longer the close-range type provided by phones, the error rate shoots
   up to anywhere between 15 percent and 100 percent. friedland points out
   the range of problems that have to be addressed once one goes past the
   relatively clean speech of broadcast news into the type of long-form
   speech that many researchers work with today.

   he says, "if you put your cell phone on the table and try to record
   everything that's being said and then try to transcribe it, you have a
   combination of many of these problems: new vocabulary [words], the
   cocktail party noise problem, regular noise, people overlapping, and
   people never speak perfectly. it's got coughs and laughs and there
   might be yelling and there might be whispering. it becomes very
   diverse." two voice spectrums that often cause chaos in diarization
   studies fail tests are children and the elderly.

   "you can combine these scenarios," he says. "i think all of this
   guarantees that a perfect speech recognizer that just listens in like a
   human will not be achieved in a reasonable time. you and i will
   probably not see that."

   which shouldn't be interpreted to mean that we're not living in the
   golden age of speech technology. this month, friedland helped launch
   movi, a [52]kickstarted speech recognizer/voice synthesizer for arduino
   that operates without the use of the cloud. "it doesn't use the
   internet," friedland says. "you don't have to use the cloud to do
   recognition. it can work with a couple hundred sentences and it
   adapts." he laughs at sony, apple, google, microsoft, and other
   companies that send speech into the cloud for processing. "all of this
   is exploiting the fact that people think [voice recognition] is so hard
   that it has to get done in the cloud. if you have one speaker speaking
   into a computer, we should consider this problem solved."

   for now, friedland says, most transcription start-ups seem to be mainly
   licensing google's api and going from there. but the field and the
   market are wide open for innovation at every level, with bizarre kinds
   of unforeseen societal change coming as soon as a project succeeds.
