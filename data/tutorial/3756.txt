[86]project page and examples

   run trained deep neural networks in the browser or node.js. currently
   supports serialization from trained [87]keras models (note: not
   up-to-date with the current keras api).

   [88]build status [89]npm version

background

   training deep neural networks on any meaningful dataset requires
   massive computational resources and lots and lots of time. however, the
   forward-pass prediction phase is relatively cheap - typically there is
   no id26, computational graphs, id168s, or
   optimization algorithms to worry about.

   what do you do when you have a trained deep neural network and now wish
   to use it to power a part of your client-facing web application?
   traditionally, you would deploy your model on a server and call it from
   your web application through an api. but what if you can deploy it in
   the browser alongside the rest of your webapp? computation would be
   offloaded entirely to your end-user!

   perhaps most users will not be able to run billion-parameter networks
   in their browsers quite yet, but smaller networks are certainly within
   the realm of possibility.

   the goal of this project is to provide a lightweight javascript library
   that can take a serialized keras, caffe, torch or [insert other deep
   learning framework here] model, together with pre-trained weights, pack
   it in your webapp, and be up and running. currently supports
   serialization from trained [90]keras models.

examples

     * mnist multi-layer id88 / [91]src / [92]demo
     * cifar-10 vggnet-like convolutional neural network / [93]src /
       [94]demo
     * lstm recurrent neural network for classifying astronomical object
       names / [95]src / [96]demo

   you can also run the examples on your local machine at
   [97]http://localhost:8000:
$ npm run examples-server

usage

   see the source code of the examples above. in particular, the cifar-10
   example demonstrates a multi-threaded implementation using web workers.

   in the browser:
<script src="neocortex.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // use neural network here
</script>

   in node.js:
$ npm install neocortex-js

import neuralnet from 'neocortex-js';

   the core steps involve:
    1. instantiate neural network class

let nn = new neuralnet({
  // relative url in browser/webworker, absolute path in node.js
  modelfilepath: 'model.json',
  arraytype: 'float64', // float64 or float32
});

    2. load the model json file, then once loaded, feed input data into
       neural network

nn.init().then(() => {
  let predictions = nn.predict(input);
  // make use of predictions
});

build

   to build the project yourself, for both the browser (outputs to
   build/neocortex.min.js) and node.js (outputs to dist/):
$ npm install
$ npm run build

   to build just for the browser:
$ npm run build-browser

keras

   a script to serialize a trained [98]keras model together with its hdf5
   formatted weights is located in the [99]utils/ folder. it currently
   only supports sequential models with layers listed below.
   implementation of graph models is planned.

   functions and layers currently implemented are listed below. more
   forthcoming.
     * id180: linear, relu, sigmoid, hard_sigmoid, tanh,
       softmax
     * advanced activation layers: leakyrelulayer, parametricrelulayer,
       parametricsoftpluslayer, thresholdedlinearlayer,
       thresholdedrelulayer
     * basic layers: denselayer, dropoutlayer, flattenlayer, mergelayer
     * recurrent layers: rgrulayer (gated-recurrent unit or gru),
       rlstmlayer (long short-term memory or lstm)
     * convolutional layers: convolution2dlayer, maxpooling2dlayer,
       convolution1dlayer, maxpooling1dlayer
     * embedding layers: embeddinglayer (maps indices to corresponding
       embedding vectors)
     * id172 layers: batchid172layer

tests

$ npm test

   browser testing is planned.
