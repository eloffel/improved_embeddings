getting started with sonnet, deep mind   s deep learning library

   posted by[10]camron [11]april 10, 2017february 21, 2019

intro article to installing sonnet. mirroring what is on their github with a
little commentary.

overview

   deep mind released a new library built on top of tensorflow that
   abstracts building a network into simpler blocks. available here:
   [12]https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet this library was released april
   6th and already has 3000 stars on github (checked april 10th).

install

    1. install tensorflow

   to do this (i   m on macosx with python2.7) if you   re on another setup
   checkout [13]https://www.tensorflow.org/install/
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorfl
ow-1.0.1-py2-none-any.whl

   2. install bazel

   bazel is googles package builder. to install on mac with homebrew.
   anything else checkout
   [14]https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html
brew install bazel

   3. install sonnet

   sonnet does not yet support python3. there is a promising pull request
   already to set this up. but not as of april 10th 2017.
$ git clone --recursive [15]https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet
$ cd sonnet/tensorflow
$ ./configure
$ cd ../

   configure will ask you some questions about what installation you would
   like.

   now we will run the install script:
$ mkdir /tmp/sonnet
$ bazel build --config=opt :install
$ ./bazel-bin/install /tmp/sonnet

   after that is complete. took a couple minutes for me:
$ pip install /tmp/sonnet/*.whl

   now to test everything worked     
$ python
>>> import sonnet as snt
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> snt.resampler(tf.constant([0.]), tf.constant([0.]))

   we should see:
<tf.tensor 'resampler/resampler:0' shape=(1,) dtype=float32>

   congratulations you have now setup deep mind   s deep learning library on
   top of tensorflow
