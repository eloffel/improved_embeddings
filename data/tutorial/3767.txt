the long game towards understanding dialog

   by: alexandre lebrun, [34]antoine bordes, [35]leon bottou, [36]marco
   baroni

1building an effective dialog system

   at facebook ai research (fair), understanding dialogue is an ambitious
   and long-term ai research goal.

   a truly effective dialogue system will be an assistive technology that
   will likely include a chatbot-type of system being able to interact
   with people through natural language communication. this could help
   people better understand the world around them and communicate more
   effectively with others, effectively bridging communication gaps.
   researching and developing these kinds of technologies will only become
   more important as the amount of digital content continues to grow.

   the attempt to understand and interpret dialogue is not a new one. as
   far back as 20 years, there were several efforts to build a machine a
   person could talk to and teach how to have a conversation. these
   incorporated technology and engineering, but were single purposed with
   a very narrow focus, using pre-programmed scripted responses.

   thanks to progress in machine learning, particularly in the last few
   years, having ai agents being able to converse with people in natural
   language has become a more realistic endeavor that is garnering
   attention from both the research community and industry.

   however, most of today   s dialogue systems continue to be scripted:
   their natural language understanding module may be based on machine
   learning, but what they execute or answer is in general dictated by
   if/then statements or rules engines. while they are improvement on what
   existed decades ago, it is in large part due to the large databases of
   content used to create and script their responses.

tackling the challenge from both ends

   getting to a natural language dialogue state with a chatbot remains a
   challenge and will require a number of research breakthroughs. at fair
   we have chosen to tackle the problem from both ends: general ai and
   reasoning by machines through communication as well as conducting
   research grounded in current id71, using lessons learned from
   exposing actual chatbots to people. our strength lies in embracing the
   diversity that spans both approaches. from long-term, fundamental
   research like the [37]commai initiative, to shorter-term applied
   efforts such as [38]fasttext or facebook m. through these, combined
   with our team   s expertise across the ai spectrum, from deep learning
   for nlp to id23, id161, and engineering, we
   hope to deliver significant natural language dialog advancements.

   an important aspect of fair work on dialog is how we ground it in clear
   foundations:
     * strong baselines: advanced learning systems for nlp problems should
       effectively deliver a performance improvement relative to more
       traditional methods. to that end, we built [39]fasttext with the
       goal of providing the very best results achievable with relatively
       simple and well understood techniques.
     * clear(er) evaluations: evaluating id71 is a hard problem.
       at fair we came up with better tools to do just that. at iclr 2017,
       we are sharing findings and tools with the academic community on
       dialogue of our initiatives. these include the [40]commai
       environment [1] to train and evaluate reasoning models, and the
       babi tasks for dialog [4] which can be used to test end-to-end
       dialog models. thanks to our collaboration with facebook m, these
       tools have been tested with models in real production conditions.
     * open research: fair publishes almost all its research in
       conferences or through preprints. similarly, code and data,
       including the two evaluation initiatives cited above are released
       as open-source. just as there is diversity of work in fair, there
       is also tremendous diversity across the ai community. we believe
       that open dialog and shared tools and learnings will lead to bigger
       advancements overall.

making progress through shared learnings

   at iclr, we are presenting 7 papers that illustrate the quality,
   innovation and breadth of fair dialog research. lazaridou et al. [6]
   and the commai team [1] propose directions for having systems be able
   to discover and use basic communication skills, a first step towards
   artificial general intelligence. li et al. present two papers that
   study how end-to-end id71 can be improved by using ongoing
   live conversations to improve themselves [2, 5]. bordes et al.
   introduces the babi tasks for dialog [4] to test end-to-end dialog
   systems in goal-oriented scenarios. and we present two papers on
   machine reading by grave et al. [3] and henaff et al. [7] that push the
   boundaries of text understanding by machines.
