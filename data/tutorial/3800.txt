   natural language is an imperfect vehicle for meaning. on the one hand,
   some expressions can be interpreted in multiple ways; on the other
   hand, there are often many superficially divergent ways to express very
   similar meanings. semantic representations attempt to disentangle these
   two effects by exposing similarities and differences in how a word or
   sentence is interpreted. such representations, and algorithms for
   working with them, constitute a major research area in natural language
   processing.

   this course will examine semantic representations for natural language
   from a computational/nlp perspective. through readings, presentations,
   discussions, and hands-on exercises, we will put a semantic
   representation under the microscope to assess its strengths and
   weaknesses. for each representation we will confront questions such as:
   what aspects of meaning are and are not captured? how well does the
   representation scale to the large vocabulary of a language? what
   assumptions does it make about grammar? how language-specific is it? in
   what ways does it facilitate manual annotation and automatic analysis?
   what datasets and algorithms have been developed for the
   representation? what has it been used for? in spring 2017 the focus
   will be on the [9]id15 (amr); its
   relationship to other representations in the literature will also be
   considered. term projects will consist of (i) innovating on the
   representation's design, datasets, or analysis algorithms, or (ii)
   applying it to questions in linguistics or downstream nlp tasks.
