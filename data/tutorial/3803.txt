   a list of 10 useful github repositories made up of ipython (jupyter)
   notebooks, focused on teaching data science and machine learning.
   python is the clear target here, but general principles are
   transferable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [41]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   this post is made up of a collection of 10 github repositories
   consisting in part, or in whole, of ipython (jupyter) notebooks,
   focused on transferring data science and machine learning concepts.
   they go from introductory python material to deep learning with
   tensorflow and theano, and hit a lot of stops in between.

   oh, they're all python-focused. jupyter now includes support for a wide
   range of languages, but this list is old school, and is straight
   ipython notebook style material.

   so here they are: 10 useful ipython notebook github repositories in no
   particular order:

   ipython notebooks

   [42]example data science notebook

     repository of teaching materials, code, and data for my data
     analysis and machine learning projects

   this warmup notebook is from postdoctoral researcher [43]randal olson,
   who uses the common python ecosystem data analysis/machine
   learning/data science stack to work with the [44]iris dataset. it's a
   single notebook, but it's a good notebook to start with, as it whets
   your appetite for all tools analytic, including visualization. it also
   gets you focused on telling stories with data.

   [45]python machine learning book

     the "python machine learning" book code repository and info resource

   this is the accompanying code for the fantastic book [46]machine
   learning with python, by [47]sebastian raschka. i don't vouch for many
   materials, but i highly recommend this book. the repository is also
   fantastic, and a great resource unto itself. however, you would be
   well-advised to splurge and grab a copy of your own to fully understand
   the contents of the repo, and to fully embrace machine learning in the
   python ecosystem.

   [48]learn data science

     open content for self-directed learning in data science

   this is a collection of notebooks and datasets, primarily put together
   by [49]nitin borwankar, covering 4 algorithmic topics: linear
   regression, id28, id79s, and id116
   id91. these are seemingly non-nonsense tutorials, though likely
   useful mostly for the newcomer.

   [50]scikit-learn tutorial

     materials for my scikit-learn tutorial

   this repository, by [51]jake vanderplas, is aimed at teaching
   [52]scikit-learn in the context of several different machine learning
   algorithms. validation, density estimation with gaussian mixture
   models, and id84 with pca are a few of the more
   interesting topics covered; you also get standards like id116,
   regression, and classification, don't worry. the material is likely
   best-suited to a beginner in machine learning, or someone with some
   understanding looking to master scikit-learn.

   [53]machine learning

     python coded examples and documentation of machine learning
     algorithms

   [54]aaron masino has shared a series of very detailed, very technical
   machine learning ipython notebook learning resources. the notebooks of
   this simply-titled repository draw inspiration from andrew ng's machine
   learning course (stanford, coursera), tom mitchell's course (carnegie
   mellon), and christopher m. bishop's "pattern recognition and machine
   learning."

   [55]research computing meetup

     slides, code, and other information relating to the fall 2013
     meetups

   from uc boulder's research computing group, this older collection of
   notebooks (it's from way back in fall 2013) covers a wide range of
   material, with an apparent focus on linux command line-powered data
   management. a number of the common libraries are covered, as well as
   shell programming and linux command line basics, and at least one
   then-current paper was implemented using the python stack. it also
   seems to tackle a few kaggle competitions, so you get a little bit of a
   lot with this one.

   github social coding

   [56]theano tutorial

     a collection of tutorials on neural networks, using theano

   phd student [57]colin raffel authored this collection of deep learning
   tutorials using theano. it contains 2 notebooks: a general theano
   neural networks tutorial, and an overview of id26. it's a
   good introductory resource for getting started with deep learning and
   theano.

   [58]ipython theano tutorials

     a collection of tutorials in ipynb format that illustrate how to do
     various things in theano

   this is a good followup to colin raffel's introductory theano
   notebooks. [59]james bergstra takes us deeper into neural network
   architecture with this, covering a wider range of theano exercises. it
   includes some introductory python material, as well as more advanced
   topics like autoencoders. it also links to a number of related
   materials.

   [60]ipython notebooks

     a collection of ipython notebooks covering various topics

   this is an eclectic mix, put together by [61]john wittenauer, with
   notebooks for python implementation of ng's coursera course exercises,
   udacity's tensorflow-oriented deep learning course exercises, and the
   spark edx course exercises. machine learning, deep learning, and big
   data processing frameworks: it doesn't get any more "data science" than
   this, folks.

   [62]islr python

     an introduction to statistical learning (james, witten, hastie,
     tibshirani, 2013): python code

   this is a great project undertaken by [63]jordi warmenhoven to
   implement the concepts from the book [64]an introduction to statistical
   learning with applications in r by james, witten, hastie, tibshirani
   (2013) in python (the book has practical exercises in r, as you may
   have guessed). the book is freely available in as a pdf, which makes
   this repo even more attractive to those looking to learn.
