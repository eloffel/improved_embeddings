   an introductory overview of matplotlib, one of the foundational aspects
   of scientific computing in python, along with some explanation of the
   maths involved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   matplotlib

   one of the most popular uses for python, especially in recent years is
   data processing, analysis and visualisation. this then leads topics
   such as the analysis of 'big data' which has many applications in
   pretty much every type of business you can imagine, and a personal
   interest of mine; machine learning.

   python has a vast array of powerful tools available to help with this
   processing, analysis and visualisation of data and is one of the main
   reasons that python has gained such momentum in the scientific world.

   in this series of posts, we will take a look at the main libraries used
   in scientific python and learn how to use them to bend data to our
   will. we won't just be learning to churn out template code however, we
   will also learn a bit of the maths behind it so that we can understand
   what is going on a little better.

   so let's kick things off with a incredibly useful little number that we
   will be using throughout this series of posts; matplotlib.

what is matplotlib?


   simply put it's a graphing library for python. it has a humongous array
   of tools that you can use to create anything from simple scatter plots,
   to sin curves, to 3d graphs. it is used heavily in the scientific
   python community for data visualisation. you can read more about the
   ideas behind matplotlib on their [36]website, but i especially
   recommend taking a look at their [37]gallery to see the amazing things
   you can pull off with this library.

plotting a simple graph


   to get started we will plot a simple sin wave from 0 to 2 pi. you will
   notice that we are using numpy here, don't worry too much about it for
   now if you don't know how to use it; we will be covering numpy in the
   next post.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

   these are the imports we will be using. as i've mentioned in a
   previous [38]post (and [39]others) the 'from x import *' way of
   importing is not good. we don't want to be typing out matplotlib.pyplot
   and numpy all the time though, they are long, so we will use the above
   compromise.
# basic plotting.
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x)) # without the first x, array indices will be used on the
x axis.
plt.show() # show the graph.

   the above code will produce a simple sin curve. the 'np.linspace(0, 2 *
   np.pi, 50)' bit of code produces an array of 50 evenly spaced numbers
   from 0 to 2 pi.

   the plot command is the short and sweet line of code that actually
   creates the graph. note that without the first x argument used here,
   instead of the x axis going fro 0 to 2 pi, it would instead use the
   array indices used in the x variable instead.

   the final bit of code plt.show() displays the graph, without this
   nothing will appear.

   you will get something like this:

   [40]basic plotting

plotting two datasets on one graph


   a lot of the time you will want to plot more than one dataset on a
   graph. in matplotlib this is simple.
# plotting two data sets on one graph.
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x),
        x, np.sin(2 * x))
plt.show()

   the above code plots both the graphs for sin(x) and sin(2x). it is
   pretty much the same as the previous code for plotting one dataset,
   except this time inside the same plt.plot() call, we define another
   dataset separated by a comma.you will end up with a graph with two
   lines on like this:

   [41]plotting 2 datasets

customising the look of the lines


   when having multiple datasets on one graph it is useful to be able to
   change the look of the plotted lines to make differentiating between
   the datasets easier.
# customising the look of lines.
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), 'r-o',
        x, np.cos(x), 'g--')
plt.show()

   in the above code you can see two examples of different line stylings;
   'r-o' and 'g--'. the letters 'r' and 'g' are the line colours and the
   following symbols are the line and marker styles. for example '-o'
   creates a solid line with dots on and '--' creates a dashed line. as
   with most of the aspects of matplotlib, the best thing to do here is
   play.

     colours:
     blue - 'b'
     green - 'g'
     red - 'r'
     cyan - 'c'
     magenta - 'm'
     yellow - 'y'
     black - 'k' ('b' is taken by blue so the last letter is used)
     white  - 'w'

     lines:
     solid line - '-'
     dashed - '--'
     dotted - '.'
     dash-dotted - '-:'

     often used markers:
     point - '.'
     pixel - ','
     circle - 'o'
     square - 's'
     triangle - '^'

   you will end up with something like this:
