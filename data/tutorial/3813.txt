   q/a system         deep learning(1/2)
     __________________________________________________________________

   deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with
   algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called
   id158s.

   feedforward

   neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the
   human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. they interpret
   sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or
   id91 raw input. the patterns they recognize are numerical,
   contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images,
   sound, text or time series, must be translated.

   the    deep    refers to neural nets with more than one hidden layer.

   very deep!

   there are many other complex applications. one of them is face
   recognition and identification. the faces are converted into
   mathematical features, and data are passed to multiple layers and the
   deep learning algorithm is trained enough until a model is able to
   recognize the faces from images, or also identify whose faces it is
   able to detect.

recurrent neural networks

   humans don   t start their thinking from scratch every second. as you
   read this essay, you understand each word based on your understanding
   of previous words. you don   t throw everything away and start thinking
   from scratch again. your thoughts have persistence.

   traditional neural networks can   t do this, and it seems like a major
   shortcoming. for example, imagine you want to classify what kind of
   event is happening at every point in a movie. it   s unclear how a
   traditional neural network could use its reasoning about previous
   events in the film to inform later ones.

   recurrent neural networks address this issue. they are networks with
   loops in them, allowing information to persist.

   boring right? well , it   s supposed to be boring!
