vector calculus: understanding the dot product

   [13]home   [14]math   [15]vector calculus   vector calculus: understanding
   the dot product

   i think of the dot product as directional multiplication.
   multiplication goes beyond [16]repeated counting: it's applying the
   essence of one item to another. (for example, [17]complex
   multiplication is rotation, not repeated counting.)

   when dealing with simple growth rates, multiplication scales one rate
   by another:
     * "3 x 4" can mean "take your 3x growth and make it 4x larger, to get
       12x"

   when dealing with vectors ("directional growth"), there's a few
   operations we can do:
     * add vectors: accumulate the growth contained in several vectors.
     * multiply by a constant: make an existing vector stronger (in the
       same direction).
     * dot product: apply the directional growth of one vector to another.
       the result is how much stronger we've made the original vector
       (positive, negative, or zero).

   today we'll build our intuition for how the dot product works.

getting the formula out of the way

   you've seen the dot product equation everywhere:

   \displaystyle{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_x \cdot b_x + a_y \cdot b_y =
   |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos(\theta) }

   and also the justification: "well billy, the law of cosines (you
   remember that, don't you?) says the following calculations are the
   same, so they are." not good enough -- it doesn't click! beyond the
   computation, what does it mean?

   the goal is to apply one vector to another. the equation above shows
   two ways to accomplish this:
     * rectangular perspective: combine x and y components
     * polar perspective: combine magnitudes and angles

   the "this stuff = that stuff" equation just means "here are two
   equivalent ways to 'directionally multiply' vectors".

seeing numbers as vectors

   let's start simple, and treat 3 x 4 as a dot product:

   \displaystyle{(3, 0) \cdot (4,0)}

   the number 3 is "directional growth" in a single dimension (the x-axis,
   let's say), and 4 is "directional growth" in that same direction. 3 x 4
   = 12 means we get 12x growth in a single dimension. ok.

   now, suppose 3 and 4 refer to different dimensions. let's say 3 means
   "triple your bananas" (x-axis) and 4 means "quadruple your oranges"
   (y-axis). now they're not the same type of number: what happens when
   apply growth (use the dot product) in our "bananas, oranges" universe?
     * (3,0) means "triple your bananas, destroy your oranges"
     * (0,4) means "destroy your bananas, quadruple your oranges"

   applying (0,4) to (3,0) means "destroy your banana growth, quadruple
   your orange growth". but (3, 0) had no orange growth to begin with, so
   the net result is 0 ("destroy all your fruit, buddy").

   \displaystyle{(3, 0) \cdot (0, 4) = 0}

   see how we're "applying" and not simply adding? with regular addition,
   we smush the vectors together: (3,0) + (0, 4) = (3, 4) [a vector which
   triples your oranges and quadruples your bananas].

   "application" is different. we're mutating the original vector based on
   the rules of the second. and the rules of (0, 4) are "destroy your
   banana growth, and quadruple your orange growth." when applied to
   something with only bananas, like (3, 0), we're left with nothing.

   the final result of the dot product process can be:
     * zero: we don't have any growth in the original direction
     * positive number: we have some growth in the original direction
     * negative number: we have negative (reverse) growth in the original
       direction

understanding the calculation

   "applying vectors" is still a bit abstract. i think "how much
   energy/push is one vector giving to the other?". here's how i visualize
   it:

   rectangular coordinates: component-by-component overlap

   like multiplying complex numbers, see how each x- and y-component
   interacts:

   dot product components

   we list out all four combinations (x with x, y with x, x with y, y with
   y). since the x- and y-coordinates don't affect each other (like
   holding a bucket sideways under a waterfall -- nothing falls in), the
   total energy absorbtion is absorbtion(x) + absorbtion(y):

   \displaystyle{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_x \cdot b_x + a_y \cdot b_y}

   polar coordinates: projection

   the word "projection" is so sterile: i prefer "along the path". how
   much energy is actually going in our original direction?

   here's one way to see it:

   dot product rotation

   take two vectors, a and b. rotate our coordinates so b is horizontal:
   it becomes (|b|, 0), and everything is on this new x-axis. what's the
   dot product now? (it shouldn't change just because we tilted our head).

   well, vector a has new coordinates (a1, a2), and we get:

   \displaystyle{a1 \cdot |\vec{b}| + a2 \cdot 0 = a1 \cdot |\vec{b}|}

   a1 is really "what is the x-coordinate of a, assuming b is the
   x-axis?". that is |a|cos(  ), aka the "projection":

   \displaystyle{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}|\cos(\theta)|\vec{b}|}

analogies for the dot product

   the common interpretation is "geometric projection", but it's so bland.
   here's some analogies that click for me:

   energy absorbtion

   one vector are solar rays, the other is where the solar panel is
   pointing (yes, yes, the normal vector). larger numbers mean stronger
   rays or a larger panel. how much energy is absorbed?
     * energy = overlap in direction * strength of rays * size of panel
     * \displaystyle{\text{energy} = \cos(\theta) \cdot |a| \cdot |b|}

   if you hold your panel sideways to the sun, no rays hit (cos(  ) = 0).

   but... but... solar rays are leaving the sun, and the panel is facing
   the sun, and the dot product is negative when vectors are opposed! take
   a deep breath, and remember the goal is to embrace the analogy
   (besides, physicists lose track of negative signs all the time).

   mario-kart speed boost

   in mario kart, there are "boost pads" on the ground that increase your
   speed (never played? i'm sorry.)

   mario kart dot product example [20]photo source

   imagine the red vector is your speed (x and y direction), and the blue
   vector is the orientation of the boost pad (x and y direction). larger
   numbers are more power.

   how much boost will you get? for the analogy, imagine the pad
   multiplies your speed:
     * if you come in going 0, you'll get nothing [if you are just dropped
       onto the pad, there's no boost]
     * if you cross the pad perpendicularly, you'll get 0 [just like the
       banana obliteration, it will give you 0x boost in the perpendicular
       direction]

   but, if we have some overlap, our x-speed will get an x-boost, and our
   y-speed gets a y-boost:

   \displaystyle{\text{total} = speed_x \cdot boost_x + speed_y \cdot
   boost_y}

   neat, eh? another way to see it: your incoming speed is |a|, and the
   max boost is |b|. the amount of boost you actually get (for being lined
   up with it) is $\cos(\theta)$, for the total $|a||b|\cos(\theta)$.

   physics physics physics

   the dot product appears all over physics: some field (electric,
   gravitational) is pulling on some particle. we'd love to multiply, and
   we could if everything were lined up. but that's never the case, so we
   take the dot product to account for potential differences in direction.

   it's all a useful generalization: integrals are "multiplication, taking
   changes into account" and the dot product is "multiplication, taking
   direction into account".

   and what if your direction is changing? why, take the [21]integral of
   the dot product, of course!

onward and upward

   don't settle for "dot product is the geometric projection, justified by
   the law of cosines". find the analogies that click for you! happy math.
