"""
classifying names with a character-level id56
*********************************************
**author**: `sean robertson <https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch>`_

we will be building and training a basic character-level id56 to classify
words. a character-level id56 reads words as a series of characters -
outputting a prediction and "hidden state" at each step, feeding its
previous hidden state into each next step. we take the final prediction
to be the output, i.e. which class the word belongs to.

specifically, we'll train on a few thousand surnames from 18 languages
of origin, and predict which language a name is from based on the
spelling:

::

    $ python predict.py hinton
    (-0.47) scottish
    (-1.52) english
    (-3.57) irish

    $ python predict.py schmidhuber
    (-0.19) german
    (-2.48) czech
    (-2.68) dutch


**recommended reading:**

i assume you have at least installed pytorch, know python, and
understand tensors:

-  http://pytorch.org/ for installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with pytorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former lua torch user

it would also be useful to know about id56s and how they work:

-  `the unreasonable effectiveness of recurrent neural
   networks <http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/id56-effectiveness/>`__
   shows a bunch of real life examples
-  `understanding lstm
   networks <http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-understanding-lstms/>`__
   is about lstms specifically but also informative about id56s in
   general

preparing the data
==================

.. note::
   download the data from
   `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`_
   and extract it to the current directory.

included in the ``data/names`` directory are 18 text files named as
"[language].txt". each file contains a bunch of names, one name per
line, mostly romanized (but we still need to convert from unicode to
ascii).

we'll end up with a dictionary of lists of names per language,
``{language: [names ...]}``. the generic variables "category" and "line"
(for language and name in our case) are used for later extensibility.

# turning names into tensors
# --------------------------
#
# now that we have all the names organized, we need to turn them into
# tensors to make any use of them.
#
# to represent a single letter, we use a "one-hot vector" of size
# ``<1 x n_letters>``. a one-hot vector is filled with 0s except for a 1
# at index of the current letter, e.g. ``"b" = <0 1 0 0 0 ...>``.
#
# to make a word we join a bunch of those into a 2d matrix
# ``<line_length x 1 x n_letters>``.
#
# that extra 1 dimension is because pytorch assumes everything is in
# batches - we're just using a batch size of 1 here.
#

import torch

# find letter index from all_letters, e.g. "a" = 0
def lettertoindex(letter):
    return all_letters.find(letter)

# just for demonstration, turn a letter into a <1 x n_letters> tensor
def lettertotensor(letter):
    tensor = torch.zeros(1, n_letters)
    tensor[0][lettertoindex(letter)] = 1
    return tensor

# turn a line into a <line_length x 1 x n_letters>,
# or an array of one-hot letter vectors
def linetotensor(line):
    tensor = torch.zeros(len(line), 1, n_letters)
    for li, letter in enumerate(line):
        tensor[li][0][lettertoindex(letter)] = 1
    return tensor

print(lettertotensor('j'))

print(linetotensor('jones').size())

# creating the network
# ====================
#
# before autograd, creating a recurrent neural network in torch involved
# cloning the parameters of a layer over several timesteps. the layers
# held hidden state and gradients which are now entirely handled by the
# graph itself. this means you can implement a id56 in a very "pure" way,
# as regular feed-forward layers.
#
# this id56 module (mostly copied from `the pytorch for torch users
# tutorial <http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/
# nn_tutorial.html#example-2-recurrent-net>`__)
# is just 2 linear layers which operate on an input and hidden state, with
# a logsoftmax layer after the output.
