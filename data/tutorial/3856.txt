who

     * nitin borwankar [4]http://twitter.com/nitin - primary developer
       (sponsored by pivotal inc. and alpine data labs).

what

     * a collection of data science learning materials in the form of
       ipython notebooks.
     * associated data sets.

   the initial beta release consists of four major topics
     * id75
     * id28
     * id79s
     * id116 id91

   each of the above has at least three ipython notebooks covering
     * overview (an exposition of the technique for the math-wary)
     * data exploration (the nuts and bolts of real world data wrangling)
     * analysis (using the technique to get results)

   one or more of these may have supplementary material. each of these
   have worksheets that contain mostly the code sections so you can
   iteratively explore the code.

   three openly available data sets are used.
     * for the linear and id28 we use a data set on loans
       and interest rates provided by learning club
       [5]http://learningclub.com
     * for id79s we use a data set of android accelerometer and
       gyroscope readings used to predict body position and motion from
       the human activity recognition project
       [6]http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognitio
       n+using+smartphones
     * un data on economic indicators of countries

why

   there's a need for open content to raise the level of awareness and
   training in basics, in the data science field (circa early 2013).

   ipython notebook provides an appropriate platform for rapid iterative
   exploration and learning.

when

   starting in 2013 and intended to extend for a long while.

where

   today github, tomorrow the world.

how

   learn data science is based on content developed by me (nitin
   borwankar) for the open data science training project
   [7]http://opendst.org most of the content (circa july 2013) is
   copyright (c) alpine data labs as per the license at opendst.org, and
   is freely available. extensions to the content embodied in this
   projects content are also released under the same license - see the
   license.txt file.

background

   if you are unfamiliar with ipython notebook you can start with
   [33]http://ipython.org/notebook

installation

     * prerequisites
       one of the following distributions is needed. please note that even
       if you have python installed it is important to have one of these
       distributions installed and the binary for this installation in
       your path. this is because these distributions come packaged with
       all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been
       historically difficult to install separately.
          + epd free enthought python distribution from
            [34]http://enthought.com
          + anaconda python from [35]http://continuum.io
          + development has been done on v 1.5 of anaconda distribution
            but epd free should work just as well.
     * the following steps assume you have installed one of the
       distributions mentioned in prerequisites.
     * from a zip or tar file
          + download the zip or tar file
          + unpack the file to a directory called learnds
          + cd to the 'notebooks' subdirectory
          + start ipython notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
     * from the git repo
          + clone the repo
          + cd to 'notebooks'
          + start ipython notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
