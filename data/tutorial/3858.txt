installation instructions

   when you need to use a dataset for a recipe in the cookbook:
    1. download the indicated dataset by clicking on the link above.
    2. extract the downloaded .zip file in your current directory (the
       directory that contains your ipython notebook). now there should be
       a new data/ subfolder containing the dataset for the recipe.
    3. execute the notebook as indicated in the recipe.

   note: dataset bikes need not be downloaded as recipe 1.2 fetches data
   directly from the internet (see [101]issue #2).
