machine_learning

   this repo contains a collection of ipython notebooks detailing various
   machine learning algorithims. in general, the mathematics follows that
   presented by dr. andrew ng's machine learning course taught at stanford
   university (materials available from [itunes u]
   ([85]http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/), stanford machine
   learning), dr. tom mitchell's course at carnegie mellon (materials
   avialable [86]here), and christopher m. bishop's "pattern recognition
   and machine learning". unless otherwise noted, the python code is
   orginal and any errors or ommissions should be attribued to me and not
   the aforemention authors.

   each ipynb provides a list of the pertinent reading material. it is
   suggested that the material be read in the order provided.

   if you do not have ipython installed or notebook configured (why not?)
   the src directory has .py versions of the notebook files and some of
   the pdf output files are in this repository's downloads section.
   however, they are not always as updated as the ipynb files.

   python version 2.7.2 ipython version 0.13
