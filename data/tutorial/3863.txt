http 301: don't use this repository - 17 jan 2019

   there's good news! mining the social web is now availabe in it's 3rd
   edition, and there's a fully updated repository available with all of
   the latest changes that you will definitely not want to miss out on:
   the code has been fully revised and ported to python 3, the runtime has
   been converted to a more convenient docker-based setup, and there's a
   brand new chapter on mining instagram data.

   my co-author, mikhail klassen, now maintains the code, and you can get
   it here:
   [82]https://github.com/mikhailklassen/mining-the-social-web-3rd-edition

   enjoy!

mining the social web (2nd edition)

summary

   mining the social web, 2nd edition is available through o'reilly media,
   amazon, and other fine book retailers. [83]purchasing the ebook
   directly from o'reilly offers a number of great benefits, including a
   variety of digital formats and continual updates to the text of book
   for life! better yet, if you choose to use o'reilly's dropbox or google
   drive synchronization, your ebooks will automatically update every time
   there's an update. in other words, you'll always have the latest
   version of the book if you purchase the ebook through o'reilly, which
   is why it's the recommended option in comparison to a paper copy or
   other electronic version. (if you prefer a [84]paperback or kindle
   version from amazon, that's a fine option as well.)

   there's an incredible turn-key virtual machine experience for this
   second edition of the book that provides you with a powerful social web
   mining toolbox. this toolbox provides the ability to explore and run
   all of the source code in a hassle-free manner. all that you have to do
   is [follow a few simple
   steps]([85]https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/mining-the-social-web-2nd
   -edition/master/ipynb/html/_appendix a - virtual machine
   experience.html) to get the virtual machine installed, and you'll be
   running the example code in as little as 20-30 minutes. (and by the
   way, most of that time is waiting for files to download.)

   this [86]short screencast demonstrates the steps involved in installing
   the virtual machine, which installs every single dependency for you
   automatically and save you a lot of time. even sophisticated power
   users tend to prefer using it versus using their own environments.

   if you experience any problems at all with installation of the virtual
   machine, file an issue here on github. be sure to also follow
   [87]@socialwebmining on twitter and like
   [88]http://facebook.com/miningthesocialweb on facebook.

   be sure to also visit [89]http://miningthesocialweb.com for additional
   content, news, and updates about the book and code in this github
   repository.

preview the full-text of chapter 1 (mining twitter)

   chapter 1 of the book provides a gentle introduction to hacking on
   twitter data. it's available in a variety of convenient formats
     * a free [90]pdf download
     * an [91]online ebook excerpt
     * an [92]ipython notebook (ipynb) file (checked into this repository)

   choose one, or choose them all. there's no better way to get started
   than following along with the opening chapter.

preview the ipython notebooks

   this edition of mining the social web extensively uses [93]ipython
   notebook to facilitate the learning and development process. if you're
   interested in what the example code for any particular chapter does,
   the best way to preview it is with the links below. when you're ready
   to develop, pull the source for this github repository and follow the
   instructions for installing the virtual machine to get started.

blog & screencasts

   be sure to bookmark the [108]mining the social web vimeo channel to
   stay up to date with short instructional videos that demonstrate how to
   use the tools in this repository. more screencasts are being added all
   the time, so check back often -- or better yet, subscribe to the
   channel.

the mining the social web virtual machine

   you may enjoy [112]this short screencast that demonstrates the
   step-by-step instructions involved in installing the book's virtual
   machine.

   the code for mining the social web is organized by chapter in an
   [113]ipython notebook format to maximize enjoyment of following along
   with examples as part of an interactive experience. unfortunately, some
   of the python dependencies for the example code can be a little bit
   tricky to get installed and configured, so providing a completely
   turn-key virtual machine to make your reading experience as simple and
   enjoyable as possible is in order. even if you are a seasoned
   developer, you may still find some value in using this virtual machine
   to get started and save yourself some time. the virtual machine is
   powered with [114]vagrant, an amazing development tool that you'll
   probably want to know about and arguably makes working with
   virtualization even easier than a native [115]virtualbox or vmware
   image.

quick start guide

   the recommended way of getting started with the example code is by
   taking advantage of the vagrant-powered virtual machine as illusrated
   in [116]this short screencast. after all, you're more interested in
   following along and learning from the examples than installing and
   managing all of the system dependencies just to get to that point,
   right?

   [appendix a - virtual machine
   experience]([117]https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/mining-the-social-w
   eb-2nd-edition/master/ipynb/html/_appendix a - virtual machine
   experience.html) provides clear step-by-step instructions for
   installing the virtual machine and is intended to serve as a quick
   start guide.

the mining the social web wiki

   this project takes advantage of its github repository's [118]wiki to
   act as a point of collaboration for consumers of the source code. feel
   free to use the wiki however you'd like to share your experiences, and
   create additional pages as needed to curate additional information.

   one of the more important wiki pages that you may want to bookmark is
   the [119]advisories page, which is an archive of notes about
   particularly disruptive commits or other changes that may affect you.

   another page of interest is a listing of all [120]100+ numbered
   examples from the book that conveniently hyperlink to read-only version
   of the ipython notebooks

"premium support"

   the source code in this repository is free for your use however you'd
   like. if you'd like to complete a more rigorous study about social web
   mining much like you would experience by following along with a
   textbook in a classroom, however, you should consider picking up a copy
   of [121]mining the social web and follow along. think of the book as
   offering a form of "premium support" for this open source project.

   the publisher's description of the book follows for your convenience:

   how can you tap into the wealth of social web data to discover who   s
   making connections with whom, what they   re talking about, and where
   they   re located? with this expanded and thoroughly revised edition,
   you   ll learn how to acquire, analyze, and summarize data from all
   corners of the social web including facebook, twitter, linkedin,
   google+, github, email, websites, and blogs.
     * employ ipython notebook, the natural language toolkit, networkx,
       and other scientific computing tools to mine popular social web
       sites
     * apply advanced text-mining techniques, such as id91 and
       tf-idf, to extract meaning from human language data
     * bootstrap interest graphs from github by discovering affinities
       among people, programming languages, and coding projects
     * build interactive visualizations with d3.js, a state-of-the-art
       html5 and javascript toolkit
     * take advantage of more than two-dozen twitter recipes presented in
       o   reilly   s popular and well-known cookbook format

   the example code for this data science book is maintained in a public
   github repository and is designed to be especially accessible through a
   turn-key virtual machine that facilitates interactive learning with an
   easy-to-use collection of ipython notebooks.
