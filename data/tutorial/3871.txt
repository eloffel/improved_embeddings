   this post summarizes and links to a great multi-part tutorial series on
   learning the tensorflow api for building a variety of neural networks,
   as well as a bonus tutorial on id26 from the beginning.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by erik hallstr  m, deep learning research engineer.

     editor's note: the tensorflow api has undergone changes since this
     series was first published. however, the general ideas are the same,
     and an otherwise well-structured tutorial such as this provides a
     great jumping off point and opportunity to consult the api
     documentation to identify and implement said changes.

   [39]part 1: how to build a recurrent neural network in tensorflow

   in this tutorial i   ll explain how to build a simple working recurrent
   neural network in tensorflow. this is the first in a series of seven
   parts where various aspects and techniques of building recurrent neural
   networks in tensorflow are covered. a short introduction to tensorflow
   is available here. for now, let   s get started with the id56!

   [40]part 2: using the id56 api in tensorflow

   this post is the follow up of the article    [41]how to build a recurrent
   neural network in tensorflow   , where we built a id56 from scratch,
   building up the computational graph manually. now we will utilize the
   native tensorflow api to simplify our script.

   [42]part 3: using the lstm api in tensorflow

   [43]in the previous post we modified our to code to use the tensorflow
   native id56 api. now we will go about to build a modification of a id56
   that called a    recurrent neural network with long short-term memory    or
   id56-lstm. this architecture was pioneered by [44]j  rgen schmidhuber
   among others. one problem with the id56 when using long
   time-dependencies (truncated_backprop_length is large) is the
      [45]vanishing gradient problem   . one way to counter this is using a
   state that is    protected    and    selective   . the id56-lstm remembers,
   forgets and chooses what to pass on and output depending on the current
   state and input.

                                lstm outputs
         outputs of the previous states and the last lstmstatetuple.

   [46]part 4: using the multilayered lstm api in tensorflow

   [47]in the previous article we learned how to use the tensorflow api to
   create a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory. in this
   post we will make that architecture deep, introducing a lstm with
   multiple layers.

   one thing to notice is that for every layer of the network we will need
   a hidden state and a cell state. typically the input to the next
   lstm-layer will be the previous state for that particular layer as well
   as the hidden activations of the    lower    or previous layer. there is a
   good diagram in [48]this article.

   [49]part 5: using the dynamicid56 api in tensorflow

   [50]in the previous guide we built a multi-layered lstm id56. in this
   post we will speed it up by not splitting up our inputs and labels into
   a list, as done on line 41   42 in our code.

   [51]part 6: using the dropout api in tensorflow

   [52]in the previous part we built a multi-layered lstm id56. in this
   post we will make it less prone to overfitting (called regularizing) by
   adding a something called dropout. it   s a weird trick to randomly turn
   off activations of neurons during training, and was pioneered by
   geoffrey hinton among others, you can read their initial [53]article
   here.

    tree layers anywhere in the network, derivative is taken with respect
        to the weight shown in red. the middle neuron is enlarged for
                           visualization purposes.

   [54]bonus: id26 from the beginning

   i have tried to understand id26 by reading some
   explanations, but i   ve always felt that the derivations lack some
   details. in this article i will try to explain it from the beginning
   hopefully not leaving anything out (theory wise at least). let   s get
   started!
