using the id56 api in tensorflow (2/7)

   this post is the follow up of the article    [11]how to build a recurrent
   neural network in tensorflow   , where we built a id56 from scratch,
   building up the computational graph manually. now we will utilize the
   native tensorflow api to simplify our script.

simple graph creation

   remember where we made the unpacking and forward passes in the vanilla
   id56?

   replace the piece of code above with this:

   you may also remove the weight- and bias matrices w and b declared
   earlier. the inner workings of the id56 are now hidden    under the hood   .
   notice the usage of split instead of unpack when assigning the x_inputs
   variable. the tf.nn.id56 accepts a list of inputs of shape [batch_size,
   input_size] , and the input_size is simply one in our case (input is
   just a series of scalars). split doesn   t remove the singular dimension,
   but unpack does, you can read more about it [15]here. it doesn   t really
   matter anyways, since we still had to reshape the inputs in our
   previous example before the id127. the tf.nn.id56
   unrolls the id56 and creates the graph automatically, so we can remove
   the for-loop. the function returns a series of previous states as well
   as the last state in the same shape as we did before manually, here is
   the printed output of these variables.

whole program

   here is the full code:

next step

   in [17]the next post we will improve the id56 by using another
   architecture called    long short-term memory    or lstm. actually this is
   not necessary since our network already can solve our toy problem. but
   remember that our goal is to learn to use tensorflow properly, not to
   solve the actual problem which is trivial :)
