   [11]in the previous part we built a multi-layered lstm id56. in this
   post we will make it less prone to overfitting (called regularizing) by
   adding a something called dropout. it   s a weird trick to randomly turn
   off activations of neurons during training, and was pioneered by
   geoffrey hinton among others, you can read their initial [12]article
   here.

   fortunately this is very simple to do in tensorflow, between the lines
   41   42 you simply add a dropoutwrapper with the id203 to not drop
   out, called output_keep_prob. change lines 41   42 to the code below.

   don   t drop out too much or you will need a large state to be sure to
   keep some of the information (in our toy example at least). as you can
   read in [14]this article dropout is implemented between id56 layers in
   tensorflow, not on recurrent connections.

whole program

   this is the whole self-contained script, just copy and run.

next step

   in the next part we will further regularize it by using something
   called batch id172. stay tuned, it will be coming soon :)
