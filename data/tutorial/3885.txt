classifying-earthquakes

   in this project i use tensorflow and a recurrent neural network to
   produce a model that can classify two types of earthquakes. the data is
   taken from the [71]ucr time series classification archive (yanping
   chen, eamonn keogh, bing hu, nurjahan begum, anthony bagnall, abdullah
   mueen and gustavo batista (2015)). this work was inspired by rob
   romijners's blog post on [72]lstm time-series classification. i credit
   [73]understanding id137 that provided an excellent introduction
   to id56s and how an lstm works. i also credit the detailed blog posts
   [74]recurrent neural networks in tensorflow i, [75]recurrent neural
   networks in tensorflow ii, and the links there in for providing a good
   background of how to create an id56 using tensorflow.

   this project is a work in progress. if you find it interesting and
   would like to contribute i welcome input.

installation instructions

conda

   anaconda can be downloaded from [76]here. the notebooks in this repo
   use python 3.

   create a conda environment and all required packages, less tensorflow:

   conda create --name tf_python3 python=3 pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
   natsort

   enter conda environment:

   source activate tf_python3

   install tensorflow from [77]here:

   conda install -c jjhelmus tensorflow=0.10.0rc0

pip

   run the following pip command to install all required packages, except
   tensorflow:

   pip3 install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter natsort

   then, install tensorflow from [78]here:

   pip3 install -i https://pypi.anaconda.org/jjhelmus/simple tensorflow

tensorboard

   all tensorflow models are saved in directories with the following
   format: tmp/logs/run_?? where the question marks refer to the model run
   number. to start tensorboard, execute the following command:

   tensorboard --logdir=tmp/logs/run_??

jupyter slides

   this project was originally presented at the san francisco python
   meetup on november 9th, 2016. the slides associated with that talk are
   found in the jupyter notebook classifying earthquakes slides.ipynb. a
   slightly different version of that talk was presented at udacity on
   january 7th, 2017 and those slides are in the jupyter notebook
   classifying earthquakes slides - udacity.ipynb.

   if you download one of these notebooks and would like to compile the
   slides as html, run the following command:

   jupyter nbconvert classifying\ earthquakes\ slides.ipynb --to slides
   --post serve
