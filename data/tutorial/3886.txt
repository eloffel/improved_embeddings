id97 algorithm: made as simple as possible, but no simpler
     __________________________________________________________________

summary

   this talk will give a pythonic introduction to the id97 algorithm.
   id97, translating words (strings) to vectors (lists of floats), is
   a relatively new algorithm which has proved to be very useful for
   making sense of text data. you will gain a conceptual understanding of
   the algorithm and be empowered to try it out on your favorite
   collection of text data.
     __________________________________________________________________

description

      you shall know a word by the company it keeps    is a common refrain in
   natural language processing (nlp). id97 is a simple neural network
   that learns which words tend to co-occur and embeds the words in a
   vector space. from these id27s, it is possible to use
   distance measures to compare words, find neighbors by id91, and
   add/subtract words to explore relationships between concepts. actually,
   id97 is a general purpose algorithm that allows any sequential data
   to be encoded into meaningful vectors - including emojis!
