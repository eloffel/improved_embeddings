datasets of annotated semantic relationships

   this repository contains annotated datasets which can be used to train
   supervised models for the task of semantic relationship extraction. if
   you know any more datasets, and want to contribute, please, notify me
   or submit a pr.

   it's divided in 3 groups:

   [75]traditional information extraction: relationships are manually
   annotated, and belongs to pre-determined type.

   [76]id10: relationships are manually annotated,
   but don't have any specific type.

   [77]distantly supervised: relationships are annotated by appying some
   [78]distant supervision technique and are pre-determined.

   description: first evaluation contest (track) for portuguese whose goal
   was to detect and classify relations betweennamed entities in running
   text, called rerelem. given a collection annotated with named entities
   belonging to ten different semantic categories, we marked all
   relationships between them within each document. we used the following
   fourfold relationship classification: identity, included-in,
   located-in, and other (which was later on explicitly detailed into
   twenty different relations).

   online encyclopedia wikipedia and labeled a total of 4701 relation
   instances. in addition to a large set of person-to-person relations, we
   also included links between people and organizations, as well as
   biographical facts such as birthday and jobtitle. in all, there are 53
   labels in the training data.

bionlp shared task

   dateset: [93]bionlp.tar.gz

   cite: [94]overview of bionlp shared task 2011

   description: the task involves the recognition of two binary part-of
   relations between entities: protein-component and subunitcomplex. the
   task is motivated by specific challenges: the identification of the
   components of proteins in text is relevant e.g. to the recognition of
   site arguments (cf. ge, epi and id tasks), and relations between
   proteins and their complexes relevant to any task involving them. rel
   setup is informed by recent semantic relation tasks (hendrickx et al.,
   2010). the task data, consisting of new annotations for ge data,
   extends a previously introduced resource (pyysalo et al., 2009; ohta et
   al., 2010a).

   cite: [96]development of a benchmark corpus to support the automatic
   extraction of drug-related adverse effects from medical case reports

   description: the work presented here aims at generating a
   systematically annotated corpus that can support the development and
   validation of methods for the automatic extraction of drug-related
   adverse effects from medical case reports. the documents are
   systematically double annotated in various rounds to ensure consistent
   annotations. the annotated documents are finally harmonized to generate
   representative consensus annotations. in order to demonstrate an
   example use case scenario, the corpus was employed to train and
   validate models for the classification of informative against the
   non-informative sentences. a maximum id178 classifier trained with
   simple features and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation resulted in
   the f1 score of 0.70 indicating a potential useful application of the
   corpus.

kbp-37

   dateset: [97]kbp37-master.zip.zip

   cite: [98]relation classification via recurrent neural network

   description: this dataset is a revision of miml-re annotation dataset,
   provided by gabor angeli et al. (2014). they use both the 2010 and 2013
   kbp official document collections, as well as a july 2013 dump of
   wikipedia as the text corpus for annotation, 33811 sentences been
   annotated. to make the dataset more suitable for our task, we made
   several refinement:
    1. first, we add direction to the relation names, such that
          per:employee of    is splited into two relations    per:employee
       of(e1,e2)    and    per:employee of(e2,e1)    except for    no relation   .
       according to description of kbp task,3 we replace    org:parents   
       with    org:subsidiaries    and replace    org:member of    with
          org:member    (by their reverse directions). this leads to 76
       relations in the dataset.
    2. then, we statistic the frequency of each relation with two
       directions separately. and relations with low frequency are
       discarded so that both directions of each relation occur more than
       100 times in the dataset. to better balance the dataset, 80%    no
       relation    sentences are also randomly discarded.
    3. after that, dataset are randomly shuffled and then sentences under
       each relation are all split into three groups, 70% for training,
       10% for development, 20% for test. finally, we remove those
       sentences in the development and test set whose entity pairs and
       relation are appeared in a training sentence simultaneously.

clausie

   dateset: [101]clausie-datasets.tar.gz

   cite: [102]clausie: clause-based id10

   description:

   three different datasets. first, the reverb dataset consists of 500
   sentences with manually labeled extractions. the sentences have been
   obtained via the random-link service of yahoo and are generally very
   noisy. second, 200 random sentences from wikipedia pages. these
   sentences are shorter, simpler, and less noisy than those of the reverb
   dataset. since some wikipedia articles are written by non-native
   speakers, however, the wikipedia sentences do contain some incorrect
   grammatical constructions. third, 200 random sentences from the new
   york times collection these sentences are generally very clean but tend
   to be long and complex.

effectiveness and efficiency of open id36

   dateset: [103]emnlp13_ualberta_experiments_v2.zip

   cite: [104]effectiveness and efficiency of open id36

   description: web-500 is a commonly used dataset, developed for the
   textrunner experiments (banko and etzioni, 2008). these sentences are
   often incomplete and grammatically unsound, representing the challenges
   of dealing with web text. nyt-500 represents the other end of the
   spectrum with formal, well written new stories from the new york times
   corpus (sandhaus, 2008). penn-100 contains sentences from the penn
   treebank recently used in an evaluation of the treekernel method (xu et
   al., 2013). we manually annotated the relations for web-500 and nyt-500
   and use the penn-100 annotations provided by treekernel   s authors (xu
   et al., 2013).

extracting relation descriptors with id49

   dateset: [105]dataset-ijcnlp2011.tar.gz

   cite: [106]extracting relation descriptors with conditional random
   fields

   description: new york times data set contains 150 business articles
   from new york times. the articles were crawled from the nyt website
   between november 2009 and january 2010. after sentence splitting and
   id121, we used the stanford ner tagger (url:
   [107]http://nlp.stanford.edu/ner/index.shtml) to identify per and org
   named entities from each sentence. for named entities that contain
   multiple tokens we concatenated them into a single token. we then took
   each pair of (per, org) entities that occur in the same sentence as a
   single candidate relation instance, where the per entity is treated as
   arg-1 and the org entity is treated as arg-2.

   wikipedia data was previously created by aron culotta et al.. since the
   original data set did not contain the annotation information we need,
   we re-annotated it. similarly, we performed sentence splitting,
   id121 and ner tagging, and took pairs of (per, per) entities
   occurring in the same sentence as a candidate relation instance. we
   always treat the first per entity as arg-1 and the second per entity as
   arg-2.

   cite: [109]modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text

   description: the nyt dataset is a widely used dataset on distantly
   supervisied id36 task. this dataset was generated by
   aligning freebase relations with the new york times (nyt) corpus, with
   sentences from the years 2005-2006 used as the training corpus and
   sentences from 2007 used as the testing corpus.
