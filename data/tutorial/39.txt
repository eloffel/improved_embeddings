deepaa

   this is convolutional neural networks generating ascii art. this
   repository is under construction.

   this work is accepted by [87]nips 2017 workshop, machine learning for
   creativity and design the paper: [88]ascii art synthesis with
   convolutional networks

   [89]web application (using previous version model) (by [90]tar-bin)

   [91]image sample

change log

     * 2017/12/2 added light model

requirements

     * tensorflow (1.3.0)
     * keras (2.0.8)
     * numpy (1.13.3)
     * pillow (4.2.1)
     * pandas (0.18.0)
     * scikit-learn (0.19.0)
     * h5py (2.7.1)
     * model's weight (download it from [92]here and place it in dir
       model.)
     * training data (additional, download it from [93]here, extract it
       and place the extracted directory in dir data.) )

how to use

   please change the line 15 of output.py
image_path = 'sample images/original images/21 original.png' # put the path of t
he image that you convert.

   into the path of image file that you use. you should use a grayscale
   line image.

   then run output.py . converted images will be output at output/ .

   you can select light model by change the line 13, 14 of output.py into
model_path = "model/model_light.json"
weight_path = "model/weight_light.hdf5"
