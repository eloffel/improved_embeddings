k-nearest neighbors demo

   this interactive demo lets you explore the k-nearest neighbors
   algorithm for classification.

   each point in the plane is colored with the class that would be
   assigned to it using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. points for
   which the k-nearest neighbor algorithm results in a tie are colored
   white.

   you can move points around by clicking and dragging!
