backtracking

the user immediately returns to the same segment

    local alternation: user switches between adjacent segments, often singly (e.g.

abab) but also for longer stretches (e.g. abc-abc).

    local orientation: very brief reading of a number of segments, then returning

to each one and editing them (e.g. abcde-abcde).

    long-distance backtracking

    long-distance alternation: user switches between the current segment and

different previous segments (e.g. jcjdjfjg)

    text    nal backtracking: user backtracks to speci   c segments after having

edited all the segments at least once

    in-text long distance backtracking: instances of long distance backtracking

as the user proceeds in order through the text.
