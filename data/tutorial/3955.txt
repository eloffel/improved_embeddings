what problems do we care about in music technology research?

    (automatically) cataloging large-scale music collections.
    music recommendation.
    similarity     ie. shanzam.
    synthesis: instruments, singing voice.
    ...

some of them can be approached with deep learning.

why deep learning might be useful for music data processing?

    music is hierarchic in frequency (note, chord) and time (onset,
rhythm) and deep learning naturally allows this representation.

    contextual analysis

    short time-scale features: id98s - ie. note, chords.
    long time-scale features: id56s - ie. structure.

    unsupervised learning: potential of learning from any audio!
    time/frequency invariant operations: max-pool.
    any input: spectrogram, mfccs, self-similarity matrices,

video, text.

acronyms:

    mlp: multi layer id88     feed-forward neural network.
    id56: recurrent neural network.
    lstm: long-short term memory.
    id98: convolutional neural network.

assumed notion of deep learning :

    it is deep when several non-linearities are applied to the

input.

    the parameters of the network are learnt:
    typically by using back-propagation.

figure : filters of the    rst id98 layer trained for genre classi   cation

layer 1 : onsets.
layer 2 : onsets, bass, harmonics, melody.
layer 3 : onsets, melody, kick, percussion.
layer 4 : harmonic structures, notes, vertical-horizontal lines.
layer 5 : textures, harmo-rhythmic patterns.

3x3    lters are limiting the representational power of the 1st layer!
does it make sense then to use id161 architectures?
