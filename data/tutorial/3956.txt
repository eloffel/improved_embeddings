the id88 (d1l2 deep learning for speech and language)

    1. 1. [course site] day 1 lecture 2 the id88 santiago pascual
    2. [70]2. 2 outline 1. supervised learning: regression/classification
       2. id75 3. id28 4. the id88 5.
       multi-class classification 6. the neural network 7. metrics
    3. [71]3. 3 machine learning techniques we can categorize three types
       of learning procedures: 1. supervised learning: =   ( ) 2.
       unsupervised learning:   ( ) 3. id23: =   ( ) we
       have a labeled dataset with pairs (x, y), e.g. classify a signal
       window as containing speech or not: x1 = [x(1), x(2),    , x(t)] y1 =
          no    x2 = [x(t+1),    , x(2t)] y2 =    yes    x3 = [x(2t+1),    , x(3t)] y3
       =    yes    ...
    4. [72]4. 4 supervised learning build a function: =   ( ),        m ,           
       depending on the type of outcome we get        regression: is continous
       (e.g. temperature samples = {19  , 23  , 22  })     classification: is
       discrete (e.g. = {1, 2, 5, 2, 2}).     beware! these are unordered
       categories, not numerically meaningful outputs: e.g. code[1] =
          dog   , code[2] =    cat   , code[5] =    ostrich   , ...

       representations as well, not only the final mapping     end2end
       learned extraction classifier model maps raw inputs to raw outputs,
       no intermediate blocks. end2end model    hola que tal   
    8. [76]8. 8 id75 function approximation =     x +    , with
       learnable parameters    = {  ,   }
    9. [77]9. 9 id75 we can also make the function more
       complex for x being an m-dimensional set of features: =   1  x1 +
         2  x2 +   3  x3 +     +   m  xm +    e.g. we want to predict the price of
       a house based on: x1 = square-meters (sqm) x2,3 = location (lat,
       lon) x4 = year of construction (yoc) price =   1  (sqm) +   2  (lat) +
         3  (lon) +   4  (yoc) +        fitting   ( ) means adjusting (learning)
       the values    = {  1,   2,     ,   m,   }     how? will see in training
       chapter, stay tunned!
   10. [78]10. 10 id28 in the classification world we talk
       about probabilities, and more concretely: given x input data
       features     id203 of y being:     a dog p(y=dog|x)     a cat
       p(y=cat|x)     a horse p(y=horse|x)     whatever p(y=whatever|x). we
       achieve so with the sigmoid function! bounded   (x)     (0, 1)note:
       this is a binary classification approach
   11. [79]11. 11 id28 interpretation: build a delimiting
       boundary between our data classes + apply the sigmoid function to
       estimate a id203 in every point in the space.
   12. [80]12. 12 the id88 both operations, id75 and
       id28, follow the scheme in the figure: depending on
       the activation function    we have a linear/non-linear behavior: if
          == identity     id75 if    == sigmoid     logistic
       regression
   13. [81]13. 13 the id88 the output is then derived by a weighted
       sum of the inputs plus a bias term. weights and bias are the
       parameters we keep (once learned) to define a neuron.
   14. [82]14. 14 the id88 actually the artificial neuron is seen as
       an analogy to a biological one. real neuron fires an impulse once
       the sum of all inputs is over a threshold. the sigmoid emulates the
       thresholding behavior     act like a switch. figure

   15. [83]15. 15 multi-class classification natural extension: put many
       neurons in parallel, each processing its binary output out of n
       possible classes. 0.3    dog    0.08    cat    0.6    whatever    raw pixels
       unrolled img id172 factor, remember: we want a pdf at the
       output!     all output p   s sum up to 1. softmax function
   16. [84]16. 16 the neural network the xor problem: sometimes a single
       neuron is not enough     just a single decision split doesn   t work
   17. [85]17. 17 the neural network solution: arrange many neurons in a
       first intermediate non-linear mapping (hidden layer), connecting
       everything from layer to layer in a feed-forward fashion. warning!
       inputs are not neurons, but they are usually depicted like neurons.
       example xor nn 2 hidden units with sigmoid activations output unit
       with sigmoid activation
   18. [86]18. the i-th layer is defined by a matrix wi and a vector bi,
       and the activation is simply a dot product plus bi: the neural
       network num parameters to learn at i-th layer: 18
   19. [87]19. the i-th layer is defined by a matrix wi and a vector bi,
       and the activation is simply a dot product plus bi: the neural
       network num parameters to learn at i-th layer: 19
   20. [88]20. important remarks:     we can put as many hidden layers as we
       want whenever training can be effectively done and we have enough
       data (next chapters)     the amount of parameters to estimate grows
       very quickly with the num of layers and units!     there is no
       formula to know the amount of units per layer nor the amount of
       layers, pitty...     the power of nnets comes from non-linear
       mappings: hidden units must be followed by a non-linear activation!

       neural network
   21. [89]21. regression metrics in regression the metric is chosen based
       on the task:     for example in tts there are different metrics for
       the different predicted parameters:     mel-cepstral distortion, root
       mean squared error f0, duration, ... 21
