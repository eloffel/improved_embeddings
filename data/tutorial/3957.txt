   winter school on deep learning for speech and language. upc
   barcelonatech etsetb telecombcn.
   the aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning
   for speech and language. recurrent neural networks (id56) will be
   presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these
   state of the art tools for time series processing. engineering tips and
   scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine
   translation, id103, id133 or question
   answering. hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that
   attendees can become competent in contemporary data analytics tools.

convolutional neural networks (d1l3 deep learning for speech and language)

    1. 1. [course site] day 1 lecture 3 convolutional neural networks
       elisa sayrol
    2. [58]2. the i-th layer is defined by a matrix wi and a vector bi,
       and the activation is simply a dot product plus bi: the deep neural
       network num parameters to learn at i-th layer: 2
    3. [59]3. from neurons to convolutional neural networks what if the
       input is a 2d signal? (images, spectrogram, but also 1d signals)
    4. [60]4. from neurons to convolutional neural networks for a 200x200
       image, we have 4x104 neurons each one with 4x104 inputs, that is
       16x108 parameters, only for one layer!!! figure credit: ranzatto
    5. [61]5. from neurons to convolutional neural networks for a 200x200
       image, we have 4x104 neurons each one with 10x10    local
       connections    (also called receptive field) inputs, that is 4x106
       what else can we do to reduce the number of parameters? figure
       credit: ranzatto
    6. [62]6. from neurons to convolutional neural networks translation
       invariance: we can use same parameters to capture a specific
          feature    in any area of the image. we can try different sets of
       parameters to capture different features. these operations are
       equivalent to perform convolutions with different filters. ex:
       with100 different filters (or feature extractors) of size 10x10,
       the number of parameters is 104 figure credit: ranzatto
    7. [63]7. from neurons to convolutional neural networks     and don   t
       forget the activation function! figure credit: ranzatto relu prelu
    8. [64]8. from neurons to convolutional neural networks most convnets
       use pooling (or subsampling) to reduce dimensionality and provide
       invariance to small local changes. pooling options:     max     average
           stochastic pooling figure credit: ranzatto
    9. [65]9. from neurons to convolutional neural networks padding (p):
       when doing the convolution in the borders, you may add values to
       compute the convolution. when the values are zero, that is quite
       common, the technique is called zero-padding. when padding is not
       used the output size is reduced. fxf=3x3
   10. [66]10. from neurons to convolutional neural networks padding (p):
       when doing the convolution in the borders, you may add values to
       compute the convolution. when the values are zero, that is quite
       common, the technique is called zero-padding. when padding is not
       used the output size is reduced. fxf=5x5
   11. [67]11. from neurons to convolutional neural networks stride (s):
       when doing the convolution or another operation, like pooling, we
       may decide to slide not pixel by pixel but every 2 or more pixels.
       the number of pixels that we skip is the value of the stride. it
       might be used to reduce the dimensionality of the output
   12. [68]12. from neurons to convolutional neural networks example: most
       convnets contain several convolutional layers, interspersed with
       pooling layers, and followed by a small number of fully connected
       layers a layer is characterized by its width, height and depth
       (that is, the number of filters used to generate the feature maps)
       an architecture is characterized by the number of layers lenet-5
       from lecun   98
   13. [69]13. from neurons to convolutional neural networks example 1:
       id98 for sl    character-based id4    marta r.
       costa-juss   and jos   a. r. fonollosa
   14. [70]14. from neurons to convolutional neural networks example 2:
       id98 for sl    convolutional neural network for id103

       gerald penn, and dong yu ieee/acm transactions on audio, speech,
       and language processing, vol.22, no. 10, october 2014
