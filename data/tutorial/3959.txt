   winter school on deep learning for speech and language. upc
   barcelonatech etsetb telecombcn.
   the aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning
   for speech and language. recurrent neural networks (id56) will be
   presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these
   state of the art tools for time series processing. engineering tips and
   scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine
   translation, id103, id133 or question
   answering. hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that
   attendees can become competent in contemporary data analytics tools.

    3. [57]3. id26 algorithm the output of the network gives
       class scores that depens on the input and the parameters     define a
       id168 that quantifies our unhappiness with the scores
       across the training data.     come up with a way of efficiently
       finding the parameters that minimize the id168
       (optimization)

       (plus some id173 term) w.r.t. parameters over the whole
       training set. id168; e.g., negative log-likelihood (good
       for classification) h2 h3 a3 a4 h4 loss hidden hidden output w2 w3

       figure credit: kevin mcguiness forward pass
    7. [61]7. id26 algorithm     we need a way to fit the model
       to data: find parameters (w(k) , b(k) ) of the network that
       (locally) minimize the id168.     we can use stochastic
       id119. or better yet, mini-batch stochastic gradient
       descent.     to do this, we need to find the gradient of the loss
       function with respect to all the parameters of the model (w(k) ,
       b(k) )     these can be found using the chain rule of
       differentiation.     the calculations reveal that the gradient wrt.
       the parameters in layer k only depends on the error from the above
       layer and the output from the layer below.     this means that the
       gradients for each layer can be computed iteratively, starting at
       the last layer and propagating the error back through the network.
       this is known as the id26 algorithm. slide credit: kevin

   12. [66]12. in the backward pass you might be in the flat part of the
       sigmoid (or any other activation function like tanh) so derivative
       tends to zero and your training loss will not go down    vanishing
