   winter school on deep learning for speech and language. upc
   barcelonatech etsetb telecombcn.
   the aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning
   for speech and language. recurrent neural networks (id56) will be
   presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these
   state of the art tools for time series processing. engineering tips and
   scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine
   translation, id103, id133 or question
   answering. hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that
   attendees can become competent in contemporary data analytics tools.

    2. [58]2. slide credit: eva mohedano training set training
       overfitting/underfitting id173 hyperparamenters overview
    3. [59]3. 2.1 3.2 4.8 0.1 0.0 2.6 3.1 1.4 2.5 0.2 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.3 3.2
       9.3 6.4 0.3 2.0 5.0 3.2 1.0 6.9 9.1 9.0 3.5 5.4 5.5 3.2 1.0 n
       training examples (rows) d features (columns) 0 1 1 0 0 n training
       set
    4. [60]4. dataset shuffled data shuffle training data (70%) test data
       (30%) split learning algorithm fit(x, y) model prediction algorithm
       predict(x) predictions compute error/accuracy score(x, y)
       out-of-sample error estimate no! training set: train/test splits
    5. [61]5. split your dataset into train and test at the very start
       usually good practice to shuffle data (exception: time series) do
       not look at test data (data snooping)! lock it away at the start to
       prevent contamination nb: never ever train on the test data! you
       have no way to estimate error if you do your model could easily
       overfit the test data and have poor generalization, you have no way
       of knowing without test data model may fail in production training
       set: data hygiene
    6. [62]6. given some paired training examples {(xi , yi ): xi     x, yi
           y} produce a function y = f(x) such that f(x) generalizes well to
       previously unseen data. examples x are times of day, y are light
       levels x are light levels, y are times of day x are measurements
       from sensors (temp, humidity, brightness, etc.), y is {rain, no
       rain} x are words occurring in an email, y is {spam, not spam} x
       are vectors of image pixels, y is {cat, dog, car, person,    } x are
       recorded audio fragments, y are words training: goal
    7. [63]7. training: remember metrics/id168 classification
       metrics: example: binary cross id178: not differenciable!
    8. [64]8. training: monitoring progress 1. split data into train,
       validation, and test sets keep 10-30% of data for validation 2. fit
       model parameters on train set using sgd 3. after each epoch: test
       model on validation set and compute loss also compute whatever
       other metrics you are interested in, e.g. top-5 accuracy save a
       snapshot of the model 4. plot learning curves as training
       progresses 5. stop when validation loss starts to increase 6. use
       model with minimum validation loss epoch loss validation loss
       training loss best model 8
    9. [65]9. overfitting symptoms: validation loss decreases at first,
       then starts increasing training loss continues to go down try: find
       more training data add stronger id173 dropout,
       drop-connect, l2 data augmentation (flips, rotations, noise) reduce
       complexity of your model epoch loss validation loss training loss 9
   10. [66]10. underfitting symptoms: training loss decreases at first but
       then stops training loss still high training loss tracks validation
       loss try: increase model capacity add more layers, increase layer
       size use more suitable network architecture e.g. multi-scale
       architecture decrease id173 strength epoch loss validation
       loss training loss 10
   11. [67]11. id173 early stopping is a form of structural risk
       minimization limits the space of models we explore to only those we
       expect to have good generalization error helps prevent overfitting
       a type of id173 other id173 techniques: weight
       constraints: e.g. l2 id173 aka. weight decay dropout
       id21, pretraining model space regularized model space
       local min with good generalization error local min with poor
       generalization error (overfit) 11
   12. [68]12. id173: weight decay add a penalty to the loss
       function for large weights l2 id173 on weights
       differentiating, this translates to decaying the weights with each
       id119 step model space 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 4 3 2 1 underfit
       overfit 12
   13. [69]13. id173: dropout modern id173 technique for
       deep nets used by many deepnets method: during training, outputs of
       a layer to zero randomly with id203 p prevents units from
       co-adapting too much forces network to learn more robust features
       at test time, dropout is disabled and unit output is multiplied by
       p srivastava et al. dropout: a simple way to prevent neural
       networks from overfitting. jrml 15(1), 2014, pp 1929-1958. 13
   14. [70]14. hyperparameters can already see we have lots of
       hyperparameters to choose: 1. learning rate 2. id173
       constant 3. number of epochs 4. number of hidden layers 5. nodes in
       each hidden layer 6. weight initialization strategy 7. loss
       function 8. id180 9.     :( choosing these is
       difficult, and a bit of an art. there are some reasonable
       heuristics: 1. try 0.1 for the learning rate. if this doesn   t work,
       divide by 3. repeat. 2. multiply lr by 0.1 every 1-10 epochs. 3.
       try ~ 0.00001 as id173 constant 4. try an existing network
       architecture and adapt it for your problem 5. start smallish, keep
       adding layers and nodes until you overfit too much you can also do
       a hyperparameter search if you have enough compute: randomized
       search tends to work well 14
   15. [71]15. 15 to produce a function that generalizes well to unseen
       data it can be a challenging task: overffitting/underfitting
       id173 as a way of adding extra information during training
       for finding the good model. training neural networks requires to
       set a large number of parameters (hyperparameters). choosing is
       difficult and requires experimentation (a bit of an art!). summary
