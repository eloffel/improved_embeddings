id3 (d2l5 deep learning for speech and language
upc 2017)

    1. 1. [course site] day 2 lecture 5 id3
       santiago pascual
    2. [71]2. 2 outline 1. what are generative models? 2. why generative
       models? 3. which generative models? 4. generative adversarial
       networks 5. applications to images 6. applications to speech
    3. [72]3. 3 what are generative models? we want our model with
       parameters    = {weights, biases} and outputs distributed like
       pmodel to estimate the distribution of our training data pdata.
       example) y = f(x), where y is scalar, make pmodel similar to pdata
       by training the parameters    to maximize their similarity.
    4. [73]4. key idea: our model cares about what distribution generated
       the input data points, and we want to mimic it with our
       probabilistic model. our learned model should be able to make up
       new samples from the distribution, not just copy and paste existing
       samples! 4 what are generative models? figure from nips 2016
       tutorial: id3 (i. goodfellow)
    5. [74]5.     model very complex and high-dimensional distributions.    
       be able to generate realistic synthetic samples     possibly perform
       data augmentation     simulate possible futures for learning
       algorithms     fill the blanks in the data     manipulate real samples
       with the assistance of the generative model     edit pictures
       (exemplified later) 5 why generative models?
    6. [75]6. 1. id3 2. autoregressive methods
       (wavenet)     stay tuned, next chapters 3. variational autoencoder 6
       current most known options:
    7. [76]7. 7 id3 (gan) we have a pair of
       networks, generator (g) and discriminator (d):     they    fight   
       against each other during training    adversarial training     g
       mission: make its pdf, pmodel, as much similar as possible to our
       training set distribution pdata     try to make predictions so
       realistic that d can   t distinguish     d mission: distinguish between
       g samples and real samples
    8. [77]8. adversarial training (goodfellow et al. 2014) we have
       networks g and d, and training set with pdf pdata. notation:    
         (g),   (d) (parameters of model g and d respectively)     x ~ pdata
       (m-dim sample from training data pdf)     z ~ n(0, i) (sample from
       prior pdf, e.g. n-dim normal)     g(z) =     ~ pg (m-dim sample from g
       network) d network receives x or     inputs     decides whether input
       is real or fake. it is optimized to learn: x is real (1),     is fake
       (0) (binary classifier). g network maps sample z to g(z) =         it
       is optimized to maximize d mistakes. nips 2016 tutorial: generative
       adversarial networks. ian goodfellow
    9. [78]9. adversarial training (batch update)     pick a sample x from
       training set     show x to d and update weights to output 1 (real)
   10. [79]10. adversarial training (batch update)     g maps sample z to    
           show     and update weights to output 0 (fake)
   11. [80]11. adversarial training (batch update)     freeze d weights    
       update g weights to make d output 1 (just g weights!)     unfreeze d
       weights and repeat
   12. [81]12. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. key idea: as d is trained
       to detect fraud, its parameters learn discriminative features of
          what is real/fake   . as backprop goes through d to g there happens
       to be information leaking about the requirements for bank notes to
       look real. this makes g perform small corrections by little steps
       to get closer and closer to what a real sample would be.     caveat:
       this means gans are not suitable for discrete tokens predictions,
       like words, because in that discrete space there is no    small
       change    criteria to get to a neighbour word (but can work in a word
       embedding space for example)
   13. [82]13. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. 100 100 it   s not even
       green
   14. [83]14. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. 100 100 there is no
       watermark
   15. [84]15. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. 100 100 watermark should
       be rounded
   16. [85]16. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. ? after enough iterations,
       and if the counterfeiter is good enough (in terms of g network it
       means    has enough parameters   ), the police should be confused.
   17. [86]17. adversarial training analogy imagine we have a
       counterfeiter (g) trying to make fake money, and the police (d) has
       to detect whether money is real or fake. ? after enough iterations,
       and if the counterfeiter is good enough (in terms of g network it
       means    has enough parameters   ), the police should be confused.
   18. [87]18. conditioned gans gans can be conditioned on other info
       extra to z: text, labels, etc.. z might capture random
       characteristics of the data, variabilities of possible futures,
       whilst c would condition the deterministic parts for details on
       ways to condition gans: ways of conditioning generative adversarial
       networks (wack et al.)
   19. [88]19. gan applications so far gans have been extensively used in
       id161 tasks:     generating images/generating video frames
           unsupervised feature extraction/learning representations    
       manipulating images (in a photoshop advanced level)     image
       coding/super resolution     transferring image styles however we have
       been working on advances for speech generation!
   20. [89]20. generating images/frames (radford et al. 2015) deep conv.
       gan (dcgan) effectively generated 64x64 rgb images in a single
       shot. for example bedrooms from lsun dataset.
   21. [90]21. generating images/frames conditioned on captions (reed et
       al. 2016b) (zhang et al. 2016)
   22. [91]22. unsupervised feature extraction/learning representations
       similarly to id97, gans learn a distributed representation that
       disentangles concepts such that we can perform operations on the
       data manifold: v(man with glasses) - v(man) + v(woman) = v(woman
       with glasses) (radford et al. 2015)
   23. [92]23. image super-resolution bicubic: not using data statistics.
       srresnet: trained with mse. srgan is able to understand that there
       are multiple correct answers, rather than averaging. (ledig et al.
       2016)
   24. [93]24. image super-resolution averaging is a serious problem we
       face when dealing with complex distributions. (ledig et al. 2016)
   25. [94]25. manipulating images and assisted content creation
       https://youtu.be/9c4z6ysbgq0?t=126
       https://youtu.be/9c4z6ysbgq0?t=161 (zhu et al. 2016)
   26. [95]26. waveforms generation we have done recent advances in
       generating speech signals with gan models. there are none existent
       systems doing so until now. current line of research. (s.pascual,
       a.bonafonte, j.serr  )
   27. [96]27. where is the downside...? well gans are tricky and hard to
       train! we do not want to minimize a cost function. instead we want
       both networks to reach a nash equilibria (saddle point). because of
       extensive experience within the gan community (with some
       does-not-work-frustration from time to time), you can find some
       tricks and tips on how to train a gan here:
       https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks an open problem of gans is the
       evaluation of their generation quality: there are no established
       objective metrics to do so     we look (or hear) the generated
       samples to know when to stop training or how are we doing. caveats
