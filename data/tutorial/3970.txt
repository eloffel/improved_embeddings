   winter school on deep learning for speech and language. upc
   barcelonatech etsetb telecombcn.
   the aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning
   for speech and language. recurrent neural networks (id56) will be
   presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these
   state of the art tools for time series processing. engineering tips and
   scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine
   translation, id103, id133 or question
   answering. hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that
   attendees can become competent in contemporary data analytics tools.

    6. [62]6. 6 statistical-based approach main approaches have been

    7. [63]7. 7 why a new approach? we need years to develop a nice
       rule-based approach regarding statistical systems: (1) word
       alignment and translation are optimized separately (2) translation
       at the level of words, but difficulties with high variations in
       morphology (e.g. translation english-to-finnish) (3) translation by
       language pairs (a) difficult to think of an automatic interlingua
       (b) bad performance with low resourced-languages
