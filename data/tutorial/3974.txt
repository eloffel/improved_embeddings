   winter school on deep learning for speech and language. upc
   barcelonatech etsetb telecombcn.
   the aim of this course is to train students in methods of deep learning
   for speech and language. recurrent neural networks (id56) will be
   presented and analyzed in detail to understand the potential of these
   state of the art tools for time series processing. engineering tips and
   scalability issues will be addressed to solve tasks such as machine
   translation, id103, id133 or question
   answering. hands-on sessions will provide development skills so that
   attendees can become competent in contemporary data analytics tools.

       concatenates forward and reverse encoding vectors     the decoder
       generates one symbol at a time based on this new context set to
       compute the new decoder memory state, we must get one vector out of
       all context vectors.
    9. [63]9. 9 compute the context vector each time step t, one vector
       context (c_i) is computed based on the (1) previous hidden state of
       the decoder (z_(i-1)), (2) previously decoded symbol (u_(i-1)), (3)
       whole context set (c)
   10. [64]10. 10 score each context vector based on how relevant it is
       for translating the next target word this scoring (h_j, j=1...t_x)

       target word and the j-th context vector
   11. [65]11. 11 score each context vector based on how relevant it is
       for translating the next target word fscore is usually a simple
       single-layer feedforward network this relevance score measures how
       relevant the j-th context vector of the source sentence is in
       deciding the next symbol in the translation
   12. [66]12. 12 normalize relevance scores=attention weight these
       attention weights correspond to how much the decoder attends to
       each of the context vectors.

   22. [76]22. 22 character-based id4: motivation
          id27s have been shown to boost the performance in many
       nlp tasks, including machine translation.    however, the standard
       look-up based embeddings are limited to a finite-size vocabulary
       for both computational and sparsity reasons.    the orthographic
       representation of the words is completely ignored.    the standard
       learning process is blind to the presence of stems, prefixes,
       suffixes and any other kind of affixes in words.
   23. [77]23. 23 character-based neural mt: proposal (step 1)    the
       computation of the representation of each word starts with a
       character-based embedding layer that associates each word (sequence
       of characters) with a sequence of vectors.    this sequence of
       vectors is then processed with a set of 1d convolution filters of
       different lengths followed with a max pooling layer.    for each
       convolutional filter, we keep only the output with the maximum
       value. the concatenation of these max values already provides us
       with a representation of each word as a vector with a fixed length
       equal to the total number of convolutional kernels.
   24. [78]24. 24 character-based neural mt: proposal (step 2)    the
       addition of two highway layers was shown to improve the quality of
       the language model in (kim et al., 2016).    the output of the second
       highway layer will give us the final vector representation of each
       source word, replacing the standard source id27 in the
       id4 system. architecture designed to ease
       gradient-based training of deep networks
