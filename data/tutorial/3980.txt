cross-lingual syntax

how can we do cross-lingual syntax ?

    find the structures we expect to find in all languages
    describe how they are dealt with

    using a representation that facilitates cross-linguistic parallelism

    allow language-specific extensions

1

approaches

ud tries to standardise between languages, and particularly:
    within language groups
    between typologically similar constructions

    basic principles:

    the primacy of content words
    clauses, nominals and modifier words
    core arguments vs. other dependents
    universal and language-specific relations
    basic and enhanced dependencies

the dog is cute

    modifier words

not always

5

core arguments

    arguments of basic intransitive and transitive verbs
    distinguished by one or more of the following properties:

    verbs usually only agree with core arguments
    core arguments normally appear without adpositions
    certain cases, traditionally called nominative, accusative, and

absolutive are typically reserved core arguments

    core arguments often occupy special positions in the clause
    syntactic phenomena like control, relativisation and passivisation can

be restricted to core arguments

    ud distinguishes core arguments from oblique dependents
    ud does not distinguish arguments from adjuncts

    co-ordination is not a dependency relation
    the    head    (parent node) is the first conjunct

17

subordination

complex clauses involving subordination arise because a core or non-core
dependent is realised as a clausal structure
four basic types:

non-core
core
adverbial clause modifiers
clausal subjects
clausal complements adnominal clause modifiers

these may be either finite or non-finite

18

clausal subjects

    when the role of subject is

filled by a clause
    relation is csubj
    sometimes blurry:

       his writing surprised me

matrix clause
