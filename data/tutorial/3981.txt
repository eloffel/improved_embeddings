ud as of now     treebanks

how many?
    languages: 50
    treebanks: 72
    trees: 642,000
    words: 12,400,000

can i use them?
    creative commons and gpl-like: 30
    creative commons non-commercial: 42

where from?
    http://universaldependencies.org
    official release preferred over github
    currently officially released: 70 treebanks
    twist: test sets currently withheld

ud treebanks come in many flavors and sizes

annotation:
    pos and base dependency relations compulsory: 72 treebanks
    ...and additionally:

    forms + features + lemmas: 58
    forms - features + lemmas: 4
    forms - features - lemmas: 7
    no forms: 3 (arabic-nyuad, english-esl, japanese-ktc)

    licensing

size:
    smallest: approx. 1000 words     swedish sign language, kazakh,

sanskrit

    largest: czech with 1.3m words, russian with 980k words

conll-u format

    derived from conll-x, overall logic same, details differ
    id form lemma upos xpos feats head deprel deps misc
    only id upos head deprel compulsory

distinguishing features:
    sentence-level metadata part of the format
    explicit (and compulsory!) representation of the original text
    deps field encodes the enhanced dependencies (non-tree structure)
    misc field allows arbitrary data stored for every word
    empty nodes     only referred to from the enhanced representation
    words as opposed to tokens

ud infrastructure - requirements

    83 treebank repositories
    100+ contributors
    online documentation consisting of roughly 14,000 web-pages
    guidelines, universal and language-specific
    discussions, decision making, validation
    regular, carefully checked official releases
    a comparatively small group of core    staff    running the show
    budget: $0

ud infrastructure - github

    github in use from day 1
    documentation and data first
    followed exclusive use of the issue tracker for discussions and

proposals

    before: many email chains     chaos
    practically everything happens openly

10

ud is open

11

data

    a github repository for every treebank

    ud_{language}-{treebank}
    master branch holds the most recent official release
    dev branch holds development data, not guaranteed to be valid
    some teams use github for development, others only to    submit   

their data prior to the release

    no strict requirements on the workflow

    official release: lindat, may & november, all treebanks which

contain valid data

12

docs

    one set of documentation for every language (not treebank)
    a github repository holding mostly markdown pages
    special care taken to make it easy to add tree visualizations and

examples

    stubs pre-generated when adding a new language
    11,000+ commits from 80+ contributors
    automatically regenerated on every push and published on github

pages

    the issue tracker for the docs repository is where all the ud activity

is happening

    hundreds of issues, thousands of replies

    documentation system: http://spyysalo.github.io/annodoc/

13

workflow and organization

    highly (cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)xxxxchaotic distributed
    all contributors given broad edit rights to all data, docs, and tools

repositories

    fully trust-based setup, git giving a safety net
    joakim holds the honorary title of chief cat herder and looks after

the project as a whole     is obeyed unconditionally

14

validation

    script to validate treebank data
    passing is compulsory
    format validation
    runs automatically every time a

treebank is updated

    indispensable especially close to an

official release date

    contributors: do we validate?
    release team: whom to help next?

http://universaldependencies.org/validation.html

15

content validation

    runs automatically every time a

treebank is updated

    reports    suspicious    syntactic

constructions

    passing not compulsory at the moment
    contributors: is there anything

odd-looking in my data?

adoption

tools and resources

ud is not just the treebanks
    parsers trained on ud data
    large multilingual parsebanks
    query tools for treebanks and parsebanks
    libraries for handling conll-u
    tree visualization tools
    annotation tools

17

parsers

    udpipe and syntaxnet
    state-of-the-art parsers, free
    full-stack parsers: raw text in - parses out
    models trained on all of ud
    udpipe     demo & web api
    udpipe web api     get parsed text with a simple http request

parsebanks

syntactic query

    dep_search
    http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/dep_search
    relatively expressive query language, especially geared towards

dependencies and rich morphology

    indexed:

    latest ud official release
       dev    branches - reindexed on every push
    up to 2 million trees for every language from the ud parsebanks

    web and api access
    used by some during annotation
    also serves as content validation back-end
