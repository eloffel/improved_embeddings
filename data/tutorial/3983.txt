    recognize certain clusters of symbols like    ...

    lexicalist hypothesis:

    words (not morphemes) are the basic units in syntax
    words enter in dependency relations
    words are forms of lemmas and have morphological features

    orthographic vs. syntactic word

    syntactically autonomous part of orthographic word
    contractions (al = a + el)
    clitics (v  monos = vamos + nos)

      a qu   hora nos vamos ma  ana?
    nos despertamos a las cinco.

   we wake up at    ve.

    taxonomy of 17 universal pos tags
    all languages use the same inventory

    not all tags have to be used by all languages
    need extensions? use features!

18

part-of-speech tags

    traditionally a mixture of morphological, syntactic/distributional

and semantic/notional criteria

    prefer grammatical > semantic criteria

    language-particular de   nition of a category

    but the name of the category is universal

    translated words: overlapping categories, but not perfect match
    upos of english dog is noun; so is french chien or russian             

    preferably pos is encoded in lexicon, not heavily

usage-dependent

    but not for incompatible syntactic functions

(e.g. pron vs. sconj)

multi-valued features (disjunction / parallel application)

    feature can have two or more values
    interpreted as disjunction
    example: in some languages, many pronouns function both as
interrogative and relative, but some pronouns are only relative.
the former will have prontype=int,rel

    in other cases, it is desirable to disambiguate by context. polish
kt  rym (form of kt  ry    which   ) can be case=ins, loc in singular or
dat in plural but we do not want to annotate case=dat,ins,loc!

    all values of the feature/language? omit the feature completely!

polish: gender=fem,masc,neut. spanish: gender=fem,masc

25

multi-valued features (serial application)

    currently used in turkish (language-speci   c values)

    two or more morphemes in chain, affecting the same feature

    example: voice=caupass (causative + passive => someone is caused

to do something)

    yan  l    be wrong   
    yan  lm      m voice=act    i was wrong   
    okuru yan  ltt      n   voice=cau    mislead the reader   
    okurlar yan  lt  lm    t  r voice=caupass    readers were misled

    sometimes features like tense help distinguish participle types
    not the same tense as with    nite verbs (reference point)
    but useful because:

    we use known ud primitives rather than language-speci   c labels

such as verbform=pastpart, or even partictype=past

    reasonably close to the grammatical meaning
