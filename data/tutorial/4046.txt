abstract

   [graph.png]

   we present a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective
   states. the electroencephalogram (eeg) and peripheral physiological
   signals of 32 participants were recorded as each watched 40 one-minute
   long excerpts of music videos. participants rated each video in terms
   of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance and
   familiarity. for 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also
   recorded. a novel method for stimuli selection was used, utilising
   retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight
   detection and an online assessment tool.

   the dataset is made publicly available and we encourage other
   researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation
   methods. the dataset was first presented in the following paper:
     * "[5]deap: a database for emotion analysis using physiological
       signals (pdf)", s. koelstra, c. muehl, m. soleymani, j.-s. lee, a.
