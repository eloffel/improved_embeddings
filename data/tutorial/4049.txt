id31 with lstms

   this repository contains the ipython notebook and training data to
   accompany the [84]o'reilly tutorial on id31 with lstms in
   tensorflow. see the original tutorial to run this code in a pre-built
   environment on o'reilly's servers with cell-by-cell guidance, or run
   these files on your own machine. there is also another file called
   pre-trained lstm.ipynb which allows you to input your own text, and see
   the output of the trained network.

downloading data

   before running the notebook, you'll first need to download all data
   we'll be using. this data is located in the models.tar.gz and
   training_data.tar.gz tarballs. we will extract these into the same
   directory as oriole lstm.ipynb. as always, the first step is to clone
   the repository.
git clone https://github.com/adeshpande3/lstm-sentiment-analysis.git

   next, we will navigate to the newly created directory and run the
   following commands.
tar -xvzf models.tar.gz
tar -xvzf training_data.tar.gz

requirements and installation

   in order to run [85]the ipython notebook, you'll need the following
   libraries.
     * [86]tensorflow version 1.1 (see below for later versions)
     * [87]numpy
     * [88]jupyter
     * [89]matplotlib

tensorflow 1.2 and later

   in order to load the models without errors you need to convert the
   checkpoints using the converter provided by tensorflow:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/tensorflow/c
ontrib/id56/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py
python checkpoint_convert.py models/pretrained_lstm.ckpt-90000 converted-checkpo
ints/pretrained_lstm-90000.ckpt

   you should also replace the original models folder if you don't want to
   modify the code:
rm -rf models
mv converted-checkpoints models

docker

   with docker, you could just mount the repository and exec it.
    1. install docker. follow the [90]docker guide.
    2. build docker image
cd lstm-sentiment-analysis
docker build -t="@yourname/tensorflow_1.1.0_py3" .
    3. run the container from the image
docker run -p 8888:8888 --name=tensorflow_yourname_py3 -v /@yourdir/lstm-sentime
nt-analysis:/lstm-sentiment-analysis -it @yourname/tensorflow_1.1.0_py3
       and visit the url([91]http://localhost:8888/)
    4. stop and restart the container
docker stop tensorflow_yourname_py3
docker start tensorflow_yourname_py3
docker attach tensorflow_yourname_py3
       if jupyter is down, relaunch it by using the command below.
cd lstm-sentiment-analysis
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root

installing anaconda python and tensorflow

   the easiest way to install tensorflow as well as numpy, jupyter, and
   matplotlib is to start with the anaconda python distribution.
    1. follow the [92]installation instructions for anaconda python. we
       recommend using python 3.6.
    2. follow the platform-specific [93]tensorflow installation
       instructions. be sure to follow the "installing with anaconda"
       process, and create a conda environment named tensorflow.
    3. if you aren't still inside your conda tensorflow environment, enter
       it by opening your terminal and typing
source activate tensorflow
    4. if you haven't done so already, download and unzip [94]this entire
       repository from github, either interactively, or by entering
git clone https://github.com/adeshpande3/lstm-sentiment-analysis
    5. use cd to navigate into the top directory of the repo on your
       machine
    6. launch jupyter by entering
jupyter notebook
       and, using your browser, navigate to the url shown in the terminal
       output (usually [95]http://localhost:8888/)
