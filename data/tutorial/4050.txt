amazon   s alexa passes 15,000 skills, up from 10,000 in february

   amazon   s [8]alexa voice platform has now passed 15,000 skills     the
   voice-powered apps that run on devices like the echo speaker, echo dot,
   newer echo show and others. the figure is up from the 10,000 skills
   amazon officially [9]announced back in february, which had then
   represented a 3x increase from september.

   the new 15,000 figure was first [10]reported via third-party analysis
   from voicebot, and amazon has now confirmed to techcrunch that the
   number is accurate.

   according to voicebot, which only analyzed skills in the u.s., the
   milestone was reached for the first time on june 30, 2017. during the
   month of june, new skill introductions increased by 23 percent, up from
   the less than 10 percent growth that was seen in each of the prior
   three months.

   the milestone also represents a more than doubling of the number of
   skills that were available at the beginning of the year, when
   voicebot [11]reported there were then 7,000 skills. that number
   was [12]officially confirmed by amazon at ces.

   voicebot also noted that flash briefings are still one of the most
   popular categories of skills, in terms of those that are live on the
   alexa skill store today. these news and information-focused voice apps
   include those from major media publications like the wall st. journal,
   npr, washington post ([13]ahem, [14]techcrunch), and others.

   because they   re one of the easiest skills to develop, flash briefings
   have grown to account for around 20 percent of the available skills.
   you can see this figure for yourself [15]here on the alexa skills
   store, which indicates there are 2,891    news    skills live now.

   the number of available skills is an important metric for tracking
   amazon   s success in the voice computing space.

   amazon is currently the leader in voice-powered devices, where it   s
   [16]expected to control 70 percent of the market this year     well ahead
   of google home, lenovo, lg and others. if anything, its success played
   a role in apple releasing its own siri-powered device, the
   [17]homepod. apple   s entrant aims to capture a portion of the market by
   attracting those who [18]care more about the speaker   s quality than the
   virtual assistant that ships with it. but one thing apple is [19]not
   talking about        yet     is whether third-party developers will be able
   to create homepod-compatible apps.

   in the meantime, amazon   s alexa is surging ahead, building out an
   entire voice app ecosystem so quickly that it hasn   t even been able to
   implement the usual safeguards     like a team that closely [20]inspects
   apps for terms of service violations, for example, or even tools that
   allow developers to make money from their creations. (for now,
   [21]amazon is simply handing out cash rewards to those building popular
   game skills     a category it sees has some early traction.)

   in the long run, amazon   s focus on growth over app ecosystem
   infrastructure could catch up with it. but for now, its alexa platform
   is much further ahead than its nearest competitor. though google home
   [22]saw a spike from holiday sales, it   s the echo dot that   s being
   adopted in droves thanks to its lower price point.

   in addition, google home has just 378 voice apps available as of june
   30, voicebot notes. microsoft   s cortana has only 65.

   while there   s been some criticism that many of amazon   s skills are
   low-quality, there   s also something to be said for being able to build
   out an app store   s long tail. maybe not all the skills are as useful as
   getting your daily dose of npr or being able to order an uber by voice,
   but having more than 15,000 to choose from means you have a better shot
   at finding one that will suit your needs.
