eval-word-vectors

   manaal faruqui, [75]manaalfar@gmail.com

   easy-to-use scripts for evaluating word vectors on a variety of tasks.
   these are the scripts that run behind the online tool on
   http://www.wordvectors.org/. i will be adding more evaluation scripts
   here over the course of time.

requirements

    1. python 2.7 (+numpy package)

data you need

    1. word vector file
    2. any word similarity evaluation file (if you are not using the
       provided ones)

   each vector file should have one word vector per line as follows (space
   delimited):-

   the -1.0 2.4 -0.3 ...

evaluating on multiple word sim tasks

   python all_wordsim.py word_vec_file word_sim_file_dir

   python all_wordsim.py skip-gram-vecs.txt data/word-sim/

evaluating on one word sim task

   python wordsim.py word_vec_file word_sim_file

   word_sim_file should be in the same format as files in data/word-sim/

reference

   please make sure to cite the papers corresponding to the word
   similarity dataset that you are using. this list of citation can be
   found at http://www.wordvectors.org/.

   please cite the following paper if you use this tool:
@inproceedings{faruqui-2014:systemdemo,
  author    = {faruqui, manaal  and  dyer, chris},
  title     = {community evaluation and exchange of word vectors at wordvectors.
org},
  booktitle = {proceedings of acl: system demonstrations},
  year      = {2014},
