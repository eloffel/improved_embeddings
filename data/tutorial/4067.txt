id63 in tensorflow

   tensorflow implementation of [85]id63. this
   implementation uses an lstm controller. ntm models with multiple
   read/write heads are supported.

   [86]alt_tag

   the referenced torch code can be found [87]here.

   ** 1. loss sometimes goes to nan even with the gradient clipping
   ([88]#2).** ** 2. the code is very poorly design to support ntm inputs
   with variable lengths. just use this code as a reference.**

prerequisites

     * python 2.7 or python 3.3+
     * [89]tensorflow 1.1.0
     * numpy

usage

   to train a copy task:
$ python main.py --task copy --is_train true

   to test a quick copy task:
$ python main.py --task copy --test_max_length 10

results

   more detailed results can be found [here](ipynb/ntm\ test.ipynb).
