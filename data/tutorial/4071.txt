a neural attention model for summarization

question: can a data-driven model capture abstractive phenomenon
necessary for summarization without explicit representations?

properties:

utilizes a simple attention-based neural conditional language model.

no syntax or other pipelining step, strictly data-driven.

generation is fully abstractive.
