science parse

   science parse parses scientific papers (in pdf form) and returns them
   in structured form. as of today, it supports these fields:
     * title
     * authors
     * abstract
     * sections (each with heading and body text)
     * bibliography, each with
          + title
          + authors
          + venue
          + year
     * mentions, i.e., places in the paper where bibliography entries are
       mentioned

   in json format, the [87]output looks like this (or like [88]this, if
   you want sections). the easiest way to get started is to use the output
   from this server.

new version: spv2

   there is a new version of science-parse out that works in a completely
   different way. it has fewer features, but higher quality in the output.
   check out the details at [89]https://github.com/allenai/spv2.

get started

   there are three different ways to get started with sp. each has its own
   document:
     * [90]server: this contains the sp server. it's useful for pdf
       parsing as a service. it's also probably the easiest way to get
       going.
     * [91]cli: this contains the command line interface to sp. that's
       most useful for batch processing.
     * [92]core: this contains sp as a library. it has all the extraction
       code, plus training and evaluation. both server and cli use this to
       do the actual work.

   alternatively, you can run the docker image: docker run -p 8080:8080
   --rm allenai/scienceparse:2.0.3

how to include into your own project

   the current version is 2.0.3. if you want to include it in your own
   project, use this:

   for sbt:
librarydependencies += "org.allenai" %% "science-parse" % "2.0.3"

   for maven:
<dependency>
  <groupid>org.allenai</groupid>
  <artifactid>science-parse_2.11</artifactid>
  <version>2.0.3</version>
</dependency>

   the first time you run it, sp will download some rather large model
   files. don't be alarmed! the model files are cached, and startup is
   much faster the second time.

   for licensing reasons, sp does not include libraries for some image
   formats. without these libraries, sp cannot process pdfs that contain
   images in these formats. if you have no licensing restrictions in your
   project, we recommend you add these additional dependencies to your
   project as well:
  "com.github.jai-imageio" % "jai-imageio-core" % "1.2.1",
  "com.github.jai-imageio" % "jai-imageio-jpeg2000" % "1.3.0", // for handling j
peg2000 images
  "com.levigo.jbig2" % "levigo-jbig2-imageio" % "1.6.5", // for handling jbig2 i
mages

development

   this project is a hybrid between java and scala. the interaction
   between the languages is fairly seaid113ss, and sp can be used as a
   library in any jvm-based language.

   our build system is sbt. to build science-parse, you have to have sbt
   installed and working. you can find details about that at
   [93]https://www.scala-sbt.org.

   once you have sbt set up, just start sbt in the main project folder to
   launch sbt's shell. there are many things you can do in the shell, but
   here are the most important ones:
     * test runs all the tests in all the projects.
     * cli/assembly builds a runnable superjar (i.e., a jar with all
       dependencies bundled) for the project. you can run it (from bash,
       not from sbt) with java -xmx10g -jar <location of superjar>.
     * server/assembly builds a runnable superjar for the webserver.
     * server/run starts the server directly from the sbt shell.

lombok

   this project uses [94]lombok which requires you to enable annotation
   processing inside of an ide. [95]here is the intellij plugin and you'll
   need to enable annotation processing (instructions [96]here).

   lombok has a lot of useful annotations that give you some of the nice
   things in scala:
     * val is equivalent to final and the right-hand-side class. it gives
       you type-id136 via some tricks
     * check out [97]@data

thanks

   special thanks goes to @kermitt2, whose work on [98]kermitt2/grobid
   inspired science parse, and helped us get started with some labeled
   data.
