tensorflow 101: understanding tensors and graphs to get you started in deep
learning

   [96]guest blog, march 29, 2017

introduction

   tensorflow is one of the most popular libraries in deep learning. when
   i started with tensorflow it felt like an alien language. but after
   attending couple of sessions in tensorflow, i got the hang of it. i
   found the topic so interesting that i delved further into it.

   while reading about tensorflow, i understood one thing. in order to
   understand tensorflow one needs to understand tensors and graphs. these
   are two basic things google tried to incorporate in it   s deep learning
   framework.

   in this article, i have explained the basics of tensors & graphs to
   help you better understand tensorflow.


what are tensors?

   as per the wiki definition of tensors:

     tensors are geometric objects that describe linear relations between
     geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors. elementary examples
     of such relations include the dot product, the cross product, and
     linear maps. geometric vectors, often used in physics and
     engineering applications, and scalars themselves are also tensors.

   as the definition goes, deep learning wants us to think that tensors as
   multidimensional arrays.

   in a recent talk by one of my colleagues, he was required to show the
   difference between a neural network made in numpy and tensors. while
   creating the material for the talk, he observed that numpy and tensors
   take almost the same time to run (with different optimizers).

   we both banged our headache over it in order to prove tensorflow is
   better but we couldn   t. this kept disturbing me and i decided to delve
   further into it.

   now, we need to understand tensors and numpy first.

   as per the numpy official website, it says:

     numpy can also be used as an efficient multidimensional container of
     generic data. arbitrary datatypes can be defined. this allows numpy
     to seaid113ssly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of
     databases.

   after reading this i   m sure the same question must have popped in your
   head as in mine. what   s the difference between tensors and ndimensional
   arrays?

   as per [97]stackexchange,  tensor : multidimensional array :: linear
   transformation : matrix.

   the above expression means tensors and multidimensional arrays are
   different types of object. the first is a type of function, the second
   is a data structure suitable for representing a tensor in a coordinate
   system.

   mathematically, tensors are defined as a multilinear function. a
   multi-linear function consists of various vector variables. a tensor
   field is a tensor valued function. for a rigorous mathematical
   explanation you can read [98]here.

   which means tensors are functions or containers which we need to
   define. the actual calculation happens when there   s data fed.  what we
   see as numpy arrays (1d, 2d,    , nd) can be considered as generic
   tensors.

   i hope now you would have some understanding of what are tensors.

why we need tensors in tensorflow?

   now, the big questions is why we need to deal with tensors in
   tensorflow. the big revelation is what numpy lacks is creating
   tensors. we can convert tensors to numpy and viceversa. that is
   possible since the constructs are defined definitely as
   arrays/matrices.

   i could get a few answers reading and searching for tensors and numpy
   arrays. for more reading, there   s no better resources than the official
   documentations.


what are graphs?

   theano   s meta-programming structure seems to be an inspiration for
   google to create tensorflow, but folks at google took it to a next
   level.

   according to the official tensorflow blog on getting started.

   a computational graph is a series of tensorflow operations arranged
   into a graph of nodes.
import tensorflow as tf
# if we consider a simple multiplication a = 2 b = 3 mul = a*b
print ("the multiplication produces:::", mul)
the multiplication produces::: 6
# but consider a tensorflow program to replicate above at = tf.constant(3) bt =
tf.constant(4)
mult = tf.mul(at, bt)
print ("the multiplication produces:::", mult)
the multiplication produces::: tensor("mul:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)

   each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as
   an output. one type of node is a constant. like all tensorflow
   constants, it takes no inputs, and it outputs a value it stores
   internally.

   i think the above statement holds true as we have seen that
   constructing a computational graph to multiply two values is rather a
   straight forward task. but we need the value at the end. we have
   defined the two constants, at and bt, along with their values. what if
   we don   t define the values?

   let   s check:
at = tf.constant() bt
= tf.constant()
mult = tf.mul(at, bt)
print ("the multiplication produces:::", mult)
                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                          
typeerror traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython   input   3   3d0aff390325> in <module>()
            > 1 at = tf.constant()
      2 bt = tf.constant()
      3
      4 mult = tf.mul(at, bt)
      5
typeerror: constant() missing 1 required positional argument: 'value'

   i guess the constant needs a value. next step would be to find out why
   we didn   t get any output. it seems that to evaluate the graph that we
   made, it needs to be run in a session.

   to understand this complexity, we need to understand what our
   computational graph has:
     * tensors: at, bt
     * operations: mult

   to execute mult, the computational graph needs a session where the
   tensors and operations would be evaluated. let   s now evaluate our graph
   in a session.
sess = tf.session()
# executing the session
print ("the actual multiplication result:::", sess.run(mult))
the actual multiplication result::: 12

   the above graph would print the same value since we are using
   constants. there are 2 more ways we could send values to the graph -
   variables and placeholders.

variables

   when you train a model, you use variables to hold and update
   parameters. variables are in memory buffers containing tensors. they
   must be explicitly initialized and can be saved to disk during and
   after training. you can later restore saved values to exercise or
   analyze the model.

   variable initializers must be run explicitly before other ops in your
   model can run. the easiest way to do that is to add an op that runs all
   the variable initializers, and run that op before using the model.

   read more [99]here.

   we can initialize variables from another variables too.  constants
   can   t be updated, that   s a shame everywhere. need to check whether
   dynamically variables can be created.

   we can conclude that placeholders is a way to define variables without
   actually defining the values to be passed to it when we create a
   computational graph.

   tf.placeholder() is the norm, used by all the tensorflow folks writing
   code daily.

   for a more in depth reading: [100]i/o for tensorflow.

   we would check out variables and placeholders below.
# variable

var1 = tf.variable(2, name="var1") var2
= tf.variable(3, name="var2")
 mulv = tf.mul(var1, var2)
 print (mulv)

tensor("mul_2:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)
with tf.session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) # always need to initialize the
variable
    print ("the variable var1 is:::", sess.run(var1))
    print ("the variable var2 is:::", sess.run(var2))
    print ("the computational result is:::", sess.run(mulv))
the variable var1 is::: 2
the variable var2 is::: 3
the computational result is::: 6


# placeholder

pl = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name="p")
pi = tf.constant(3.) c = tf.add(pl, pi)
 print (c)

tensor("add_1:0", dtype=float32)
with tf.session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) # always need to initialize the
var iables
    writer = tf.train.summarywriter("output", sess.graph)
    #print("the placeholder value passed:::", sess.run(pl, {pl:3}))
    print("the calculation result is:::", sess.run(c, {pl:3}))
writer.close()
warning:tensorflow:from <ipython   input   15   4c5578691c20>:3 in <module>.: summaryw
riter.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.training.summary_io) is deprecated and wi
ll be
removed after 2016   11   30.
instructions for updating:
please switch to tf.summary.filewriter. the interface and behavior is the same;
thi s is just a rename.
the calculation result is::: 6.0



end notes

   in this article, we observed the  basics of tensors and what do these
   do in a computational graph. the actual objective for creating this is
   to make tensors flow through the graph. we write the tensors and
   through sessions we make them flow.

   i hope you enjoyed reading this article.if you have any questions or
   doubts feel free to post them below.
