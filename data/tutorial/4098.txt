id195 chatbot for keras

   this repository contains a new generative model of chatbot based on
   id195 modeling. further details on this model can be found in section
   3 of the paper [91]end-to-end adversarial learning for generative
   conversational agents. in the case of publication using ideas or pieces
   of code from this repository, please kindly cite this paper.

   the trained model available here used a small dataset composed of ~8k
   pairs of context (the last two utterances of the dialogue up to the
   current point) and respective response. the data were collected from
   dialogues of english courses online. this trained model can be
   fine-tuned using a closed domain dataset to real-world applications.

   the canonical id195 model became popular in neural machine
   translation, a task that has different prior id203 distributions
   for the words belonging to the input and output sequences, since the
   input and output utterances are written in different languages. the
   architecture presented here assumes the same prior distributions for
   input and output words. therefore, it shares an embedding layer (glove
   pre-trained id27) between the encoding and decoding processes
   through the adoption of a new model. to improve the context
   sensitivity, the thought vector (i.e. the encoder output) encodes the
   last two utterances of the conversation up to the current point. to
   avoid forgetting the context during the answer generation, the thought
   vector is concatenated to a dense vector that encodes the incomplete
   answer generated up to the current point. the resulting vector is
   provided to dense layers that predict the current token of the answer.
   see section 3.1 of our paper for a better insight into the advantages
   of our model.

   the algorithm iterates by including the predicted token into the
   incomplete answer and feeding it back to the right-hand side input
   layer of the model shown below.

   [92]alt tag

   as can be seen in the figure above, the two lstms are arranged in
   parallel, while the canonical id195 has the recurrent layers of
   encoder and decoder arranged in series. recurrent layers are unfolded
   during id26 through time, resulting in a large number of
   nested functions and, therefore, a higher risk of vanishing gradient,
   which is worsened by the cascade of recurrent layers of the canonical
   id195 model, even in the case of gated architectures such as the
   lstms. i believe this is one of the reasons why my model behaves better
   during training than the canonical id195.

   the following pseudocode explains the algorithm.

   [93]alt tag

   the training of this new model converges in few epochs. using our
   dataset of 8k training examples, it was required only 100 epochs to
   reach categorical cross-id178 loss of 0.0318, at the cost of 139
   s/epoch running in a gpu gtx980. the performance of this trained model
   (provided in this repository) seems as convincing as the performance of
   a vanilla id195 model trained on the ~300k training examples of the
   cornell movie dialogs corpus, but requires much less computational
   effort to train.

   to chat with the pre-trained model:
    1. download the python file "conversation.py", the vocabulary file
       "vocabulary_movie", and the net weights "my_model_weights20", which
       can be found [94]here ;
    2. run conversation.py.

   to chat with the new model trained by our [95]new gan-based training
   algorithm:
    1. download the python file "conversation_discriminator.py", the
       vocabulary file "vocabulary_movie", and the net weights
       "my_model_weights20.h5", "my_model_weights.h5", and
       "my_model_weights_discriminator.h5", which can be found [96]here ;
    2. run conversation_discriminator.py.

   this model has a better performance using the same training data. the
   discriminator of the gan-based model is used to select the best answer
   between two models, one trained by teacher forcing and another trained
   by our new gan-like training method, whose details can be found in
   [97]this paper.

   to train a new model or to fine tune on your own data:
    1. if you want to train from the scratch, delete the file
       my_model_weights20.h5. to fine tune on your data, keep this file;
    2. download the glove folder 'glove.6b' and include this folder in the
       directory of the chatbot (you can find this folder [98]here). this
       algorithm applies id21 by using a pre-trained word
       embedding, which is fine tuned during the training;
    3. run split_qa.py to split the content of your training data into two
       files: 'context' and 'answers' and get_train_data.py to store the
       padded sentences into the files 'padded_context' and
       'padded_answers';
    4. run train_bot.py to train the chatbot (it is recommended the use of
       gpu, to do so type:
       theano_flags=mode=fast_run,device=gpu,floatx=float32,exception_verb
       osity=high python train_bot.py);

   name your training data as "data.txt". this file must contain one
   dialogue utterance per line. if your dataset is big, set the variable
   num_subsets (in line 29 of train_bot.py) to a larger number.

   weights_file = 'my_model_weights20.h5' weights_file_gan =
   'my_model_weights.h5' weights_file_discrim =
   'my_model_weights_discriminator.h5'

   a nice overview of the current implementations of neural conversational
   models for different frameworks (along with some results) can be found
   [99]here.

   our model can be applied to other nlp tasks, such as text
   summarization, see for example [100]alternate 2: recursive model a. we
   encourage the application of our model in other tasks, in this case, we
   kindly ask you to cite our work as can be seen in [101]this document,
   registered in july 2017.

   these codes can run in ubuntu 14.04.3 lts, python 2.7.6, theano 0.9.0,
   and keras 2.0.4. the use of another configuration may require some
   minor adaptations.
