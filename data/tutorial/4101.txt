tensorflow tutorials using jupyter notebook

   tensorflow tutorials written in python (of course) with jupyter
   notebook. tried to explain as kindly as possible, as these tutorials
   are intended for tensorflow beginners. hope these tutorials to be a
   useful recipe book for your deep learning projects. enjoy coding! :)
