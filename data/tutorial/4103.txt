[112]motivation

   there are different motivations for this open source project.
   tensorflow (as we write this document) is one of / the best deep
   learning frameworks available. the question that should be asked is why
   has this repository been created when there are so many other tutorials
   about tensorflow available on the web?

[113]why use tensorflow?

   deep learning is in very high interest these days - there's a crucial
   need for rapid and optimized implementations of the algorithms and
   architectures. tensorflow is designed to facilitate this goal.

   the strong advantage of tensorflow is it flexibility in designing
   highly modular models which can also be a disadvantage for beginners
   since a lot of the pieces must be considered together when creating the
   model.

   this issue has been facilitated as well by developing high-level apis
   such as [114]keras and [115]slim which abstract a lot of the pieces
   used in designing machine learning algorithms.

   the interesting thing about tensorflow is that it can be found anywhere
   these days. lots of the researchers and developers are using it and its
   community is growing at the speed of light! so many issues can be dealt
   with easily since they're usually the same issues that a lot of other
   people run into considering the large number of people involved in the
   tensorflow community.

[116]what's the point of this repository?

   developing open source projects for the sake of just developing
   something is not the reason behind this effort. considering the large
   number of tutorials that are being added to this large community, this
   repository has been created to break the jump-in and jump-out process
   that usually happens to most of the open source projects, but why and
   how?

   first of all, what's the point of putting effort into something that
   most of the people won't stop by and take a look? what's the point of
   creating something that does not help anyone in the developers and
   researchers community? why spend time for something that can easily be
   forgotten? but how we try to do it? even up to this very moment there
   are countless tutorials on tensorflow whether on the model design or
   tensorflow workflow.

   most of them are too complicated or suffer from a lack of
   documentation. there are only a few available tutorials which are
   concise and well-structured and provide enough insight for their
   specific implemented models.

   the goal of this project is to help the community with structured
   tutorials and simple and optimized code implementations to provide
   better insight about how to use tensorflow quick and effectively.

   it is worth noting that, the main goal of this project is to provide
   well-documented tutorials and less-complicated code!

[117]tensorflow installation and setup the environment

   [118]alternate text

   in order to install tensorflow please refer to the following link:

     * [119]tensorflow installation

   [120]_img/mainpage/installation.gif

   the virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent
   package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working
   environment.

[162]contributing

   when contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change
   you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners
   of this repository before making a change. for typos, please do not
   create a pull request. instead, declare them in issues or email the
   repository owner.

   please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
   interactions with the project.

[163]pull request process

   please consider the following criterions in order to help us in a
   better way:

     * the pull request is mainly expected to be a code script suggestion
       or improvement.
     * a pull request related to non-code-script sections is expected to
       make a significant difference in the documentation. otherwise, it
       is expected to be announced in the issues section.
     * ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end
       of the layer when doing a build and creating a pull request.
     * add comments with details of changes to the interface, this
       includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file
       locations and container parameters.
     * you may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of at
       least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do
       that, you may request the owner to merge it for you if you believe
       all checks are passed.

[164]final note

   we are looking forward to your kind feedback. please help us to improve
   this open source project and make our work better. for contribution,
   please create a pull request and we will investigate it promptly. once
   again, we appreciate your kind feedback and elaborate code inspections.

[165]acknowledgement

   i have taken huge efforts in this project for hopefully being a small
   part of tensorflow world. however, it would not have been plausible
   without the kind support and help of my friend and colleague
   [166]domenick poster for his valuable advices. he helped me for having
   a better understanding of tensorflow and my special appreciation goes
   to him.
