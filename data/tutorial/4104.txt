show, attend and tell

   update (december 2, 2016) tensorflow implementation of [88]show, attend
   and tell: neural image id134 with visual attention which
   introduces an attention based image caption generator. the model
   changes its attention to the relevant part of the image while it
   generates each word.

getting started

prerequisites

   first, clone this repo and [92]pycocoevalcap in same directory.
$ git clone https://github.com/yunjey/show-attend-and-tell-tensorflow.git
$ git clone https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption.git

   this code is written in python2.7 and requires [93]tensorflow 1.2. in
   addition, you need to install a few more packages to process [94]mscoco
   data set. i have provided a script to download the mscoco image dataset
   and [95]vggnet19 model. downloading the data may take several hours
   depending on the network speed. run commands below then the images will
   be downloaded in image/ directory and vggnet19 model will be downloaded
   in data/ directory.
$ cd show-attend-and-tell-tensorflow
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ chmod +x ./download.sh
$ ./download.sh

   for feeding the image to the vggnet, you should resize the mscoco image
   dataset to the fixed size of 224x224. run command below then resized
   images will be stored in image/train2014_resized/ and
   image/val2014_resized/ directory.
$ python resize.py

   before training the model, you have to preprocess the mscoco caption
   dataset. to generate caption dataset and image feature vectors, run
   command below.
$ python prepro.py

train the model

   to train the image captioning model, run command below.
$ python train.py

(optional) tensorboard visualization

   i have provided a tensorboard visualization for real-time debugging.
   open the new terminal, run command below and open
   http://localhost:6005/ into your web browser.
$ tensorboard --logdir='./log' --port=6005

evaluate the model

   to generate captions, visualize attention weights and evaluate the
   model, please see evaluate_model.ipynb.
