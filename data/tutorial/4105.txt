shakespeare translations using tensorflow

   this is an example of using the new google's [74]tensorflow library on
   monolingual translation going from modern english to shakespeare based
   on research from [75]wei xu.

prepare

   first download the tensorflow library depending on your platform:
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/tensorflow-0.5.0-py2-n
one-any.whl # for mac
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.5.0
-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl # for ubuntu

    1. grabs parallel data.
    2. gets train, dev split.
    3. builds vocabulary
    4. converts parallel data into ids

   from the root directory:
python -m tensorshake.get_data
python -m tensorshake.prepare_corpus

   delete /cache to start anew.

train

   use the example bash script to train the model. this saves the check
   points in the --train_dir directory. if you run it again, the training
   process continues from the check point. to restart with fresh
   parameters, simply delete/rename the check points.
./run.sh
