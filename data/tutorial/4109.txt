tflearn: deep learning library featuring a higher-level api for tensorflow.

   tflearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top
   of tensorflow. it was designed to provide a higher-level api to
   tensorflow in order to facilitate and speed-up experimentations, while
   remaining fully transparent and compatible with it.

   tflearn features include:
     * easy-to-use and understand high-level api for implementing deep
       neural networks, with tutorial and examples.
     * fast prototyping through highly modular built-in neural network
       layers, regularizers, optimizers, metrics...
     * full transparency over tensorflow. all functions are built over
       tensors and can be used independently of tflearn.
     * powerful helper functions to train any tensorflow graph, with
       support of multiple inputs, outputs and optimizers.
     * easy and beautiful graph visualization, with details about weights,
       gradients, activations and more...
     * effortless device placement for using multiple cpu/gpu.

   the high-level api currently supports most of recent deep learning
   models, such as convolutions, lstm, biid56, batchnorm, prelu, residual
   networks, generative networks... in the future, tflearn is also
   intended to stay up-to-date with latest deep learning techniques.

   note: latest tflearn (v0.3) is only compatible with tensorflow v1.0 and
   over.

overview

# classification
tflearn.init_graph(num_cores=8, gpu_memory_fraction=0.5)

net = tflearn.input_data(shape=[none, 784])
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 64)
net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 10, activation='softmax')
net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossid178')

model = tflearn.dnn(net)
model.fit(x, y)

# sequence generation
net = tflearn.input_data(shape=[none, 100, 5000])
net = tflearn.lstm(net, 64)
net = tflearn.dropout(net, 0.5)
net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, 5000, activation='softmax')
net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossid178')

model = tflearn.sequencegenerator(net, dictionary=idx, seq_maxlen=100)
model.fit(x, y)
model.generate(50, temperature=1.0)

   there are many more examples available [116]here.

installation

   tensorflow installation

   tflearn requires tensorflow (version 1.0+) to be installed.

   to install tensorflow, simply run:
pip install tensorflow

   or, with gpu-support:
pip install tensorflow-gpu

   for more details see [117]tensorflow installation instructions

   tflearn installation

   to install tflearn, the easiest way is to run

   for the bleeding edge version (recommended):
pip install git+https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn.git

   for the latest stable version:
pip install tflearn

   otherwise, you can also install from source by running (from source
   folder):
python setup.py install

     * for more details, please see the [118]installation guide.

getting started

   see [119]getting started with tflearn to learn about tflearn basic
   functionalities or start browsing [120]tflearn tutorials.

examples

   there are many neural network implementation available, see
   [121]examples.
