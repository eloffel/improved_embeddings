unsupervised data generated for geoquery and sail datasets

   this repository contains the generated unsupervised data for geoquery
   and sail id29 tasks.

   for a detailed description of this see below and in the paper
   [71]id29 with semi-supervised sequential autoencoders,
   ko  isk   et al., emnlp 2016. please cite the paper if you use this
   corpus in your work.

geoquery data

   for geoquery, we fit a 3-gram kneser-ney model to the queries in the
   training set and sample about 7 million queries from it. we ensure that
   the sampled queries are different from the training queries, but do not
   enforce validity.

sail data

   for this task we hand designed a maze by trying to approximately
   replicate the key statistics of the existing mazes (corridor lengths,
   number and types of intersections, object distribution).

path navigation action sequences

   to approximate the distribution of instruction sequences that
   correspond to utterances in the sail dataset, we selected randomly a
   starting point, an ending point, and a starting and ending orientation
   in the hand-designed maze. we then found the shortest action sequence
   between the two points. the sequence was then segmented into roughly
   utterance-sized instructions using heuristic rules.
