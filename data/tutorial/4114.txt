   event:
   [56]representation learning
   speaker:

   [57]russ salakhutdinov, carnegie mellon university

   in this talk i will focus on discussing deep learning models that can
   find semantically meaningful representations of words, learn to read
   documents and answer questions about their content. first, i will
   introduce the gated-attention (ga) reader model, that  integrates a
   multi-hop architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based
   on multiplicative interactions between the query embedding and the
   intermediate states of a recurrent neural network document reader. this
   enables the reader to build query-specific representations of tokens in
   the document for accurate answer selection. second, i will next
   introduce a two-step learning system to id53 from
   unstructured text, consisting of a retrieval step and a reading
   comprehension step. finally, i will discuss a fine-grained gating
   mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level
   representations based on properties of the words. i will show that on
   several tasks, these models significantly improve upon many of the
   existing techniques.
   joint work with with bhuwan dhingra, zhilin yang, yusuke watanabe,
   hanxiao liu, ye yuan, junjie hu, and william w. cohen
