   in data science, id119 is one of the important and difficult
   concepts. here we explain this concept with an example, in a very
   simple way. check this out.

   when i first started out learning about machine learning algorithms, it
   turned out to be quite a task to gain an intuition of what the
   algorithms are doing. not just because it was difficult to understand
   all the mathematical theory and notations, but it was also plain
   boring. when i turned to online tutorials for answers, i could again
   only see equations or high level explanations without going through the
   detail in a majority of the cases.

   it was then that one of my data science colleagues introduced me to the
   concept of working out an algorithm in an excel sheet. and that worked
   wonders for me. any new algorithm, i try to learn it in an excel at a
   small scale and believe me, it does wonders to enhance your
   understanding and helps you fully appreciate the beauty of the
   algorithm.

   let me explain to you using an example.

   most of the data science algorithms are optimization problems and one
   of the most used algorithms to do the same is the id119
   algorithm.

   now, for a starter, the name itself id119 algorithm may
   sound intimidating, well, hopefully after going though this post,that
   might change.

   lets take the example of predicting the price of a new price from
   housing data:

   now, given historical housing data,the task is to create a model that
   predicts the price of a new house given the house size.

   the task     for a new house, given its size (x), what will its price (y)
   be?

   lets start off by plotting the historical housing data:

   now, we will use a simple linear model, where we fit a line on the
   historical data, to predict the price of a new house (ypred) given its
   size (x)

   in the above chart, the red line gives the predicted house price
   (ypred) given house size (x).

   ypred = a+bx

   the blue line gives the actual house prices from historical data
   (yactual)

   the difference between yactual and ypred (given by the yellow dashed
   lines) is the prediction error (e)

   so, we need to find a line with optimal values of a,b (called weights)
   that best fits the historical data by reducing the prediction error and
   improving prediction accuracy.

   so, our objective is to find optimal a, b that minimizes the error
   between actual and predicted values of house price (1/2 is for
   mathematical convenience since it helps in calculating gradients in
   calculus)

   sum of squared errors (sse) =    sum (actual house price     predicted
   house price)^2

   =     sum(y     ypred)^2

   (please note that there are other measures of error. sse is just one of
   them.)

   this is where id119 comes into the picture. id119
   is an optimization algorithm that finds the optimal weights (a,b) that
   reduces  prediction error.

   lets now go step by step to understand the id119 algorithm:

   step 1: initialize the weights(a & b) with random values and calculate
   error (sse)

   step 2: calculate the gradient i.e. change in sse when the weights (a &
   b) are changed by a very small value from their original randomly
   initialized value. this helps us move the values of a & b in the
   direction in which sse is minimized.

   step 3: adjust the weights with the gradients to reach the optimal
   values where sse is minimized

   step 4: use the new weights for prediction and to calculate the new sse

   step 5: repeat steps 2 and 3 till further adjustments to weights
   doesn   t significantly reduce the error

   we will now go through each of the steps in detail (i worked out the
   steps in excel, which i have pasted below). but before that, we have to
   standardize the data as it makes the optimization process faster.

   step 1: to fit a line ypred = a + b x, start off with random values of
   a and b and calculate prediction error (sse)

   step 2: calculate the error gradient w.r.t the weights

      sse/   a =     (y-yp)

      sse/   b =     (y-yp)x

   here, sse=   (y-yp)^2 =   (y-(a+bx))^2

   you need to know a bit of calculus, but that   s about it!!

      sse/   a and    sse/   b are the gradients and they give the direction of
   the movement of a,b w.r.t to sse.

   step 3:adjust the weights with the gradients to reach the optimal
   values where sse is minimized

   we need to update the random values of a,b so that we move in the
   direction of optimal a, b.

   update rules:
     * a        sse/   a
     * b        sse/   b

   so, update rules:
    1. new a = a     r *    sse/   a = 0.45-0.01*3.300 = 0.42
    2. new b = b     r *    sse/   b= 0.75-0.01*1.545 = 0.73

   here, r is the learning rate = 0.01, which is the pace of adjustment to
   the weights.

   step 4:use new a and b for prediction and to calculate new total sse

   you can see with the new prediction, the total sse has gone down (0.677
   to 0.553). that means prediction accuracy has improved.

   step 5: repeat step 3 and 4 till the time further adjustments to a, b
   doesn   t significantly reduces the error. at that time, we have arrived
   at the optimal a,b with the highest prediction accuracy.

   this is the id119 algorithm. this optimization algorithm and
   its variants form the core of many machine learning algorithms like
   neural networks and even deep learning.

   disclaimers:

   please note that this post is primarily for tutorial purposes, hence:
    1. the data used is fictitious and data size is extremely small. also
       to simplify the example, the data and model, is a one variable
       example.
    2. this post is primarily meant to highlight how we can simplify our
       understanding of the math behind algorithms like id119
       by working them out in excel, hence there is no claim here that
       id119 gives better /worse results as compared to least
       square regression.
    3. since the data is very small, for tutorial purposes, the entire
       data is being used for training. however, while building actual
       predictive models, various data validation techniques are leveraged
       (example     train / test split or n- cross validation)
