convolutional neural network

overview

   this is the code for [81]this video on youtube by siraj raval as part
   of the math of intelligence course. a convolutional neural network
   implemented in pure numpy. it uses a mnist-like dataset with about 30
   alphanumeric symbols. the author trained a deep convolutional network
   using keras and saved the weights using python's pickle utility. only
   the the forward propagation code is rewritten in pure numpy (as opposed
   to theano or tensorflow as in keras). which lets us run the network as
   a demo via heroku. for id26 in numpy for a convnet see

dependencies
     __________________________________________________________________

   dependencies are packaged in the flask folder, so this app does not
   have any external depencies. run pip install -r requirements.txt to
   install them.

   install pip [86]here.

usage

   to start the web app run python run.py . to start the notebook run
   jupyter notebook in terminal.

   install jupyter [87]here.
