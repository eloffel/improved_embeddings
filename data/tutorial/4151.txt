   in 2006, clive humbly, uk mathematician, and architect of tesco   s
   clubcard coined the phrase    data is the new oil. he said the following:

      data is the new oil. it   s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot be
   used. it has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create
   a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so, must data be
   broken down, analyzed for it to have value.   

   the iphone revolution, growth of the mobile economy, advancements in
   big data technology has created a perfect storm. in 2012, hbr published
   an article that put data scientists on the radar. the article [16]data
   scientist: the sexiest job of the 21st century labeled this    new breed   
   of people; a hybrid of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and trusted
   adviser.

   every organization is now making attempts to be more data-driven.
   machine learning techniques have helped them in this endeavor. i
   realize that a lot of the material out there is too technical and
   difficult to understand. in this series of articles, my aim is to
   simplify data science. i will take a cue from the stanford course/book
   ([17]an introduction to statistical learning). this attempt is to make
   data science easy to understand for everyone.

   in this article, i will begin by covering fundamental principles,
   general process and types of problems in data science.

   data science is a multi-disciplinary field. it is the intersection
   between the following domains:
     * business knowledge
     * statistical learning aka machine learning
     * computer programming

   the focus of this series will be to simplify the machine learning
   aspect of data science. in this article, i will begin by covering
   principles, general process and types of problems in data science.

key principles

   [1*qsbtyuprx8aahbco99bo8w.png]
     * data is a strategic asset: this concept is an organisational
       mindset. the question to ask is:    are we using the all the data
       asset that we are collecting and storing? are we able to extract
       meaningful insights from them?   . i   m sure that the answers to these
       question are    no   . companies that are cloud born are intrinsically
       data-driven. it is in their psyche to treat data as a strategic
       asset. this mindset is not valid for most of the organisation.
     * systematic process for knowledge extraction: a methodical process
       needs to be in place for extracting insights from data. this
       process should have clear and distinct stages with clear
       deliverables. the cross industry standard process for data mining
       ([19]crisp-dm) is one such process.
     * sleeping with the data: organisations need to invest in people who
       are passionate about data. transforming data into insight is not
       alchemy. there are no alchemists. they need evangelists who
       understand the value of data. they need evangelists who are data
       literate and creative. they need folks who can connect data,
       technology, and business.
     * embracing uncertainty: data science is not a silver bullet. it is
       not a crystal ball. like reports and kpis, it is a decision
       enabler. data science is a tool and not a means to end. it is not
       in the realm of absolute. it is in the realm of probabilities.
       managers and decision makers need to embrace this fact. they need
       to embrace quantified uncertainty in their decision-making process.
       such uncertainty can only be entrenched if the organizational
       culture adopts a fail fast-learn fast approach. it will only thrive
       if organizations choose a culture of experimentation.
     * the bab principle: i perceive this as the most important principle.
       the focus of a lot of data science literature is on models and
       algorithms. the equation is devoid of business context.
       business-analytics-business (bab) is the principle that emphasizes
       the business part of the equation. putting them in a business
       context is pivotal. define the business problem. use analytics to
       solve it. integrate the output into the business process. bab.

process

   [1*_iu9od6j8z4teh3kvuqana.png]

   taking a cue from principle #2, let me now emphasize on the process
   part of data science. following are the stages of a typical data
   science project:

1. define business problem

   albert einstein once quoted    everything should be made as simple as
   possible, but not simpler   . this quote is the crux of defining the
   business problem. problem statements need to be developed and framed.
   clear success criteria need to be established. in my experience,
   business teams are too busy with their operational tasks at hand. it
   doesn   t mean that they don   t have challenges that need to be addressed.
   brainstorming sessions, workshops, and interviews can help to uncover
   these challenges and develop hypotheses. let me illustrate this with an
   example. let us assume that a telco company has seen a decline in their
   year-on-year revenue due to a reduction in their customer base. in this
   scenario, the business problem may be defined as:
     * the company need grow the customer base by targeting new segments
       and reducing customer churn.

2. decompose to machine learning tasks

   the business problem, once defined, needs to be decomposed to machine
   learning tasks. let   s elaborate on the example that we have set above.
   if the organization needs to grow our the customer base by targeting
   new segments and reducing customer churn, how can we decompose it into
   machine learning problems? following is an example of decomposition:
     * reduce the customer churn by x %.
     * identify new customer segments for targeted marketing.

3. data preparation

   once we have defined the business problem and decomposed into machine
   learning problems, we need to dive deeper into the data. data
   understanding should be explicit to the problem at hand. it should help
   us with to develop right kind of strategies for analysis. key things to
   note is the source of data, quality of data, data bias, etc.

4. exploratory data analysis

   a cosmonaut traverses through the unknowns of the cosmos. similarly, a
   data scientist traverses through the unknowns of the patterns in the
   data, peeks into the intrigues of its characteristics and formulates
   the unexplored. exploratory data analysis (eda) is an exciting task. we
   get to understand the data better, investigate the nuances, discover
   hidden patterns, develop new features and formulate modeling
   strategies.

5. modelling

   after eda, we move on to the modeling phase. here, based on our
   specific machine learning problems, we apply useful algorithms like
   regressions, id90, id79s, etc.

6. deployment and evaluation

   finally, the developed models are deployed. they are continuously
   monitored to observe how they behaved in the real world and calibrated
   accordingly.

   typically, the modeling and deployment part is only 20% of the work.
   80% of the work is getting your hands dirty with data, exploring the
   data and understanding it.

machine learning problem types

   [1*gv_zmhj2ljw-4fi1dl3l7g.png]

   in general, machine learning has two kinds of tasks:

supervised learning

   supervised learning is a type of machine learning task where there is a
   defined target. conceptually, a modeler will supervise the machine
   learning model to achieve a particular goal. supervised learning can be
   further classified into two types:

regression

   regression is the workhorse of machine learning tasks. they are used to
   estimate or predict a numerical variable. few examples of regression
   models can be:
     * what is the estimate of the potential revenue next quarter?
     * how many deals can i close next year?

classification

   as the name suggests, classification models classify something. it is
   estimated which bucket something is best suited. classification models
   are frequently used in all types of applications. few examples of
   classification models are:
     * spam filtering is a popular implementation of a classification
       model. here every incoming e-mail is classified as spam or not spam
       based on certain characteristics.
     * churn prediction is another important application of classification
       models. churn models used widely in telcos to classify whether a
       given customer will churn (i.e. cease to use the service) or not.

unsupervised learning

   unsupervised learning is a class of machine learning task where there
   are no targets. since unsupervised learning doesn   t have any specified
   target, the result that they churn out may be sometimes difficult to
   interpret. there are a lot of types of unsupervised learning tasks. the
   key ones are:
     * id91: id91 is a process of group similar things
       together. customer segmentation uses id91 methods.
     * association: association is a method of finding products that are
       frequently matched with each other. market basket analysis in
       retail uses association method to bundle products together.
     * link prediction: link prediction is used to find the connection
       between data items. recommendation engines employed by facebook,
       amazon and netflix heavily use link prediction algorithms to
       recommend us friends, items to purchase and movies respectively.
     * data reduction: data reduction methods are used to simplify data
       set from a lot of features to a few features. it takes a large data
       set with many attributes and finds ways to express them in terms of
       fewer attributes.

machine learning task to models to algorithm

   once we have broken down business problems into machine learning tasks,
   one or many algorithms can solve a given machine learning task.
   typically, the model is trained on multiple algorithms. the algorithm
   or set of algorithms that provide the best result is chosen for
   deployment.

   azure machine learning has more than 30 pre-built algorithms that can
   be used for training machine learning models.

   azure machine learning cheat-sheet will help to navigate through it.

conclusion

   data science is a broad field. it is an exciting field. it is an art.
   it is a science. in this article, we have just explored the surface of
   the iceberg. the    hows    will be futile if the    whys    are not known. in
   the subsequent articles, we will explore the    hows    of machine
   learning.
