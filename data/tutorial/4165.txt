predicting income with the census income dataset

overview

   the [80]census income data set contains over 48,000 samples with
   attributes including age, occupation, education, and income (a binary
   label, either >50k or <=50k). the dataset is split into roughly 32,000
   training and 16,000 testing samples.

   here, we use the [81]wide and deep model to predict the income labels.
   the wide model is able to memorize interactions with data with a large
   number of features but not able to generalize these learned
   interactions on new data. the deep model generalizes well but is unable
   to learn exceptions within the data. the wide and deep model combines
   the two models and is able to generalize while learning exceptions.

   for the purposes of this example code, the census income data set was
   chosen to allow the model to train in a reasonable amount of time.
   you'll notice that the deep model performs almost as well as the wide
   and deep model on this dataset. the wide and deep model truly shines on
   larger data sets with high-cardinality features, where each feature has
   millions/billions of unique possible values (which is the specialty of
   the wide model).

   finally, a key point. as a modeler and developer, think about how this
   dataset is used and the potential benefits and harm a model's
   predictions can cause. a model like this could reinforce societal
   biases and disparities. is a feature relevant to the problem you want
   to solve, or will it introduce bias? for more information, read about
   [82]ml fairness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   the code sample in this directory uses the high level
   tf.estimator.estimator api. this api is great for fast iteration and
   quickly adapting models to your own datasets without major code
   overhauls. it allows you to move from single-worker training to
   distributed training, and it makes it easy to export model binaries for
   prediction.

   the input function for the estimator uses
   tf.contrib.data.textlinedataset, which creates a dataset object. the
   dataset api makes it easy to apply transformations (map, batch,
   shuffle, etc.) to the data. [83]read more here.

   the estimator and dataset apis are both highly encouraged for fast
   development and efficient training.

running the code

   first make sure you've [84]added the models folder to your python path;
   otherwise you may encounter an error like importerror: no module named
   official.wide_deep.

setup

   the [85]census income data set that this sample uses for training is
   hosted by the [86]uc irvine machine learning repository. we have
   provided a script that downloads and cleans the necessary files.
python census_dataset.py

   this will download the files to /tmp/census_data. to change the
   directory, set the --data_dir flag.

training

   you can run the code locally as follows:
python census_main.py

   the model is saved to /tmp/census_model by default, which can be
   changed using the --model_dir flag.

   to run the wide or deep-only models, set the --model_type flag to wide
   or deep. other flags are configurable as well; see census_main.py for
   details.

   the final accuracy should be over 83% with any of the three model
   types.

   you can also experiment with -inter and -intra flag to explore
   inter/intra op parallelism for potential better performance as follows:
python census_main.py --inter=<int> --intra=<int>

   please note the above optional inter/intra op does not affect model
   accuracy. these are tensorflow framework configurations that only
   affect execution time. for more details regarding the above inter/intra
   flags, please refer to [87]optimizing_for_cpu or [88]tensorflow
   config.proto source code.

tensorboard

   run tensorboard to inspect the details about the graph and training
   progression.
tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/census_model

id136 with savedmodel

   you can export the model into tensorflow [89]savedmodel format by using
   the argument --export_dir:
python census_main.py --export_dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model

   after the model finishes training, use [90]saved_model_cli to inspect
   and execute the savedmodel.

   try the following commands to inspect the savedmodel:

   replace ${timestamp} with the folder produced (e.g. 1524249124)
# list possible tag_sets. only one metagraph is saved, so there will be one opti
on.
saved_model_cli show --dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model/${timestamp}/

# show signaturedefs for tag_set=serve. signaturedefs define the outputs to show
.
saved_model_cli show --dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model/${timestamp}/ \
    --tag_set serve --all

id136

   let's use the model to predict the income group of two examples:
saved_model_cli run --dir /tmp/wide_deep_saved_model/${timestamp}/ \
--tag_set serve --signature_def="predict" \
--input_examples='examples=[{"age":[46.], "education_num":[10.], "capital_gain":
[7688.], "capital_loss":[0.], "hours_per_week":[38.]}, {"age":[24.], "education_
num":[13.], "capital_gain":[0.], "capital_loss":[0.], "hours_per_week":[50.]}]'

   this will print out the predicted classes and class probabilities.
   class 0 is the <=50k group and 1 is the >50k group.

additional links

   if you are interested in distributed training, take a look at
   [91]distributed tensorflow.

   you can also [92]run this model on cloud ml engine, which provides
   [93]hyperparameter tuning to maximize your model's results and enables
   [94]deploying your model for prediction.
