   mallet is a java-based package for statistical natural language
   processing, document classification, id91, id96,
   information extraction, and other machine learning applications to
   text.
   mallet includes sophisticated tools for document classification:
   efficient routines for converting text to "features", a wide variety of
   algorithms (including na  ve bayes, maximum id178, and decision
   trees), and code for evaluating classifier performance using several
   commonly used metrics. [[20]quick start] [[21]developer's guide]
   in addition to classification, mallet includes tools for sequence
   tagging for applications such as named-entity extraction from text.
   algorithms include id48, maximum id178 markov models,
   and id49. these methods are implemented in an
   extensible system for finite state transducers. [[22]quick start]
   [[23]developer's guide]
   topic models are useful for analyzing large collections of unlabeled
   text. the mallet id96 toolkit contains efficient,
   sampling-based implementations of id44, pachinko
   allocation, and hierarchical lda. [[24]quick start]
   many of the algorithms in mallet depend on numerical optimization.
   mallet includes an efficient implementation of limited memory bfgs,
   among many other optimization methods. [[25]developer's guide]
   in addition to sophisticated machine learning applications, mallet
   includes routines for transforming text documents into numerical
   representations that can then be processed efficiently. this process is
   implemented through a flexible system of "pipes", which handle distinct
   tasks such as tokenizing strings, removing stopwords, and converting
   sequences into count vectors. [[26]quick start] [[27]developer's guide]
   an add-on package to mallet, called grmm, contains support for
   id136 in general id114, and training of crfs with
   arbitrary graphical structure. [[28]about grmm]
      
   the toolkit is open source software, and is released under the
   [29]common public license. you are welcome to use the code under the
   terms of the licence for research or commercial purposes, however
   please acknowledge its use with a citation:
