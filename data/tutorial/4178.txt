vector calculus: understanding the gradient

   [13]home   [14]math   [15]vector calculus   vector calculus: understanding
   the gradient

   the gradient is a fancy word for derivative, or the rate of change of a
   function. it   s a vector (a direction to move) that
     * points in the direction of greatest increase of a function
       ([16]intuition on why)
     * is zero at a local maximum or local minimum (because there is no
       single direction of increase)

   the term "gradient" is typically used for functions with several inputs
   and a single output (a scalar field). yes, you can say a line has a
   gradient (its slope), but using "gradient" for single-variable
   functions is unnecessarily confusing. keep it simple.

      gradient    can refer to gradual changes of color, but we   ll stick to
   the math definition if that   s ok with you. you   ll see the meanings are
   related.

properties of the gradient

   now that we know the gradient is the derivative of a multi-variable
   function, let   s derive some properties.

   the regular, plain-old derivative gives us the rate of change of a
   single variable, usually x. for example, df/dx tells us how much the
   function f changes for a change in x. but if a function takes multiple
   variables, such as x and y, it will have multiple derivatives: the
   value of the function will change when we    wiggle    x (df/dx) and when
   we wiggle y (df/dy).

   we can represent these multiple rates of change in a vector, with one
   component for each derivative. thus, a function that takes 3 variables
   will have a gradient with 3 components:
     * f(x) has one variable and a single derivative: df/dx
     * f(x,y,z) has three variables and three derivatives: (df/dx, df/dy,
       df/dz)

   the gradient of a multi-variable function has a component for each
   direction.

   and just like the regular derivative, the gradient points in the
   direction of greatest increase ([17]here's why: we trade motion in each
   direction enough to maximize the payoff).

   however, now that we have multiple directions to consider (x, y and z),
   the direction of greatest increase is no longer simply    forward    or
      backward    along the x-axis, like it is with functions of a single
   variable.

   if we have two variables, then our 2-component gradient can specify any
   direction on a plane. likewise, with 3 variables, the gradient can
   specify and direction in 3d space to move to increase our function.

a twisted example

   i   m a big fan of examples to help solidify an explanation. suppose we
   have a magical oven, with coordinates written on it and a special
   display screen:

   gradient microwave example

   we can type any 3 coordinates (like    3,5,2   ) and the display shows us
   the gradient of the temperature at that point.

   the microwave also comes with a convenient clock. unfortunately, the
   clock comes at a price     the temperature inside the microwave varies
   drastically from location to location. but this was well worth it: we
   really wanted that clock.

   with me so far? we type in any coordinate, and the microwave spits out
   the gradient at that location.

   be careful not to confuse the coordinates and the gradient. the
   coordinates are the current location, measured on the x-y-z axis. the
   gradient is a direction to move from our current location, such as move
   up, down, left or right.

   now suppose we are in need of psychiatric help and put the pillsbury
   dough boy inside the oven because we think he would taste good. he   s
   made of cookie dough, right? we place him in a random location inside
   the oven, and our goal is to cook him as fast as possible. the gradient
   can help!

   the gradient at any location points in the direction of greatest
   increase of a function. in this case, our function measures
   temperature. so, the gradient tells us which direction to move the
   doughboy to get him to a location with a higher temperature, to cook
   him even faster. remember that the gradient does not give us the
   coordinates of where to go; it gives us the direction to move to
   increase our temperature.

   thus, we would start at a random point like (3,5,2) and check the
   gradient. in this case, the gradient there is (3,4,5). now, we wouldn   t
   actually move an entire 3 units to the right, 4 units back, and 5 units
   up. the gradient is just a direction, so we   d follow this trajectory
   for a tiny bit, and then check the gradient again.

   we get to a new point, pretty close to our original, which has its own
   gradient. this new gradient is the new best direction to follow. we   d
   keep repeating this process: move a bit in the gradient direction,
   check the gradient, and move a bit in the new gradient direction. every
   time we nudged along and follow the gradient, we   d get to a warmer and
   warmer location.

   eventually, we   d get to the hottest part of the oven and that   s where
   we   d stay, about to enjoy our fresh cookies.

don   t eat that cookie!

   but before you eat those cookies, let   s make some observations about
   the gradient. that   s more fun, right?

   first, when we reach the hottest point in the oven, what is the
   gradient there?

   zero. nada. zilch. why? well, once you are at the maximum location,
   there is no direction of greatest increase. any direction you follow
   will lead to a decrease in temperature. it   s like being at the top of a
   mountain: any direction you move is downhill. a zero gradient tells you
   to stay put     you are at the max of the function, and can   t do better.

   but what if there are two nearby maximums, like two mountains next to
   each other? you could be at the top of one mountain, but have a bigger
   peak next to you. in order to get to the highest point, you have to go
   downhill first.

   ah, now we are venturing into the not-so-pretty underbelly of the
   gradient. finding the maximum in regular (single variable) functions
   means we find all the places where the derivative is zero: there is no
   direction of greatest increase. if you recall, the regular derivative
   will point to local minimums and maximums, and the absolute max/min
   must be tested from these candidate locations.

   the same principle applies to the gradient, a generalization of the
   derivative. you must find multiple locations where the gradient is zero
       you   ll have to test these points to see which one is the global
   maximum. again, the top of each hill has a zero gradient     you need to
   compare the height at each to see which one is higher. now that we have
   cleared that up, go enjoy your cookie.

mathematics

   we know the definition of the gradient: a derivative for each variable
   of a function. the gradient symbol is usually an upside-down delta, and
   called    del    (this makes a bit of sense     delta indicates change in one
   variable, and the gradient is the change in for all variables). taking
   our group of 3 derivatives above

   \displaystyle{\text{gradient of } f(x,y,z) = \nabla f(x,y,z) =
   (\frac{df}{dx},\frac{df}{dy},\frac{df}{dz})   }

   notice how the x-component of the gradient is the partial derivative
   with respect to x (similar for y and z). for a one variable function,
   there is no y-component at all, so the gradient reduces to the
   derivative.

   also, notice how the gradient is a function: it takes 3 coordinates as
   a position, and returns 3 coordinates as a direction.

   \displaystyle{f(x,y,z) = x + y^2 + z^3 }

   \displaystyle{\nabla f(x,y,z) =
   (\frac{df}{dx},\frac{df}{dy},\frac{df}{dz}) = (1, 2y, 3z^2)}

   if we want to find the direction to move to increase our function the
   fastest, we plug in our current coordinates (such as 3,4,5) into the
   gradient and get:

   \displaystyle{\text{direction} = (1, 2(4), 3(5)^2) = (1, 8, 75)}

   so, this new vector (1, 8, 75) would be the direction we   d move in to
   increase the value of our function. in this case, our x-component
   doesn   t add much to the value of the function: the partial derivative
   is always 1.

   obvious applications of the gradient are finding the max/min of
   multivariable functions. another less obvious but related application
   is finding the maximum of a constrained function: a function whose x
   and y values have to lie in a certain domain, i.e. find the maximum of
   all points constrained to lie along a circle. solving this calls for my
   boy lagrange, but all in due time, all in due time: enjoy the gradient
   for now.

   the key insight is to recognize the gradient as the generalization of
   the derivative. the gradient points to the direction of greatest
   increase; keep following the gradient, and you will reach the local
   maximum.

questions

   why is the gradient perpendicular to lines of equal potential?

   lines of equal potential (   equipotential   ) are the points with the same
   energy (or value for f(x,y,z)). in the simplest case, a circle
   represents all items the same distance from the center.

   the gradient represents the direction of greatest change. if it had any
   component along the line of equipotential, then that energy would be
   wasted (as it   s moving closer to a point at the same energy). when the
   gradient is perpendicular to the equipotential points, it is moving as
   far from them as possible ([18]this article explains why the gradient
   is the direction of greatest increase     it   s the direction that
   maximizes the varying tradeoffs inside a circle).
