comprehensive learning path     data science in python

journey from a python noob to a kaggler on python

   so, you want to [94]become a data scientist or may be you are already
   one and want to expand your tool repository. you have landed at the
   right place. the aim of this page is to provide a comprehensive
   learning path to people new to python for data science. this path
   provides a comprehensive overview of steps you need to learn to use
   [95]python for data science. if you already have some background, or
   don   t need all the components, feel free to adapt your own paths and
   let us know how you made changes in the path.

   you can also check the mini version of this learning path
      > [96]infographic: quick guide to learn data science in python.

   reading this in 2019? we have designed an [97]updated learning path for
   you! check it out on our courses portal and start your data science
   journey today.


step 0: warming up

   before starting your journey, the first question to answer is:

   why use python?

   or

   how would python be useful?

   watch the first 30 minutes of this [98]talk from jeremy, founder of
   datarobot at pycon 2014, ukraine to get an idea of how useful python
   could be.


   step 1: setting up your machine

   now that you have made up your mind, it is time to set up your
   machine. the easiest way to proceed is to just [99]download anaconda
   from continuum.io . it comes packaged with most of the things you will
   need ever. the major downside of taking this route is that you will
   need to wait for continuum to update their packages, even when there
   might be an update available to the underlying libraries. if you are a
   starter, that should hardly matter.

   if you face any challenges in installing, you can find more
   [100]detailed instructions for various os here.


step 2: learn the basics of python language

   you should start by understanding the basics of the language, libraries
   and data structure. the [101]free [102]course by analytics vidhya on
   python is one of the best places to start your journey. this course
   focuses on how to get started with python for data science and by the
   end you should be comfortable with the basic concepts of the language.

   assignment: take the [103]awesome free python course by analytics
   vidhya

   alternate resources: if interactive coding is not your style of
   learning, you can also look at the [104]google class for python. it is
   a 2 day class series and also covers some of the parts discussed later.


step 3: learn id157 in python

   you will need to use them a lot for data cleansing, especially if you
   are working on text data. the best way to[105] learn regular
   expressions is to go through the google class and keep this [106]cheat
   sheet handy.

   assignment: do the [107]baby names exercise

   if you still need more practice, follow this [108]tutorial for text
   cleaning. it will challenge you on various steps involved in data
   wrangling.

step 4: learn scientific libraries in python     numpy, scipy, matplotlib and
pandas

   this is where fun begins! here is a brief introduction to various
   libraries. let   s start practicing some common operations.
     * practice the [109]numpy tutorial thoroughly, especially numpy
       arrays. this will form a good foundation for things to come.
     * next, look at the [110]scipy tutorials. go through the introduction
       and the basics and do the remaining ones basis your needs.
     * if you guessed matplotlib tutorials next, you are wrong! they are
       too comprehensive for our need here. instead look at this
       [111]ipython notebook till line 68 (i.e. till animations)
     * finally, let us look at pandas. pandas provide dataframe
       functionality (like r) for python. this is also where you should
       spend good time practicing. pandas would become the most effective
       tool for all mid-size data analysis. start with a short
       introduction, [112]10 minutes to pandas. then move on to a more
       detailed [113]tutorial on pandas.

   you can also look at [114]exploratory data analysis with pandas and
   [115]data munging with pandas

   additional resources:
     * if you need a book on pandas and numpy,    [116]python for data
       analysis by wes mckinney   
     * there are a lot of tutorials as part of pandas documentation. you
       can have a look at them [117]here

   assignment: solve this [118]assignment from cs109 course from harvard.


step 5: effective data visualization

   go through this [119]lecture form cs109. you can ignore the initial 2
   minutes, but what follows after that is awesome! follow this lecture up
   with [120]this assignment.


step 6: learn scikit-learn and machine learning

   now, we come to the meat of this entire process. scikit-learn is the
   most useful library on python for machine learning. here is a
   [121]brief overview of the library. go through lecture 10 to lecture 18
   from [122]cs109 course from harvard. you will go through an overview of
   machine learning, supervised learning algorithms like regressions,
   id90, ensemble modeling and non-supervised learning
   algorithms like id91. follow individual lectures with the
   [123]assignments from those lectures.

   you should also check out the    [124]introduction to data science   
   course to give yourself a big boost in your quest to land a data
   scientist role.


   additional resources:
     * if there is one book, you must read, it is [125]programming
       collective intelligence     a classic, but still one of the best
       books on the subject.
     * additionally, you can also follow one of the best courses on
       [126]machine learning course from yaser abu-mostafa. if you need
       more lucid explanation for the techniques, you can opt for the
       [127]machine learning course from andrew ng and follow the
       exercises on python.
     * tutorials on scikit learn


step 7: practice, practice and practice

   congratulations, you made it!

   you now have all what you need in technical skills. it is a matter of
   practice and what better place to practice than compete with fellow
   data scientists on the [128]datahack platform. go, dive into one of the
   live competitions currently running on [129]datahack and kaggle and
   give all what you have learnt a try!


step 8: deep learning

   now that you have learnt most of machine learning techniques, it is
   time to give deep learning a shot. there is a good chance that you
   already know what is deep learning, but if you still need a brief
   intro, [130]here it is.

   i am myself new to deep learning, so please take these suggestions with
   a pinch of salt. the most comprehensive resource is
   [131]deeplearning.net. you will find everything here     lectures,
   datasets, challenges, tutorials. you can also try the [132]course from
   geoff hinton a try in a bid to understand the basics of neural
   networks.


   get started with python: [133]a complete tutorial to learn data science
   with python from scratch


   p.s. in case you need to use big data libraries, give pydoop and
   pymongo a try. they are not included here as big data learning path is
   an entire topic in itself.

       good tips. you might consider more of an emphasis on ipython

       thanks for the path. i was looking for something like this.
       what time frame do you think will be needed to complete this path
       from scratch (beginner to python)?

            hi dk,
            the learning path is meant to be done in self paced manner.
            the learning rate varies from person to person. a good coder
            learning full time can complete this learning path in a couple
            of months. on the other hand, if you are doing this part time,
            it can take up to 12 months.
            regards,
            kunal
