an end to end tutorial of a machine learning pipeline

   this tutorial tries to do what most most machine learning tutorials
   available online do not. it is not a 30 minute tutorial which teaches
   you how to "train your own neural network" or "learn deep learning in
   under 30 minutes". it's a full pipeline which you would need to do if
   you actually work with machine learning - introducing you to all the
   parts, and all the implementation decisions and details that need to be
   made. the dataset is not one of the standard sets like mnist or cifar,
   you will make you very own dataset. then you will go through a couple
   conventional machine learning algorithms, before finally getting to
   deep learning!

   in the fall of 2016, i was a teaching fellow (harvard's version of ta)
   for the graduate class on "advanced topics in data science (cs209/109)"
   at harvard university. i was in-charge of designing the class project
   given to the students, and this tutorial has been built on top of the
   project i designed for the class.

update 24th october 2018

   the tutorial has now been re-written in pytorch thanks to anshul basia
   ([95]https://github.com/anshulbasia)

   you can access the html here:
   [96]https://spandan-madan.github.io/deeplearningproject/pytorch_version
   /deep_learning_project-pytorch.html and the ipython notebook with the
   code in pytorch
   here:[97]https://github.com/spandan-madan/deeplearningproject/blob/mast
   er/pytorch_version/deep_learning_project-pytorch.ipynb

citing if you use the work here

   if you would like to use this work, please cite the work using the doi
   - [98]doi

reading/viewing the tutorial

   to view the project as an html file, visit -
   [99]https://spandan-madan.github.io/deeplearningproject/

the code

   if you would like to access to code, please go through the ipython
   notebook deep_learning_project.ipynb

setup

   python
     * we will be using python 2.7. primary reason is that tensorflow is
       not compatible with python > 3.5, and some other libraries are not
       compatible with python 3.

   to make setup easy, we are going to use conda.
     * please install conda 3 from [100]https://www.continuum.io/downloads
     * the repository has a conda config file which will make setting up
       super easy. it's the file deeplearningproject_environment.yml
     * then create a new conda environment using the command with conda
       env create -f deeplearningproject_environment.yml
     * now, you can activate the environment with: source activate
       deeplearningproject
     * jupyter notebook if all the isntallations go through, you are good
       to go! if not, here is a list of packages that need to be
       installed: requests imdbpy wget tmdbsimple seaborn sklearn pillow
       keras tensorflow h5py gensim nltk stop_words

   please install imdbpy using 'pip install imdbpy==6.6' since earlier
   versions are broken

setting up conda environment in jupyter notebook

   to be able to run the environment you just created on a juputer
   notebook, first check that you have the python package ipykernel
   installed. if you don't simply install it using
pip install ipykernel

   now, add this to your jupyter notebook using the command:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name deeplearningproject --display-name "de
eplearningproject"

   needless to say, remove all single quotes before running commands.

   go to the directory and run jupyter notbeook by "jupyter notebook" and
   open the respective notebook on browser. to install tmdb: pip install
   tmdbsimple use "import tmdbsimple as tmdb"

setting up a docker container with docker-compose

prerequisites

     * docker [101]https://docs.docker.com/install/
     * docker compose [102]https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

run docker-compose

   to work with an isolate environment and be able to run it on many
   systems without troubles, you can run this docker-compose command:
docker-compose up

   it will build deeplearningproject image according to dockerfile. and
   then run dokcer container via docker-compose. see docker and
   docker-compose docs for more informations :
     * [103]https://docs.docker.com/
     * [104]https://docs.docker.com/compose/

   then access notebooks through your web browser at
   [105]http://localhost:8888

   you should notice that notebooks have been copied from root to
   notebooks folder to mount them into container via bind volume. any
   changes you make, will be saved on host (notebooks dir).

add packages

   you can add conda or pip packages to image (and thus, container) by
   updating deeplearningproject_environment.yml file and then run
docker-compose build

   it will build a new deeplearningproject image with new conda/pip
   packages installed. stop your running container (ctrl-c) and then
   docker-compose up to rerun a fresh new container.

known common bugs

   i will keep updating this as issues pop up on this repository.
     * one known bug is because keras 2.0 is not compatible with some
       keras 1.2 functionalities. you may run into errors with importing
       vgg16. if so, just update keras using the following command:

sudo pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade

   -os error: too many open files refer to:
   [106]https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16526783/python-subprocess-too
   -many-open-files or, shut down notebook and execute following the the
   same terminal ``bash ulimit -sn 10000
and restart the jupyter notebook.

hope this repo helps introduce you to a full machine learning pipeline! if you s
pot an error, please create an issue to help out others using this resource!

to prevent problems with installation and setting up, this repository comes with
 a conda environment profile. the only thing you will need is to install the new
est version of conda, and use this profile to create a new environment and it wi
ll come set up with all the libraries you will need for the tutorial.
