dbpedia version 2016-04

   dataset category:
   [17]dbpedia release
   publication year:
   2016

   this release is based on updated wikipedia dumps dating from
   march/april 2016 featuring a significantly expanded base of information
   as well as richer and (hopefully) cleaner data based on the dbpedia
   ontology.


   you can download the new dbpedia datasets in a variety of rdf-document
   formats from: [18]http://wiki.dbpedia.org/downloads-2016-04 or directly
   here: [19]http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2016-04/

support dbpedia

   during the latest dbpedia meeting in leipzig we [20]discussed about
   ways to support dbpedia and what [21]benefits this support would bring.
   on top of that we need to buy a new server to host dbpedia spotlight
   that was so generously hosted so far by third parties.

   if you use dbpedia and want us to keep going forward, we kindly invite
   you to [22]donate here or become a [23]member of the dbpedia
   association.

statistics

   the english version of the dbpedia knowledge base currently describes
   6.0m entities of which 4.6m have abstracts, 1.53m have geo coordinates
   and 1.6m depictions. in total, 5.2m resources are classified in a
   consistent ontology, consisting of 1.5m persons, 810k places (including
   505k populated places), 490k works (including 135k music albums, 106k
   films and 20k video games), 275k organizations (including 67k companies
   and 53k educational institutions), 301k species and 5k diseases. the
   total number of resources in english dbpedia is 16.9m that, besides the
   6.0m resources, includes 1.7m skos concepts (categories), 7.3m redirect
   pages, 260k disambiguation pages and 1.7m intermediate nodes.


   altogether the dbpedia 2016-04 release consists of 9.5 billion
   (2015-10: 8.8 billion) pieces of information (rdf triples) out of which
   1.3 billion (2015-10: 1.1 billion) were extracted from the english
   edition of wikipedia, 5.0 billion (2015-04: 4.4 billion) were extracted
   from other language editions and 3.2 billion (2015-10: 3.2 billion)
   from dbpedia commons and wikidata. in general, we observed a growth in
   mapping-based statements of about 2%.


   thorough statistics can be found on the[24] dbpedia website and general
   information on the dbpedia datasets[25] here.

community

   the dbpedia community added new classes and properties to the dbpedia
   ontology via the mappings wiki. the dbpedia 2016-04 ontology
   encompasses:
     * 754 classes (dbpedia 2015-10: 739)
     * 1,103 object properties (dbpedia 2015-10: 1,099)
     * 1,608 datatype properties (dbpedia 2015-10: 1,596)
     * 132 specialized datatype properties (dbpedia 2015-10: 132)
     * 410 owl:equivalentclass and 221 owl:equivalentproperty mappings
       external vocabularies (dbpedia 2015-04: 407 - 221)


   the editor community of the mappings wiki also defined many new
   mappings from wikipedia templates to dbpedia classes. for the dbpedia
   2016-04 extraction, we used a total of 5800 template mappings (dbpedia
   2015-10: 5553 mappings). for the second time the top language, gauged
   by the number of mappings, is dutch (646 mappings), followed by the
   english community (604 mappings).

(breaking) changes

     * in addition to normalized datasets to english dbpedia (en-uris) we
       additionally provide normalized datasets based on the dbpedia
       wikidata (dbw) datasets (wkd-uris). these sorted datasets will be
       the foundation for the upcoming fusion process with wikidata. the
       dbw-based uris will be the only ones provided from the following
       releases on.
     * we now filter out triples from the raw infobox extractor that are
       already mapped. e.g. no more    <x> dbo:birthplace <z>    and    <x>
       dbp:birthplace|dbp:placeofbirth|... <z>    in the same resource.
       these triples are now moved to the    infobox-properties-mapped   
       datasets and not loaded on the main endpoint. see [26]issue 22 for
       more details.
     * major improvements in our citation extraction. see [27]here for
       more details.
     * we incorporated the statistical [28]distribution approach of heiko
       paulheim in creating type statements automatically and providing
       them as an additional datasets (instance_types_sdtyped_dbo).


   in case you missed it, what we changed in the previous release
   (2015-10)
     * english dbpedia switched to iris. this can be a breaking change to
       some applications that need to change their stored dbpedia resource
       uris / links. we provide the    uri-same-as-iri    dataset for english
       to ease the transition.
     * the instance-types dataset is now split into two files:
       instance-types (containing only direct types) and
       instance-types-transitive containing the transitive types of a
       resource based on the dbpedia ontology
     * the mappingbased-properties file is now split into three (3) files:
          +    geo-coordinates-mappingbased    that contains the coordinated
            originating from the mappings wiki. the    geo-coordinates   
            continues to provide the coordinates originating from the
            geoextractor
          +    mappingbased-literals    that contains mapping based fact with
            literal values
          +    mappingbased-objects    that contains mapping based fact with
            object values
          + the    mappingbased-objects-disjoint-[domain|range]    are facts
            that are filtered out from the    mappingbased-objects    datasets
            as errors but are still provided
     * we added a new extractor for citation data that provides two files:
          + citation links: linking resources to citations
          + citation data: trying to get additional data from citations.
            this is a quite interesting dataset but we need help to clean
            it up
     * all datasets are available in .ttl and .tql serialization (nt, nq
       dataset were neglected for reasons of redundancy and server
       capacity).


upcoming changes

     * dataset id172: we are going to normalize datasets based on
       wikidata uris and no longer on the english language edition, as a
       prerequisite to finally start the fusion process with wikidata.
     * rml integration: wouter maroy did already provide the necessary
       groundwork for switching the mappings wiki to a[29] rml based
       approach on github. we are not there yet but this is at the top of
       our list of changes.
     * starting with the next release we are adding datasets with [30]nif
       annotations of the abstracts (as we already provided those for the
       [31]2015-04 release). we will eventually extend the nif annotation
       dataset to cover the whole wikipedia article of a resource.

new datasets

     * maltese (mt) is the newest addition of wikipedia language wikis
       extracted by dbpedia.
     * sdtypes: we extended the coverage of the automatically created type
       statements (instance_types_sdtyped_dbo) to english, german and
       dutch (see above).
     * extensions: in the extension folder ([32]2016-04/ext) we provide
       two new datasets (both are to be considered in an experimental
       state:
          + dbpedia world facts: this dataset is authored by the dbpedia
            association itself. it lists all countries, all currencies in
            use and (most) languages spoken in the world as well as how
            these concepts relate to each other (spoken in, primary
            language etc.) and useful properties like iso codes
            ([33]ontology diagram). this dataset extends the very useful
            [34]lexvo dataset with facts from dbpedia and the [35]cia
            factbook. please report any error or suggestions in regard to
            this dataset to [36]markus.
          + lector facts: this experimental dataset was provided by matteo
            cannaviccio and demonstrates [37]his approach to generating
            facts by using common sequences of words (i.e. phrases) that
            are frequently used to describe instances of binary relations
            in a text. we are looking into using this approach as a
            regular extraction step. it would be helpful to get some
            feedback from you.
