readme

mc-afp is a machine comprehension dataset that is generated based on the public
available gigaword dataset (afp portion). the technique to create such a dataset
is reported in the paper:

"building large machine reading-comprehension datasets using paragraph vectors",
radu soricut, nan ding.

we generate a datasets of around 2 million examples,
on which we estimate that the human-level accuracy is in the 90% range
(in a 5-way multi-choice setup; for comparison, a random-guess approach has 20%
accuracy).
a novel neural-network architecture that combines the representation power
of id56s with the discriminative power of fully-connected
multi-layered networks achieves the best results we could obtain on our dataset:
83.2% accuracy.

what is enclosed in this package is an encrypted mc-afp dataset and the code
which decodes the encrypted dataset.

datasets needed:
d1. english gigaword fifth edition (ldc2011t07) from the linguistic
    data consortium (ldc).
    [we cannot provide you with this dataset, please contact ldc
    at [73]https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/].
d2. the mc-afp dataset that comes with this package, see data/

decoding procedure:
1. specify the path to "(dataset d1)" in ${ldcdir} of generate_text.sh
2. specify the output directory in ${outdir} of generate_text.sh
3. sh generate_text.sh
4. when finished, the final dataset should be in ${outdir}
