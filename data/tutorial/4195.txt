   lab's [3]dataset webpage

description

   this dataset contains product reviews and metadata from amazon,
   including 142.8 million reviews spanning may 1996 - july 2014.

   product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and
   image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).

"small" subsets for experimentation

   if you're using this data for a class project (or similar) please
   consider using one of these smaller datasets below before requesting
   the larger files. to obtain the larger files you will need to
   [4]contact me to obtain access.

   k-cores (i.e., dense subsets): these data have been reduced to extract
   the [5]k-core, such that each of the remaining users and items have k
   reviews each.

   ratings only: these datasets include no metadata or reviews, but only
   (user,item,rating,timestamp) tuples. thus they are suitable for use
   with [6]mymedialite (or similar) packages.

complete review data

   please see the per-category files below, and only download these
   (large!) files if you really need them:

   [55]raw review data (20gb) - all 142.8 million reviews

   the above file contains some duplicate reviews, mainly due to
   near-identical products whose reviews amazon merges, e.g. vhs and dvd
   versions of the same movie. these duplicates have been removed in the
   files below:

   [56]user review data (18gb) - duplicate items removed (83.68 million
   reviews), sorted by user

   [57]product review data (18gb) - duplicate items removed, sorted by
   product

   [58]ratings only (3.2gb) - same as above, in csv form without reviews
   or metadata

   [59]5-core (9.9gb) - subset of the data in which all users and items
   have at least 5 reviews (41.13 million reviews)

   finally, the following file removes duplicates more aggressively,
   removing duplicates even if they are written by different users. this
   accounts for users with multiple accounts or plagiarized reviews. such
   duplicates account for less than 1 percent of reviews, though this
   dataset is probably preferable for id31 type tasks:

   [60]aggressively deduplicated data (18gb) - no duplicates whatsoever
   (82.83 million reviews)

   format is one-review-per-line in (loose) json. see examples below for
   further help reading the data.

visual features

   we extracted visual features from each product image using a deep id98
   (see citation below). image features are stored in a binary format,
   which consists of 10 characters (the product id), followed by 4096
   floats (repeated for every product). see files below for further help
   reading the data.

   [65]visual features (141gb) - visual features for all products

   the images themselves can be extracted from the imurl field in the
   metadata files.

code

reading the data

   data can be treated as python dictionary objects. a simple script to
   read any of the above the data is as follows:

   def parse(path): g = gzip.open(path, 'r') for l in g: yield eval(l)

convert to 'strict' json

   the above data can be read with python 'eval', but is not strict json.
   if you'd like to use some language other than python, you can convert
   the data to strict json as follows:

   import json import gzip def parse(path): g = gzip.open(path, 'r') for l
   in g: yield json.dumps(eval(l)) f = open("output.strict", 'w') for l in
   parse("reviews_video_games.json.gz"): f.write(l + '\n')

pandas data frame

   this code reads the data into a pandas data frame:

   import pandas as pd import gzip def parse(path): g = gzip.open(path,
   'rb') for l in g: yield eval(l) def getdf(path): i = 0 df = {} for d in
   parse(path): df[i] = d i += 1 return pd.dataframe.from_dict(df,
   orient='index') df = getdf('reviews_video_games.json.gz')

read image features

   import array def readimagefeatures(path): f = open(path, 'rb') while
   true: asin = f.read(10) if asin == '': break a = array.array('f')
   a.fromfile(f, 4096) yield asin, a.tolist()

example: compute average rating

   ratings = [] for review in parse("reviews_video_games.json.gz"):
   ratings.append(review['overall']) print sum(ratings) / len(ratings)

example: latent-factor model in [140]mymedialite

   predicts ratings from a rating-only csv file

   ./rating_prediction --recommender=biasedmatrixfactorization
   --training-file=ratings_video_games.csv --test-ratio=0.1
