terms of use

  copyright of the hansards

   the copyright on the hansards is held by the canadian parliament. the
   [5]faq on the web site of the canadian parliament states:

     the publishing of the official publications of the house of commons
     is governed by the law of parliamentary privilege, by which the
     house of commons has the right to control the publication of its
     proceedings. it may be used without seeking the permission of the
     speaker of the house of commons provided that it is accurately
     reproduced and that it does not offend the dignity of the house of
     commons or one of its members. reproduction of the material is
     permitted in whole or in part, and by any means.

how the alignment was performed

    1. raw text extraction: the raw text was extracted from html files (as
       available via [6]http://www.parl.gc.ca) with a perl script that
       makes use of the [7]html::parser module by gisle aas / michael a.
       chase.
    2. sentence splitting: the raw text was split into sentences with
       adwait ratnaparkhi's [8]mxterminator. for details on mxterminator,
       see [9]http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~adwait/statnlp.html.
    3. text alignment: the sentences were aligned with i. dan melamed's
       [10]gsa tool. see
       [11]http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~melamed/.gsa/readme.htm for details
       on gsa.
    4. one-to-one correspondences were then extracted from the aligned
       data.

coverage

   the complete hansards of the debates in the house and senate of the
   36^th canadian parliament, as far as available, were aligned. the
   corpus was then split into 5 sets of sentence pairs: training (80% of
   the sentence pairs), two sets of sentence pairs for testing (5% each),
   and two sets of sentence pairs for final evaluation (5% each). the
   current release consists of the training and testing sets. the
   evaluation sets are reserved for future mt evaluation purposes and
   currently not available. table 1 shows the size of the various
   subcorpora:

file format

   the release consists of sets of corresponding files (*.e and *.f) that
   contain one sentence per line, so that sentence no. n in the file xyz.e
   corresponds to sentence no. n in the file xyz.f. in order to save
   space, individual files are gzipped individually. for each day of
   parliamentary sessions, there is usually one file per language.
   occasionally, there are several.

caveats

    1. this release contains only sentence pairs. even though the order of
       the sentences is the same as in the original, there may be gaps
       resulting from many-to-one, many-to-many, or one-to-many alignments
       that were filtered out. therefore, this release may not be suitable
       for discourse-related research. table 2 shows the total number of
       sentences on the english and french sides and the number of
       sentence pairs extracted.
    2. neither the sentence splitting nor the alignments are perfect. in
       particular, watch out for pairs that differ considerably in length.
       you may want to filter these out before you do any statistical
       training.

credits

   we are very grateful to the canadian people in general and to the
   canadian parliament in particular for making the hansards available to
   the general public free of charge and without any restrictions that
   would hamper research. their generosity is gratefully acknowledged.

   we would also like to thank the authors of the aforementioned software
   tools for making them available to the research community. without them
   the alignment of the hansards would have been much more difficult, if
   not impossible. their generosity, too, is gratefully acknowledged.

   the alignment of the hansards was performed as part of the [12]rewrite
   project under funding from the [13]darpa tides program.
