200,000+ jeopardy! questions in a json file

   [rendertimingpixel.png]
   [7]dataset

   [8]here's a json file containing 216,930 jeopardy questions, answers
   and other data. see the bottom of the post for a csv verson. the format
   of the json object is described below. questions were obtained by
   crawling [9]www.j-archive.com [oc]

   according to j-archive, the total number of jeopardy! questions over
   the show's span (as of this post) is 252,583 - so this is approximately
   83% of them. in particular, around the last two years of game play are
   missing.

   the json file is an unordered list of questions where each question has
     * 'category' : the question category, e.g. "history"
     * 'value' : $ value of the question as string, e.g. "$200"
       note: this is "none" for final jeopardy! and tiebreaker questions
     * 'question' : text of question
       note: this sometimes contains hyperlinks and other things messy
       text such as when there's a picture or video question
     * 'answer' : text of answer
     * 'round' : one of "jeopardy!","double jeopardy!","final jeopardy!"
       or "tiebreaker"
       note: tiebreaker questions do happen but they're very rare (like
       once every 20 years)
     * 'show_number' : string of show number, e.g '4680'
     * 'air_date' : the show air date in format yyyy-mm-dd

   i'd love to hear of anything that gets done with this! let me know! :d

   i was thinking it would be cool to have a site where you could
   sort/search all of the questions in a bunch of different ways, such as
   only $1000+ questions or only category "world capitals". also, somehow
   using this for a reddit bot could be interesting with the right idea.

   pm me if link dies

   edit: updated the link to mega.co.nz which is much better

   edit 2: now available in csv format! [10]link

   edit 3: alternate download links (google drive): [11]json, [12]csv

   i am leary of sites that make me download an exe to download files. i
   will love to get my hands on the json file but from the current url, i
   rather not.

   it would be great if you could post the file in a different location
   where we don't have to register or worse still install some other
   software.

   i downloaded the file. i didn't have to install an exe to download it.
   if you click on download: jeopardy questions1.json on the page, it
   should be fine.

   wow, that was confusing as shit. yeah, for anyone else:
     * click on the text directly above the star rating at the top of the
       page. it is the download link
     * do not download the exe at the bottom of the page. it claims to be
       a "download manager," but really we don't know what that is and
       we're all suspicious of it.

   yeah i'm on my phone and was wondering why the extension was .bin,
   didn't know you had to click what appears to be the title =/

   on a related note, are there any download sites that aren't an absolute
   pain to download stuff from?

   the guy who won the jeopardy tournament of champions did something
   similar. he scraped all the questions off jarchive then made a personal
   website that he would use to test himself. he gave a talk about it,
   i'll link to it if i find it.

   here it is:

   why are some of the values crazy numbers? are those from daily doubles?

   yes, the person can bet up to all of their money if they want. the
   highest value for any question was $18,000 from show #6246, which the
   guy got correct! i should've made some distinction between normal
   questions and daily doubles but i didn't think of it at the time.

   no worries, i am playing around with the data and it is simple enough
   to tag all questions whose value is not 100, 200, 300... 1000 that they
   are daily doubles. this leaves out any daily double whose contestant
   uses an even number, but it should get it pretty close.

   i set up a web service to serve up all the data from jarchive here:
   [56]jservice.io - it only has a few endpoints now, but i'd love to see
   people using it.
