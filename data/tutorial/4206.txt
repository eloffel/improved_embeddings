       [disease]
     * is contraindicated in     [drug] should not be taken if you have
       [disease or symptom]

     * personal experiences     i started [drug] for [disease]
     * personal experiences negated     [drug] did not cause [symptom]
     * impersonal experiences     i   ve heard [drug] causes [symptom]
