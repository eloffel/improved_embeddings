practical deep learning for coders (fast.ai courses)

   these are the lecture materials from [80]practical deep learning for
   coders. two important parts of the course are [81]our online forums and
   [82]our wiki. if you are encountering an error, we recommend that you
   first search the forums and wiki for a solution. if you can't find the
   answer there, the next step is to ask your question on the forums. see
   this advice on [83]how to ask for help in a way that will allow others
   to most quickly and effectively be able to help you. please don't use
   github issues to ask for help debugging (many questions have already
   been answered in the forums).
