introduction

   the facets project contains two visualizations for understanding and
   analyzing machine learning datasets: facets overview and facets dive.

   the visualizations are implemented as [96]polymer web components,
   backed by [97]typescript code and can be easily embedded into jupyter
   notebooks or webpages.

   live demos of the visualizations can be found on the [98]facets project
   description page.

facets overview

   [99]overview visualization of uci census data

   overview gives a high-level view of one or more data sets. it produces
   a visual feature-by-feature statistical analysis, and can also be used
   to compare statistics across two or more data sets. the tool can
   process both numeric and string features, including multiple instances
   of a number or string per feature.

   overview can help uncover issues with datasets, including the
   following:
     * unexpected feature values
     * missing feature values for a large number of examples
     * training/serving skew
     * training/test/validation set skew

   key aspects of the visualization are outlier detection and distribution
   comparison across multiple datasets. interesting values (such as a high
   proportion of missing data, or very different distributions of a
   feature across multiple datasets) are highlighted in red. features can
   be sorted by values of interest such as the number of missing values or
   the skew between the different datasets.

   details about overview usage can be found in its [100]readme.

facets dive

   [101]dive visualization of uci census data

   dive is a tool for interactively exploring up to tens of thousands of
   multidimensional data points, allowing users to seaid113ssly switch
   between a high-level overview and low-level details. each example is a
   represented as single item in the visualization and the points can be
   positioned by faceting/bucketing in multiple dimensions by their
   feature values. combining smooth animation and zooming with faceting
   and filtering, dive makes it easy to spot patterns and outliers in
   complex data sets.

   details about dive usage can be found in its [102]readme.

setup

usage in google colabratory/jupyter notebooks

   using facets in [103]google colabratory and [104]jupyter notebooks can
   be seen [105]in this notebook. these notebooks work without the need to
   first download/install this repository.

   note that for using facets overview in a jupyter notebook, there are
   two considerations:
    1. in the notebook, you will need to change the path that the facets
       overview python code is loaded from to the correct path given where
       your notebook kernel is run from.
    2. you must also have the protocol buffers python runtime library
       installed:
       [106]https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/python. if you
       used pip or anaconda to install jupyter, you can use the same tool
       to install the runtime library.

   when visualizing a large amount of data in dive in a juypter notebook,
   as is done in the [107]dive demo jupyter notebook, you will need to
   start the notebook server with an increased iopub data rate. this can
   be done with the command jupyter notebook
   --notebookapp.iopub_data_rate_limit=10000000.

code installation

git clone https://github.com/pair-code/facets
cd facets

building the visualizations

   if you make code changes to the visualization and would like to rebuild
   them, follow these directions:
    1. install bazel: [108]https://bazel.build/
    2. build the visualizations: bazel build facets:facets_jupyter (run
       from the facets top-level directory)

using the rebuilt visualizations in a jupyter notebook

   if you want to use the visualizations you built locally in a jupyter
   notebook, follow these directions:
    1. move the resulting vulcanized html file from the build step into
       the facets-dist directory.
    2. install the visualizations into jupyter as an nbextension.

     * if jupyter was installed with pip, you can use jupyter nbextension
       install facets-dist/ if jupyter was installed system-wide or
       jupyter nbextension install facets-dist/ --user if installed
       per-user (run from the facets top-level directory). you do not need
       to run any follow-up jupyter nbextension enable command for this
       extension.
     * alternatively, you can manually install the nbextension by finding
       your jupyter installation's share/jupyter/nbextensions folder and
       copying the facets-dist directory into it.

    3. in the notebook cell's html link tag that loads the built facets
       html, load from /nbextensions/facets-dist/facets-jupyter.html,
       which is the locally installed facets distribution. from the
       previous step.
