   [20]    mcmc: hamiltonian monte carlo (a.k.a. hybrid monte carlo)
   [21]fmri in neuroscience: the basics    

a gentle introduction to id115 (mcmc)

   [22]nov 19

   posted by [23]dustinstansbury

   applying probabilistic models to data usually involves integrating a
   complex, multi-dimensional id203 distribution. for example,
   calculating the expectation/mean of a model distribution involves such
   an integration. many (most) times, these integrals are not calculable
   due to the high dimensionality of the distribution or because there is
   no closed-form expression for the integral available using calculus.
   id115 (mcmc) is a method that allows one to
   approximate complex integrals using stochastic sampling routines. as
   mcmc   s name indicates, the method is composed of two components, the
   markov chain and monte carlo integration.

   monte carlo integration is a powerful technique that exploits
   stochastic sampling of the distribution in question in order to
   approximate the difficult integration. however, in order to use monte
   carlo integration it is necessary to be able to sample from the
   id203 distribution in question, which may be difficult or
   impossible to do directly. this is where the second component of mcmc,
   the markov chain, comes in. a markov chain is a sequential model that
   transitions from one state to another in a probabilistic fashion, where
   the next state that the chain takes is conditioned on the previous
   state. markov chains are useful in that if they are constructed
   properly, and allowed to run for a long time, the states that a chain
   will take also sample from a target id203 distribution. therefore
   we can construct markov chains to sample from the distribution whose
   integral we would like to approximate, then use monte carlo integration
   to perform the approximation.

   here i introduce a series of posts where i describe the basic concepts
   underlying mcmc, starting off by describing [24]monte carlo
   integration, then giving a [25]brief introduction of markov chains and
   how they can be constructed to sample from a target id203
   distribution. given these foundation principles, we can then discuss
   mcmc techniques such as the [26]metropolis and [27]metropolis-hastings
   algorithms, the [28]gibbs sampler, and the [29]hybrid monte
   carlo algorithm.

   as always, each post has a somewhat formal/mathematical introduction,
   along with an example and simple matlab implementations of the
   associated algorithms.
