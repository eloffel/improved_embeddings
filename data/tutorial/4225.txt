inverse transform sampling

   [22]sep 9

   posted by [23]dustinstansbury

   there are a number of sampling methods used in machine learning, each
   of which has various strengths and/or weaknesses depending on the
   nature of the sampling task at hand. one simple method for generating
   samples from distributions with closed-form descriptions is inverse
   transform (it) sampling.

   the idea behind it sampling is that the id203 mass for a random
   variable x distributed according to the id203 density function
   f(x)  integrates to one and therefore the cumulative distribution
   function c(x) can be used to map from values in the interval (0,1)
   (i.e. probabilities) to the domain of f(x) . because it is easy to
   sample values z uniformly from the interval (0,1) , we can use the
   inverse of the cdf c(x)^{-1} to transform these sampled probabilities
   into samples x . the code below demonstrates this process at work in
   order to sample from a student   s t distribution with 10 degrees of
   freedom.
rand('seed',12345)

% degrees of freedom
df = 10;
x = -3:.1:3;
cx = cdf('t',x,df)
z = rand;

% compare values of
zidx = min(find(cx>z));

% draw sample
sample = x(zidx);

% display
figure; hold on
plot(x,cx,'k','linewidth',2);
plot([x(1),x(zidx)],[cx(zidx),cx(zidx)],'r','linewidth',2);
plot([x(zidx),x(zidx)],[cx(zidx),0],'b','linewidth',2);
plot(x(zidx),z,'ko','linewidth',2);
text(x(1)+.1,z + .05,'z','color','r')
text(x(zidx)+.05,.05,'x_{sampled}','color','b')
ylabel('c(x)')
xlabel('x')
hold off

   it sampling from student   s-t(10)

   however, the scheme used to create to plot above is inefficient in that
   one must compare current values of z with the c(x) for all values of x
   . a much more efficient method is to evaluate c^{-1} directly:
    1. derive c^{-1}(x) (or a good approximation) from f(x)
    2. for i = 1:n

     *     draw z_i from unif(0,1)
     *     x_i = cdf^{-1}(z_i)
     *     end for

   the it sampling process is demonstrated in the next chunk of code to
   sample from the beta distribution, a distribution for which c^{-1}  is
   easy to approximate using netwon   s method (which we let matlab do for
   us within the function icdf.m)
rand('seed',12345)
nsamples = 1000;

% beta parameters
alpha = 2; beta = 10;

% draw proposal samples
z = rand(1,nsamples);

% evaluate proposal samples at inverse cdf
samples = icdf('beta',z,alpha,beta);
bins = linspace(0,1,50);
counts = histc(samples,bins);
probsampled = counts/sum(counts)
probtheory = betapdf(bins,alpha,beta);

% display
b = bar(bins,probsampled,'facecolor',[.9 .9 .9]);
hold on;
t = plot(bins,probtheory/sum(probtheory),'r','linewidth',2);
xlim([0 1])
xlabel('x')
ylabel('p(x)')
legend([t,b],{'theory','it samples'})
hold off

   inverse transform sampling of beta(2,10)

wrapping up

   the it sampling method is generally only used for univariate
   distributions where c^{-1} can be computed in closed form, or
   approximated. however, it is a nice example of how uniform random
   variables can be used to sample from much more complicated
   distributions.
