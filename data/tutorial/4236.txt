a sound vocabulary and dataset

   audioset consists of an expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes
   and a collection of 2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn
   from youtube videos. the ontology is specified as a hierarchical graph
   of event categories, covering a wide range of human and animal sounds,
   musical instruments and genres, and common everyday environmental
   sounds.

   by releasing audioset, we hope to provide a common, realistic-scale
   evaluation task for audio id37, as well as a starting point
   for a comprehensive vocabulary of sound events.

large-scale data collection

   to collect all our data we worked with human annotators who verified
   the presence of sounds they heard within youtube segments. to nominate
   segments for annotation, we relied on youtube metadata and
   content-based search.

   our resulting dataset has excellent coverage over the audio event
   classes in our ontology.

   the ontology and dataset construction are described in more detail in
   our [9]icassp 2017 paper. you can contribute to the ontology at our
   [10]github repository. the dataset and machine-extracted features are
   available at the [11]download page.
