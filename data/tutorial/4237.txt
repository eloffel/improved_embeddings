youtube-boundingboxes dataset

   youtube-boundingboxes is a large-scale data set of video urls with
   densely-sampled high-quality single-object bounding box annotations.

   the data set consists of approximately 380,000 15-20s video segments
   extracted from 240,000 different publicly visible youtube videos,
   automatically selected to feature objects in natural settings without
   editing or post-processing, with a recording quality often akin to that
   of a hand-held cell phone camera.

   all these video segments were human-annotated with high precision
   classifications and bounding boxes at 1 frame per second.

   our goal with the public release of this dataset is to help advance the
   state of the art of machine learning for video understanding.
   10.5 million
   human annotations
   the data set consists of 10.5 million human annotations on video
   frames.
   5.6 million
   bounding boxes
   the data set contains 5.6 million tight bounding boxes around tracked
   objects in video frames.
   240,000
   videos
   the data set consists of 380,000 15-20s video segments extracted from
   240,000 different publicly visible youtube videos, automatically
   selected to feature objects in natural settings without editing or
   post-processing, with a recording quality often akin to that of a
   hand-held cell phone camera.
   95%
   label accuracy
   the use of a cascade of increasingly precise human annotators ensures a
   measured label accuracy above 95% for every class and tight bounding
   boxes around the tracked objects.
   23
   types of objects
   the objects tracked in the video segments belong to 23 different
   classes.
