  [112]ape is not a monkey neural monkey

   neural sequence learning using tensorflow

   [113]build status [114]documentation status

   the neural monkey package provides a higher level abstraction for
   sequential neural network models, most prominently in natural language
   processing (nlp). it is built on [115]tensorflow. it can be used for
   fast prototyping of sequential models in nlp which can be used e.g. for
   id4 or sentence classification.

   the higher-level api brings together a collection of standard building
   blocks (id56 encoder and decoder, multi-layer id88) and a simple
   way of adding new building blocks implemented directly in tensorflow.

usage

neuralmonkey-train <experiment_ini>
neuralmonkey-run <experiment_ini> <datasets_ini>
neuralmonkey-server <experiment_ini> [option] ...
neuralmonkey-logbook --logdir <experiments_dir> [option] ...

installation

     * you need python 3.5.2 (or higher) to run neural monkey.
     * when using virtual environment, execute these commands to install
       the python dependencies:
$ source path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate

# for gpu-enabled version
(virtualenv)$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements-gpu.txt

# for cpu-only version
(virtualenv)$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
     * if you are using the gpu version, make sure that the
       ld_library_path environment variable points to lib and lib64
       directories of your cuda and cudnn installations. similarly, your
       path variable should point to the bin subdirectory of the cuda
       installation directory.
     * if the training crashes on an unknown dependency, just install it
       with pip. remember to keep your virtual environment up-to-date with
       the package requirements file, which may be changed over time. to
       update the dependencies, re-run the pip install command from above
       (pay attention to the distinction between gpu and non-gpu
       versions).

getting started

   there is a [116]tutorial that you can follow, which gives you the
   overwiev of how to design your experiments with neural monkey.

package overview

     * bin: directory with neuralmonkey executables
     * examples: example configuration files for ready-made experiments
     * lib: third party software
     * neuralmonkey: python package files
     * scripts: directory with tools that may come in handy. note
       dependencies for these tools may not be listed in the project
       requirements.
     * tests: test files

documentation

   you can find the api documentation of this package [117]here. the
   documentation files are generated from docstrings using [118]autodoc
   and [119]napoleon extensions to the python documentation package
   [120]sphinx. the docstrings should follow the recommendations in the
   [121]google python style guide. additional details on the docstring
   formatting can be found in the napoleon documentation as well.
