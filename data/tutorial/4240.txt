memory-augmented neural networks

   this project contains implementations of memory augmented neural
   networks. this includes code in the following subdirectories:
     * [90]memn2n-lang-model: this code trains memn2n model for language
       modeling, see section 5 of the paper "[91]end-to-end memory
       networks". this code is implemented in [92]torch7 (written in lua);
       more documentation is given in the readme in that subdirectory.
     * [93]memn2n-babi-matlab: the code for the memn2n babi task
       experiments of section 4 of the paper "[94]end-to-end memory
       networks". this code is implemented in matlab; more documentation
       is given in the readme in that subdirectory.
     * [95]dbll: code to train memn2n on tasks from the paper
       "[96]dialog-based language learning". this code is implemented in
       [97]torch7; more documentation is given in the readme in that
       subdirectory.
     * [98]hitl: code to train memn2n on tasks from the paper
       "[99]dialogue learning with human-in-the-loop". this code is
       implemented in [100]torch7; more documentation is given in the
       readme in that subdirectory.
     * [101]askingquestions: code to train memn2n on tasks from the paper
       "[102]learning through dialogue interactions". this code is
       implemented in [103]torch7; more documentation is given in the
       readme in that subdirectory.
     * [104]kvmemnn: code to train memn2n on tasks from the paper
       "[105]key-value memory networks for directly reading documents".
       this code is implemented in [106]torch7; more documentation is
       given in the readme in that subdirectory.
     * [107]entnet-babi: code to train an entity network on babi tasks, as
       described in the paper "[108]tracking the world state with
       recurrent entity networks". this code is implemented in
       [109]torch7; more documentation is given in the readme in that
       subdirectory.

other 3rd party implementations

     * [110]python-babi: memn2n implemenation on babi tasks with very nice
       interactive demo.
     * [111]theano-babi: memn2n implementation in theano for babi tasks.
     * [112]tf-lang: memn2n language model implementation in tensorflow.
     * [113]tf-babi: another memn2n implementation of memn2n in
       tensorflow, but for babi tasks.
