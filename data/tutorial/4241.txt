features

   1
   [orig]
   categorical features support
   improve your training results with catboost that allows you to use
   non-numeric factors, instead of having to pre-process your data or
   spend time and effort turning it to numbers.
   2
   [orig]
   fast and scalable gpu version
   train your model on a fast implementation of gradient-boosting
   algorithm for gpu. use a multi-card configuration for large datasets.
   3
   [orig]
   improved accuracy
   reduce overfitting when constructing your models with a novel
   gradient-boosting scheme.
   4
   [orig]
   fast prediction
   apply your trained model quickly and efficiently even to
   latency-critical tasks using catboost's model applier
   5
   [orig]
   user-friendly api interface
   launch catboost right from the command line or enjoy a user-friendly
   api for python or r, with tools for formula analysis and training
   visualisation.

about

   catboost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on id90.
   developed by yandex researchers and engineers, it is the successor of
   the [8]matrixnet algorithm that is widely used within the company for
   ranking tasks, forecasting and making recommendations. it is universal
   and can be applied across a wide range of areas and to    a variety of
   problems.
