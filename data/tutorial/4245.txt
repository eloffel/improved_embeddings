   value estimation   one of the most common types of machine learning
   algorithms   can automatically estimate values by looking at related
   information. for example, a website can determine how much a house is
   worth based on the property's location and characteristics. in this
   project-based course, discover how to use machine learning to build a
   value estimation system that can deduce the value of a home. follow
   adam geitgey as he walks through how to use sample data to build a
   machine learning model, and then use that model in your own programs.
   although the project featured in this course focuses on real estate,
   you can use the same approach to solve any kind of value estimation
   problem with machine learning.
   topics include:
     * setting up the development environment
     * building a simple home value estimator
     * finding the best weights automatically
     * working with large data sets efficiently
     * training a supervised machine learning model
     * exploring a home value data set
     * deciding how much data is needed
     * preparing the features
     * training the value estimator
     * measuring accuracy with mean absolute error
     * improving a system
     * using the machine learning model to make predictions

   - [adam] how do websites automatically determine how much a house is
   worth? this is an example of using machine learning for value
   estimation. a machine learning model uses information from other homes
   sold in the area and produces a value estimate for a different house.
   hi, i'm adam geitgey and i'd like to welcome you to this course where
   you'll build a value estimation system that can automatically deduce
   the value of your house based on its location and characteristics.
   first, we'll cover how to use training data to build a machine learning
   model. then we'll explore how to use that machine learning model in
   your own programs.

   but the skills you'll develop in this course aren't limited to real
   estate. you can use the exact same approach to solve any kind of value
   estimation problem with machine learning. let's dive in.
