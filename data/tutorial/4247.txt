applications of artificial intelligence & deep learning

   now think about this, instead of you doing all your work, you have a
   machine to finish it for you or it can do something which you thought
   was not possible at all. for instance:
   predicting future - deep learning tutorial - edureka

   predicting the future: it can help us in predicting earthquakes,
   tsunami   s, etc. beforehand so that preventive measures can be taken to
   save many lives from falling into the clutches of natural calamities.
   chat-bots: all of you would have heard about siri, which is apple   s
   voice controlled virtual assistant. believe me, with the help of deep
   learning these virtual assistance are getting smarter day by day. in
   fact, siri can adapt itself according to the user and provide better
   personalized assistance. id70 - deep learning tutorial - edureka
   self driving cars - deep learning tutorial - edureka self-driving
   cars: imagine, how incredible it would be for physically disabled and
   elderly people who find it difficult to drive on their own. apart from
   this, it will save millions of innocent lives who meet road accident
   every year because of human error.

   google ai eye doctor: it is a recent initiative taken by google where
   they are working with an indian eye care chain to develop an ai
   software which can examine retina scans and identify a condition called
   diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness.
   ai eye doctor - deep learning tutorial - edureka
   ai music composer - deep learning tutorial - edureka ai music
   composer: well, who thought we can have an ai music composer using deep
   learning. hence, i would not be surprised to hear that the next best
   music is given by a machine.


   a dream reading machine: this is one of my favorites, a machine that
   can capture your dreams in the form of video or something. with so many
   un-realistic applications of ai & deep learning we have seen so far, i
   was not surprised to find out that this was tried in japan few years
   back on three test subjects and they were able to achieve close to 60%
   accuracy. that is something quite unbelievable, yet true. ai dream
   machine - deep learning tutorial - edureka

   i am pretty sure that some of these real life applications of ai & deep
   learning would have given you goosebumps. alright then, this sets the
   base for you and now, we are ready to proceed further in this deep
   learning tutorial and understand what is artificial intelligence.

what is artificial intelligence ?

   artificial intelligence is nothing but the capability of a machine to
   imitate intelligent human behavior. ai is achieved by mimicking a human
   brain, by understanding how it thinks, how it learns, decides, and work
   while trying to solve a problem.

   for example: a machine playing chess, or a voice activated software
   which helps you with various things in your iphone or a number plate
   recognition system which captures the number plate of a over speeding
   car and processes it to extract the registration number and identify
   the owner of the car. all these wasn   t very easy to implement before
   deep learning. now, let   s understand the various subsets of artificial
   intelligence.

subsets of artificial intelligence

   till now, you would have heard a lot about artificial intelligence,
   machine learning and deep learning. however, do you know the
   relationship between all three of them? basically, deep learning is a
   sub-field of machine learning and machine learning is a sub-field of
   artificial intelligence as shown in the image below:
   ai timeline - deep learning tutorial - edureka

   when we look at something like [60]alphago, it   s often portrayed as a
   big success for deep learning, but it   s actually a combination of ideas
   from several different fields of ai and machine learning. in fact, you
   would be surprised to hear that the idea behind deep neural networks is
   not new but dates back to 1950   s. however, it became possible to
   practically implement it because of the high-end resource capability
   available nowadays.

   so, moving ahead in this deep learning tutorial blog, let   s explore
   machine learning followed by its limitations.


what is machine learning ?

   machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which provide
   computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly
   programmed. in machine learning, we do not have to define explicitly
   all the steps or conditions like any other programming application. on
   the contrary, the machine gets trained on a training dataset, large
   enough to create a model, which helps machine to take decisions based
   on its learning.

   for example: we want to determine the species of a flower based on its
   petal and sepal length (leaves of a flower) using machine learning.
   then, how will we do it?
   machine learning - deep learning tutorial - edureka
   we will feed the flower data set which contains various characteristics
   of different flowers along with their respective species into our
   machine as you can see in the above image. using this input data set,
   the machine will create and train a model which can be used to classify
   flowers into different categories.
   once our model has been trained, we will pass on a set of
   characteristics as input to the model.
   finally, our model will output the species of the flower present in the
   new input data set. this process of training a machine to create a
   model and use it for decision making is called machine learning.
   however this process has some limitations.

limitations of machine learning

   machine learning is not capable of handling high dimensional data that
   is where input & output is quite large. handling and processing such
   type of data becomes very complex and resource exhaustive. this is
   termed as curse of dimensionality. to understand this in simpler terms,
   let   s consider the following image:
     dimensionality problem - deep learning tutorial - edureka


   consider a line of 100 yards and you have dropped a coin somewhere on
   the line. now, it   s quite convenient for you to find the coin by simply
   walking on the line. this very line is a single dimensional entity.


   next, consider you have a square of side 100 yards each as shown in the
   above image and yet again, you dropped a coin somewhere in between.
   now, it is quite evident that you are going to take more time to find
   the coin within that square as compared to the previous scenario. this
   square is a 2 dimensional entity.


   lets take it a step ahead by considering a cube of side 100 yards each
   and you have dropped a coin somewhere in between. now, it is even more
   difficult to find the coin this time. this cube is a 3 dimensional
   entity.

   hence, you can observe the complexity is increasing as the dimensions
   are increasing. and in real-life, the high dimensional data that we
   were talking about has thousands of dimensions that makes it very
   complex to handle and process. the high dimensional data can easily be
   found in use-cases like image processing, nlp, image translation etc.

   machine learning was not capable of solving these use-cases and hence,
   deep learning came to the rescue. deep learning is capable of handling
   the high dimensional data and is also efficient in focusing on the
   right features on its own. this process is called feature extraction.
   now, let   s move ahead in this deep learning tutorial and understand how
   deep learning works.

how deep learning works?

   in an attempt to re-engineer a human brain, deep learning studies the
   basic unit of a brain called a brain cell or a neuron. inspired from a
   neuron an artificial neuron or a id88 was developed. now, let us
   understand the functionality of biological neurons and how we mimic
   this functionality in the id88 or an artificial neuron:
   id88 & neuron - deep learning tutorial - edureka
     * if we focus on the structure of a biological neuron, it has
       dendrites which is used to receive inputs. these inputs are summed
       in the cell body and using the axon it is passed on to the next
       biological neuron as shown in the above image.
     * similarly, a id88 receives multiple inputs, applies various
       transformations and functions and provides an output.
     * as we know that our brain consists of multiple connected neurons
       called neural network, we can also have a network of artificial
       neurons called id88s to form a deep neural network. so, let   s
       move ahead in this deep learning tutorial to understand how a deep
       neural network looks like.

deep learning tutorial: what is deep learning?

   deep neural network - deep learning tutorial - edureka
     * any deep neural network will consist of three types of layers:
          + the input layer
          + the hidden layer
          + the output layer

   in the above diagram, the first layer is the input layer which receives
   all the inputs and the last layer is the output layer which provides
   the desired output.
   all the layers in between these layers are called hidden layers. there
   can be n number of hidden layers thanks to the high end resources
   available these days.
   the number of hidden layers and the number of id88s in each layer
   will entirely depend on the use-case you are trying to solve.

   now that you have a picture of a deep neural networks, let   s move ahead
   in this deep learning tutorial to get a high level view of how deep
   neural networks solves a problem of image recognition.

deep learning use     case

   we want to perform image recognition using deep networks: deep neural
   network - what is deep learning - edureka
   here, we are passing the high dimensional data to the input layer. to
   match the dimensionality of the input data, the input layer will
   contain multiple sub-layers of id88s so that it can consume the
   entire input.
   the output received from the input layer will contain patterns and will
   only be able to identify the edges of the images based on the contrast
   levels.
   this output will be fed to the hidden layer 1 where it will be able to
   identify various face features like eyes, nose, ears etc.
   now, this will be fed to the hidden layer 2 where it will able to form
   the entire faces. then, the output of layer 2 is sent to the output
   layer.
   finally, the output layer performs classification based on the result
   obtained from the previous and predicts the name.

   let me ask you a question, what will happen if any of these layers is
   missing or the neural network is not deep enough? simple, we will not
   be able to accurately identify the images. this is the very reason why
   these use-cases did not have a solution all these years prior to deep
   learning. just to take this further, we will try to apply deep networks
   on a mnist data-set.
     image recognition - deep learning tutorial - edureka
     * the mnist data-set consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000
       testing samples of handwritten digit images. the task here is to
       train a model which can accurately identify the digit present on
       the image.
     * to solve this use-case a deep network will be created with multiple
       hidden layers to process all the 60,000 images pixel by pixel and
       finally we will receive an output layer.
     * the output layer will be an array of index 0 to 9, where each index
       corresponds to the respective digit. index 0 contains the
       id203 for 0 being the digit present on the input image.
     * similarly, index 2 which has a value of 0.1, actually represents
       the id203 of 2 being the digit present on the input image.
       so, if we see the highest id203 in this array is 0.8 which is
       present at index 7 of the array. hence the number present on the
       image is 7.

conclusion

   so guys, this was all about deep learning in a nutshell. in this deep
   learning tutorial, we saw various applications of deep learning and
   understood its relationship with ai and machine learning. then, we
   understood how we can use id88 or an artificial neuron basic
   building blocks for creating deep neural network that can perform
   complex tasks such. at last, we went through one of the use-cases of
   deep learning where we performed image recognition using deep neural
   networks and understood all the steps that happen behind the scene.
   now, in the next blog of this deep learning tutorial series, we will
   learn how to implement a id88 using tensorflow, which is a python
   based library for deep learning.
