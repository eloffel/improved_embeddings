crypto-id56: learning the enigma with recurrent neural networks

   see [89]paper and [90]blog post

   [91]concept-small

about

   this repo contains a deep lstm-based model for learning polyalphabetic
   ciphers. it also contains code for training the model on three ciphers:
   the vigenere, autokey, and enigma ciphers. the first two are light
   proof-of-concept tasks whereas the enigma is much more complex. for
   this reason, the enigma model is enormous (3000 hidden units) and takes
   a lot longer to train.

vigenere and autokey ciphers

   the [92]vigenere cipher works like this (where we're encrypting
   plaintext "calcul" with keyword "maths" (repeated)). the [93]autokey
   cipher is a slightly more secure variant. [94]vigenere cipher

enigma cipher

   the [95]enigma cipher works like this. [96]enigma cipher
