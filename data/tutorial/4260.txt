                          the text-generating id56 demo

tl;dr generate wacky stuff

   welcome to the id56 demo. type a string into the text box, and the id56
   will generate characters that start with this text. it will be nonsense
   most of the time, but it will occasionally be amusing and interesting.
   the id56 is particularly amusing because it sometimes generates
   wise-sounding nonsense. for example, try typing "the meaning of life
   is".
   unfortunately the running the id56 takes a bit of time, so please be
   patient! it's slow because we need to perform two 1500x1500
   matrix-vector products for each generated character. as a result, it
   generates about 20 characters a second.

   click on a sentence to get started a feel for the id56
   [1]my name is
   [2]today is
   [3]my greatest accomplishment is
   [4]matrix l
   [5]quantum ph
   [6]the meaning of life is
   [7]this is a piece of
   or try typing something creative. up to you!
