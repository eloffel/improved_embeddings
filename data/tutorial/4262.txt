scale-out computation

   easily scale-out computation on apache spark dataframes in a
   distributed fashion with the new databricks horovodestimator.

   benefit from accelerated hardware support (cuda and cudnn) for greater
   performances on the most demanding jobs.

   automatically scale resources based on your needs, and keep costs under
   control by separating storage from compute resources.
