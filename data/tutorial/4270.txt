visual interaction networks

   tensorflow implementation of visual interaction networks from google
   deepmind.

   implementation is on tensorflow r1.2.

   [84]https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01433

   "another key part of relational reasoning involves predicting the
   future in a physical scene. from just a glance, humans can infer not
   only what objects are where, but also what will happen to them over the
   upcoming seconds, minutes and even longer in some cases. for example,
   if you kick a football against a wall, your brain predicts what will
   happen when the ball hits the wall and how their movements will be
   affected afterwards (the ball will ricochet at a speed proportional to
   the kick and - in most cases - the wall will remain where it is)." from
   an article of deepmind

   [85]https://deepmind.com/blog/neural-approach-relational-reasoning/

   [86]alt tag

n-objects gravity simulations

   for changing configure values, please check constants script.

   cat constracts.py

   for generating images and data,

   python physical_engines.py

   for modeling visual interaction networks

   python gravity_vin.py

data

   the data are gathered from my own implemented physics engine, which is
   same of interaction network git repo.
   [87]https://github.com/jaesik817/interaction-networks_tensorflow

   one different thing from in physics engines is time difference between
   frames, which was 0.0001 in in repo and is 0.001 in this. because
   0.0001 secs frame cannot be recognized in 32 x 32 images.

settings

   settings are written in constants.py and gravity_vin.py. the number of
   objects, frames on each simulations and rollout frames are 3, 50 and
   20. the training max epoches are 80000. in physical_engines code, every
   frames are saved as image and coded data, and those things are used in
   gravity_vin script. each image has background ones from cifar 10
   training data set as the paper.

results

   the loss decreased as followed, which is summarized value of losses on
   near future 8 frames and encoding-decoding losses on input images.

   [88]alt tag

   the quilititive results are as followed.
