   guest blog post by [36]martijn theuwissen, co-founder at datacamp.other
   python resources can be found [37]here.

   python is widely used for data analysis and you might have considered
   learning it yourself (if not, or if you   re still looking for that bit
   of extra motivation to get started, see why you should be learning
   python below). of course, learning on your own can be a challenge and
   some guidance is always helpful. guidance to learn python for working
   with data is exactly what this article will provide you with.

   we will discuss steps you should take for learning python accompanied
   with some essential resources, such as the free [38]python for data
   analysis courses and tutorials from datacamp as well as reading and
   learning materials.

   [39][capture.png]

   step 0: reasons to learn python

   why learn python as a data analytics tool?
     * it   s a popular data analysis tool: firstly, by itself python is one
       of the most popular tools for data analysis. with 35% of data
       scientists using python, it is ahead of sql and sas, and behind
       only r.
     * general purpose programming: despite there being other very popular
       and great computing tools used for analyzing data (e.g. r, sas),
       python is the only true general purpose programming language. check
       out this [40]infographic for a more thorough comparison.
     * popular programming language: in addition, python is one
       the [41]most popular programming languages, when compared with
       other general purpose languages (e.g. java, c++, php).
     * if that   s not enough, python is also the [42]language of choice for
       teaching computer science in top u.s. universities.

   as a side note: we don   t recommend that you only learn python and
   forget about the rest. however, learning python is one of the best
   things you can do for your career. there are good reasons why python is
   being adopted so widely by computer scientists, and why it   s a data
   analysis tool of choice for so many, the main one being the ease of
   learning and using python. nonetheless, it can be challenging to set a
   learning path, so that   s what we will do now.

   step 1: setting up your python environment for data analysis
     * download python from continuum analytics: [43]anaconda
     * optional (download rodeo from yhat): [44]rodeo ide

   setting up your python environment for performing data analysis is
   relatively simple. the most convenient way to go about this is to
   download the free [45]anaconda package from continuum analytics, as it
   contains the core python language, as well as all of the essential
   libraries including numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and ipython. by
   using the graphical installer, downloading python is as easy as
   downloading any computer program.

   after installing, you will get a launcher containing a number of
   programs. the most important one is the ipython notebook, which is also
   called [46]jupyter notebook. once  you launch the notebook, the
   terminal is opened and a notebook is opened in your browser. don   t get
   confused here! you don   t need internet connection to create or use the
   notebooks. simply, the browser is used instead of a separate program
   and serves as your environment,where you can code.

   however, you are not limited to using the browser based jupyter
   notebooks. if you prefer an ide, a great option for data analysis
   is [47]rodeo from yhat. if you are familiar with [48]rstudio for r,
   rodeo is something very similar for python. be sure to try out both
   alternatives, as, ultimately, the python environment you use will
   depend on your personal preference.

   step 2: learning the basics and fundamentals

   now you are ready to begin learning to code with python. there are a
   couple of good ways to go about this. given your interest to learn
   python for data analysis, your best option is the [49]introduction for
   python for data science from datacamp. this free course consist of
   video tutorials and interactive in browser exercises and is a great way
   to learn by doing, as opposed to simply reading concepts and looking at
   examples. you wouldn   t begin learning how to paint by reading a book
   about it. you would pick up a brush and start painting. that   s the way
   we would suggest for you to start learning python! in addition to the
   introductory course, datacamp offers an [50]intermediate python for
   data science course which takes you even further.

   another quite useful resource is the python course from [51]codecademy.
   while this course is not about data, but rather programming with
   python, it is a great way to both practice with python syntax and gain
   exposure to programming concepts that will be useful to you when
   working with data.

   step 3: python packages for data analysis

   python is a general purpose language and is often used for things other
   than data analysis and data science. what makes python extremely useful
   for working with data, however, are the libraries that give users the
   necessary functionality. below are the major python libraries that are
   used for working with data. you should take some time to familiarize
   yourself with the basic purposes of these packages.
     * [52]numpy and [53]scipy     fundamental scientific computing.
     * [54]pandas     data manipulation and analysis.
     * [55]matplotlib     plotting and visualization.
     * [56]scikit-learn     machine learning and data mining.
     * [57]statsmodels     statistical modeling, testing, and analysis.

   step 4: get data to learn with. (loading data)

   the best way to learn and get comfortable with python, or any other new
   programming language, is to take a sample dataset to work with,
   experiment, and try the new skills and techniques you pick up along the
   way.

   the statsmodels library contains some preloaded datasets that you could
   use. otherwise you can load a data set from the web or a csv file. to
   do so you can follow a [58]sample code from available examples or
   forums like [59]stack overflow.  always have your dataset available and
   treat it as a toy that you can play with and learn from.

   step 5: manipulating data

   one of the most hands-on skills of working with data is data
   manipulation. data doesn   t always come clean and analysis-ready. in
   order to be able to analyse data, we often need data that is
   manipulated through transformations, formatting, cleaning, etc. pandas
   and numpy are the go to tools for that in python, so start learning how
   to use them with your sample dataset.
     * get started with a short introduction: [60]10 minutes to pandas
     * follow an introductory tutorial: [61]pandas notebook lesson
     * go back to the datacamp courses and re-apply what you learned to
       your toy dataset: [62]datacamp python for data science

   step 6: visualizing data

   another essential skill in data analysis is data . visuals are
   extremely important for both exploratory data analysis, as well the
   communication of your results. matplotlib is the most commonly used
   library for this in python.
     * get inspired by viewing some plots and graphs: [63]matplotlib
       gallery
     * take a look at some sample code: [64]matplotlib examples
     * review the matplotlib chapter on datacamp: [65]datacamp python for
       data science
     * come up with some visualizations for your toy dataset.

   step 7: data analytics

   of course analyzing data is not just about formatting and making plots
   and graphs. the analytics begins with statistical modeling, machine
   learning algorithms, data mining techniques, id136s and so on.
   python is a fantastic tool for analyzing data because it has libraries
   such as scikit-learn and statsmodels which contain the implementations
   of the models and algorithms that you might need for your analysis. of
   course, as python is a general purpose programming language, you are
   also free to program your own methods when you become an advanced user,
   though make sure you are not replicating what already exists.
     * begin by considering a familiar technique that you will be able to
       follow (e.g.. [66]id75, [67]k-nearest
       neighbors, [68]time series) and find an example of implementation
       in python.
     * try performing a simple analysis on your toy dataset.
     * you can look at examples
       of [69]scikit-learn and [70]statsmodels methods that you might not
       know, just to appreciate the possibilities.

   step 8: reporting

   communicating your analysis is a key soft skill in data science. of
   course, communication begins with good use of language and style.
   however, an equally important aspect of communicating your analysis is
   preparing legible reports. luckily you have a handy tool for that in
   the form of the previously mentioned jupyter notebooks (see step 1).

   while you can use the jupyter notebooks as a place to code and do your
   analysis, you can also imbed text, formatted formulas, even images and
   video if you like. what   s more, you have to options of exporting your
   code in various formats that include pdfs, html, and markdown.
     * gain a better familiarity with jupyter through a
       tutorial: [71]jupyter notebooks getting started
     * if you are familiar with latex learn how to use it with
       jupyter:  [72]latex in ipython notebooks
     * if you are not familiar with latex but and you want to use
       mathematical notation in your reports, read about it: [73]latex for
       mathematics wiki
     * read some high-quality reports: [74]data science projects from
       berkeley

   step 9: mastering python

   after learning the basics of python and exploring the main tools and
   libraries with your sample dataset, you should proceed to taking some
   courses either for python, or courses taught with python to begin
   mastering the language. apparently, after 10,000 hours you can become
   an expert in anything, so don   t wait and get started! some online
   course and sources for projects we would recommend include:
     * data management and processing: [75]python for everybody by
       university of michigan
     * data analysis: [76]data analysis and interpretation specialization
     * data science fundamentals: intro to data science on udacity
     * [77]kaggle competitions
     * [78]drivendata.org competitions

          cool. thanks for the guidance.

          i bookmarked this guide ... it's easy to get lost in midst of so
          much information . i took a python course from coursera. it was
          best online class - most useful . i just need to find an
          interesting project to continue the learning process .

          i have python installed via cygwin ... i did a few scrypting
          projects for the coursera couse (web page scraping ) .

          i will use this post to follow up on the learning.  thank you.

          next step : install anaconda
