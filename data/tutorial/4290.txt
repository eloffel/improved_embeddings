how to train, deploy and develop tensorflow ai models, sparkml from jupyter
notebook to production


   today i would like to post a more technical and pure engineering topic.
   the heart of the matter in artificial intelligence(ai) is more
   practical/empirical based than theoretical. even though the conceptual
   framework is undoubtedly important. but to get a good grasp of the real
   work involved in setting up all the apparatus for a machine
   learning/deep learning and ai model or project we need to get the hands
   dirty, so to speak.

   the video below may offer the right frame of mind with this goal. it
   features a talk by research scientist [14]chris fregly from pipelineio
       a machine learning and ai start-up from san francisco, us. chris
   starts by presenting the github repository called
   [15]fluxcapacitor/pipeline. in spite of the talk being from january
   2017     less than six months of development in software development
   might mean a lot of time and already not up to data work -, i thought
   this presentation to preserve its relevance. and it manages to put
   together a plethora of software developments such as kubernetes
   orchestration tools, docker containers, apache sparkml, tensorflow and
   the jupyter notebook all in a bundled development stack, quite
   impressive

   the youtube video description of the talk is also worth to read
   through. i share it here:


   in this completely demo-based talk, chris fregly from pipelineio will
   demo the latest 100% open source research in high-scale, fault-tolerant
   model serving using tensorflow, spark ml, jupyter notebook, docker,
   kubernetes, and netflixoss microservices.


   this talk will discuss the trade-offs of mutable vs. immutable model
   deployments, on-the-fly jvm byte-code generation, global request
   batching, miroservice circuit breakers, and dynamic cluster scaling    
   all from within a jupyter notebook.


   chris fregly is a research scientist at pipelineio     a machine learning
   and artificial intelligence startup in san francisco.


   chris is an apache spark contributor, netflix open source committer,
   founder of the advanced spark and tensorflow meetup, author of the
   upcoming book, advanced spark, and creator of the upcoming o   reilly
   video series, deploying and scaling distributed tensorflow in
   production.


   previously, chris was a distributed systems engineer at netflix, data
   solutions engineer at databricks, and a founding member of the ibm
   spark technology center in san francisco.


   this talk was part of meetup from the [17]advanced spark and tensorflow
   meetup and anticipates the [18]startupml conference to be held in san
   francisco later in august. these are cutting-edge software development
   around data engineering, big data pipelines, machine learning and
   artificial intelligence compute engines. then there is the hardware
   part of all this multitude of developments, which has also witnessed
   recently some important milestones. chris    talk manages to give us
   picture of the relationship between these software and hardware
   developments within the sparkml and tensorflow ai models stacks.
   pipelineio [19]pipelineio: spark ml and tensorflow ai platform



   one other interesting aspect of the talk is how the jupyter notebook of
   python language software development origin is seaid113ssly integrated
   with the various pipelines, providing flexible environments
   contributing to a more productive setup overall.

   my final work goes to the part of the talk where chris gave his view
   about model deployments and rollbacks and the graph transform tool that
   chris has been working on . it seemed to be the heart of the matter in
   this talk. the way modern ai and machine learning/deep learning models
   are being deployed deserves greater attention. of special interest is
   the interplay between mutable and immutable deployment, with the
   rollback option always an on button. docker containers and images are
   playing an increasing crucial role in this development. so to know as
   much as possible about docker containers and images is a plus. on the
   graph transform tool development chris recommends simplification
   procedures in order to properly make sense of what can easily become a
   deeply convoluted graphical display as well as optimizing the serving
   runtime environment.
