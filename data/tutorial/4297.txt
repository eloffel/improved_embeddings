a textbook for an honors id202 course (updated sept. 4, 2017):

id202 done wrong.

                               by sergei treil



from the introduction:

   the title of the book sounds a bit mysterious. why should anyone read
   this book if it presents the subject in a wrong way? what is
   particularly done "wrong" in the book?
   before answering these questions, let me first describe the target
   audience of this text. this book appeared as lecture notes for the
   course "honors id202". it supposed to be a first linear
   algebra course for mathematically advanced students. it is intended for
   a student who, while not yet very familiar with abstract reasoning, is
   willing to study more rigorous mathematics that is presented in a
   "cookbook style" calculus type course. besides being a first course in
   id202 it is also supposed to be a first course introducing a
   student to rigorous proof, formal definitions---in short, to the style
   of modern theoretical (abstract) mathematics.
   the target audience explains the very specific blend of elementary
   ideas and concrete examples, which are usually presented in
   introductory id202 texts with more abstract definitions and
   constructions typical for advanced books.
   another specific of the book is that it is not written by or for an
   algebraist. so, i tried to emphasize the topics that are important for
   analysis, geometry, id203, etc., and did not include some
   traditional topics. for example, i am only considering vector spaces
   over the fields of real or complex numbers. linear spaces over other
   fields are not considered at all, since i feel time required to
   introduce and explain abstract fields would be better spent on some
   more classical topics, which will be required in other disciplines. and
   later, when the students study general fields in an abstract algebra
   course they will understand that many of the constructions studied in
   this book will also work for general fields.
   also, i treat only finite-dimensional spaces in this book and a basis
   always means a finite basis. the reason is that it is impossible to say
   something non-trivial about infinite-dimensional spaces without
   introducing convergence, norms, completeness etc., i.e. the basics of
   functional analysis. and this is definitely a subject for a separate
   course (text). so, i do not consider infinite hamel bases here: they
   are not needed in most applications to analysis and geometry, and i
   feel they belong in an abstract algebra course.

   the cost of printing; however the students should have an option to use
   the free electronic version.

what is new:

   september 2017 version of the book includes correction of numerous
   typos. some exercises were updated.

   in the september 2014 version i corrected numerous typos, noticed by
   the readers. i also added some more detailed explanations, in
   particular, clearly specifying in all situations  whether real or
   complex case (or both) is considered.

   in this version i  also expanded a bit sections on  non-orthogonal
   orthogonalization of the quadratic forms, and on  singular value
   decomposition and its applications.  in particular, i added a  section
   about moore--penrose inverse (section  4.5  in  ch.  6).
