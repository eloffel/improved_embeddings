1.1

introductory remarks

the task of mathematics is to establish the truth or falsehood of (formalizable) state-
ments using rigorous logic, and to provide methods for the solution of classes of (e.g.
applied) problems, ideally including rigorous logical proofs verifying the validity of the
methods (proofs that the method under consideration will, indeed, provide a correct
solution).

the topic of this class is calculus, which is short for in   nitesimal calculus, usually un-
derstood (as it is here) to mean di   erential and integral calculus of real and complex
numbers (more generally, calculus may refer to any method or system of calculation
guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions, we will brie   y touch on another
example in sec. 1.2 below). in that sense, calculus is the beginning part of the broader
   eld of (mathematical) analysis, the section of mathematics concerned with the notion
of a limit (for us, the most important examples will be limits of sequences (def. 7.1
below) and limits of functions (def. 8.17 below)).

before we can properly de   ne our    rst limit, however, it still needs some preparatory
work. in modern mathematics, the objects under investigation are almost always so-
called sets. so one aims at deriving (i.e. proving) true (and interesting and useful)
statements about sets from other statements about sets known or assumed to be true.
such a derivation or proof means applying logical rules that guarantee the truth of the
derived (i.e. proved) statement.

however, unfortunately, a proper de   nition of the notion of set is not easy, and neither
is an appropriate treatment of logic and proof theory. here, we will only be able to
brie   y touch on the bare necessities from logic and set theory needed to proceed to the
core matter of this class. we begin with logic in sec. 1.2, followed by set theory in
sec. 1.3, combining both in sec. 1.4. the interested student can    nd an introductory
presentation of axiomatic set theory in [phi16, sec. a] and he/she should consider taking
a separate class on set theory, logic, and proof theory at a later time.

1.2 propositional calculus

1.2.1 statements

mathematical logic is a large    eld in its own right and, as indicated above, a thorough in-
troduction is beyond the scope of this class     the interested reader may refer to [eft07],
[kun12], and references therein. here, we will just introduce some basic concepts using
common english (rather than formal symbolic languages     a concept explained in books
like [eft07]).

as mentioned before, mathematics establishes the truth or falsehood of statements. by
a statement or proposition we mean any sentence (any sequence of symbols) that can

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

reasonably be assigned a truth value, i.e. a value of either true, abbreviated t, or false,
abbreviated f. the following example illustrates the di   erence between statements and
sentences that are not statements:

example 1.1. (a) sentences that are statements:

every dog is an animal. (t)
every animal is a dog. (f)
the number 4 is odd. (f)
2 + 3 = 5. (t)
   2 < 0. (f)
x + 1 > 0 holds for each natural number x. (t)

(b) sentences that are not statements:

let   s study calculus!
who are you?
3    5 + 7.
x + 1 > 0.
all natural numbers are green.

the fourth sentence in ex. 1.1(b) is not a statement, as it can not be said to be either
true or false without any further knowledge on x. the    fth sentence in ex. 1.1(b) is
not a statement as it lacks any meaning and can, hence, not be either true or false. it
would become a statement if given a de   nition of what it means for a natural number
to be green.

1.2.2 logical operators

the next step now is to combine statements into new statements using logical operators,
where the truth value of the combined statements depends on the truth values of the
original statements and on the type of logical operator facilitating the combination.
the simplest logical operator is negation, denoted   . it is actually a so-called unary
operator, i.e. it does not combine statements, but is merely applied to one statement.
for example, if a stands for the statement    every dog is an animal.   , then   a stands
for the statement    not every dog is an animal.   ; and if b stands for the statement    the
number 4 is odd.   , then   b stands for the statement    the number 4 is not odd.   , which
can also be expressed as    the number 4 is even.   

to completely understand the action of a logical operator, one usually writes what is
known as a truth table. for negation, the truth table is

a   a
t f
f t

(1.1)

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

that means if the input statement a is true, then the output statement   a is false; if
the input statement a is false, then the output statement   a is true.
we now proceed to discuss binary logical operators, i.e. logical operators combining
precisely two statements. the following four operators are essential for mathematical
reasoning:
conjunction: a and b, usually denoted a     b.
disjunction: a or b, usually denoted a     b.
implication: a implies b, usually denoted a     b.
equivalence: a is equivalent to b, usually denoted a     b.
here is the corresponding truth table:

a b a     b a     b a     b a     b
t t
t f
f t
f f

t
t
t
f

t

(1.2)

when    rst seen, some of the assignments of truth values in (1.2) might not be completely
intuitive, due to the fact that logical operators are often used somewhat di   erently in
common english. let us consider each of the four logical operators of (1.2) in sequence:

for the use in subsequent examples, let a1, . . . , a6 denote the six statements from ex.
1.1(a).

conjunction: most likely the easiest of the four, basically identical to common language
use: a    b is true if, and only if, both a and b are true. for example, using ex. 1.1(a),
a1     a4 is the statement    every dog is an animal and 2 + 3 = 5.   , which is true since
both a1 and a4 are true. on the other hand, a1     a3 is the statement    every dog is
an animal and the number 4 is odd.   , which is false, since a3 is false.
disjunction: the disjunction a    b is true if, and only if, at least one of the statements
a, b is true. here one already has to be a bit careful     a     b de   nes the inclusive or,
whereas    or    in common english is often understood to mean the exclusive or (which is
false if both input statements are true). for example, using ex. 1.1(a), a1     a4 is the
statement    every dog is an animal or 2 + 3 = 5.   , which is true since both a1 and a4
are true. the statement a1     a3, i.e.    every dog is an animal or the number 4 is odd.   
is also true, since a1 is true. however, the statement a2     a5, i.e.    every animal is a
dog or    2 < 0.    is false, as both a2 and a5 are false.
as you will have noted in the above examples, logical operators can be applied to
combine statements that have no obvious contents relation. while this might seem
strange, introducing contents-related restrictions is unnecessary as well as undesirable,
since it is often not clear which seemingly unrelated statements might suddenly appear
in a common context in the future. the same occurs when considering implications and
equivalences, where it might seem even more obscure at    rst.

implication: instead of a implies b, one also says if a then b, b is a consequence
of a, b is concluded or inferred from a, a is su   cient for b, or b is necessary for
a. the implication a     b is always true, except if a is true and b is false. at    rst
glance, it might be surprising that a     b is de   ned to be true for a false and b true,
however, there are many examples of incorrect statements implying correct statements.
for instance, squaring the (false) equality of integers    1 = 1, implies the (true) equality
of integers 1 = 1. however, as with conjunction and disjunction, it is perfectly valid
to combine statements without any obvious context relation: for example, using ex.
1.1(a), the statement a1     a6, i.e.    every dog is an animal implies x + 1 > 0 holds for
each natural number x.    is true, since a6 is true, whereas the statement a4     a2, i.e.
   2 + 3 = 5 implies every animal is a dog.    is false, as a4 is true and a2 is false.
of course, the implication a     b is not really useful in situations, where the truth
values of both a and b are already known. rather, in a typical application, one tries
to establish the truth of a to prove the truth of b (a strategy that will fail if a happens
to be false).

example 1.2. suppose we know sasha to be a member of a group of children. then
the statement a    sasha is a girl.    implies the statement b    there is at least one girl
in the group.    a priori, we might not know if sasha is a girl or a boy, but if we can
establish sasha to be a girl, then we also know b to be true. if we    nd sasha to be a
boy, then we do not know, whether b is true or false.

   

equivalence: a     b means a is true if, and only if, b is true. once again, using
input statements from ex. 1.1(a), we see that a1     a4, i.e.    every dog is an animal
is equivalent to 2 + 3 = 5.   , is true as well as a2     a3, i.e.    every animal is a dog is
equivalent to the number 4 is odd.   . on the other hand, a4     a5, i.e.    2 + 3 = 5 is
equivalent to    2 < 0, is false.
analogous to the situation of implications, a     b is not really useful if the truth values
of both a and b are known a priori, but can be a powerful tool to prove b to be true
or false by establishing the truth value of a. it is obviously more powerful than the
implication as illustrated by the following example (compare with ex. 1.2):

example 1.3. suppose we know sasha is the tallest member of a group of children.
then the statement a    sasha is a girl.    is equivalent to the statement b    the tallest
kid in the group is a girl.    as in ex. 1.2, if we can establish sasha to be a girl, then we
also know b to be true. however, in contrast to ex. 1.2, if we    nd sasha to be a boy,
we know b to be false.

remark 1.4. in computer science, the truth value t is often coded as 1 and the truth
value f is often coded as 0.

1.2.3 rules

note that the expressions in the    rst row of the truth table (1.2) (e.g. a     b) are not
statements in the sense of sec. 1.2.1, as they contain the statement variables (also known

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

8

as propositional variables) a or b. however, the expressions become statements if all
statement variables are substituted with actual statements. we will call expressions of
this form propositional formulas. moreover, if a truth value is assigned to each statement
variable of a propositional formula, then this uniquely determines the truth value of the
formula. in other words, the truth value of the propositional formula can be calculated
from the respective truth values of its statement variables     a    rst justi   cation for the
name propositional calculus.

example 1.5. (a) consider the propositional formula (a     b)     (  b). suppose a is
true and b is false. the truth value of the formula is obtained according to the
following truth table:

a b a     b   b (a     b)     (  b)
t f

t

t

f

(1.3)

(b) the propositional formula a     (  a), also known as the law of the excluded middle,
has the remarkable property that its truth value is t for every possible choice of
truth values for a:

a   a a     (  a)
t f
f t

t
t

(1.4)

formulas with this property are of particular importance.

de   nition 1.6. a propositional formula is called a tautology or universally true if,
and only if, its truth value is t for all possible assignments of truth values to all the
statement variables it contains.

notation 1.7. we write   (a1, . . . , an) if, and only if, the propositional formula   
contains precisely the n statement variables a1, . . . , an.

de   nition 1.8. the propositional formulas   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) are called
equivalent if, and only if,   (a1, . . . , an)       (a1, . . . , an) is a tautology.
lemma 1.9. the propositional formulas   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) are equiva-
lent if, and only if, they have the same truth value for all possible assignments of truth
values to a1, . . . , an.

proof. if   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) are equivalent and ai is assigned the truth
value ti, i = 1, . . . , n, then   (a1, . . . , an)       (a1, . . . , an) being a tautology implies it
has truth value t. from (1.2) we see that either   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) both
have truth value t or they both have truth value f.

if, on the other hand, we know   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) have the same truth
value for all possible assignments of truth values to a1, . . . , an, then, given such an
assignment, either   (a1, . . . , an) and   (a1, . . . , an) both have truth value t or both
have truth value f, i.e.   (a1, . . . , an)       (a1, . . . , an) has truth value t in each case,
showing it is a tautology.

for all logical purposes, two equivalent formulas are exactly the same     it does not
matter if one uses one or the other. the following theorem provides some important
equivalences of propositional formulas. as too many parentheses tend to make formulas
less readable, we    rst introduce some precedence conventions for logical operators:

convention 1.10.    takes precedence over    ,   , which take precedence over    ,   .
so, for example,

is the same as

(a       b       b       a)       c     (a       d)

(cid:16)(cid:0)a     (  b)(cid:1)    (cid:0)(  b)     (  a)(cid:1)(cid:17)    (cid:16)(  c)    (cid:0)a     (  d)(cid:1)(cid:17).

(b) (a     b)    (cid:0)(a     b)     (b     a)(cid:1), i.e. a and b are equivalent if, and only if, a
is both necessary and su   cient for b. one also calls the implication b     a the
converse of the implication a     b. thus, a and b are equivalent if, and only if,
both a     b and its converse hold true.

having checked all the rules completes the proof of the theorem.

(cid:4)

the importance of the rules provided by th. 1.11 lies in their providing proof techniques,
i.e. methods for establishing the truth of statements from statements known or assumed
to be true. the rules of th. 1.11 will be used frequently in proofs throughout this class.

in subsequent proofs, we will also frequently use so-called transitivity of implication as
well as transitivity of equivalence (we will encounter equivalence again in the context
of relations in sec. 1.3 below). in preparation for the transitivity rules, we generalize
implication to propositional formulas:

de   nition 1.12. in generalization of the implication operator de   ned in (1.2), we say
the propositional formula   (a1, . . . , an) implies the propositional formula   (a1, . . . , an)
(denoted   (a1, . . . , an)       (a1, . . . , an)) if, and only if, each assignment of truth values
to the a1, . . . , an that makes   (a1, . . . , an) true, makes   (a1, . . . , an) true as well.

theorem 1.13. (a) transitivity of implication: (a     b)     (b     c)     (a     c).
(b) transitivity of equivalence: (a     b)     (b     c)     (a     c).
proof. according to def. 1.12, the rules can be veri   ed by providing truth tables that
show that, for all possible assignments of truth values to the propositional formulas on
the left-hand side of the implications, either the left-hand side is false or both sides are

having checked both rules, the proof is complete.

de   nition and remark 1.14. a proof of the statement b is a    nite sequence of
statements a1, a2, . . . , an such that a1 is true; for 1     i < n, ai implies ai+1, and an
implies b. if there exists a proof for b, then th. 1.13(a) guarantees that b is true.

1.3 set theory

in the previous section, we have had a    rst glance at statements and corresponding truth
values. in the present section, we will move our focus to the objects such statements
are about. reviewing example 1.1(a), and recalling that this is a mathematics class
rather than one in zoology, the    rst two statements of example 1.1(a) are less relevant
for us than statements 3   6. as in these examples, we will nearly always be interested in
statements involving numbers or collections of numbers or collections of such collections
etc.

in modern mathematics, the term one usually uses instead of    collection    is    set   .
in 1895, georg cantor de   ned a set as    any collection into a whole m of de   nite
and separate objects m of our intuition or our thought   . the objects m are called
the elements of the set m . as explained in [phi16, sec. a], without restrictions and
re   nements, cantor   s set theory is not free of contradictions and, thus, not viable to be
used in the foundation of mathematics. axiomatic set theory provides these necessary
restrictions and re   nements and an introductory treatment can also be found in [phi16,

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

12

sec. a]. however, it is possible to follow and understand the rest of this class, without
having studied axiomatic set theory.
notation 1.15. we write m     m for the statement    m is an element of the set m    .
de   nition 1.16. the sets m and n are equal, denoted m = n , if, and only if, m and
n have precisely the same elements.

   

de   nition 1.16 means we know everything about a set m if, and only if, we know all its
elements.

de   nition 1.17. the set with no elements is called the empty set; it is denoted by the
symbol    .
example 1.18. for    nite sets, we can simply write down all its elements, for example,
a := {0}, b := {0, 17.5}, c := {5, 1, 5, 3}, d := {3, 5, 1}, e := {2,   2,   2}, where the

symbolism    :=    is to be read as    is de   ned to be equal to   .

note c = d, since both sets contain precisely the same elements. in particular, the
order in which the elements are written down plays no role and a set does not change if
an element is written down more than once.

if a set has many elements, instead of writing down all its elements, one might use
abbreviations such as f := {   4,   2, . . . , 20, 22, 24}, where one has to make sure the
meaning of the dots is clear from the context.
de   nition 1.19. the set a is called a subset of the set b (denoted a     b and also
referred to as the inclusion of a in b) if, and only if, every element of a is also an
element of b (one sometimes also calls b a superset of a and writes b     a). please
note that a = b is allowed in the above de   nition of a subset. if a     b and a 6= b,
then a is called a strict subset of b, denoted a ( b.
if b is a set and p (x) is a statement about an element x of b (i.e., for each x     b,
p (x) is either true or false), then we can de   ne a subset a of b by writing

a := {x     b : p (x)}.

(1.5)

this notation is supposed to mean that the set a consists precisely of those elements of
b such that p (x) is true (has the truth value t in the language of sec. 1.2).
example 1.20. (a) for each set a, one has a     a and         a.
(b) if a     b, then a = {x     b : x     a}.
(c) we have {3}     {6.7, 3, 0}. letting a := {   10,   8, . . . , 8, 10}, we have {   2, 0, 2} =

{x     a : x3     a},     = {x     a : x + 21     a}.

remark 1.21. as a consequence of def. 1.16, the sets a and b are equal if, and only
if, one has both inclusions, namely a     b and b     a. thus, when proving the equality
of sets, one often divides the proof into two parts,    rst proving one inclusion, then the
other.

de   nition 1.22. (a) the intersection of the sets a and b, denoted a    b, consists of
all elements that are in a and in b. the sets a, b are said to be disjoint if, and
only if, a     b =    .

(b) the union of the sets a and b, denoted a     b, consists of all elements that are in
a or in b (as in the logical disjunction in (1.2), the or is meant nonexclusively). if
a and b are disjoint, one sometimes writes a       b and speaks of the disjoint union
of a and b.

(c) the di   erence of the sets a and b, denoted a\b (read    a minus b    or    a without
b   ), consists of all elements of a that are not elements of b, i.e. a \ b := {x    
a : x /    b}. if b is a subset of a given set a (sometimes called the universe in
this context), then a \ b is also called the complement of b with respect to a.
in that case, one also writes bc := a \ b (note that this notation suppresses the
dependence on a).

example 1.23. (a) examples of intersections:

{1, 2, 3}     {3, 4, 5} = {3},
   2}     {1, 2, . . . , 10} =    ,
{

{   1, 2,   3, 4, 5}     {   10,   9, . . . ,   1}     {   1, 7,   3} = {   1,   3}.

(b) examples of unions:

{1, 2, 3}     {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
{1, 2, 3}      {4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},

{   1, 2,   3, 4, 5}     {   99,   98, . . . ,   1}     {   1, 7,   3}

= {   99,   98, . . . ,   2,   1, 2, 4, 5, 7}.

(c) examples of di   erences:

{1, 2, 3} \ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2},
{1, 2, 3} \ {3, 2, 1,   5} =    ,

{   10,   9, . . . , 9, 10} \ {0} = {   10,   9, . . . ,   1}     {1, 2, . . . , 9, 10}.

with respect to the universe {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, it is

{1, 2, 3}c = {4, 5};

with respect to the universe {0, 1, . . . , 20}, it is

{1, 2, 3}c = {0}     {4, 5, . . . , 20}.

de   nition 1.24. given a set a, the set of all subsets of a is called the power set of a,
denoted p(a) (for reasons explained later (cf. prop. 2.17), the power set is sometimes
also denoted as 2a).

example 1.25. examples of power sets:

p(   ) = {   },
p({0}) =(cid:8)   ,{0}(cid:9),

p(cid:0)p({0})(cid:1) = p(cid:0)(cid:8)   ,{0}(cid:9)(cid:1) =(cid:8)   ,{   },{{0}},p({0})(cid:9).

   

(1.9a)

(1.9c)

so far, we have restricted our set-theoretic examples to    nite sets. however, not sur-
prisingly, many sets of interest to us will be in   nite (we will have to postpone a mathe-
matically precise de   nition of    nite and in   nite to sec. 3.2). we will now introduce the
most simple in   nite set.

de   nition 1.26. the set n := {1, 2, 3, . . .} is called the set of natural numbers. more-
over, we de   ne n0 := {0}     n.
remark 1.27. mathematicians tend to desire as few fundamental objects as possible.
one of the consequences is the idea to actually de   ne numbers as special sets: 0 :=    ,
1 := {0}, 2 := {0, 1}; in general, de   ne the natural number n := {0, 1, . . . , n     1} =
(n     1)     {n     1}.

   

the following theorem compiles important set-theoretic rules:

theorem 1.28. let a, b, c, u be sets.

(a) commutativity of intersections: a     b = b     a.
(b) commutativity of unions: a     b = b     a.
(c) associativity of intersections: (a     b)     c = a     (b     c).
(d) associativity of unions: (a     b)     c = a     (b     c).
(e) distributivity i: a     (b     c) = (a     b)     (a     c).
(f ) distributivity ii: a     (b     c) = (a     b)     (a     c).
(g) de morgan   s law i: u \ (a     b) = (u \ a)     (u \ b).
(h) de morgan   s law ii: u \ (a     b) = (u \ a)     (u \ b).
(i) double complement: if a     u , then u \ (u \ a) = a.

proof. in each case, the proof results from the corresponding rule of th. 1.11:

(a):

x     a     b     x     a     x     b

th. 1.11(c)

    x     b     x     a     x     b     a.

(g): under the general assumption of x     u , we have the following equivalences:
x     u \ (a     b)       (x     a     b)       (cid:0)x     a     x     b(cid:1) th. 1.11(i)
    x     u \ a     x     u \ b     x     (u \ a)     (u \ b).

      (x     a)       (x     b)

the proofs of the remaining rules are left as an exercise.

(cid:4)

remark 1.29. the correspondence between th. 1.11 and th. 1.28 is no coincidence.
one can actually prove that, starting with an equivalence of propositional formulas
  (a1, . . . , an)       (a1, . . . , an), where both formulas contain only the operators    ,   ,  ,
one obtains a set-theoretic rule (stating an equality of sets) by reinterpreting all state-
ment variables a1, . . . , an as variables for sets, all subsets of a universe u , and replacing
    by    ,     by    , and    by u\ (if there are no multiple negations, then we do not need
the hypothesis that a1, . . . , an are subsets of u ). the procedure also works in the op-
posite direction     one can start with a set-theoretic formula for an equality of sets and
translate it into two equivalent propositional formulas.

1.4 predicate calculus

now that we have introduced sets in the previous section, we have to return to the
subject of mathematical logic once more. as it turns out, propositional calculus, which
we discussed in sec. 1.2, does not quite su   ce to develop the theory of calculus (nor
most other mathematical theories). the reason is that we need to consider statements
such as

x + 1 > 0 holds for each natural number x. (t)
all real numbers are positive. (f)
there exists a natural number bigger than 10. (t)
there exists a real number x such that x2 =    1. (f)
for all natural numbers n, there exists a natural number bigger than n. (t)

(1.10a)
(1.10b)
(1.10c)
(1.10d)
(1.10e)

that means we are interested in statements involving universal quanti   cation via the
quanti   er    for all    (one also often uses    for each    or    for every    instead), existential
quanti   cation via the quanti   er    there exists   , or both. the quanti   er of universal
quanti   cation is denoted by     and the quanti   er of existential quanti   cation is denoted
by    . using these symbols as well as n and r to denote the sets of natural and real

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

16

numbers, respectively, we can restate (1.10) as

x + 1 > 0. (t)

   x   n
   x   r
   n   n
   x   r
   n   n    m   n

x > 0. (f)

n > 10. (t)
x2 =    1. (f)

m > n. (t)

de   nition 1.30. a universal statement has the form

whereas an existential statement has the form

p (x),

   x   a

p (x).

(1.11a)

(1.11b)

(1.11c)

(1.11d)

(1.11e)

(1.12a)

(1.12b)

in (1.12), a denotes a set and p (x) is a sentence involving the variable x, a so-called
predicate of x, that becomes a statement (i.e. becomes either true or false) if x is substi-
tuted with any concrete element of the set a (in particular, p (x) is allowed to contain
further quanti   ers, but it must not contain any other quanti   er involving x     one says
x must be a free variable in p (x), not bound by any quanti   er in p (x)).

the universal statement (1.12a) has the truth value t if, and only if, p (x) has the truth
value t for all elements x     a; the existential statement (1.12b) has the truth value t
if, and only if, p (x) has the truth value t for at least one element x     a.
and wx   a
remark 1.31. some people prefer to write vx   a

even though this notation has the advantage of emphasizing that the universal statement
can be interpreted as a big logical conjunction and the existential statement can be
interpreted as a big logical disjunction, it is signi   cantly less common. so we will stick
to     and     in this class.
remark 1.32. according to def. 1.30, the existential statement (1.12b) is true if, and
only if, p (x) is true for at least one x     a. so if there is precisely one such x, then
(1.12b) is true; and if there are several di   erent x     a such that p (x) is true, then
(1.12b) is still true. uniqueness statements are often of particular importance, and one
sometimes writes

instead of    x   a

instead of    x   a

.

for the statement    there exists a unique x     a such that p (x) is true   . this notation
can be de   ned as an abbreviation for

(1.15c)

(1.15d)

(1.15e)

(1.15f)

remark 1.34. as for propositional calculus, we also have some important rules for
predicate calculus:

(a) consider the negation of a universal statement,       x   a

p (x), which is true if, and
only if, p (x) does not hold for each x     a, i.e. if, and only if, there exists at least
one x     a such that p (x) is false (such that   p (x) is true). we have just proved
the rule
(1.16a)

      x   a

p (x)        x   a   p (x).

similarly, consider the negation of an existential statement. we claim the corre-
sponding rule is

      x   a

p (x)        x   a   p (x).

(1.16b)

indeed, we can prove (1.16b) from (1.16a):

th. 1.11(k)

(1.16a)

p (x)

      x   a

          x   a     p (x)

            x   a   p (x)

th. 1.11(k)

   

   x   a   p (x).

(1.17)
one can interpret (1.16) as a generalization of the de morgan   s laws th. 1.11(i),(j).

one can actually generalize (1.16) even a bit more: if a statement starts with several
quanti   ers, then one negates the statement by replacing each     with     and vice versa
plus negating the predicate after the quanti   ers (see the example in (1.20e) below).

(b) if a, b are sets and p (x, y) denotes a predicate of both x and y, then    x   a    y   b

p (x, y)
and    y   b    x   a
p (x, y) both hold true if, and only if, p (x, y) holds true for each x     a
and each y     b, i.e. the order of two consecutive universal quanti   ers does not
matter:
(1.18a)

p (x, y)

   x   a    y   b

p (x, y)        y   b    x   a

in the same way, we obtain the following rule:

   x   a    y   b

p (x, y)        y   b    x   a

p (x, y).

(1.18b)

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

18

if a = b, one also uses abbreviations of the form

p (x, y)

p (x, y)

for

for

   x,y   a
   x,y   a

   x   a    y   a
   x   a    y   a

p (x, y),

p (x, y).

(1.19a)

(1.19b)

generalizing rules (1.18), we can always commute identical quanti   ers. caveat:
quanti   ers that are not identical must not be commuted (see ex. 1.35(d) below).

example 1.35. (a) negation of universal and existential statements:

negation of (1.11a) :

negation of (1.11b) :

negation of (1.11c) :

z }| {m     n . (f)

  (m>n)

(b) as a more complicated example, consider the negation of the uniqueness statement

(1.13), i.e. of (1.14):

      !

x   a

p (x)

   

(1.16b), th. 1.11(a)

   

th. 1.11(i)

   

(1.16a)

   

th. 1.11(j),(k)

   

th. 1.11(a)

   

      x   a (cid:18)p (x)        y   a(cid:0)p (y)     x = y(cid:1)(cid:19)
   x   a   (cid:18)p (x)        y   a(cid:0)  p (y)     x = y(cid:1)(cid:19)
   x   a (cid:18)  p (x)           y   a(cid:0)  p (y)     x = y(cid:1)(cid:19)
   x   a (cid:18)  p (x)        y   a  (cid:0)  p (y)     x = y(cid:1)(cid:19)
   x   a (cid:18)  p (x)        y   a(cid:0)p (y)     x 6= y(cid:1)(cid:19)
   x   a (cid:18)p (x)        y   a(cid:0)p (y)     x 6= y(cid:1)(cid:19) .

so how to decode the expression, we have obtained at the end? it states that if
p (x) holds for some x     a, then there must be at least a second, di   erent, element
y     a such that p (y) is true. this is, indeed, precisely the negation of    !
p (x).
x   a

(c) identical quanti   ers commute:

   x   r    n   n
   x   r    y   r    n   n

x2n     0        n   n    x   r
ny > x2        x   r    n   n    y   r

x2n     0,

ny > x2.

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

19

(d) the following example shows that di   erent quanti   ers do, in general, not commute

(i.e. do not yield equivalent statements when commuted): while the statement

   x   r    y   r

y > x

(1.23a)

is true (for each real number x, there is a bigger real number y, e.g. y := x + 1 will
do the job), the statement

   y   r    x   r

y > x

(1.23b)

is false (for example, since y > y is false). in particular, (1.23a) and (1.23b) are not
equivalent.

(e) even though (1.13) provides useful notation, it is better not to think of    ! as a
quanti   er. it is really just an abbreviation for (1.14), and it behaves very di   erently
from     and    : the following examples show that, in general,    ! commutes neither
with    , nor with itself:

   n   n    !
m   n

m < n 6       !

m   n    n   n

m < n

(the statement on the left is true, as one can choose n = 2, but the statement on

the right is false, as    n   n

m < n holds for every m     n). similarly,
   !
n   n    !
m   n

m < n 6       !

m   n    !
n   n

m < n

(the statement on the left is still true and the statement on the right is still false
(there is no m     n such that    !
n   n

m < n)).

remark 1.36. one can make the following observations regarding the strategy for
proving universal and existential statements:

(a) to prove that    x   a

x     a     examples are not enough!

1 foundations: mathematical logic and set theory

20

the sub   eld of mathematical logic dealing with quanti   ed statements is called predicate
calculus. in general, one does not restrict the quanti   ed variables to range only over
elements of sets (as we have done above). again, we refer to [eft07] for a deeper
treatment of the subject.

as an application of quanti   ed statements, let us generalize the notion of union and
intersection:

de   nition 1.37. let i 6=     be a nonempty set, usually called an index set in the present
context. for each i     i, let ai denote a set (some or all of the ai can be identical).
(a) the intersection

ai :=(cid:26)x :    i   i

x     ai(cid:27)

\i   i

(1.24a)

consists of all elements x that belong to every ai.

(b) the union

x     ai(cid:27)
consists of all elements x that belong to at least one ai. the union is called disjoint
if, and only if, for each i, j     i, i 6= j implies ai     aj =    .

ai :=(cid:26)x :    i   i

[i   i

(1.24b)

proposition 1.38. let i 6=     be an index set, let m denote a set, and, for each i     i,
let ai denote a set. the following set-theoretic rules hold:

(ai     m ).

(ai     m ).

(ai     m ).

(ai     m ).

(a) (cid:18)ti   i
(b) (cid:18)si   i
(c) (cid:18)ti   i
(d) (cid:18)si   i
(e) m \ ti   i
(f ) m \ si   i

ai(cid:19)     m = ti   i
ai(cid:19)     m = si   i
ai(cid:19)     m = ti   i
ai(cid:19)     m = si   i
ai = si   i
ai = ti   i

(m \ ai).

(m \ ai).

proof. we prove (c) and (e) and leave the remaining proofs as an exercise.

to justify the equivalence at (   ), we make use of th. 1.11(b) and verify     and    . for
    note that the truth of x     m implies x     ai     x     m is true for each i     i. if x     ai
is true for each i     i, then x     ai     x     m is still true for each i     i. to verify    , note
that the existence of i     i such that x     m implies the truth of x     m        i   i
x     ai.
if x     m is false for each i     i, then x     ai must be true for each i     i, showing
x     m        i   i

x     ai is true also in this case.

comparing with the notation of def. 1.37, in (1.25a), for example, we have i = r and
ai = n for each i     i (where, in (1.25a), we have written x instead of i). similarly, in
(1.25b), we have i = n and an = {1, 2, . . . , n} for each n     i.

all such pairs is called the cartesian product a    b, i.e.

a    b := {(x, y) : x     a     y     b}.

a        =        a =    ,

{1, 2}    {1, 2, 3} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)}
6= {1, 2, 3}    {1, 2} = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}.

also note that, for x 6= y,

(x, y) =(cid:8){x},{x, y}(cid:9) 6=(cid:8){y},{x, y}(cid:9) = (y, x).

de   nition 2.3. given sets a, b, a function or map f is an assignment rule that assigns
to each x     a a unique y     b. one then also writes f (x) for the element y. the set a
is called the domain of f , denoted d(f ), and b is called the range of f , denoted r(f ).
the information about a map f can be concisely summarized by the notation

f : a        b,

x 7    f (x),

(2.5)

where x 7    f (x) is called the assignment rule for f , f (x) is called the image of x, and
x is called a preimage of f (x) (the image must be unique, but there might be several
preimages). the set

(2.6)

graph(f ) :=(cid:8)(x, y)     a    b : y = f (x)(cid:9)

is called the graph of f (not to be confused with pictures visualizing the function f ,
which are also called graph of f ).
if one wants to be completely precise, then one
identi   es the function f with the ordered triple (a, b, graph(f )).
the set of all functions with domain a and range b is denoted by f(a, b) or ba, i.e.
(2.7)

f(a, b) := ba :=(cid:8)(f : a        b) : a = d(f )     b = r(f )(cid:9).

caveat: some authors reserve the word map for continuous functions, but we use func-
tion and map synonymously.
de   nition 2.4. let a, b be sets and f : a        b a function.
(a) if t is a subset of a, then

f (t ) := {f (x)     b : x     t}

is called the image of t under f .

(b) if u is a subset of b, then

is called the preimage or inverse image of u under f .

f   1(u ) := {x     a : f (x)     u}

2 functions and relations

(c) f is called injective or one-to-one if, and only if, every y     b has at most one

preimage, i.e. if, and only if, the preimage of {y} has at most one element:

f injective

(d) f is called surjective or onto if, and only if, every element of the range of f has a

preimage:

f surjective        y   b    x   a

y = f (x)        y   b

f   1{y} 6=    .

(2.11)

(e) f is called bijective if, and only if, f is injective and surjective.

example 2.5. examples of functions:

f : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},
g : n        n,
h : n        {2, 4, 6, . . .},
  h : n        {2, 4, 6, . . .},
g : n        r,
f : p(n)        p(cid:0)p(n)(cid:1),

f (x) :=    x + 6,
g(n) := 2n,
h(n) := 2n,

  h(n) :=(n

for n even,
for n odd,

g(n) := n/(n + 1),
f (a) := p(a).

(2.12e)

(2.12f)

instead of f (x) :=    x + 6 in (2.12a), one can also write x 7       x + 6 and analogously
in the other cases. also note that, in the strict sense, functions g and h are di   erent,
since their ranges are di   erent (however, using the following def. 2.4(a), they have the
same image in the sense that g(n) = h(n)). furthermore,

f ({1, 2}) = {5, 4} = f   1({1, 2}),

  h   1({2, 4, 6}) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},

(2.13)

f is bijective; g is injective, but not surjective; h is bijective;   h is surjective, but not
injective. can you    gure out if g and f are injective and/or surjective?
example 2.6. (a) for each nonempty set a, the map id : a        a, id(x) := x, is
called the identity on a. if one needs to emphasize that id operates on a, then one
also writes ida instead of id. the identity is clearly bijective.

(b) let a, b be nonempty sets. a map f : a        b is called constant if, and only if,
there exists c     b such that f (x) = c for each x     a. in that case, one also writes
f     c, which can be read as    f is identically equal to c   . if f     c,     6= t     a, and
u     b, then

f (t ) = {c},

f   1(u ) =(a for c     u ,
for c /    u .

   

(2.14)

f is injective if, and only if, a = {x}; f is surjective if, and only if, b = {c}.

(c) given a     x, the map

   : a        x,

  (x) := x,

24

(2.15)

is called inclusion (also embedding or imbedding). an inclusion is always injective;
it is surjective if, and only if a = x, i.e. if, and only if, it is the identity on a.

(d) given a     x and a map f : x        b, the map g : a        b, g(x) = f (x), is called
the restriction of f to a; f is called the extension of g to x. in this situation, one
also uses the notation f    a for g (some authors prefer the notation f|a or f|a).

there are several important rules regarding functions and set-theoretic operations. how-
ever, we will not make use of them in this class, and the interested student can    nd
them in [phi16, th. 2.7].

de   nition 2.7. the composition of maps f and g with f : a        b, g : c        d, and
f (a)     c is de   ned to be the map

g     f : a        d,

(g     f )(x) := g(cid:0)f (x)(cid:1).

the expression g     f is read as    g after f     or    g composed with f    .
example 2.8. consider the maps

f : n        r,
g : n        r,

n 7    n2,
n 7    2n.

(2.16)

(2.17a)
(2.17b)

we obtain f (n) = {1, 4, 9, . . .}     d(g), g(n) = {2, 4, 6, . . .}     d(f ), and the composi-
tions

(g     f ) : n        r,
(f     g) : n        r,

(g     f )(n) = g(n2) = 2n2,

functions have the same domain and the same range.

f (a)     c and g(c)     e.

proof. (a): both h     (g     f ) and (h     g)     f map a into f . so it just remains to prove
(cid:0)h     (g     f )(cid:1)(x) =(cid:0)(h     g)     f(cid:1)(x) for each x     a. one computes, for each x     a,

(cid:0)h     (g     f )(cid:1)(x) = h(cid:0)(g     f )(x)(cid:1) = h(cid:0)g(f (x))(cid:1) = (h     g)(f (x))

de   nition 2.10. a function g : b        a is called a right inverse (resp. left inverse)
of a function f : a        b if, and only if, f     g = idb (resp. g     f = ida). moreover,
g is called an inverse of f if, and only if, it is both a right and a left inverse. if g is
an inverse of f , then one also writes f   1 instead of g. the map f is called (right, left)
invertible if, and only if, there exists a (right, left) inverse for f .

while examples 2.11(a),(b) show that left and right inverses are usually not unique,
they are unique provided f is bijective (see th. 2.12(c)).

theorem 2.12. let a, b be nonempty sets.

(a) f : a        b is right invertible if, and only if, f is surjective.
(b) f : a        b is left invertible if, and only if, f is injective.
(c) f : a        b is invertible if, and only if, f is bijective. in this case, the right inverse

and the left inverse are unique and both identical to the inverse.

proof. (a): if f is surjective, then, for each y     b, there exists xy     f   1{y} such that
f (xy) = y. de   ne
(2.25)

g(y) := xy

g : b        a,

(note to the interested reader: the de   nition of g is, in general, not as unproblematic
as it might seem     g is a so-called choice function, and its de   nition makes use of the
axiom of choice, see [phi16, sec. a.4]). then, for each y     b, f (g(y)) = y, showing g
is a right inverse of f . conversely, if g : b        a is a right inverse of f , then, for each
y     b, it is y = f (g(y)), showing that g(y)     a is a preimage of y, i.e. f is surjective.
(b): fix a     a. if f is injective, then, for each y     b with f   1{y} 6=    , let xy denote
the unique element in a satisfying f (xy) = y. de   ne

then, for each x     a, g(f (x)) = x, showing g is a left inverse of f . conversely, if
g : b        a is a left inverse of f and x1, x2     a with f (x1) = f (x2) = y, then
x1 = (g     f )(x1) = g(f (x1)) = g(f (x2)) = (g     f )(x2) = x2, showing y has precisely one
preimage and f is injective.

the    rst part of (c) follows immediately by combining (a) and (b). it merely remains
to verify the uniqueness of right and left inverse for bijective maps. so let g be a left
inverse of f , let h be a right inverse of f , and let f   1 be an inverse of f . then, for each
y     b,

g(y) =(cid:0)g     (f     f   1)(cid:1)(y) =(cid:0)(g     f )     f   1(cid:1)(y) = f   1(y),

de   nition 2.14. (a) given an index set i and a set a, a map f : i        a is sometimes
called a family (of elements in a), and is denoted in the form f = (ai)i   i with
ai := f (i). when using this representation, one often does not even specify f and
a, especially if the ai are themselves sets.

(b) a sequence in a set a is a family of elements in a, where the index set is the set of
natural numbers n. in this case, one writes (an)n   n or (a1, a2, . . . ). more generally,
a family is called a sequence, given a bijective map between the index set i and a
subset of n.

(c) given a family of sets (ai)i   i, we de   ne the cartesian product of the ai to be the

set of functions

ai :=( f : i       [j   i

aj! :    i   i

f (i)     ai) .

example 2.15. (a) using the notion of family, we can now say that the intersection

if i has precisely n elements with n     n, then the elements of the cartesian product
qi   i ai are called (ordered) n-tuples, (ordered) triples for n = 3.
ti   i ai and unionsi   i ai as de   ned in def. 1.37 are the intersection and union of

the family of sets (ai)i   i, respectively. as a concrete example, let us revisit (1.25b),

is bijective (recall that p(a) denotes the power set of a and {0, 1}a denotes the set of
all functions from a into {0, 1}).
proof.    is injective: let b, c     p(a) with b 6= c. by possibly switching the names
of b and c, we may assume there exists x     b such that x /    c. then   b(x) = 1,
whereas   c(x) = 0, showing   (b) 6=   (c), proving    is injective.
   is surjective: let f : a        {0, 1} be an arbitrary function and de   ne b := {x     a :
f (x) = 1}. then   (b) =   b = f , proving    is surjective.
(cid:4)
proposition 2.17 allows one to identify the sets p(a) and {0, 1}a via the bijective map
  . this fact together with the common practise of set theory to identify the number 2
with the set {0, 1} (cf. rem. 1.27 above) explains the notation 2a for p(a).

2.2 relations

de   nition 2.18. given sets a and b, a relation is a subset r of a    b (if one wants
to be completely precise, a relation is an ordered triple (a, b, r), where r     a    b).
if a = b, then we call r a relation on a. one says that a     a and b     b are related
according to the relation r if, and only if, (a, b)     r. in this context, one usually writes
a r b instead of (a, b)     r.
example 2.19. (a) the relations we are probably most familiar with are = and    .
the relation r of equality, usually denoted =, makes sense on every nonempty set
a:

r :=    (a) := {(x, x)     a    a : x     a}.

(2.35)

the set    (a) is called the diagonal of the cartesian product, i.e., as a subset of
a    a, the relation of equality is identical to the diagonal:

x = y     x r y     (x, y)     r =    (a).

similarly, the relation     on r is identical to the set

r    := {(x, y)     r2 : x     y}.

(b) every function f : a        b is a relation, namely the relation

rf = {(x, y)     a    b : y = f (x)} = graph(f ).

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

conversely, if b 6=    , then every relation r     a    b uniquely corresponds to the
function
(2.39)

fr : a        p(b),

fr(x) = {y     b : x r y}.

de   nition 2.20. let r be a relation on the set a.

(a) r is called re   exive if, and only if,

i.e. if, and only if, every element is related to itself.

(b) r is called symmetric if, and only if,

x r x,

   x   a

i.e. if, and only if, each x is related to y if, and only if, y is related to x.

   x,y   a(cid:0)x r y     y r x(cid:1),

(c) r is called antisymmetric if, and only if,

   x,y   a(cid:0)(x r y     y r x)     x = y(cid:1),

i.e. if, and only if, the only possibility for x to be related to y at the same time that
y is related to x is in the case x = y.

(2.40)

(2.42)

(2.43)

2 functions and relations

(d) r is called transitive if, and only if,

   x,y,z   a(cid:0)(x r y     y r z)     x r z(cid:1),

i.e. if, and only if, the relatedness of x and y together with the relatedness of y and
z implies the relatedness of x and z.

example 2.21. the relations = and     on r (or n) are re   exive, antisymmetric, and
transitive; = is also symmetric, whereas     is not; < is antisymmetric (since x < y   y < x
is always false) and transitive, but neither re   exive nor symmetric. the relation

r :=(cid:8)(x, y)     n2 : (x, y are both even)     (x, y are both odd)(cid:9)

on n is not antisymmetric, but re   exive, symmetric, and transitive. the relation

(2.44)

s := {(x, y)     n2 : y = x2}

(2.45)

is not transitive (for example, 2 s 4 and 4 s 16, but not 2 s 16), not re   exive, not sym-
metric; it is only antisymmetric.

de   nition 2.22. a relation r on a set a is called an equivalence relation if, and only
if, r is re   exive, symmetric, and transitive. if r is an equivalence relations, then one
often writes x     y instead of x r y.
example 2.23. (a) the equality relation = is an equivalence relation on each a 6=    .
(b) the relation r de   ned in (2.44) is an equivalence relation on n.

(c) given a disjoint union a =   si   iai with every ai 6=     (which is sometimes called a

decomposition of a), an equivalence relation on a is de   ned by

x     y        i   i (cid:0)x     ai     y     ai(cid:1).

(2.46)

conversely, given an equivalence relation     on a nonempty set a, we can construct
a decomposition a =   si   iai such that (2.46) holds: for each x     a, de   ne
called the equivalence class of x; each y     [x] is called a representative of [x]. one
veri   es that the properties of     guarantee

[x] := {y     a : x     y},

(2.47)

(cid:0)[x] = [y]     x     y(cid:1)     (cid:0)[x]     [y] =           (x     y)(cid:1).

the set of all equivalence classes i := a/    := {[x] : x     a} is called the quotient set
of a by    , and a =   si   iai with ai := i for each i     i is the desired decomposition
of a.

(2.48)

de   nition 2.24. a relation r on a set a is called a partial order if, and only if, r is
re   exive, antisymmetric, and transitive. if r is a partial order, then one usually writes
x     y instead of x r y. a partial order     is called a total or linear order if, and only if,
for each x, y     a, one has x     y or y     x.

2 functions and relations

31

notation 2.25. given a (partial or total) order     on a 6=    , we write x < y if, and
only if, x     y and x 6= y, calling < the strict order corresponding to     (note that the
strict order is never a partial order).

de   nition 2.26. let     be a partial order on a 6=    ,     6= b     a.
(a) x     a is called lower (resp. upper) bound for b if, and only if, x     b (resp. b     x)
for each b     b. moreover, b is called bounded from below (resp. from above) if, and
only if, there exists a lower (resp. upper) bound for b; b is called bounded if, and
only if, it is bounded from above and from below.

(b) x     b is called minimum or just min (resp. maximum or max) of b if, and only if,
x is a lower (resp. upper) bound for b. one writes x = min b if x is minimum and
x = max b if x is maximum.

(c) a maximum of the set of lower bounds of b (i.e. a largest lower bound) is called
in   mum of b, denoted inf b; a minimum of the set of upper bounds of b (i.e. a
smallest upper bound) is called supremum of b, denoted sup b.

example 2.27. (a) for each a     r, the usual relation     de   nes a total order on a.
for a = r, we see that n has 0 and 1 as lower bound with 1 = min n = inf n. on
the other hand, n is unbounded from above. the set m := {1, 2, 3} is bounded
with min m = 1, max m = 3. the positive real numbers r+ := {x     r : x > 0}
have inf r+ = 0, but they do not have a minimum (if x > 0, then 0 < x/2 < x).

(b) consider a := n    n. then

(m1, m2)     (n1, n2)     m1     n1     m2     n2,

(2.49)

de   nes a partial order on a that is not a total order (for example, neither (1, 2)    
(2, 1) nor (2, 1)     (1, 2)). for the set

b :=(cid:8)(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)(cid:9),

(2.50)

we have inf b = min b = (1, 1), b does not have a max, but sup b = (2, 2) (if
(m, n)     a is an upper bound for b, then (2, 1)     (m, n) implies 2     m and
(1, 2)     (m, n) implies 2     n, i.e. (2, 2)     (m, n); since (2, 2) is clearly an upper
bound for b, we have proved sup b = (2, 2)).

a di   erent order on a is the so-called lexicographic order de   ned by

(m1, m2)     (n1, n2)     m1 < n1     (m1 = n1     m2     n2).

(2.51)

in contrast to the order from (2.49), the lexicographic order does de   ne a total
order on a.

lemma 2.28. let     be a partial order on a 6=    ,     6= b     a. then the relation    ,

is also a partial order on a. moreover, using obvious notation, we have, for each x     a,

x    -lower bound for b
x    -upper bound for b
x = min   b
x = max   b
x = inf   b
x = sup   b

   
   
   
   
   
   

x    -upper bound for b,
x    -lower bound for b,
x = max   b,
x = min   b,
x = sup   b,
x = inf   b.

(2.53a)

(2.53c)

(2.53e)

proof. re   exivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity of     clearly imply the same properties
for    , respectively. moreover

x     b        b   b

b     x     x    -upper bound for b,

proving (2.53a). analogously, we obtain (2.53b). next, (2.53c) and (2.53d) are implied
by (2.53a) and (2.53b), respectively. finally, (2.53e) is proved by

x = inf   b     x = max   {y     a : y    -lower bound for b}

    x = min   {y     a : y    -upper bound for b}     x = sup   b,

and (2.53f) follows analogously.

(cid:4)

proposition 2.29. let     be a partial order on a 6=    ,     6= b     a. the elements
max b, min b, sup b, inf b are all unique, provided they exist.

proof. exercise.

(cid:4)

de   nition 2.30. let a, b be nonempty sets with partial orders, both denoted by    
(even though they might be di   erent). a function f : a        b, is called (strictly)
isotone, order-preserving, or increasing if, and only if,

f is called (strictly) antitone, order-reversing, or decreasing if, and only if,

   x,y   a(cid:0)x < y     f (x)     f (y) (resp. f (x) < f (y))(cid:1);
   x,y   a(cid:0)x < y     f (x)     f (y) (resp. f (x) > f (y))(cid:1).

(2.54a)

(2.54b)

functions that are (strictly) isotone or antitone are called (strictly) monotone.

proposition 2.31. let a, b be nonempty sets with partial orders, both denoted by    .
(a) a (strictly) isotone function f : a        b becomes a (strictly) antitone function

and vice versa if precisely one of the relations     is replaced by    .

(b) if the order     on a is total and f : a        b is strictly isotone or strictly antitone,

then f is one-to-one.

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

33

(c) if the order     on a is total and f : a        b is invertible and strictly isotone (resp.

antitone), then f   1 is also strictly isotone (resp. antitone).

proof. (a) is immediate from (2.54).

(b): due to (a), it su   ces to consider the case that f is strictly isotone. if f is strictly
isotone and x 6= y, then x < y or y < x since the order on a is total. thus, f (x) < f (y)
or f (y) < f (x), i.e. f (x) 6= f (y) in every case, showing f is one-to-one.
(c): again, due to (a), it su   ces to consider the isotone case. if u, v     b such that u < v,
then u = f (f   1(u)), v = f (f   1(v)), and the isotonicity of f imply f   1(u) < f   1(v) (we
are using that the order on a is total     otherwise, f   1(u) and f   1(v) need not be
comparable).
(cid:4)
example 2.32. (a) f : n        n, f (n) := 2n, is strictly increasing, every constant map
on n is both increasing and decreasing, but not strictly increasing or decreasing.
all maps occurring in (2.24) are neither increasing nor decreasing.

(b) the map f : r        r, f (x) :=    2x, is invertible and strictly decreasing, and so is

f   1 : r        r, f   1(x) :=    x/2.

(c) the following counterexamples show that the assertions of prop. 2.31(b),(c) are no
longer correct if one does not assume the order on a is total. let a be the set from
(2.50) (where it had been called b) with the (nontotal) order from (2.49). the map

(2.55)

(2.56)

is strictly isotone, but not one-to-one. the map

f : a        n,          
      
f : a        {1, 2, 3},          
      

f (1, 1) := 1,
f (1, 2) := 2,
f (2, 1) := 2,

f (1, 1) := 1,
f (1, 2) := 2,
f (2, 1) := 3,

is strictly isotone and invertible, however f   1 is not isotone (since 2 < 3, but
f   1(2) = (1, 2) and f   1(3) = (2, 1) are not comparable, i.e. f   1(2)     f   1(3) is not
true).

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

3.1

induction and recursion

one of the most useful proof techniques is the method of induction     it is used in
situations, where one needs to verify the truth of statements   (n) for each n     n, i.e.
the truth of the statement
(3.1)

  (n).

   n   n

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

34

induction is based on the fact that n satis   es the so-called peano axioms:

p1: n contains a special element called one, denoted 1.

p2: there exists an injective map s : n        n \ {1}, called the successor function (for

each n     n, s(n) is called the successor of n).

p3: if a subset a of n has the property that 1     a and s(n)     a for each n     a, then

a is equal to n. written as a formula, the third axiom is:

   a   p(n)(cid:0)1     a     s(a)     a     a = n(cid:1).

remark 3.1. in def. 1.26, we had introduced the natural numbers n := {1, 2, 3, . . .}.
the successor function is s(n) = n + 1. in axiomatic set theory, one starts with the
peano axioms and shows that the axioms of set theory allow the construction of a
set n which satis   es the peano axioms. one then de   nes 2 := s(1), 3 := s(2), . . . ,
n + 1 := s(n). the interested reader can    nd more details in [phi16, sec. d.1].

theorem 3.2 (principle of induction). suppose, for each n     n,   (n) is a statement
(i.e. a predicate of n in the language of def. 1.30). if (a) and (b) both hold, where

(a)   (1) is true,

(b)    n   n(cid:0)  (n)       (n + 1)(cid:1),
then (3.1) is true, i.e.   (n) is true for every n     n.
proof. let a := {n     n :   (n)}. we have to show a = n. since 1     a by (a), and

n     a       (n)

(b)

      (n + 1)     s(n) = n + 1     a,

(3.2)

i.e. s(a)     a, the peano axiom p3 implies a = n.
remark 3.3. to prove some   (n) for each n     n by induction according to th. 3.2
consists of the following two steps:

(cid:4)

(a) prove   (1), the so-called base case.

(b) perform the inductive step, i.e. prove that   (n) (the induction hypothesis) implies

  (n + 1).

  (n) holds true for each n     n, i.e.   (n) holds true for each n     n.
corollary 3.6. let i be an index set. suppose, for each i     i,   (i) is a statement. if
there is a bijective map f : n        i and (a) and (b) both hold, where
(a)   (cid:0)f (1)(cid:1) is true,
(b)    n   n(cid:16)  (cid:0)f (n)(cid:1)       (cid:0)f (n + 1)(cid:1)(cid:17),

(cid:4)

then   (i) is true for every i     i.
finite induction: the above assertion remains true if f : {1, . . . , m}        i is bijective
for some m     n and n in (b) is replaced by {1, . . . , m     1}.
proof. if, for each n     n, we use   (n) to denote   (cid:0)f (n)(cid:1), then th. 3.2 shows   (n) is
true for every n     n. given i     i, we have n := f   1(i)     n with f (n) = i, showing that
  (i) =   (cid:0)f (n)(cid:1) =   (n) is true.
for the    nite induction, let   (n) denote (cid:0)n     m       (cid:0)f (n)(cid:1)(cid:1)     n > m. then, for 1    
n < m, we have   (n)       (n + 1) due to (b). for n     m, we also have   (n)       (n + 1)
due to n     m     n + 1 > m. thus, th. 3.2 shows   (n) is true for every n     n. given
i     i, it is n := f   1(i)     {1, . . . , m} with f (n) = i. since n     m       (n)       (cid:0)f (n)(cid:1), we
obtain that   (i) is true.
(cid:4)

apart from providing a widely employable proof technique, the most important ap-
plication of th. 3.2 is the possibility to de   ne sequences inductively, using so-called
recursion:

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

36

theorem 3.7 (recursion theorem). let a be a nonempty set and x     a. given a
sequence of functions (fn)n   n, where fn : an        a, there exists a unique sequence
(xn)n   n in a satisfying the following two conditions:

(i) x1 = x.
(ii)    n   n

xn+1 = fn(x1, . . . , xn).

the same holds if n is replaced by an index set i as in cor. 3.6.

proof. to prove uniqueness, let (xn)n   n and (yn)n   n be sequences in a, both satisfying
(i) and (ii), i.e.

x1 = y1 = x and

   n   n(cid:0)xn+1 = fn(x1, . . . , xn)     yn+1 = fn(y1, . . . , yn)(cid:1).

each m     {1, . . . , n}.

fn(y1, . . . , yn)

(3.6b)

(3.8)

i.e.   (n + 1) holds and the induction is complete.
to prove existence, we have to show that there is a function f : n        a such that the
following two conditions hold:

f (1) = x,

   n   n

f (n + 1) = fn(cid:0)f (1), . . . , f (n)(cid:1).

this shows a = x and proves   (1).
induction hypothesis: assume   (m) for each m     {1, . . . , n}.
induction step: from the induction hypothesis, we know

   !

(x1,...,xn)   an

(1, x1), . . . , (n, xn)     g.

thus, if we let xn+1 := fn(x1, . . . , xn), then (n + 1, xn+1)     g by the de   nition of g. if
(n + 1, a)     g with a 6= xn+1, then h := g \ {(n + 1, a)}     f (using the uniqueness of
the (1, x1), . . . , (n, xn)     g), implying g     h in contradiction to (n + 1, a) /    h. this
shows a = xn+1, proves   (n + 1), and completes the induction.
due to (3.12), we can now de   ne f : n        a, f (n) := xn, and the de   nition of g then
guarantees the validity of (3.9).
(cid:4)

example 3.8. in many applications of th. 3.7, one has functions gn : a        a and
uses
(3.13)

   n   n(cid:0)fn : an        a,

fn(a1, . . . , an) := gn(an)(cid:1).

here are some important concrete examples:

(a) the factorial function f : n0        n, n 7    n!, is de   ned recursively by

0! := 1,

1! := 1,

   n   n

(n + 1)! := (n + 1)    n!,

i.e. we have a = n and gn(x) := (n + 1)    x. so we obtain
(n!)n   n0 = (1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, . . . ).

(3.14a)

(3.14b)

(b) for each a     r and each d     r, we de   ne the following arithmetic progression (also

called arithmetic sequence) recursively by

a1 := a,

   n   n

an+1 := an + d,

(3.15a)

i.e. we have a = r and gn = g with g(x) := x + d. for example, for a = 2 and
d =    0.5, we obtain

(an)n   n = (2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0,    0.5,    1,    1.5, . . . ).

(3.15b)

(c) for each a     r and each q     r \ {0}, we de   ne the following geometric progression

(also called geometric sequence) recursively by

x1 := a,

   n   n

xn+1 := xn    q,

(3.16a)

i.e. we have a = r and gn = g with g(x) := x    q. for example, for a = 3 and
q =    2, we obtain
(3.16b)

(xn)n   n = (3,    6, 12,    24, 48, . . . ).

for the time being, we will continue to always specify a and the gn or fn in subsequent
recursive de   nitions, but in the literature, most of the time, the gn or fn are not provided
explicitly.

example 3.9. (a) the fibonacci sequence consists of the fibonacci numbers, de   ned

recursively by

f0 := 0, f1 := 1,

   n   n

fn+1 := fn + fn   1,

i.e. we have a = n0 and

fn : an        a,

fn(a1, . . . , an) :=(1

an + an   1

for n = 1,
for n     2.

so we obtain

(3.17a)

(3.17b)

(fn)n   n0 = (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, . . . ).

(3.17c)

(b) for a := n, x := 1, and

fn : an        a,

fn(a1, . . . , an) := a1 +        + an,

(3.18a)

one obtains

x1 = 1,

x2 = f1(1) = 1,

x3 = f2(1, 1) = 2,

x4 = f3(1, 1, 2) = 4,

x5 = f4(1, 1, 2, 4) = 8,

x6 = f5(1, 1, 2, 4, 8) = 16,

in (3.19a), one can also use other symbols for i, except a and n; for a    nite sequence,
n needs to be less than the maximal index of the    nite sequence.

(b) product symbol: on a = r (or, more generally, on every set where a multiplication

for q = 1, the sum sn is actually arithmetic with d = 0, i.e. sn = na can be

3.2 cardinality: the size of sets

cardinality measures the size of sets. for a    nite set a, it is precisely the number of
elements in a. for an in   nite set, it classi   es the set   s degree or level of in   nity (it turns
out that not all in   nite sets have the same size).

de   nition 3.12. (a) the sets a, b are de   ned to have the same cardinality or the
same size if, and only if, there exists a bijective map    : a        b. one can show
that this de   nes an equivalence relation on every set of sets (see [phi16, th. a.53]).

(b) the cardinality of a set a is n     n (denoted #a = n) if, and only if, there exists
a bijective map    : a        {1, . . . , n}. the cardinality of     is de   ned as 0, i.e.
#    := 0. a set a is called    nite if, and only if, there exists n     n0 such that
#a = n; a is called in   nite if, and only if, a is not    nite, denoted #a =     (in the
strict sense, this is an abuse of notation, since     is not a cardinality     for example
#n =     and #p(n) =    , but n and p(n) do not have the same cardinality, since
the power set p(a) is always strictly bigger than a (see th. 3.20 below)     #a =    
is merely an abbreviation for the statement    a is in   nite   ). the interested student
   nds additional material regarding the uniqueness of    nite cardinality in [phi16,
th. a.61] and [phi16, cor. a.62], and regarding characterizations of in   nite sets in
[phi16, th. a.54].

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

41

(c) the set a is called countable if, and only if, a is    nite or a has the same cardinality

as n. otherwise, a is called uncountable.

theorem 3.13. let a 6=     be a    nite set.
(a) if b     a with a 6= b, then b is    nite with #b < #a.
(b) if a     a, then #(cid:0)a \ {a}(cid:1) = #a     1.
proof. for #a = n     n, we use induction to prove (a) and (b) simultaneously, i.e. we
show
   n   n (cid:18)#a = n    

#b     {0, . . . , n     1}     #(cid:0)a \ {a}(cid:1) = n     1(cid:19)
}

base case (n = 1): in this case, a has precisely one element, i.e. b = a \ {a} =    , and
#    = 0 = n     1 proves   (1).
induction step: for the induction hypothesis, we assume   (n) to be true, i.e. we assume
(a) and (b) hold for each a with #a = n. we have to prove   (n + 1), i.e., we consider
a with #a = n + 1. from #a = n + 1, we conclude the existence of a bijective map    :
a        {1, . . . , n + 1}. we have to construct a bijective map    : a \ {a}        {1, . . . , n}.
to this end, set k :=   (a) and de   ne the auxiliary function

n + 1
k
x

for x = k,
for x = n + 1,
for x /    {k, n + 1}.

then f        : a        {1, . . . , n + 1} is bijective by th. 2.13, and
(f       )(a) = f (  (a)) = f (k) = n + 1.

thus, the restriction    := (f       )    a\{a} is the desired bijective map    : a \ {a}       
{1, . . . , n}, proving #(cid:0)a \ {a}(cid:1) = n. it remains to consider the strict subset b of a.
since b is a strict subset of a, there exists a     a \ b. thus, b     a \ {a} and, as
we have already shown #(cid:0)a \ {a}(cid:1) = n, the induction hypothesis applies and yields b
is    nite with #b     #(cid:0)a \ {a}(cid:1) = n, i.e. #b     {0, . . . , n}, proving   (n + 1), thereby
theorem 3.14. for #a = #b = n     n and f : a        b, the following statements
are equivalent:

completing the induction.

(cid:4)

(i) f is injective.

(ii) f is surjective.

(iii) f is bijective.

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

42

proof. it su   ces to prove the equivalence of (i) and (ii).
if f is injective, then f : a        f (a) is bijective. since #a = n, there exists a bijective
map    : a        {1, . . . , n}. then (       f   1) : f (a)        {1, . . . , n} is also bijective,
showing #f (a) = n, i.e., according to th. 3.13(a), f (a) can not be a strict subset of
b, i.e. f (a) = b, proving f is surjective.
if f is surjective, then f has a right inverse g : b        a by th. 2.12(a), i.e. f     g = idb.
but this also means f is a left inverse for g, such that g must be injective by th. 2.12(b).
according to what we have already proved above, g injective implies g surjective, i.e.
g must be bijective. from th. 2.12(c), we then know the left inverse of g is unique,
implying f = g   1. in particular, f is injective.
(cid:4)

lemma 3.15. for each    nite set a (i.e. #a = n     n0) and each b     a, one has
#(a \ b) = #a     #b.
proof. for b =    , the assertion is true since #(a \ b) = #a = #a     0 = #a     #b.
for b 6=    , the proof is conducted over the size of b, i.e. as a    nite induction (cf. cor.
3.6) over the set {1, . . . , n}, showing

base case (m = 1):   (1) is precisely the statement provided by th. 3.13(b).
induction step: for the induction hypothesis, we assume   (m) with 1     m < n. to
prove   (m + 1), consider b     a with #b = m + 1. fix an element b     b and set
b1 := b \ {b}. then #b1 = m by th. 3.13(b), a \ b = (a \ b1) \ {b}, and we compute

#(a \ b) = #(cid:0)(a \ b1) \ {b}(cid:1) th. 3.13(b)

= #a     #b,

=

#(a \ b1)     1(cid:0)  (m)(cid:1)= #a     #b1     1

proving   (m + 1) and completing the induction.

(cid:4)

theorem 3.16. if a, b are    nite sets, then #(a     b) = #a + #b     #(a     b).
proof. the assertion is clearly true if a or b is empty. if a and b are nonempty, then
there exist m, n     n such that #a = m and #b = n, i.e. there are bijective maps
f : a        {1, . . . , m} and g : b        {1, . . . , n}.
we    rst consider the case a   b =    . we need to construct a bijective map h : a   b       
{1, . . . , m + n}. to this end, we de   ne

h : a     b        {1, . . . , m + n},

h(x) :=(f (x)

for x     a,
g(x) + m for x     b.

the bijectivity of f and g clearly implies the bijectivity of h, proving #(a     b) =
m + n = #a + #b.

43

finally, we consider the case of arbitrary a, b. since a     b = a      (b \ a) and b \ a =
b \ (a     b), we can compute

#(a     b) = #(cid:0)a      (b \ a)(cid:1) = #a + #(b \ a)

thereby establishing the case.

proof. if at least one ai is empty, then (3.25) is true, since both sides are 0.

base case (n = 1): q1
induction step: from the induction hypothesis   (n), we obtain a bijective map    :
i=1 ai and n :=qn
a        {1, . . . , n}, where a :=qn
i=1 ki. to prove   (n + 1), we need
to construct a bijective map h : a    an+1        {1, . . . , n    kn+1}. since #an+1 = kn+1,
there exists a bijective map f : an+1        {1, . . . , kn+1}. we de   ne
h : a    an+1        {1, . . . , n    kn+1},
h(a1, . . . , an, an+1) :=(cid:0)f (an+1)     1(cid:1)    n +   (a1, . . . , an).

since    and f are bijective, and since every m     {1, . . . , n    kn+1} has a unique rep-
resentation in the form m = a    n + r with a     {0, . . . , kn+1     1} and r     {1, . . . , n}
(exercise), h is also bijective. this proves   (n + 1) and completes the induction.
(cid:4)
theorem 3.18. for each    nite set a (i.e. #a = n     n0), one has #p(a) = 2n.

base case (n = 0): for n = 0, we have a =    , i.e. p(a) = {   }. thus, #p(a) = 1 = 20,
proving   (0).

induction step: assume   (n) and consider a with #a = n + 1. then a contains
at least one element a. for b := a \ {a}, we then know #b = n from th. 3.13(b).

3 natural numbers, induction, and the size of sets

44

moreover, setting m := (cid:8)c     {a} : c     p(b)(cid:9), we have the disjoint decomposition
p(a) = p(b)      m. as the map    : p(b)        m,   (c) := c    {a}, is clearly bijective,
p(b) and m have the same cardinality. thus,

#p(a) th. 3.16= #p(b) + #m = #p(b) + #p(b)(cid:0)  (n)(cid:1)= 2    2n = 2n+1,

thereby proving   (n + 1) and completing the induction.

(cid:4)

remark 3.19. in the proof of the following th. 3.20, we will encounter a new proof
technique that we did not use before, the so-called proof by contradiction, also called
indirect proof. it is based on the observation, called the principle of contradiction, that
a       a is always false:

a   a a       a
t f
f t

f
f

(3.26)

thus, one possibility of proving a statement b to be true is to show   b     a       a for
some arbitrary statement a. since the right-hand side of the implication is false, the
left-hand side must also be false, proving b is true.

theorem 3.20. let a be a set. there can never exist a surjective map from a onto
p(a) (in this sense, the size of p(a) is always strictly bigger than the size of a; in
particular, a and p(a) can never have the same size).
proof. if a =    , then there is nothing to prove. for nonempty a, as mentioned above,
the idea is to conduct a proof by contradiction. to this end, assume there does exist a
surjective map f : a        p(a) and de   ne

b := {x     a : x /    f (x)}.

(3.27)

now b is a subset of a, i.e. b     p(a) and the assumption that f is surjective implies
the existence of a     a such that f (a) = b. if a     b, then a /    f (a) = b, i.e. a     b
implies a     b       (a     b), so that the principle of contradiction tells us a /    b must be
true. however, a /    b implies a     f (a) = b, i.e., this time, the principle of contradiction
tells us a     b must be true. in conclusion, we have shown our original assumption that
there exists a surjective map f : a        p(a) implies a     b       (a     b), i.e., according
to the principle of contradiction, no surjective map from a into p(a) can exist.
(cid:4)
we conclude the section with a number of important results regarding the natural
numbers and countability.

element from b. then c := b \ {b} has cardinality n and, according to the induction
hypothesis, there exists c     c satisfying c = min c. if c     b, then c     x for each x     b,
proving c = min b. if b     c, then b     x for each x     b, proving b = min b. in each
case, b has a min, proving   (n + 1) and completing the induction.
(b): let     6= a     n. we have to show a has a min. if a is    nite, then a has a min by (a).
if a is in   nite, let n be an element from a. then the    nite set b := {k     a : k     n}
must have a min m by (a). since m     x for each x     b and m     n < x for each
x     a \ b, we have m = min a.
(cid:4)
proposition 3.22. every subset a of n is countable.

proof. since     is countable, we may assume a 6=    . from th. 3.21(b), we know that
every nonempty subset of n has a min. we recursively de   ne a sequence in a by

a1 := min a,

an+1 :=(min an

an

if an := a \ {ai : 1     i     n} 6=    ,
if an =    .

this sequence is the same as the function f : n        a, f (n) = an. an easy induction
shows that, for each n     n, an 6= an+1 implies the restriction f    {1,...,n+1} is injective.
thus, if there exists n     n such that an = an+1, then f    {1,...,k}: {1, . . . , k}        a is
bijective, where k := min{n     n : an = an+1}, showing a is    nite, i.e. countable. if
there does not exist n     n with an = an+1, then f is injective. another easy induction
shows that, for each n     n, f ({1, . . . , n})     {k     a : k     n}, showing f is also
surjective, proving a is countable.
(cid:4)
proposition 3.23. for each set a 6=    , the following three statements are equivalent:
(i) a is countable.

(ii) there exists an injective map f : a        n.
(iii) there exists a surjective map g : n        a.
proof. directly from the de   nition of countable in def. 3.12(c), one obtains (i)   (ii) and
(i)   (iii). to prove (ii)   (i), let f : a        n be injective. then f : a        f (a) is
bijective, and, since f (a)     n, f (a) is countable by prop. 3.22, proving a is countable
as well. to prove (iii)   (i), let g : n        a be surjective. according to th. 2.12(a), g
has a right inverse f : a        n, i.e. g     f = ida. but this means g is a left inverse for f ,
showing f is injective according to th. 2.12(b). then a is countable by an application
of (ii).

theorem 3.24. if (a1, . . . , an), n     n, is a    nite family of countable sets, thenqn

is countable.

i=1 ai

proof. we    rst consider the special case n = 2 with a1 = a2 = n and show the map

   : n    n        n,   (m, n) := 2m    3n,

is injective: if   (m, n) =   (p, q), then 2m    3n = 2p    3q. moreover m     p or p     m.
if m     p, then 3n = 2p   m    3q. since 3n is odd, 2p   m    3q must also be odd, implying
p     m = 0, i.e. m = p. moreover, we now have 3n = 3q, implying n = q, showing
(m, n) = (p, q), i.e.    is injective.

we now come back to the general case stated in the theorem. if at least one of the ai is
empty, then a is empty. so it remains to consider the case, where all ai are nonempty.
the proof is conducted by induction by showing

base case (n = 1):   (1) is merely the hypothesis that a1 is countable.

induction step: assuming   (n), prop. 3.23(ii) provides injective maps f1 : qn
n and f2 : an+1        n. to prove   (n+1), we provide an injective map h : qn+1
h(a1, . . . , an, an+1) :=   (cid:0)f1(a1, . . . , an), f2(an+1)(cid:1).

the injectivity of f1, f2, and    clearly implies the injectivity of h, thereby proving
  (n + 1) and completing the induction.
(cid:4)
theorem 3.25. if (ai)i   i is a countable family of countable sets (i.e.     6= i is countable
and each ai, i     i, is countable), then the union a :=si   i ai is also countable.
proof. it su   ces to consider the case that all ai are nonempty. moreover, according to
prop. 3.23(iii), it su   ces to construct a surjective map    : n        a. also according
to prop. 3.23(iii), the countability of i and the ai provides us with surjective maps
f : n        i and gi : n        ai. de   ne

f : n    n        a, f (m, n) := gf (m)(n).

then f is surjective: given x     a, there exists i     i such that x     ai. since f is
surjective, there is m     n satisfying f (m) = i. moreover, since gi is surjective, there
exists n     n with gi(n) = x. then f (m, n) = gi(n) = x, verifying that f is surjective.
as n   n is countable by th. 3.24, there exists a surjective map h : n        n   n. thus,
f     h is the desired surjective map from n onto a. note: the axiom of choice (ac,
see [phi16, sec. a.4]) is used when choosing each gi from the set of all surjective maps
from n onto ai. it has actually been shown that it is impossible to prove the theorem
without using ac (cf. [phi16, rem. 3.18]).

4.1 the real numbers as a complete totally ordered field

the set of real numbers, denoted r, is a set with special properties, namely a so-called
complete totally ordered    eld. we already know what totally ordered means, but we still
need to explain what a    eld is, what an ordered    eld is, and what it means for a total
order to be complete. we begin with the last part.

de   nition 4.1. a total order     on a nonempty set a is called complete if, and only if,
every nonempty subset b of a that is bounded from above has a supremum, i.e.

b   p(a)\{   } (cid:18)(cid:18)    x   a    b   b

   

b     x(cid:19)        s   a

s = sup b(cid:19) .

(4.1)

lemma 4.2. a total order     on a nonempty set a is complete if, and only if, every
nonempty subset b of a that is bounded from below has an in   mum.

proof. according to lem. 2.28, it su   ces to prove one implication. we show that (4.1)
implies that every nonempty b bounded from below has an in   mum: de   ne

c := {x     a : x is lower bound for b}.

(4.2)

then every b     b is an upper bound for c and (4.1) implies there exists s = sup c     a.
to verify s = inf b, it remains to show s     c, i.e. that s is a lower bound for b.
however, every b     b is an upper bound for c and s = sup c is the min of all upper
bounds for c, i.e. s     b for each b     b, showing s     c.
(cid:4)
de   nition 4.3. let a be a nonempty set with a map

    : a    a        a,

(x, y) 7    x     y

(4.3)

(called a composition on a, the examples we have in mind are addition and multiplication
on r). then a is called a group with respect to     if, and only if, the following three
conditions are satis   ed:

(i) associativity: x     (y     z) = (x     y)     z holds for all x, y, z     a.
(ii) there exists a neutral element e     a, i.e. an element e     a such that

   x   a

x     e = x.

(iii) for each x     a, there exists an inverse element x     a, i.e. an element x     a such

that

x     x = e.

a is called a commutative or abelian group if, and only if, it is a group and satis   es the
additional condition:

4 real numbers

(iv) commutativity: x     y = y     x holds for all x, y     a.
de   nition 4.4. let a be a nonempty set with two maps

+ : a    a        a,
   : a    a        a,

(x, y) 7    x + y,
(x, y) 7    x    y

48

(4.4)

(+ is called addition and    is called multiplication; often one writes xy instead of x    y).
then a is called a    eld if, and only if, the following three conditions are satis   ed:

(i) a is a commutative group with respect to +. the neutral element with respect

to + is denoted 0.

(ii) a\{0} is a commutative group with respect to   . the neutral element with respect

to    is denoted 1.

(iii) distributivity:

   x,y,z   a

x    (y + z) = x    y + x    z.

(4.5)

if a is a    eld and     is a total order on a, then a is called a totally ordered    eld if, and
only if, the following condition is satis   ed:

(iv) compatibility with addition and multiplication:

   x,y,z   a(cid:0)x     y     x + z     y + z(cid:1),
   x,y   a(cid:0)0     x     0     y     0     xy(cid:1).

(4.6a)

(4.6b)

finally, a is called a complete totally ordered    eld if, and only if, a is a totally ordered
   eld that is complete in the sense of def. 4.1.

theorem 4.5. there exists a complete totally ordered    eld r (it is called the set of
real numbers). moreover, r is unique up to isomorphism, i.e. if a is a complete totally
ordered    eld, then there exists an isomorphism    : a        r, i.e. a bijective map    :
a        r, satisfying

  (x + y) =   (x) +   (y),

   x,y   a

  (xy) =   (x)  (y),

   x,y   a
   x,y   a(cid:0)x < y       (x) <   (y)(cid:1).

it also turns out that the isomorphism is unique.

(4.7a)

(4.7b)

(4.7c)

proof. to really prove the existence of the real numbers by providing a construction
is tedious and not easy. one possible construction is provided in [phi16, sec. d] (the
existence proof is completed in [phi16, th. d.41], the results regarding the isomorphism
can be found in [phi16, th. d.45]).

theorem 4.6. the following statements and rules are valid in the set of real numbers
r (and, more generally, in every    eld):

(a) inverse elements are unique. for each x     r, the unique inverse with respect to
addition is denoted by    x. also de   ne y    x := y + (   x). for each x     r\{0}, the
unique inverse with respect to multiplication is denoted by x   1. for x 6= 0, de   ne
the fractions y

x := y/x := yx   1 with numerator y and denominator x.

(b)    (   x) = x and (x   1)   1 = x for x 6= 0.
(c) (   x) + (   y) =    (x + y) and x   1y   1 = (xy)   1 for x, y 6= 0.
(d) x + a = y + a     x = y and, for a 6= 0, xa = ya     x = y.
(e) x    0 = 0.
(f ) x(   y) =    (xy).
(g) (   x)(   y) = xy.
(h) x(y     z) = xy     xz.
(i) xy = 0     x = 0     y = 0.
(j) rules for fractions:

=

ab

where all denominators are assumed 6= 0.

proof. (a): let a, b be additive inverses to x. then a = a + 0 = a + x + b = 0 + b = b.
the multiplicative case is proved completely analogously.
(b):    x + x = 0 already shows that x is the inverse to    x, i.e.    (   x) = x. the
multiplicative case is proved completely analogously.
(c): x + y + (   x) + (   y) = x     x + y     y = 0, showing (   x) + (   y) is the inverse to
(x + y). the multiplicative case is proved completely analogously.
(d): if x + a = y + a, then x = x + a     a = y + a     a = y. again, the multiplicative
case is proved completely analogously.

(e): one computes

x    0 + x    1

(4.5)

= x    (0 + 1) = x    1 = 0 + x    1,

i.e. x    0 = 0 follows from (d).
(f): xy + x(   y) = x(y     y) = x    0 = 0, where we used (4.5) and (e). this shows x(   y)
is the additive inverse to xy.

(g): xy =    (   (xy)) =    (x(   y)) =    ((   y)x) = (   y)(   x), where (f) was used twice.
(h): x(y     z) = x(y + (   z)) = xy + x(   z) = xy     xz.
(i): if xy = 0 and x 6= 0, then y = 1    y = x   1xy = x   1    0 = 0.

(cid:4)

theorem 4.7. the following statements and rules are valid in the set of real numbers
r (and, more generally, in every totally ordered    eld):

(a) x     y        x        y.
(b) x     y     z     0     xz     yz holds as well as x     y     z     0     xz     yz.
(c) x 6= 0     x2 := x    x > 0. in particular 1 > 0.
(d) x > 0     1/x > 0, whereas x < 0     1/x < 0.
(e) if 0 < x < y, then x/y < 1, y/x > 1, and 1/x > 1/y.

(f ) x < y     u < v     x + u < y + v.
(g) 0 < x < y     0 < u < v     xu < yv.
(h) x < y     0 <    < 1     x <   x + (1       )y < y. in particular x < x+y
proof. (a): using (4.6a): x     y     0     y     x        y        x.
(b): one argues, for z     0,

2 < y.

x     y     0     y     x

(4.6b)

    0     (y     x)z = yz     xz     xz     yz,

x     y     0     y     x

    0     (y     x)(   z) = xz     yz     xz     yz.
(c): from (4.6b), one obtains x2     0. from th. 4.6(i), one then gets x2 > 0.
(d): if x > 0, then x   1 < 0 implies the false statement 1 = xx   1 < 0, i.e. x   1 > 0. the
case x < 0 is treated analogously.

4 real numbers

51

(e): using (d), we obtain from 0 < x < y that x/y = xy   1 < yy   1 = 1 and 1 = xx   1 <
yx   1 = y/x.
(f): x < y     x + u < y + u and u < v     y + u < y + v; both combined yield
x + u < y + v.
(g): 0 < x < y     0 < u < v     xu < yu     yu < yv     xu < yv.
(h): since 0 <    and 1        > 0, x < y implies

  x <   y     (1       )x < (1       )y.

using (4.6a), we obtain

x =   x + (1       )x <   x + (1       )y <   y + (1       )y = y,

completing the proof of the theorem.

theorem 4.8. let     6= a, b     r,        r, and de   ne

a + b := {a + b : a     a     b     b},

  a := {  a : a     a}.

if a and b are bounded, then

sup(a + b) = sup a + sup b,
inf(a + b) = inf a + inf b,

sup(  a) =(      sup a for        0,
      inf a for    < 0,
inf(  a) =(      inf a for        0,

remark 4.9. we would like to recover the natural numbers n as a subset of r. indeed,
if we start with 1 as the neutral element of multiplication and de   ne 2 := 1+1, 3 := 2+1,
. . . , then n := {1, 2, . . .} is a subset of r, satisfying the peano axioms p1, p2, p3 of sec.
3.1. however, if one does actually construct r according to the axioms of axiomatic
set theory, then one starts by constructing n    rst (basically as we did in rem. 1.27
and def. 1.26), constructing r from n in several steps (cf. [phi16, sec. d]). depending
on the construction used, the original set of natural numbers will typically not be the
same set as the natural numbers as a subset of r. however, both sets will satisfy the
peano axioms and you will have a canonical bijection between the two sets. which
one you consider the    genuine    set of natural numbers depends on your personal taste

4 real numbers

52

and philosophy and is completely irrelevant. any two models of n will always produce
equivalent results, since they must both satisfy the three peano axioms.

   

we now introduce a zoo of important subsets of r together with corresponding notation:

n := {1, 2, 3, . . .}
n0 := n     {0},

proof. we conduct the proof by contradiction: suppose x is an upper bound for the set
a := {n    : n     n}. since the order     on r is complete, according to (4.1), there exists
s     r such that s = sup a. in particular, s        is not an upper bound for a, i.e. there
exists n     n satisfying n    > s      . but then (n + 1)    > s in contradiction to s = sup a.
this shows x is not an upper bound for a, thereby establishing the case.

5.1 de   nition and basic arithmetic

according to th. 4.7(c), x2     0 holds for every real number x     r, i.e. the equation
x2 + 1 = 0 has no solution in r. this de   ciency of the real numbers motivates the
e   ort to try to extend the    eld of real numbers to a larger    eld c, the so-called complex
numbers. the two requirements that c is to be a    eld containing r and that there is to
be some complex number i     c satisfying i2 =    1 already dictates the following laws
of addition and multiplication for complex numbers z = x + iy and w = u + iv with
x, y, u, v     r:

z + w = x + iy + u + iv = x + u + i(y + v),

zw = (x + iy)(u + iv) = xu     yv + i(xv + yu).

moreover, if x + iy = u + iv, then (x     u)2 =    (v     y)2, i.e. x     u = 0 = v     y,
implying x = u and y = v. this suggests to try de   ning complex numbers as pairs of
real numbers. indeed, this works:

de   nition 5.1. we de   ne the set of complex numbers c := r    r, where, keeping in
mind (5.1), addition on c is de   ned by

and multiplication on c is de   ned by

+ : c    c        c,

   : c    c        c,

(cid:0)(x, y), (u, v)(cid:1) 7    (x, y) + (u, v) := (x + u, y + v),
(cid:0)(x, y), (u, v)(cid:1) 7    (x, y)    (u, v) := (xu     yv, xv + yu).

theorem 5.2. (a) the set of complex numbers c with addition and multiplication as
de   ned in def. 5.1 forms a    eld, where (0, 0) and (1, 0) are the neutral elements
with respect to addition and multiplication, respectively,

is the additive inverse to z = (x, y), whereas

(b) de   ning subtraction and division in the usual way, for each z, w     c, by w     z :=
w + (   z), and w/z := wz   1 for z 6= (0, 0), respectively, all the rules stated in th.
4.6 are valid in c.

(c) the map

is a monomorphism, i.e. it is injective and satis   es

   : r        c,

  (x) := (x, 0),

  (x + y) =   (x) +   (y),

(5.5)

(5.6a)

(5.6b)

it is customary to identify r with   (r), as it usually does not cause any confusion.
one then just writes x instead of (x, 0).

proof. all computations required for (a) and (c) are straightforward and are left as
an exercise; (b) is a consequence of (a), since th. 4.6 and its proof are valid in every
   eld.
(cid:4)

notation 5.3. the number i := (0, 1) is called the imaginary unit (note that, indeed,
i2 = i   i = (0, 1)   (0, 1) = (0   0    1   1, 0   1 + 1   0) = (   1, 0) =    1). using i, one obtains
the commonly used representation of a complex number z = (x, y)     c:

z = (x, y) = x    (1, 0) + y    (0, 1) = x + iy,

(5.7)

where one calls re z := x the real part of z and im z := y the imaginary part of z.
moreover, z is called purely imaginary if, and only if, re z = 0 (as a consequence of this
convention, one has the (harid113ss) pathology that 0 is both real and purely imaginary).

remark 5.4. there does not exist a total order     on c that makes c into a totally
ordered    eld (i.e. no total order on c can be compatible with addition and multiplication
in the sense of (4.6)): indeed, if there were such a total order     on c, then all the rules
of th. 4.7 had to be valid with respect to that total order    . in particular, 0 < 12 = 1
and 0 < i2 =    1 had to be valid by th. 4.7(c), and, then, 0 < 1 + (   1) = 0 had to
be valid by th. 4.7(f). however, 0 < 0 is false, showing that there is no total order on
c that satis   es (4.6). caveat: of course, there do exist total orders on c, just none
compatible with addition and multiplication     for example, the lexicographic order on
r    r (de   ned as it was in (2.51) for n    n) constitutes a total order on c.
de   nition and remark 5.5. conjugation: for each complex number z = x + iy, we
de   ne its complex conjugate or just conjugate to be the complex number   z := x     iy.
we then have the following rules that hold for each z = x + iy, w = u + iv     c:
(a) z + w = x+u   iy   iv =   z+   w and zw = xu   yv   (xv+yu)i = (x   iy)(u   iv) =   z   w.
(b) z +   z = 2x = 2 re z and z       z = 2yi = 2i im z.
(c) z =   z     x + iy = x     iy     y = 0     z     r.

and for z 6= 0:

z   n := (z   1)n.

(5.8)

theorem 5.7. exponentiation rules: let z, w     c. for z, w 6= 0, the following rules
hold for every m, n     z; otherwise they hold for each m, n     n0:
(a) zm+n = zm    zn.
(b) znwn = (zw)n.

(c) (zm)n = zm n.

proof. (a): first, we prove the statement for each m     n0 by induction: the base case
(m = 0) is zn = zn, which is true. for the induction step, we compute

zm+1+n (5.8)

= z    zm+n ind. hyp.

= z    zm    zn (5.8)

= zm+1zn,

completing the induction step. the above prove allows n < 0 for z 6= 0. interchanging
m and n covers the case m < 0 and n     0. if m < 0 and n < 0, then
= (z   1)   m   n = (z   1)   m    (z   1)   n (5.8)

zm+n = z   (   m   n) (5.8)

= zm    zn.

(b): for n     n0, the statement is proved by induction: the base case (n = 0) is
z0w0 = 1 = (zw)0, which is true. for the induction step, we compute

zn+1wn+1 (5.8)

= z    zn    w    wn ind. hyp.

= zw    (zw)n (5.8)

= (zw)n+1,

completing the induction step. for n < 0 and z 6= 0:

znwn (5.8)

= (z   1)   n(w   1)   n = (z   1w   1)   n th. 4.6(c)

= (cid:0)(zw)   1(cid:1)   n (5.8)

= (zw)n.

(c): first, we prove the statement for each n     n0 by induction: the base case (n = 0)
is (zm)0 = 1 = z0, which is true. for the induction step, we compute

(zm)n+1 (5.8)

= zm    (zm)n ind. hyp.

= zm    zm n (a)

= zm n+m = zm (n+1),

completing the induction step. from (a), we also have (zm)   1 = z   m for z 6= 0. thus,
for n < 0 and z 6= 0:

(zm)n (5.8)

= (cid:0)(zm)   1(cid:1)   n

thereby completing the proof.

= (z   m)   n = z(   m)(   n) = zm n,

5.2 sign and absolute value (modulus)

we face a certain conundrum regarding the handling of square roots. the problem
is that we will need the notion of a continuous function to prove the existence of a
unique square root    x for every nonnegative real number x and, in consequence, we
will have to wait until section 7.2.5 below to carry out this proof. on the other hand, it
is extremely desirable to present the theory of convergence simultaneously for real and
for complex numbers, which requires the notion of the absolute value or modulus of a
complex number, to be de   ned in def. 5.9(b) below as the square root of a nonnegative
real number.

faced with this di   culty, we will introduce the notion of square root now, assuming the
existence, until we can add the proof in section 7.2.5. some students might be worried
that this might lead to a circular argument, where our later proof of the existence of
square roots would somehow make use of our previous assumption of that existence. of
course, we will be careful not to make such a circular (and, thereby, logically invalid)
argument. the point is that for real numbers the notion of absolute value does in no
way depend on the notion of a square root (see lem. 5.10 below).
de   nition and remark 5.8. we de   ne a nonnegative real number y     r+
0 to be the
square root of the nonnegative real number x     r+
0 if, and only if, y2 = x. if y is the
square root of x, then one uses the notation    x := y. we will see in rem. and def.
7.61 that every x     r+
0        r+
0 ,
f (x) :=    x, is strictly increasing (in particular, injective).
de   nition 5.9. (a) the sign function is de   ned by

0 has a unique square root and that the function f : r+

sgn : r        r,

sgn(x) :=         
      

1
0
   1

for x > 0,
for x = 0,
for x < 0.

(5.9)

it is emphasized that the sign function is only de   ned for real numbers (cf. rem.
5.4)!

(b) the absolute value or modulus function is de   ned by

abs : c        r+
0 ,

(5.10)
where the term absolute value is often preferred for real numbers z     r and the
term modulus is often preferred if one also considers complex numbers z /    r.

z = x + iy 7    |z| :=    z   z =px2 + y2,

lemma 5.10. for each x     r, one has

|x| = x    sgn(x) =(x

for x     0,
   x for x < 0.

(d) max{| re z|,| im z|}     |z|     | re z| + | im z|.

(cid:12)(cid:12)|z|     |w|(cid:12)(cid:12)     |z     w|.

proof. we carry out the proofs for z, w     c. however, for z, w     r, everything can
easily be shown directly from (5.11), without making use of square roots.
let z = x + iy with x, y     r.
(a): if z 6= 0, then x 6= 0 or y 6= 0, i.e. x2 > 0 or y2 > 0 by th. 4.7(c), implying
x2 + y2 > 0 by th. 4.7(f), i.e. |z| =px2 + y2 > 0.
(b): since a := |z|     r+
(c): since   z = x     iy, we have |  z| =px2 + (   y)2 =px2 + y2 = |z|.
(d): it is x = re z, y = im z. let a := max{|x|,|y|}. as remarked in def. and rem.
5.8, the square root function is increasing and, thus, taking square roots in the chain of
inequalities a2     x2 + y2     (|x| + |y|)2 implies a     |z|     |x| + |y| as claimed.
(e): as remarked in def. and rem. 5.8, the square root function is injective, and, thus,
(e) follows from

0 , we have |a| =    a2 = a = |z|.

|zw|2 = zw zw

def. and rem. 5.5(a)

=

zw  z   w = z   z w   w = |z|2 |w|2.

(f): let w = u + iv with u, v     r. we    rst consider the special case z = 1. applying
the formula (5.4b) for the inverse to w, one obtains

|w   1|2 =

u2

(u2 + v2)2 +

(u2 + v2)2 =

u2 + v2 =(cid:0)|w|   1(cid:1)2

i.e. |w   1| = |w|   1. now (f) follows from (e): | z

once again using that the square root function is increasing.

(h): using (g), we obtain

|z| = |z     w + w|     |z     w| + |w|     |z|     |w|     |z     w|,
|w| = |w     z + z|     |z     w| + |z|        (|z|     |w|)     |z     w|,

implying(cid:12)(cid:12)|z|     |w|(cid:12)(cid:12)     |z     w| by (5.11) (notice |z|     |w|     r).

remark 5.12. each complex number (x, y) = x + iy can be visualized as a point in
the so-called complex plane, where the horizontal x-axis represents real numbers and
the veritcal y-axis represents purely imaginary numbers. then the addition of complex
numbers is precisely the vector addition of 2-dimensional vectors in the complex plane,
and conjugation is represented by re   ection through the x-axis. moreover, the modulus
|z| of a complex number is precisely its distance from the origin (0, 0), and |z     w|
is the distance between the points z = (x, y) and w = (u, v) in the plane. complex
multiplication can also be interpreted geometrically in the plane: if    denotes the angle
that the vector representing z = (x, y) forms with the x-axis, and, likewise,    denotes
the angle that the vector representing w = (u, v) forms with the x-axis, then zw is
the vector of length |zw| that forms the angle    +    with the x-axis (we will better
understand this geometrical interpretation of complex multiplication later (see def. and
rem. 8.29), when writing complex numbers in the polar form z = x + iy = |z| exp(i  ),
making use of the exponential function exp).

5.3 sums and products

here we compile some important rules involving sums and products of complex numbers
(the exceptions are the estimates in th. 5.13(d),(e) below, which actually require real
numbers):

(c) and leave the other cases as exercises. for (c), the base case (n = 0) is provided by
the true statement w0+1     z0+1 = w     z = (w     z)z0 w0   0. for the induction step, one

by adding the corresponding entries in row n to the left and to the right of the considered
entry in row n + 1. the    rst and last entry of each row are always set to 1. this can

6.1 arithmetic of k-valued functions

notation 6.1. we will write k in situations, where we allow k to be r or c.

notation 6.2. if a is any nonempty set, then one can add and multiply arbitrary
functions f, g : a        k, and one can de   ne several further operations to create new
functions from f and g:

(f + g) : a        k,
(  f ) : a        k,
(f g) : a        k,
(f /g) : a        k,
re f : a        r,
im f : a        r,

(f + g)(x) := f (x) + g(x),

(  f )(x) :=   f (x)
(f g)(x) := f (x)g(x),
(f /g)(x) := f (x)/g(x)
(re f )(x) := re(f (x)),
(im f )(x) := im(f (x)).

for each        k,

(assuming g(x) 6= 0),

for k = r, we further de   ne

max(f, g) : a        r, max(f, g)(x) := max(cid:8)f (x), g(x)(cid:9),
min(f, g)(x) := min(cid:8)f (x), g(x)(cid:9),
min(f, g) : a        r,
f + : a        r,
f    : a        r,

f + := max(f, 0),
f    := max(   f, 0).

finally, once again also allowing k = c,

|f| : a        r,

|f|(x) := |f (x)|.

6.2 polynomials

64

de   nition 6.3. let n     n. each function from k into k, x 7    xn, is called a monomial.
a function p from k into k is called a polynomial if, and only if, it is a linear combination
of monomials, i.e. if, and only if p has the form

n

xj=0

p : k        k, p (x) =

ajxj = a0 + a1x +        + anxn,

aj     k.

(6.2)

the aj are called the coe   cients of p . the largest number d     n such that ad 6= 0 is
called the degree of p , denoted deg(p ). if all coe   cients are 0, then p is called the zero
polynomial; the degree of the zero polynomial is de   ned as    1 (in th. 6.6(b) below, we
will see that each polynomial of degree n     n0 is uniquely determined by its coe   cients
a0, . . . , an and vice versa).
polynomials of degree     0 are constant. polynomials of degree     1 have the form
p (x) = a + bx and are called a   ne functions (often they are also called linear functions,
even though this is not really correct for a 6= 0, since every function p that is linear (in
the sense of id202) must satisfy p (0) = 0). polynomials of degree     2 have the
form p (x) = a + bx + cx2 and are called quadratic functions.
each        k such that p (  ) = 0 is called a zero or a root of p .
a rational function is a quotient p/q of two polynomials p and q.
remark 6.4. let        k and let p, q be polynomials. then   p , p +q, and p q de   ned
according to not. 6.2 are polynomials as well. more precisely, if    = 0 or p     0, then
  p = 0; if p     0, then p + q = q; if q     0, then p + q = p ; if p     0 or q     0, then
p q = 0. if    6= 0 and

which completes the induction step. there is a notational issue in the second and third
line in of the above computation, since, in both lines, the bm+1 in the    rst sum is the
actual bm+1 from q, but bm+1 = 0 in the second sum in both lines, which is due to the
induction hypothesis being applied for m < m+1. this is actually used when combining
both sums in the last step, computing, for m + 1     j     m + n: aj   m   1bm+1 xj + aj   m   1   
0   xj = aj   m   1bm+1 xj. for j = m + n + 1, one haspm+n+1
akbm+n+1   k = anbm+1, since
bm+n+1   k = 0 for n > k and ak = 0 for k > n.
finally, deg(p q) = m + n follows from cm+n = ambn 6= 0.

polynomial q with deg(q) = n     1 such that

p (x) = p (  ) + (x       ) q(x).

theorem 6.6. (a) if p is a polynomial with n := deg(p )     0, then p has at most n

zeros.

(b) let p, q be polynomials as in (6.3) with n = m, deg(p )     n, and deg(q)     n. if
p (xj) = q(xj) at n + 1 distinct points x0, x1, . . . , xn     k, then aj = bj for each
j     {0, . . . , n}.
consequence 1: if p, q with degree     n agree at n + 1 distinct points, then p = q.
consequence 2: if we know p = q, then they agree everywhere, in particular at
max{deg(p ), deg(q)} + 1 distinct points, which implies they have the same coe   -
cients.

proof. (a): for n = 0, p is constant, but not the zero polynomial, i.e. p     a0 6= 0 with
no zeros as claimed. for n     n, the proof is conducted by induction. the base case
(n = 1) is provided by the observation that deg(p ) = 1 implies p is the a   ne function
with p (x) = a0 + a1x, a1 6= 0, i.e. p has precisely one zero at    =    a0/a1. for the
induction step, assume deg(p ) = n + 1. if p has no zeros, then the assertion of (a)
holds true. otherwise, p has at least one zero        k, and, according to th. 6.5(b),
there exists a polynomial q such that deg(q) = n and

p (x) = (x       ) q(x).

(6.10)

from the induction hypothesis, we gather that q has at most n zeros, i.e. (6.10) implies
p has at most n + 1 zeros, which completes the induction.

(b): if p (xj) = q(xj) at n + 1 distinct points xj, then each of these points is a zero of
p     q. thus p     q is a polynomial of degree     n with at least n + 1 zeros. then (a)
implies deg(p     q) =    1, i.e. p     q is the zero polynomial, i.e. aj     bj = 0 for each
j     {0, . . . , n}.

remark 6.7. let p be a polynomial with n := deg(p )     0. according to th. 6.6(a), p
has at most n zeros. using th. 6.5(b) for an induction shows there exists k     {0, . . . , n}
and a polynomial q of degree n     k such that

p (x) = q(x)

(x       j) = (x       1)(x       2)       (x       k)q(x),

where q does not have any zeros in k and {  1, . . . ,   k} = {       k : p (  ) = 0} is the set
of zeros of p . it can of course happen that p does not have any zeros and p = q (no
  j exist). it can also occur that some of the   j in (6.11a) are identical. thus, we can
rewrite (6.11a) as

where   1, . . . ,   l, l     {0, . . . , k}, are the distinct zeros of p , and mj     n withpl

7 limits and convergence in the real and complex

numbers

7.1 sequences

recall from def. 2.14(b) that a sequence in k is a function f : n        k, in this context
usually denoted as f = (zn)n   n or (z1, z2, . . . ) with zn := f (n). sometimes the sequence
also has the form (zn)n   i, where i 6=     is a countable index set (e.g. i = n0) di   erent
from n (in the context of convergence (see the following def. 7.1), i must be n or it
must have the same cardinality as n, i.e.    nite i are not permissible).
de   nition 7.1. the sequence (zn)n   n in k is said to be convergent with limit z     k if,
and only if, for each    > 0, there exists an index n     n such that |zn     z| <    for every
index n > n . the notation for (zn)n   n converging to z is limn       zn = z or zn     z for
n        . thus, by de   nition,

lim
n      

zn = z             r+    n   n    n>n |zn     z| <   .

(7.1)

the sequence (zn)n   n in k is called divergent if, and only if, it is not convergent.
example 7.2. (a) for every constant sequence (zn)n   n = (a)n   n with a     k, one has
limn       zn = limn       a = a: since, for each n     n, |zn     a| = |a     a| = 0, one can
choose n = 1 for each    > 0.

(b) limn      

1

n+a = 0 for each a     c: here zn := 1/(n + a) (if n =    a, then set zn := w
with w     c arbitrary). given    > 0, choose an arbitrary n     n with n          1 +|a|.
then, for each n     n , we compute |n + a| = |n     (   a)|     |n     |a|| = n     |a| >
n     |a|          1, and, thus, |zn| = |n + a|   1 <    as desired.

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

68

(c) ((   1)n)n   n is not convergent: we have zn = 1 for each even n and zn =    1 for each
odd n. thus, for each z 6= 1 and each even n, |zn     z| = |1    z| > |1    z|/2 =:    > 0,
i.e. z is not a limit of (zn)n   n. however, z = 1 is also not a limit of the sequence,
since, for each odd n, |zn     1| = |     1     1| = 2 > 1 =:    > 0, proving that the
sequence has no limit.

theorem 7.3. (a) let (zn)n   n be a sequence in c. then (zn)n   n is convergent in c
if, and only if, both (re zn)n   n and (im zn)n   n are convergent in r. moreover, in
that case,

lim
n      

zn = z     lim
n      

re zn = re z     lim
n      

im zn = im z.

(7.2)

(b) let (xn)n   n be a sequence in r and z     c. then

lim
n      

xn = z     z     r.

(7.3)

proof. (a): suppose (zn)n   n converges to z     c. then, given    > 0, there exists n     n
such that, for each n > n , |zn     z| <   . in consequence, for each n > n ,

| re zn     re z| = | re(zn     z)|

th. 5.11(d)

   

|zn     z| <   ,

(7.4)

proving limn       re zn = re z. the proof of limn       im zn = im z is completely anal-
ogous. conversely, suppose there are x, y     r such that limn       re zn = x and
limn       im zn = y. here we encounter, for the    rst time, what is sometimes called an   /2
argument: given    > 0, there exists n     n such that, for each n > n , | re zn    x| <   /2
and | im zn     y| <   /2, implying, for each n > n ,

|zn     (x + iy)| = | re zn + i im zn     (x + iy)|

    | re zn     x| + |i|| im zn     y| <   /2 +   /2 =   ,

proving limn       zn = x + iy.
(b) is a direct consequence of (a).

(b) according to th. 7.3(a) and ex. 7.2(c), the sequence ( 1

n + (   1)n i)n   n is divergent.

another important example relies on the following inequality:

proposition 7.5 (bernoulli   s inequality). for each n     n0 and each x     [   1,   [, we
have

proof. for n = 0, (7.6) reads 1     1, for n = 1, (7.6) reads 1 + x     1 + x, for n = 2,
(7.6) reads (1 + x)2 = 1 + 2x + x2     1 + 2x, all three statements being trivially true, in
the case n = 2 with strict inequality for x 6= 0. we now proceed by induction for n     2.

for q = 0, there is nothing to prove. for 0 < |q| < 1, it is |q|   1 > 1, i.e. h := |q|   1   1 > 0.
thus, for each    > 0 and n     1/(  h), we obtain

open interval with center z and length 2  ). more generally, a set u     k is called
a neighborhood of z if, and only if, there exists    > 0 with b  (z)     u (so, for
example, for    > 0, b  (z) is always a neighborhood of z, whereas r and [z       ,   [
are neighborhoods of z for k = r, but not for k = c ([z       ,   [ not even being
de   ned for z /    r); the sets {z}, {w     k : re w     re z}, {w     k : re w     re z +  }
are never neighborhoods of z).

(b) if   (n) is a statement for each n     n, then   (n) is said to be true for almost all
n     n if, and only if, there exists a    nite subset a     n such that   (n) is true for
each n     n \ a, i.e. if, and only if,   (n) is always true, with the possible exception
of    nitely many cases.

remark 7.8. in the language of def. 7.7, the sequence (zn)n   n converges to z if, and
only if, every neighborhood of z contains almost all zn.

de   nition 7.9. the sequence (zn)n   n in k is called bounded if, and only if, the set
{|zn| : n     n} is bounded in the sense of def. 2.26(a).
proposition 7.10. let (zn)n   n be a sequence in k.

(a) limits are unique, that means if z, w     k such that limn       zn = z and limn       zn =

w, then z = w.

(b) if (zn)n   n is convergent, then it is bounded.

proof. (a): exercise.
(b): if limn       zn = z, then a := {|zn| : |zn     z|     1}     {|z1|} is nonempty and    nite.
according to th. 3.21(a), a has an upper bound m . then max{m,|z| + 1} is an upper
bound for {|zn| : n     n}, and 0 is always a lower bound, showing that the sequence is
bounded.

proposition 7.11. let (zn)n   n be a sequence in c with limn       zn = 0.
(a) if (bn)n   n is a sequences in c such that there exists c     r+ with |bn|     c|zn| for

almost all n, then limn       bn = 0.

(b) if (cn)n   n is a bounded sequence in c, then limn      (cnzn) = 0.

proof. (a): given    > 0, there exists n     n such that |zn| <   /c and |bn|     c|zn| for
each n > n . then, for each n > n , |bn|     c|zn| <   , proving limn       bn = 0.
(b): if (cn)n   n is bounded, then there exists c     r+ such that |cn|     c for each n     n.
thus, |cnzn|     c|zn| for each n     n, implying limn      (cnzn) = 0 via (a).

(7.11a): for    = 0, there is nothing to prove. for    6= 0 and    > 0, there exists n     n

that m2 is an upper bound for {|wn| : n     n}. moreover, given    > 0, there exists
n     n such that, for each n > n , |zn     z| <   /(2m2) and |wn     w| <   /(2m1), implying

such that, for each n > n , |wn     w| <   |w|2/2 and |wn     w| < |w|/2 (since w 6= 0 for

   n>n (cid:12)(cid:12)|zn|     |z|(cid:12)(cid:12)     |zn     z| <   .

(7.11f): write zn = xn + iyn and z = x + iy with xn, yn, x, y     r, n     n. then we know

the proofs for the two identities of (b) are left as exercises.

(c): proceeding by contraposition, assume x > y and set s := (x+y)/2. then y < s < x

theorem 7.19. suppose s := (xn)n   n is a monotone sequence in r (increasing or
decreasing). de   ning a := {xn : n     n}, the following holds:

xn =               
            

if s is increasing and not bounded,

sup a if s is increasing and bounded,
   
inf a if s is decreasing and bounded,
       if s is decreasing and not bounded.

(7.21)

proof. we treat the increasing case; the decreasing case is proved completely analo-
gously. if a is bounded and    > 0, let k := sup a       ; if a is unbounded, then let
k     r be arbitrary. in both cases, since k can not be an upper bound, there exists
n     n such that xn > k. since the sequence is increasing, for each n > n , xn     xn,
showing | sup a     xn| <    in the bounded case, and xn > k in the unbounded case. (cid:4)

(7.22)

it is sometimes necessary to consider so-called subsequences and reorderings of a given
sequence. here, we are interested in sequences in r or c, but for subsequences and
reorderings it is irrelevant in which set a the sequence takes its values. as it presents
virtually no extra di   culty to introduce the notions for general sequences, and since we
will need to consider sequences with values in sets other than r or c in calculus ii, we
admit general sequences in the following de   nition.
de   nition 7.21. let a be an arbitrary nonempty set. consider a sequence    : n       
a. given a function    : n        n (that means (  (n))n   n constitutes a sequence of
indices), the new sequence (         ) : n        a is called a subsequence of    if, and
only if,    is strictly increasing (i.e. 1       (1) <   (2) < . . . ). moreover,           is
called a reordering of    if, and only if,    is bijective. one can write    in the form
(zn)n   n by setting zn :=   (n), and one can write           in the form (wn)n   n by setting
wn := (         )(n) = z  (n). especially for a subsequence of (zn)n   n, it is also common
to write (znk)k   n. this notation corresponds to the one above if one lets nk :=   (k).
analogous de   nitions work if the index set n of    is replaced by a general countable
nonempty index set i.

example 7.22. consider the sequence (1, 2, 3, . . . ). then (2, 4, 6, . . . ) constitutes a
subsequence and (2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, . . . ) constitutes a reordering. using the notation of def.
7.21, the original sequence is given by    : n        n,   (n) := n; the subsequence
is selected via   1 : n        n,   1(n) := 2n; and the reordering is accomplished via
  2 : n        n,   2(n) :=(n + 1

if n is odd,
if n is even.

subsequence and every reordering of (zn)n   n is also convergent with limit z.

if limn       zn = z, then every

proof. let (wn)n   n be a subsequence of of (zn)n   n, i.e. there is a strictly increasing
function    : n        n such that wn = z  (n). if limn       zn = z, then, given    > 0, there
is n     n such that zn     b  (z) for each n > n . for   n choose any number from n that
is     n and in   (n). take m :=      1(   n ) (where      1 :   (n)        n). then, for each
n > m , one has   (n) >   n     n , and, thus, wn = z  (n)     b  (z), showing limn       wn = z.
let (wn)n   n be a reordering of (zn)n   n, i.e. there is a bijective function    : n        n
such that wn = z  (n). let    and n be as before. de   ne

m := max{     1(n) : n     n}.

(7.23)

as    is bijective, it is   (n) > n for each n > m . then, for each n > m , one has
wn = z  (n)     b  (z), showing limn       wn = z.
(cid:4)
de   nition 7.24. let (zn)n   n be a sequence in k. a point z     k is called a cluster
point or an accumulation point of the sequence if, and only if, for each    > 0, b  (z)
contains in   nitely many members of the sequence (i.e. #{n     n : zn     b  (z)} =    ).
example 7.25. the sequence ((   1)n)n   n has cluster points 1 and    1.
proposition 7.26. a point z     k is a cluster point of the sequence (zn)n   n in k if,
and only if, the sequence has a subsequence converging to z.

proof. if (wn)n   n is a subsequence of (zn)n   n, limn       wn = z, then every b  (z),    > 0,
contains in   nitely many wn, i.e. in   nitely many zn, i.e. z is a cluster point of (zn)n   n.
conversely, if z is a cluster point of (zn)n   n, then, inductively, de   ne    : n        n as
follows: for   (1), choose the index k of any point zk in b1(z) (such a point exists, since
z is a cluster point of the sequence). now assume that n > 1 and that   (m) have already
been de   ned for each m < n. let m := max{  (m) : m < n}. since b 1
(z) contains
in   nitely many zk, there must be some zk     b 1
(z) such that k > m . choose this k as
  (n). thus, by construction,    is strictly increasing, i.e. (wn)n   n with wn := z  (n) is a
subsequence of (zn)n   n. moreover, for each    > 0, there is n     n such that 1/n <   .
then, for each n > n , wn     b 1
(cid:4)
theorem 7.27 (bolzano-weierstrass). every bounded sequence s := (xn)n   n in k
has at least one cluster point in k. moreover, for k = r, the set a := {x     r :
x is cluster point of s} has a max x        r and a min x        r, i.e. every bounded sequence
in r has a largest and a smallest cluster point. in addition, for each    > 0, the inequality
x           < xn < x    +    holds for almost all n.

conducted completely analogous. let m, m     r be a lower and an upper bound for s,
respectively. then m     a   , showing a    6=    ; and m is a lower bound for a   . since a   
is bounded from below, a := inf a        r by the completeness of r. moreover, for each
   > 0, a        /    a   , as a is a lower bound for a   , i.e. xn > a        holds for in   nitely many
n     n. on the other hand, a +   /2     a    follows from a being the largest lower bound
of a   , i.e. xn > a +   /2 holds for only    nitely many n (if any). in particular, we have
shown xn < a +    holds for almost all n, and a        < xn < a +    must hold for in   nitely
many n, showing a is a cluster point of s. to see that a is the largest cluster point of
s (i.e. a = max a), we have to show that x > a implies x is not a cluster point of s.
however, letting    := x     a > 0, we had seen above that xn > a +   /2 holds for only
   nitely many n, i.e. b  /2(x) contains only    nitely many xn, showing x is not a cluster
point of s.
it now remains to consider the complex case, i.e. a bounded sequence s := (zn)n   n in c.
for each n     n, let zn = xn+iyn with xn, yn     r. due to th. 5.11(d), we have |xn|     |zn|
and |yn|     |zn|, i.e. the boundedness of s implies the boundedness of both (xn)n   n and
(yn)n   n. then we know that (xn)n   n has a cluster point x and, by prop. 7.26, s
has a subsequence (znj )j   n such that x = limj       xnj . as the subsequence (ynj )j   n is
still bounded, it must have a cluster point y and a subsequence (ynjk
)k   n such that
= x + iy =: z,
y = limk       ynjk
as well, we now have limk       znjk
i.e. s has a subsequence converging to z. according to prop. 7.26, z is a cluster point
of s.
(cid:4)
de   nition 7.28. a sequence (zn)n   n in c is de   ned to be a cauchy sequence if, and
only if, for each        r+, there exists n     n such that |zn     zm| <    for each n, m > n ,

sequence.

2 =   , establishing that (zn)n   n is a cauchy sequence.

proof. suppose the sequence is convergent with limn       zn = z. then, given    > 0,
there is n     n such that zn     b   
(z) for each n > n . if n, m > n , then |zn     zm|    
|zn     z| + |z     zm| <   
conversely, suppose the sequence is a cauchy sequence. using similar reasoning as in
the proof of prop. 7.10(b), we    rst show the sequence is bounded. if the sequence is
cauchy, then there exists n     n such that |zn     zm| < 1 for all n, m > n . thus, the
set a := {|zn| : |zn     zn +1|     1}     {|z1|}     r+
0 is nonempty and    nite. according to
th. 3.21(a), a has an upper bound m . then max{m,|zn +1| + 1} is an upper bound for
{|zn| : n     n}, showing that the sequence is bounded. from th. 7.27, we obtain that
the sequence has a cluster point z. it remains to show limn       zn = z. given    > 0,
choose n     n such that |zn     zm| <   /2 for all n, m > n . since z is a cluster point,
there exists k > n such that |zk     z| <   /2. thus,

   n>n |zn     z|     |zn     zk| + |zk     z| <

proving limn       zn = z.

7.2 continuity

7.2.1 de   nitions and first examples

roughly, a function is continuous if a small change in its input results in a small change
of its output. for functions de   ned on an interval, the notion of continuity makes
precise the idea of a function having no jump     no discontinuity     at some point x in
its domain. for example, we would say the sign function of (5.9) has precisely one
jump     one discontinuity     at x = 0, whereas quadratic functions (or, more generally,
polynomials) do not have any jumps     they are continuous.
de   nition 7.31. let m     c. if        m , then a function f : m        k is said to be
continuous in    if, and only if, for each    > 0, there is    > 0 such that the distance
between the values f (z) and f (  ) is less than   , provided the distance between z and   
is less than   , i.e. if, and only if,

        r+         r+    z   m (cid:0)|z       | <        |f (z)     f (  )| <   (cid:1).

(7.30)

moreover, f is called continuous if, and only if, f is continuous in every        m . the set of
all continuous functions from f : m        k is denoted by c(m, k), c(m ) := c(m, r).
example 7.32. (a) every constant map f : m        k,     6= m     c, is continuous: in
this case, given   , we can choose any    > 0 we want, say    := 42: if   , z     m , then
|f (  )     f (z)| = 0 <   , which holds independently of   , in particular, if |       z| <   .

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

77

(b) every a   ne function f : k        k, f (z) := az + b is continuous: for a = 0, this

follows from (a). for a 6= 0, given    > 0, choose    :=   /|a|. then,

|z       | <    =

     ,z   k

=   

= |a||z       | < |a|

  
|a|

.

(7.31)

   
      

(c) the sign function of (5.9) is not continuous: it is continuous in each        r\{0}, but
not continuous in 0: if    6= 0, then, given    > 0, choose    := |  |. if |x      | <   , then
sgn(x) = sgn(  ), i.e. | sgn(x)     sgn(  )| = 0 <   , proving continuity in   . however,
at 0, for    := 1/2, we have

     >0(cid:12)(cid:12) sgn(0)     sgn(  /2)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |0     1| = 1 >

showing sgn is not continuous in 0.

(7.32)

some subtleties arise from the possibility that f can be de   ned on subsets of c with
very di   erent properties. the notions introduced in def. 7.33 help to deal with these
subtleties.

de   nition 7.33. let m     c.
(a) the point z     c is called a cluster point or accumulation point of m if, and only if,
each   -neighborhood of z,        r+, contains in   nitely many points of m , i.e. if, and
only if,
(7.33)

        r+

#(m     b  (z)) =    .

note: a cluster point of m is not necessarily in m .

(b) the point z is called an isolated point of m if, and only if, there is        r+ such

that b  (z)     m = {z}. note: an isolated point of m is always in m .

proposition 7.34. if m     c, then each point of m is either a cluster point or an
isolated point of m , i.e.

m = {z     m : z cluster point of m}      {z     m : z isolated point of m}.

(7.34)

proof. consider z     m that is not a cluster point of m . we have to show that z is an
isolated point of m . since z is not a cluster point of m , there exists      > 0 such that
a := (m     b    (z)) \ {z} is    nite. de   ne

   :=(min{|a     z| : a     a} if a 6=    ,
if a =    .

    

(7.35)

then b  (z)    m = {z}, showing z is an isolated point of m . finally, the union in (7.34)
is clearly disjoint.
(cid:4)

lemma 7.35. let m     c, f : m        k. if    is an isolated point of m , then f is
always continuous in   .

proof. independently of the concrete de   nition of f , we know there is    > 0 such that
b  (  )     m = {  }. in other words, if z     m with |z       | <   , then z =   , implying
|f (z)     f (  )| = 0 <    for each    > 0, showing f to be continuous in   .
(cid:4)
example 7.36. (a) the sign function restricted to the set m :=]      ,   1]   {0}   [1,   [,

i.e.

sgn(x) =         
      

1
0
   1

for x     [1,   [,
for x = 0,
for x    ]        ,   1]

is continuous: as in ex. 7.32(c), one sees that sgn is continuous in each        m \{0}.
however, now it is also continuous in 0, since 0 is an isolated point of m .

(b) every function f : n        k is continuous, since every n     n is an isolated point of

n (due to {n} = n     b 1

2

(n)).

7.2.2 continuity, sequences, and function arithmetic

to make available the power of the results on convergent sequences from sec. 7.1 to
investigations regarding the continuity of functions, we need to understand the relation-
ship between both notions. the core of this relationship is the contents of the following
th. 7.37, which provides a criterion allowing one to test continuity in terms of convergent
sequences:

theorem 7.37. let m     c, f : m        k. if        m , then f is continuous in    if, and
only if, for each sequence (zn)n   n in m with limn       zn =   , the sequence (f (zn))n   n
converges to f (  ), i.e.

lim
n      

zn =        lim
n      

f (zn) = f (  ).

(7.36)

proof. if        m is an isolated point of m , then there is    > 0 such that m   b  (  ) = {  }.
then every f : m        k is continuous in    according to lem. 7.35. on the other hand,
every sequence in m converging to    must be    nally constant and equal to   , i.e. (7.36)
is trivially valid at   . thus, the assertion of the theorem holds if        m is an isolated
point of m .
if        m is not an isolated point of m , then    is a cluster point of m according to prop.
7.34. so, for the remainder of the proof, let        m be a cluster point of m . assume
that f is continuous in    and (zn)n   n is a sequence in m with limn       zn =   . for each
   > 0, there is    > 0 such that z     m and |z       | <    implies |f (z)     f (  )| <   . since
limn       zn =   , there is also n     n such that, for each n > n , |zn       | <   . thus,
for each n > n , |f (zn)     f (  )| <   , proving limn       f (zn) = f (  ). conversely, assume
that f is not continuous in   . we have to construct a sequence (zn)n   n in m with

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

79

limn       zn =   , but (f (zn))n   n does not converge to f (  ). since f is not continuous
in   , there must be some   0 > 0 such that, for each 1/n, n     n, there is at least one
zn     m satisfying |zn       | < 1/n and |f (zn)     f (  )|       0. then (zn)n   n is a sequence in
m with limn       zn =    and (f (zn))n   n does not converge to f (  ).
(cid:4)

we can now apply the rules of th. 7.13 to see that all the arithmetic operations de   ned
in not. 6.2 preserve continuity:

theorem 7.38. let m     c, f, g : m        k,        k,        m . if f, g are both continuous
in   , then   f , f + g, f g, f /g for g 6= 0, |f|, re f , and im f are all continuous in   . if
k = r, then max(f, g), min(f, g), f + and f   , are also all continuous in   .

proof. let (zn)n   n be a sequence in m such that limn       zn =   . then the continuity
of f and g in    yields limn       f (zn) = f (  ) and limn       g(zn) = g(  ). then

(7.11d)

(7.11e)

(7.2)

(7.2)

   
   
   
   
   
   
   

if f, g are both r-valued, then we also have

(  f )(zn) = (  f )(  ),

(f + g)(zn) = (f + g)(  ),

(f g)(zn) = (f g)(  ),

(f /g)(zn) = (f /g)(  ),
n      |f|(zn) = |f|(  ),
(re f )(zn) = (re f )(  ),

lim

(im f )(zn) = (im f )(  ).

lim
n

max(f, g)(zn) = max(f, g)(  ),

min(f, g)(zn) = min(f, g)(  ),

lim
n      
lim
n      

and,    nally, the continuity of f + and f    follows from the continuity of max(f, g). (cid:4)

corollary 7.39. a function f : m        c, m     c, is continuous in        m if, and
only if, both re f and im f are continuous in   .

proof. if f is continuous in   , then re f and im f are both continuous in    by th. 7.38.
if re f and im f are both continuous in   , then, as

f is continuous in   , once again, by th. 7.38.

f = re f + i im f,

(7.37)

(cid:4)

example 7.40. (a) the continuity of the absolute value function z 7    |z| on k can be
concluded directly from (7.11e) and, alternatively, from combining the continuity
of f : k        k, f (z) = z, according to ex. 7.32(b), with the continuity of |f|
according to th. 7.38.

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

(b) every polynomial p : k        k, p (x) = pn

j=0 ajxj, aj     k, is continuous: first
note that every monomial x 7    xj is continuous on k by (7.11g). then th. 7.38
implies the continuity of x 7    ajxj on k. now the continuity of p follows from
(7.16a) or, alternatively, by an induction from the f + g part of th. 7.38.

(c) let p, q : k        k, be polynomials and let a := q   1{0} the set of all zeros of
q (if any). then the rational function (p/q) : k \ a        k is continuous as a
consequence of (b) plus the f /g part of th. 7.38.

theorem 7.41. let df , dg     c, f : df        c, g : dg        k, f (df )     dg. if f
is continuous in        df and g is continuous in f (  )     dg, then g     f : df        k is
continuous in   . in consequence, if f and g are both continuous, then the composition
g     f is also continuous.
proof. let        df and assume f is continuous in    and g is continuous in f (  ). if (zn)n   n
is a sequence in df such that limn       zn =   , then the continuity of f in    implies that
limn       f (zn) = f (  ). then the continuity of g in f (  ) implies limn       g(f (zn)) =
g(f (  )), thereby establishing the continuity of g     f in   .
(cid:4)

7.2.3 bounded, closed, and compact sets

subsets a of c (and even subsets of r) can be extremely complicated. if the set a has
one or more of the benign properties de   ned in the following, then this can often be
exploited in some useful way (we will see an important example in th. 7.54 below).
de   nition 7.42. consider a     c.
(a) a is called bounded if, and only if, a =     or the set {|z| : z     a} is bounded in r

in the sense of def. 2.26(a), i.e. if, and only if,

   m   r+

a     bm (0).

(b) a is called closed if, and only if, every sequence in a that converges in c has its

limit in a (note that     is, thus, closed).

(c) a is called compact if, and only if, a is both closed and bounded.
example 7.43. (a) clearly,     and sets containing single points {z}, z     c are com-
pact. the sets c and r are simple examples of closed sets that are not bounded.

(b) let a, b     r, a < b. each bounded interval ]a, b[, ]a, b], [a, b[, [a, b] is, indeed,
bounded (by m := max{|a|,|b|}).
if (xn)n   n is a sequence in [a, b], converging
to x     r, then th. 7.13(c) shows a     x     b, i.e. x     [a, b] and [a, b] is, indeed,
closed. analogously, one sees that the unbounded intervals [a,   [ and ]       , a] are
also closed. on the other hand, open and half-open intervals are not closed: for
su   ciently large n, the convergent sequence (b     1
n )n   n is in [a, b[, but limn      (b    
n) = b /    [a, b[, and the other cases are treated analogously.
in particular, only
intervals of the form [a, b] (and trivial intervals) are compact.

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

81

(c) for each    > 0 and each z     c, the set b  (z) is bounded (since b  (z)     b  +|z|(0)
by the triangle inequality), but not closed (since, for su   ciently large n     n,
(z +        1
n )n   n is a sequence in b  (z), converging to z +    /    b  (z)). in particular,
b  (z) is not compact.

proposition 7.44. (a) finite unions of bounded (resp. closed, resp. compact) sets are
bounded (resp. closed, resp. compact), i.e. if a1, . . . , an     c, n     n, are bounded
(resp. closed, resp. compact), then a :=sn
j=1 aj is also bounded (resp. closed, resp.
compact).
(b) arbitrary (i.e.    nite or in   nite) intersections of bounded (resp. closed, resp. com-
pact) sets are bounded (resp. closed, resp. compact), i.e. if i 6=     is an arbitrary
index set and, for each j     i, aj     c is bounded (resp. closed, resp. compact), then
a :=tj   i aj is also bounded (resp. closed, resp. compact).

proof. (a): exercise.
(b): fix j0     i. if all aj, j     i, are bounded, then, in particular, there is m     r+ such
that aj0     bm (0). thus, a =tj   i aj     aj0     bm (0) shows a is also bounded. if all
aj, j     i, are closed and (an)n   n is a sequence in a that converges to some z     c, then
(an)n   n is a sequence in each aj, j     i, and, since each aj is closed, z     aj for each
j     i, i.e. z     a =tj   i aj. if all aj, j     i, are compact, then they are all closed and
bounded and, thus, a is closed and bounded, i.e. a is compact.
(cid:4)
(b) n = sn   n{n} shows that in   nite unions of compact sets can be unbounded, and

example 7.45. (a) according to prop. 7.44(a), all    nite subsets of c are compact.

n] shows that in   nite unions of compact sets are not always

n , 1     1

]0, 1[= sn   n[ 1

closed.

many more examples of closed sets can be obtained as preimages of closed sets under
continuous maps according to the following remark:

remark 7.46. in calculus ii, it will be shown in the more general context of maps f
between metric spaces that a map f is continuous if, and only if, all preimages f   1(a)
under f of closed sets a are closed. here, we will only prove the following special case:

f : c        k continuous and a     k closed     f   1(a)     c closed.

(7.38)
indeed, suppose f is continuous and a     k is closed. if (zn)n   n is a sequence in f   1(a)
with limn       zn = z     c, then (f (zn))n   n is a sequence in a. the continuity of f then
implies limn       f (zn) = f (z) and, then, f (z)     a, since a is closed. thus, z     f   1(a),
showing f   1(a) is closed.
example 7.47. (a) for each z     c and each r > 0, the closed disk br(z) := {w     c :

|z     w|     r} with radius r and center z is, indeed, closed by (7.38), since

(7.39)
where f is the continuous map f : c        r, f (w) := |z     w|. since br(z) is clearly
bounded, it is also compact.

br(z) = f   1[0, r],

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

82

(b) for each z     c and each r > 0, the circle (also called a 1-sphere) sr(z) := {w     c :
|z     w| = r} with radius r and center z is closed by (7.38), since sr(z) = f   1{r},
where f is the same map as in (7.39). moreover, sr(z) is also clearly bounded, and,
thus, compact.

(c) according to (7.38), for each x     r, the closed half-spaces {z     c : re z     x} =

re   1[x,   [ and {z     c : im z     x} = im   1[x,   [ are, indeed, closed.

theorem 7.48. a subset k of c is compact if, and only if, every sequence in k has a
subsequence that converges to some limit z     k.
proof. if k is closed and bounded, and (zn)n   n is a sequence in k, then the boundedness,
the bolzano-weierstrass th. 7.27, and prop. 7.26 yield a subsequence that converges to
some z     c. however, since k is closed, z     k.
conversely, assume every sequence in k has a subsequence that converges to some
limit z     k. let (zn)n   n be a sequence in k that converges to some w     c. then this
sequence must have a subsequence that converges to some z     k. however, according to
prop. 7.23, it must be w = z     k, showing k is closed. if k is not bounded, then there
exists a sequence (zn)n   n in k such that limn       |zn| =    . every subsequence (znk)k   n
then still has the property that limk       |znk| =    , in particular, each subsequence is
unbounded and can not converge to some z     c (let alone in k).
(cid:4)
caveat 7.49. in calculus ii, we will generalize the notion of compactness to subsets of
so-called metric spaces, de   ning a set k to be compact if, and only if, every sequence
in k has a subsequence that converges to some limit in k. while it remains true that
every compact set is closed and bounded, the converse does not(!) hold in general metric
spaces (in general, even in closed sets, there exist bounded sequences that do not have
convergent subsequences).

   

one reason that compact sets are useful is that real-valued continuous functions on
compact sets assume a maximum and a minimum, which is the contents of th. 7.54
below. in preparation, we now de   ne maxima and minima for real-valued functions.

de   nition 7.50. let m     c, f : m        r.
(a) given z     m , f has a (strict) global min at z if, and only if, f (z)     f (w) (f (z) <
f (w)) for each w     m \ {z}. analogously, f has a (strict) global max at z if, and
only if, f (z)     f (w) (f (z) > f (w)) for each w     m \{z}. moreover, f has a (strict)
global extreme value at z if, and only if, f has a (strict) global min or a (strict)
global max at z.

(b) given z     m , f has a (strict) local min at z if, and only if, there exists    > 0
such that f (z)     f (w) (f (z) < f (w)) for each w     {w     m : |z     w| <   } \ {z}.
analogously, f has a (strict) local max at z if, and only if, there exists    > 0 such
that f (z)     f (w) (f (z) > f (w)) for each w     {w     m :
|z     w| <   } \ {z}.

83

moreover, f has a (strict) local extreme value at z if, and only if, f has a (strict)
local min or a (strict) local max at z.

remark 7.51. in the context of def. 7.50, it is immediate from the respective de   nitions
that f has a (strict) global min at z     m if, and only if,    f has a (strict) global max
at z. moreover, the same holds if    global    is replaced by    local   . it is equally obvious
that every (strict) global min/max is a (strict) local min/max.

theorem 7.52. if k     c is compact, and f : k        c is continuous, then f (k) is
compact.

proof. if (wn)n   n is a sequence in f (k), then, for each n     n, there is some zn     k
such that f (zn) = wn. as k is compact, there is a subsequence (an)n   n of (zn)n   n
with limn       an = a for some a     k. then (f (an))n   n is a subsequence of (wn)n   n and
the continuity of f yields limn       f (an) = f (a)     f (k), showing that (wn)n   n has a
convergent subsequence with limit in f (k). by th. 7.48, we have therefore established
that f (k) is compact.
(cid:4)

lemma 7.53. if k is a nonempty compact subset of r, then k contains a smallest
and a largest element, i.e. there exist m, m     k such that m     x     m for each x     k.
proof. since the compact set k is bounded, we know that

       < m := inf k     sup k =: m <    .

n and m     1

according to the de   nition of the inf and sup as largest lower bound and smallest upper
bound, respectively, for each n     n, there must be elements xn, yn     k such that
m     xn     m + 1
n     yn     m . since the compact set k is also closed, we get
m = limn       xn     k and m = limn       yn     k.
(cid:4)
theorem 7.54. if k     c is compact, and f : k        r is continuous, then f assumes
its max and its min, i.e. there are zm     k and zm     k such that f has a global min at
zm and a global max at zm . in particular, the continuous function f assumes its max
and min on each compact interval k = [a, b]     r, a, b     r.
proof. since k is compact and f is continuous, f (k)     r is compact according to
th. 7.52. then, by lem. 7.53, f (k) contains a smallest element m and a largest
element m . this, in turn, implies that there are zm, zm     k such that f (zm) = m and
f (zm ) = m .
(cid:4)

example 7.55. on an unbounded set, a continuous function does not necessarily have
a global max or a global min, as one can already see from x 7    x. an example for a
continuous function on a bounded, but not closed, interval, that does not have a global
max is f : ]0, 1]        r, f (x) := 1/x, which is continuous by th. 7.38.

intermediate value theorem

[a, b]        r is
theorem 7.56 (bolzano   s theorem). let a, b     r with a < b. if f :
continuous with f (a) > 0 and f (b) < 0, then f has at least one zero in ]a, b[. more
precisely, the set a := f   1{0} has a min   1 and a max   2, a <   1       2 < b, where f > 0
on [a,   1[ and f < 0 on ]  2, b].

proof. let   1 := inf f   1(r   0 ).
(a): f (  1)     0: this is clear if   1 = b. if   1 < b, then, for each n     n su   ciently large,
there exists xn    ]  1,   1 + 1/n[    [a, b] such that f (xn)     0). then limn       xn =   1 and
the continuity of f implies limn       f (xn) = f (  1). now f (  1)     0 is a consequence of
th. 7.13(c). in particular, (a) yields a <   1 and f > 0 on [a,   1[.
(b): f (  1)     0: the continuity of f implies limn       f (  1     1/n) = f (  1) and, since we
have already seen f (  1     1/n) > 0 for each n     n su   ciently large, f (  1)     0 is again a
consequence of th. 7.13(c). in particular, we have   1 < b.

combining (a) and (b), we have f (  1) = 0 and a <   1 < b.
de   ning   2 := sup f   1(r+
then f < 0 on ]  2, b] is also clear as well as   1       2.
theorem 7.57 (intermediate value theorem). let a, b     r with a < b. if f : [a, b]       
r is continuous, then f assumes every value between f (a) and f (b), i.e.

0 ), f (  2) = 0 and a <   2 < b is shown completely analogous.

then consider the auxiliary function g :
continuous with g(a) =        f (a) > 0 and g(b) =        f (b) < 0. according to bolzano   s
th. 7.56, there exists       ]a, b[ such that g(  ) =        f (  ) = 0, i.e. f (  ) =    as claimed.
if f (b) < f (a) and       ]f (b), f (a)[, then consider the auxiliary function g : [a, b]        r,
g(x) := f (x)     . then g is continuous with g(a) = f (a)      > 0 and g(b) = f (b)      < 0.
once again, according to bolzano   s th. 7.56, there exists       ]a, b[ such that g(  ) =
f (  )        = 0, i.e. f (  ) =   .
(cid:4)
theorem 7.58. if i     r is an interval (of one of the 8 types listed in (4.11)) and
f : i        r is continuous, then f (i) is also an interval (it can degenerate to a single
point if f is constant). more precisely, if     6= i = [a, b] is a compact interval, then
    6= f (i) = [min f (i), max f (i)]; if i is not a compact interval, then one of the following
9 cases occurs:

f (i) = r,
f (i) =]        , sup f (i)],
f (i) =]        , sup f (i)[,
f (i) = [inf f (i),   [
f (i) = [inf f (i), sup f (i)],

proof. if i is a compact interval, then we merely combine th. 7.54 with th. 7.57.
otherwise, let        f (i). if f (i) has an upper bound, then th. 7.57 implies [  , sup f (i)[   
f (i) and f (i)     [  ,   [    [  , sup f (i)]. if f (i) does not have an upper bound, then th.
7.57 implies f (i)     [  ,   [= [  ,   [. analogously, one obtains f (i)   ]        ,   ] =]        ,   ]
or f (i)   ]        ,   ] = [inf f (i),   ] or f (i)   ]        ,   ] =] inf f (i),   ], showing that there are

theorem 7.60. let i     r be an interval (of one of the 8 types listed in (4.11)). if
f : i        r is strictly increasing (resp. decreasing), then f has an inverse function f   1
de   ned on j := f (i), i.e. f   1 : j        i, and f   1 is continuous and strictly increasing
(resp. decreasing). if f is also continuous, then j must be an interval.

proof. from prop. 2.31(b), we know f : i        r is one-to-one. then f : i        f (i)
is invertible and prop. 2.31(c) shows f   1 is strictly monotone in the same sense as f .
we need to prove the continuity of f   1. we assume f to be strictly increasing (the case
where f is strictly decreasing then follows by considering    f ). let        j,    > 0, and
       i with f (  ) =   . if i = {  }, then j = {  }, and there is nothing to prove. it remains
to consider three cases:
(a)    = min i, i.e.    is the left endpoint of i (and    6= max i),
(b)    = max i, i.e.    is the right endpoint of i (and    6= min i),
(c)    is neither the min nor the max of i.
we carry out the proof for (c) and leave the (very similar) cases (a) and (b) as exercises.
in case (c), there are points   1,   2     b  (  )     i such that
          <   1 <    <   2 <    +   .

0 ) = r+

remark and de   nition 7.61 (roots). we are now in a position to ful   ll the promise
made in def. and rem. 5.8, i.e. to prove the existence of unique roots for nonnegative
real numbers: for each n     n, the function f : r+
0        r, f (x) := xn, is continuous
and strictly increasing with j := f (r+
0 . then th. 7.60 implies the existence
of a continuous and strictly increasing inverse function f   1 : r+
0        r+
0 . for each
0 , we call f   1(x) the nth root of x and write n   x := x
x     r+
n := f   1(x). then
( n   x)n = (x
n )n = x is immediate from the de   nition. caveat: by de   nition, roots are
always nonnegative and they are only de   ned for nonnegative numbers (when studying
complex numbers and c-valued functions more deeply in the    eld of complex analysis,
one typically extends the notion of root, but we will not pursue this route in this class).
as anticipated in def. and rem. 5.8, one also writes    x instead of 2   x and calls    x the
square root of x.
remark and de   nition 7.62. it turns out that    2 (and many other roots) are not
rational numbers, i.e.    2 /    q. this is easily proved by contradiction: if    2     q, then
there exist natural numbers m, n     n such that    2 = m/n. moreover, by canceling
possible factors of 2, we may assume at least one of the numbers m, n is odd. now
   2 = m/n implies m2 = 2n2, i.e. m2 and, thus, m must be even. in consequence, there
exists p     n such that m = 2p, implying 2n2 = m2 = 4p2 and n2 = 2p2. thus n2 and n
must also be even, in contradiction to m, n not both being even.
the elements of r\q are called irrational numbers. it turns out that most real numbers
are irrational numbers     one can show that q is countable, whereas r \ q is not count-
able (actually, every interval contains countably many rational and uncountably many
irrational numbers, see [phi16, sec. f], in particular, [phi16, th. f.1(c)] and [phi16,
cor. f.4]).

proof. if at least one of the xj is 0, then (7.43) becomes the true statement 0     x1+      +xn
with strict equality if at least one xj > 0. if x1 =        = xn = x, then (7.43) also holds
since both sides are equal to x. thus, for the remainder of the proof, we assume all
xj > 0 and not all xj are equal. first, we consider the special case, where x1+      +xn
= 1.
since not all xj are equal, there exists k with xk 6= 1. we prove (7.43) by induction for
n     {2, 3, . . .} in the form

base case (n = 2): since x1 + x2 = 2, 0 < x1, x2 and not both x1 and x2 are equal to
1, there is    > 0 such that x1 = 1 +    and x2 = 1       , i.e. x1x2 = 1       2 < 1, which
establishes the base case. induction step: we now have n     2 and 0 < x1, . . . , xn+1
with pn+1
j=1 xj = n + 1 plus the existence of k, l     {1, . . . , n + 1} such that xk = 1 +   ,

where we have used that, on both sides of the inequality in (7.50), there are n + 1 factors

all factors are equal. we now apply (7.50) to the sequences (an)n   n, (bn)n   n, (cn)n   n,

applying (7.50) with x = 1 and x =    1, respectively, yields (an)n   n and (bn)n   n are
strictly increasing, and (cn)n   n is strictly decreasing. on the other hand, an < cn holds
for each n     n, showing (an)n   n is bounded from above by c1, and (cn)n   n is bounded
from below by a1. in particular, th. 7.19 implies the convergence of both (an)n   n and
(cn)n   n. moreover, limn       cn = limn      (cid:0)an(1 + 1/n)(cid:1) = e    1 = e, which, together with
an < e < cn for each n     n, can be used to compute e to an arbitrary precision.

(b) r \ q is dense in r.
(c) for each x     r, there exist sequences (rn)n   n and (sn)n   n in the rational numbers
q such that x = limn       rn = limn       sn, (rn)n   n is strictly increasing and (sn)n   n
is strictly decreasing.

proof. (a): since each b  (x) is an interval, it su   ces to prove that every interval ]a, b[,
a < b, contains a rational number. if 0    ]a, b[, then there is nothing to prove. suppose
0 < a < b and set    := b     a > 0. choose n     n such that 1/n <    and let

q := max(cid:26) k

then, once again, q     q and a < q < b.
(b): analogous to (a), we show that every interval ]a, b[, a < b, contains an irrational
number: according to (a), we choose q     q   ]a, b[,    := b     q > 0 and n     n such
that    2/n <   . then a <    := q +    2/n < b and also        r \ q (otherwise,
   2 = n(       q)     q).

representation of x, i.e., we have to verify x = k

rational exponents in a natural way, i.e., for each a, b > 0 and each x, y     q:

nm (here, as in rem. and def. 7.61, we used that    7      n is one-
0 for each n     n). the exponentiation rules of th. 5.7 now extend to

ax+y = ax ay,
ax bx = (ab)x,
(ax)y = ax y.

(7.54a)
(7.54b)
(7.54c)

for the proof, by possibly multiplying numerator and denominator by some natural
number, we can assume x = k/n and y = l/n with k, l     z and n     n. then

moreover, we obtain the following monotonicity rules for each a, b     r+ and each
x, y     q:

   x>0 (cid:16)a < b     ax < bx(cid:17),
   x<0 (cid:16)a < b     ax > bx(cid:17),
   a>1 (cid:16)x < y     ax < ay(cid:17),
   0<a<1 (cid:16)x < y     ax > ay(cid:17).

(7.55b)

(7.55c)

(7.55d)

if x = k/n with k, n     n and a < b, then a1/n < b1/n according to rem. and
def. 7.61, which, in turn, implies ax = (a1/n)k < (b1/n)k = bx, proving (7.55a); and
a   1 > b   1 implies a   x = (a   1)x > (b   1)x = b   x, proving (7.55b). if x < y, set q :=
y     x > 0. then 1 < a and (7.55a) imply 1 = 1q < aq, i.e. ax < ax aq = ay, proving
(7.55c). similarly, 0 < a < 1 and (7.55a) imply aq < 1q = 1, i.e. ay = ax aq < ax,
proving (7.55d).
the following estimates will also come in handy: for a     r+ and x, y     q:

a > 1     x > 0     ax     1 < x    ax+1,

   m   n (cid:16)x, y     [   m, m]     |ax     ay|     l|x     y|,

where l := max{am+1, (1/a)m+1}(cid:17).

(7.56)

(7.57)

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

91

for x     1, (7.56) is proved by ax < ax+1 < x    ax+1 + 1; for x < 1, write x = p/n
with p, n     n and p < n, and apply (7.44) to obtain ax < 1 + x(a     1) < 1 + xa <
1 + x    ax+1. for the proof of (7.57),    rst consider a > 1. moreover, by possibly
renaming x and y, we may assume x < y, i.e. z := y     x > 0. thus, (7.56) holds
with x replaced by z. multiplying the resulting inequality by ax yields

ax az     ax = ay     ax < z    ax az+1 = (y     x) ay+1     (y     x) am+1,

proving (7.57) for a > 1. for a = 1, it is clearly true, and for a < 1, it is a   1 > 1,
i.e.

|ax     ay| = |(a   1)   x     (a   1)   y|     |y     x| (a   1)m+1,

   nishing the proof of (7.57).

(b) we now de   ne ax for irrational x by letting

ax := lim
n      

aqn, where (qn)n   n is a sequence in q with

qn = x.

(7.58)

lim
n      

for this de   nition to make sense, we have to know such sequences (qn)n   n exist,
which we do know from th. 7.68(c). we also know from th. 7.68(c) that there
exists an increasing sequence (qn)n   n in q converging to x, in particular, bounded
by x. then, by (7.55c) and (7.55d), respectively, (aqn)n   n is increasing for a > 1
and decreasing for 0 < a < 1. moreover, the sequence is bounded from above by
an with n     n, n > x, for a > 1; and bounded from below by 0 for 0 < a < 1.
in both cases, th. 7.19 implies convergence of the sequence to some limit that we
may call ax. however, we still need to verify that, for each sequence (rn)n   n in q
with limn       rn = x, the sequence (arn)n   n converges to the same limit ax in r. if
limn       rn = x, then limn       |qn     rn| = 0. since (rn)n   n and (qn)n   n are bounded,
(7.57) implies
(7.59)

|aqn     arn|     l|qn     rn|,
such that prop. 7.11(a) implies limn       |aqn     arn| = 0 and

   l   r+

   n   n

lim
n      

arn = lim
n      

(arn     aqn + aqn) = 0 + ax = ax,

(7.60)

showing (7.58) does not depend on the chosen sequence.

proposition 7.70. the exponentiation rules (7.54), the monotonicity rules (7.55), and
the estimates (7.56) and (7.57) remain valid if x, y     q is replaced by x, y     r. more-
over, for each a > 0 and each sequence (xn)n   n in r:
xn = x     r     lim
n      

axn = ax.

lim
n      

(7.61)

proof. given x, y     r, let (pn)n   n and (qn)n   n be sequences in q such that limn       pn =
x and limn       qn = y.
we start by verifying (7.57). as we can assume (pn)n   n and (qn)n   n to be monotone,
we may also assume pn, qn     [   m, m] for each n     n. then the rational case of (7.57)
implies

   n   n

|apn     aqn|     l|pn     qn|,

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

92

and th. 7.13(c) establishes the case. then (7.61) also follows, since

0     |axn     ax|     l|xn     x|     0.

we deal with (7.54) next. for each a, b > 0:

ax+y = lim
n      
ax bx = lim
n      
(ax)qk = lim
   k   n
n      
    (ax)y = lim
n

(7.54c)

= lim
n      
ax qn

(ax)qn = lim
n      

(7.57)
= ax y,

thereby proving (7.54).
proceeding to (7.55c), let a > 1 and h > 0. if (qn)n   n is a strictly increasing sequence
in q+ with limn       qn = h, then ah = limn       aqn > aq1 > 1. thus, if x < y, let
h := y     x > 0 to obtain ay = ax ah > ax, i.e. (7.55c). if 0 < a < 1 and x < y, then
(1/a)x < (1/a)y, yielding (7.55d). for (7.55a), consider x > 0 and 0 < a < b. then

b
a

> 1    

bx

ax =(cid:18) b
a(cid:19)x

> 1     bx > ax,

proving (7.55a). if x < 0 and 0 < a < b, then ax = (1/a)   x > (1/b)   x = bx, proving
(7.55b).
finally, it remains to verify (7.56). for x     1, the proof for rational x still works for
irrational x. for 0 < x < 1, one uses the usual sequence (qn)n   n in q with limn       qn = x
and obtains (recalling a > 1)

ax = lim
n      

aqn

proving (7.56).

de   nition 7.71 (exponential and power functions). (a) each function of the form

f : r+        r,

f (x) := x  ,        r,

(7.62)

is called a power function. for    > 0, the power function is extended to x = 0 by
setting 0   := 0; for        z, it is de   ned on r \ {0}; for        n0 even on r.

(b) each function of the form

f : r        r+,

f (x) := ax,

a > 0,

(7.63)

is called a (general) exponential function. the case where a = e with e being euler   s
number from (7.49) is of particular interest and importance. most of the time, when
referring to an exponential function, one actually means x 7    ex. it is also common
to write exp(x) instead of ex.

theorem 7.72. (a) every power function as de   ned in def. 7.71(a) is continuous on
its respective domain. moreover, for each    > 0, it is strictly increasing on [0,   [;
for each    < 0, it is strictly decreasing on ]0,   [.

(b) every exponential function as de   ned in def. 7.71(b) is continuous. moreover, for

each a > 1, it is strictly increasing; for each 0 < a < 1, it is strictly decreasing.

proof. (a): the monotonicity claims are provided by (7.55a) and (7.55b), respectively.
for each        n0, the power function is a polynomial, for each        z, a rational function,
i.e. continuity is provided by ex. 7.40(b) and ex. 7.40(c), respectively. for a general
       r, the continuity proof on r+ will be postponed to ex. 7.76(a) below, where it can
be accomplished more easily. so it remains to show the continuity in x = 0 for    > 0.
however, if (xn)n   n is a sequence in r+ with limn       xn = 0 and k     n with 1/k       ,
then, at least for n su   ciently large such that xn     1, 0 < x  
n by (7.55d). then
the continuity of x 7    x1/k implies limn       x1/k
n = 0 and the sandwich th. 7.16 implies
limn       x  
(b): everything has already been proved     continuity is provided by (7.61), monotonicity
is provided by (7.55c) and (7.55d).
(cid:4)

n = 0, proving continuity in x = 0.

n     x1/k

remark and de   nition 7.73 (logarithm). according to th. 7.72(b), for each a    
r+ \ {1}, the exponential function f : r        r+, f (x) := ax, is continuous and strictly
monotone with f (r) = r+ (verify that the image is all of r+ as an exercise). then
th. 7.60 implies the existence of a continuous and strictly monotone inverse function
f   1 : r+        r. for each x     r+, we call f   1(x) the logarithm of x to base a and write
loga x := f   1(x). the most important special case is where the base is euler   s number,
a = e. this is called the natural logarithm. bases a = 2 and a = 10 also carry special
names, binary and common logarithm, respectively. the notation is

ln x := loge x,

lb x := log2 x,

lg x := log10 x,

(7.64)

however, the notation in the literature varies     one    nds log used instead of ln, lb, and
lg; one also    nds lg instead of lb. so you always need to verify what precisely is meant
by either notation.
corollary 7.74. for each a     r+ \ {1}, the logarithm function f : r+        r, f (x) =
loga x is continuous. for a > 1, it is strictly increasing; for 0 < a < 1, it is strictly
decreasing.
(cid:4)

theorem 7.75. one obtains the following logarithm rules:

   a   r+\{1}
   a   r+\{1}
   a   r+\{1}
   a   r+\{1}

   x   r+
   x   r

proof. all the rules are easy consequences of the logarithm being de   ned as the inverse
function to f : r        r+, f (x) := ax.
(7.65a): it is loga 1 = f   1(1) = 0, as f (0) = a0 = 1.
(7.65b): it is loga a = f   1(a) = 1, as f (1) = a1 = a.
(7.65c): it is aloga x = f (f   1(x)) = x.
(7.65d): it is loga ax = f   1(f (x)) = x.

(7.65e): it is loga(xy) = f   1(xy) = f   1(cid:0)f (loga x + loga y)(cid:1) = loga x + loga y, since

f (loga x + loga y) = aloga x+loga y = aloga x aloga y (7.65c)

= xy.

(7.65f): it is loga(xy) = f   1(xy) = f   1(cid:0)f (y loga x)(cid:1) = y loga x, since

f (y loga x) = ay loga x = (aloga x)y (7.65c)

= xy.

(7.65g) is just a combination of (7.65e) and (7.65f): loga(x/y) = loga(xy   1) = loga x    
loga y.
(7.65h) is just a special case of (7.65f): loga
(7.65i): one computes

n   x = loga x1/n = 1

n loga x.

(logb a) loga x

(7.65f)

= logb aloga x (7.65c)

= logb x.

thus, we have veri   ed all the rules and concluded the proof.

example 7.76. (a) for each        r, the power function

f : r+        r,

f (x) := x   = e   ln x,

(cid:4)

(7.66)

is continuous, which follows from th. 7.41, since f = exp   (   ln), ln is continuous
by cor. 7.74, and exp is continuous by th. 7.72(b).

7.3 series

7.3.1 de   nition and convergence

series are a special type of sequences, namely sequences whose members arise from
summing up the members of another sequence. we have, on occasion, already encoun-
tered series, for example the harmonic series (sn)n   n, whose members sn were de   ned
in (7.27). in the present section, we will study series more systematically.

de   nition 7.77. given a sequence (an)n   n in k (or, more generally, in any set a,
where an addition is de   ned), the sequence (sn)n   n, where

sn :=

   n   n

aj,

n

xj=1

is called an (in   nite) series and is denoted by

   xj=1

aj :=xj   n

aj := (sn)n   n.

(7.67)

(7.68)

the an are called the summands of the series, the sn its partial sums. moreover, each

seriesp   j=k aj with k     n is called a remainder (series) of the series (sn)n   n.
the example of the remainder series already shows that it is useful to allow countable
index sets other than n. thus, if (aj)j   i, where i is a countable index set and    : n       
i a bijective map, then de   ne

a  (j)

(7.69)

   xj=1
  , which is suppressed in the notationpj   i aj.

xj   i

aj :=

   

(compare the de   nition in (3.19c) for    nite sums). note that the de   nition depends on

for sequences in k, the notion of convergence is available, and, thus, it is also available
for series arising from real or complex sequences (as such series are, again, sequences in
k).

7 limits and convergence of real and complex numbers

96

de   nition 7.78. if (sn)n   n is a series with the sn de   ned as in (7.67) and with sum-
mands aj     k, then the series is called convergent with limit s     k if, and only if,
limn       sn = s in the sense of (7.1). in that case, one writes

aj = s

   xj=1

(7.70)

and calls s the sum of the series. the series is called divergent if, and only if, it is

not convergent. we write p   j=1 aj =     (resp. p   j=1 aj =       ) if, and only if, (sn)n   n
diverges to     (resp.       ) in the sense of def. 7.18.
caveat 7.79. one has to use care as the symbol p   j=1 aj is used with two completely
di   erent meanings. if it is used according to (7.68), then it means a sequence; if it is
used according to (7.70), then it means a real or complex number (or, possibly,     or
      ). it should always be clear from the context, if it means a sequence or a number.
for example, in the statement    the seriesp   j=1 2   j is convergent   , it means a sequence;
whereas in the statement    p   j=1 2   j = 1   , it means a number.
example 7.80. (a) for each q     c with |q| < 1, p   j=0 qj is called a geometric series.
from (3.22b) (the reader is asked to go back and check that (3.22b) and its proof,
j=0 qj =
. since |q| < 1, we know limn       qn+1 = 0 from ex. 7.6. thus, the series is

proof. since (b) is merely the contraposition of (a), it su   ces to prove (a). to this end,

let sn := pn

respectively. since (tn)n   n converges, it must be a cauchy sequence by th. 7.29. thus,

(7.78) is now a consequence of th. 7.13(c).

triangle inequality for    nite sums also implies (cid:12)(cid:12)pn

(cid:4)
de   nition 7.84. a seriesp   j=1 aj in r is called alternating if, and only if, its summands
alternate between positive and negative signs, i.e. if sgn(aj+1) =     sgn(aj) 6= 0 for each
j     n.
theorem 7.85 (leibniz criterion). letp   j=1 aj be an alternating series. if the sequence
(|an|)n   n of absolute values is strictly decreasing and limn       an = 0, then the series is
convergent and

   xj=n+1

aj =   n an+1,

(7.79)

that means the error made when approximating the limit by the partial sum sn has the
same sign as the    rst neglected summand an+1, and its absolute value is less than |an+1|.
proof. we    rst consider the case where a1 > 0, i.e. where there exists a strictly de-
creasing sequence of positive numbers (bn)n   n such that an = (   1)n+1bn. as the bn are
strictly decreasing, we obtain bn     bn+1 > 0 for each n     n, such that the sequences

are strictly monotone, namely (un)n   n strictly increasing and (vn)n   n strictly decreasing.
since, 0 < un < un + b2n+1 = vn < b1 for each n     n, both sequences (un)n   n and
(vn)n   n are also bounded, and, thus, convergent by th. 7.19, i.e. u := limn       un     r
and v := limn       vn     r. since

v     u = lim

(vn     un) = lim
n      

(s2n+1     s2n) = lim

we obtain u = v and limn       sn = u and 0 < u < b1 = a1. in particular, there is

      ]0, 1[ satisfyingp   j=1 aj =    a1.
in the case a1 < 0, the above proof yields convergence of    p   j=1 aj =p   j=1(   aj) with
p   j=1(   aj) =    (   a1) for a suitable       ]0, 1[. however, this then yields, as before,
p   j=1 aj =    a1.
applying the above result to each remainder series p   j=n+1 aj, n     n, completes the

proof of (7.79) and the theorem.

7.3.3 absolute convergence and rearrangements

in general, one has to use care when dealing with in   nite series, as convergence properties
and even the limit in case of convergence can depend on the order of the summands (in
obvious contrast to the situation of    nite sums). for real series that are convergent, but
not absolutely convergent, one has the striking riemann rearrangement theorem [phi16,
th. 7.93] that states one can choose an arbitrary number s     r   {      ,   } and reorder
the summands such that the new series converges to s (actually, [phi16, th. 7.93] says
even more, namely that one can prescribe an entire interval of cluster points for the
rearranged series). however, the situation is better for absolutely convergent series. in
the present section, we will prove results that show the sum of absolutely convergent
series does not depend on the order of the summands.

of (an)n   n in the sense of def. 7.21.

theorem 7.92. letp   j=1 aj andp   j=1 bj be series in c such that (bn)n   n is a reordering
if p   j=1 aj is absolutely convergent, then so is
p   j=1 bj and p   j=1 aj =p   j=1 bj.
j=1 |aj|, and tn := pn
proof. let sn := pn
j=1 bj denote the respective
partial sums. we will show that limn      (sn     tn) = 0. given    > 0, since (  sn)n   n is a
cauchy sequence by th. 7.29, there exists n     n, such that

j=1 aj,   sn := pn
   n>m>n |  sn       sm| = |am+1| +        + |an| <   .

since (bn)n   n is a reordering of (an)n   n, there exists a bijective map    : n        n such
that bn = a  (n) for each n     n. since    is bijective, there exists m     n such that
{1, 2, . . . , n + 1}       {1, 2, . . . , m}. then n > m implies   (n) > n + 1, and

   n>m    k   n |sn     tn|     |an +2| +        + |an +k| <   ,

since all aj with j     n +1 occur in both sn and tn and cancel in sn   tn (i.e. all aj that do
not cancel must have an index j > n + 1). so we have shown that limn      (sn     tn) = 0,
which, in turn, implies

bj = lim

example 7.94. we apply th. 7.93 to so-called double series, i.e. to series with index
set i := n    n. the following notation is common:
amn := x(m,n)   n  n

   xm,n=1

a(m,n),

(7.87)

where one writes amn (also am,n) instead of a(m,n). recall from th. 3.24 that n    n is
countable. in general, the convergence properties of the double series and, if it exists,
the value of the sum, will depend on the chosen bijection    : n        n    n.
however, we will now assume our double series to be absolutely convergent. then th.
7.92 guarantees the sum does not depend on the chosen bijection and we can apply th.

b-adic representations of real numbers

we are mostly used to representing real numbers in the decimal system. for example,
we write

where

the decimal system represents real numbers as, in general, in   nite series of decimal
fractions. digital computers represent numbers in the dual system, using base 2 instead
of 10. for example, the number from (7.91a) has the dual representation

x = 10000011.10 = 27 + 21 + 20 +

2   (2n+1),

(7.91b)

   xn=0

where it is an exercise to verify

2   (2n+1) =

.

   xn=0

representations with base 16 (hexadecimal) and 8 (octal) are also of importance when
working with digital computers. more generally, each natural number b     2 can be used
as a base.

de   nition 7.96. let b     2 be a natural number.
(a) given an integer n     z and a sequence (dn , dn   1, dn   2, . . . ) in {0, . . . , b     1}, the

series

   x  =0

dn      bn     

(7.92)

is called a b-adic series. the number b is called the base or the radix, and the
numbers d   are called digits.

(b) if x     r+

0 is the sum of the b-adic series given by (7.92), than one calls the b-adic

series a b-adic representation or a b-adic expansion of x.

theorem 7.97. given a natural number b     2 and a nonnegative real number x    
r+
0 , there exists a b-adic series representing x, i.e. there is n     z and a sequence
(dn , dn   1, dn   2, . . . ) in {0, . . . , b     1} such that

x =

   x  =0

dn      bn     .

(7.93)

if one introduces the additional requirement that 0 6= dn , then each x > 0 has either a
unique b-adic representation or precisely two b-adic representations. more precisely, for
0 6= dn and x > 0, the following statements are equivalent:
(i) the b-adic representation of x is not unique.

(ii) there are precisely two b-adic representations of x.

(iii) there exists a b-adic representation of x such that dn = 0 for each n     n0 for

some n0 < n .

(iv) there exists a b-adic representation of x such that dn = b     1 for each n     n0 for

some n0     n .

8 convergence of k-valued functions

8.1 pointwise and uniform convergence

so far we have studied the convergence of sequences in k. we will now also need to
study the convergence of sequences (fn)n   n, where each member fn of the sequence is
a function fn : m        k, m     c. here, for the    rst time, we encounter the situation
that there exist di   erent useful notions of convergence for such sequences.

de   nition 8.1. let (fn)n   n be a sequence of functions, fn : m        k,     6= m     c.
(a) we say (fn)n   n converges pointwise to f : m        k if, and only if, limn       fn(z) =

f (z) for each z     m , i.e. if, and only if,

   z   m         r+    n   n    n>n |fn(z)     f (z)| <   .

so, in general, n in (8.1) depends on both z and   .

(b) we say (fn)n   n converges uniformly to f : m        k if, and only if,

        r+    n   n    n>n    z   m |fn(z)     f (z)| <   .

(8.1)

(8.2)

in (8.2), n is still allowed to depend on   , but, in contrast to the situation of (8.1),
not on z     in that sense, the convergence is uniform in z.

remark 8.2. it is immediate from def. 8.1(a),(b) that uniform convergence implies
pointwise convergence, but ex. 8.3(b) below will show the converse is not true.

example 8.3. (a) let     6= m     c (for example m = [0, 1] or m = b1(0)), and
fn : m        k, fn(z) = 1/n for each n     n. then, clearly, (fn)n   n converges
uniformly to f     0.

(b) the sequence (fn)n   n, where fn :

but not uniformly, to

f : [0, 1]        r,

[0, 1]        r, fn(x) := xn, converges pointwise,
f (x) :=(0

proving the convergence is not uniform.

theorem 8.4. let (fn)n   n be a sequence of functions, fn : m        k,     6= m     c. if
(fn)n   n converges uniformly to f : m        k and all fn are continuous at        m , then
f is also continuous at   . in particular, if each fn is continuous, then so is f (uniform
limits of continuous functions are continuous).

proof. let    > 0. due to the uniform convergence of (fn)n   n,

de   nition 8.5. (a) in def. 7.77, it was mentioned that series can be formed from each
sequence in a set a, where an addition is de   ned. letting     6= m     c, we now
consider a := f(m, k), i.e. the set of functions from m into k. then the addition
on a is de   ned according to (6.1a) and, given a sequence of functions (fn)n   n in a,

correct, since one writes aj zj = fj(z) for the summands, even though one actually
means fj. moreover, one uses the same notation if one actually does mean the series

note: the notationp   j=0 aj zj introduced in (8.9) is very common, but not entirely
p   j=0 fj(z) in k, so one has to see from the context ifp   j=0 aj zj means a series of

(a) the series converges pointwise to f : m        k if, and only if, it (i.e. (sn)n   n)

two di   erent meanings     it can mean the sequence of partial sums as in (8.8) or, in
the case of convergent series, the limit function as in (8.10) (cf. caveat 7.79).

analogous to the situation of series in k, the notation p   j=1 fj is also used with

(a) the series converges uniformly to some f : m        k if, and only if, for each
n     n and each z     m , the remainder series p   j=n+1 fj(z) in k converges to some

implies uniform convergence of p   j=1 fj.

(c) if each fj is continuous in        m and the series converges uniformly to f : m       
k, then f is continuous in   . in particular, if each fj is continuous, then f is
continuous.

proof. (a): if p   j=1 fj converges uniformly to f , then f (z) =p   j=1 fj(z) holds for each
z     m , rn(z) = f (z)     sn(z) for each n     n, z     m according to (7.76), where
sn(z) :=pn
j=1 fj(z). then (8.11) is just (8.2), where the sn now play the role of the fn
in (8.2). conversely, if the remainder series converge for each z     m , then we can de   ne

f : m        k, f (z) := f1(z)+r1(z) =p   j=1 fj(z). then, once again, rn(z) = f (z)   sn(z)
for each n     n, z     m , and (8.11) is just (8.2), yielding the uniform convergence of the
series.

of particular interest in the context of function series. even for power series, studying
convergence can still be di   cult, but the availability of the following th. 8.9 does help
to (at least partially) settle the question in many cases.

theorem 8.9. for each power series p   j=0 aj zj, aj     k, there exists a number r

p   j=0 aj zj converges pointwise in the sense of def. 8.6(a) for each z     br(0) (cf. def.

in (8.15), lim sup denotes the so-called limit superior, which is de   ned as the largest

cluster point of the sequence ( np|an|)n   n if the sequence is bounded (cf. th. 7.27) and
    if the sequence is unbounded. as the limit superior can be 0 or    , we also de   ne
1/0 :=     and 1/    := 0 in (8.15).

an+1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

provided all an are nonzero and provided the limit in (8.16) either exists in r+

0 or is    .
proof. for the proof of (8.15), we apply the root test from th. 7.89(b). here, for the
root test, we have to consider the sequence ( np|an||z|n)n   n. as a consequence of (7.11a)
and prop. 7.26, lim supn      (  xn) =    lim supn       xn for each    > 0 and each sequence
(xn)n   n in r (with           :=    , this also holds if the limit superior is in   nite). thus,

lim sup

np|an||z|n = |z| lim sup

np|an| = |z| l.

if |z| > 1/l, then |z| l > 1 and (7.82b) applies, i.e. (8.13b) holds for r = 1/l.
if
|z| < 1/l, then |z| l < 1, and, recalling the bolzano-weierstrass th. 7.27, one sees that
(7.82a) applies, i.e. (8.13a) holds for r = 1/l.
next, if 0 < r0 < r, then p   j=0 |aj rj
z     br0(0) and each j     n, we have |aj zj|     |aj rj
8.7(b).
the validity of (8.16) follows from the ratio test of th. 7.89(c): if all an 6= 0 and z 6= 0,
then

0| converges according to (8.13a). since, for each
0|, (8.14) is a consequence of cor.

n      (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
an+1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12), then |z|/l < 1, i.e. (7.83a) applies, proving (8.13a) for r = l.
if |z| < l := limn      (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
if |z| > l, then |z|/l > 1, i.e. (7.83b) applies, proving (8.13b) for r = l.
corollary 8.10. if p   j=0 aj zj, aj     k, is a power series with radius of convergence
r    ]0,   ], then the function

proof. each partial sum z 7   pn
j=0 aj zj is a polynomial, i.e. continuous on k. moreover,
if        br(0), then the power series converges uniformly on m := b|  |(0) by (8.14), i.e.
it is continuous at        m by th. 8.4.

let us investigate what can happen for |z| = r = 1 for some cases: the series
p   n=1 zn (   = 0) is divergent for each z     c with z = 1 by the observation that
(zn)n   n does not converge to 0 for n         (as |zn| = 1 for each n     n); the
series p   n=1 n   1 zn (   =    1) is the harmonic series, i.e. divergent, for z = 1, but
convergent for z =    1 according to ex. 7.86(a).

caveat 8.12. theorem 8.9 does not claim the uniform convergence of p   j=0 aj zj on
br(0), which is usually not true (e.g., it is an exercise to show that p   j=0 zj does not
or divergence ofp   j=0 aj zj for |z| = r, which has to be determined case by case (cf. ex.
de   nition and remark 8.13. given two power series p := p   j=0 aj zj and q :=

note that we have not assumed any convergence of the series so far, i.e. p, q, and p     q
are not k-valued functions, but sequences of k-valued functions according to def. 8.5
(sequences of polynomials, actually). sometimes one also calls the cauchy product p    q
the convolution of p and q.
now, if we do assume p and q to have some nonzero radii of convergence, say rp, rq    
]0,   ], respectively, then, by (8.13a), both series are absolutely convergent for each
z     br(0), where r := min{rp, rq}. thus, the functions

then, for each x     r, 1 = e(0) = e(x     x) = e(x)e(   x), i.e. e(   x) = (cid:0)e(x)(cid:1)   1
,
showing e(x) 6= 0 for each x     r. thus, e(1) > 0, the continuity of e, and the

applying (8.29) with x = 1 shows e(n) = an for each n     n. applying (8.29) with
x = 1/n, n     n, shows a = e(1) = (e(1/n))n, i.e. e(1/n) = a1/n since e(1/n) > 0.

ax = lim

aqn = lim

e(qn) = e(x).

finally, if x     r   , then

ax = (a   x)   1 =(cid:0)e(   x)(cid:1)   1

where, in the last step, it was used that limk       xk = 0 and the continuity of f implies
limk       f (xk) = ln 1 = 0.
similarly, but simpler, one obtains (8.34) and (8.35) (exercise). finally, for the sequence
(xn)n   n with xn := 1/n, (8.35) implies (8.36).
(cid:4)
de   nition 8.19 (exponentiation with complex exponents). for each (a, z)     r+   c,
we de   ne
(8.37)

az := exp(z ln a),

where exp is the function de   ned in (8.24). for a = e, (8.37) yields ez = exp(z), i.e.
(8.37) is consistent with (8.26).

theorem 8.20. (a) the    rst two exponentiation rules of (7.54) still hold for each

a, b > 0 and each z, w     c:

az+w = az aw,
az bz = (ab)z.

(b) for each a     r+, the exponential function

f (z) := az,

(8.39a)

is continuous, and, for each        c, the power function
g(x) := x  ,

g : r+        c,

is continuous.

=

exp((z + w) ln a) = exp(z ln a + w ln a)

th. 8.16(b)

=

exp(z ln a) exp(w ln a)

(8.37)

proving (8.38a), and

(8.40)

proving (8.38b).

(7.65e)

= (ab)z,

(b): the continuity of both functions follows from the continuity of exp (according to
th. 8.16(a)) and from the fact that continuity is preserved by compositions (according
to th. 7.41): the exponential function f , given by f (z) = ez ln a, is the composition of
the continuous functions z 7    z ln a and w 7    ew, whereas (analogous to ex. 7.76(a)),
the power function g, given by g(x) = e   ln x, is the composition g = exp   (   ln), where
ln is continuous by cor. 7.74.

8.4 trigonometric functions

the    rst    de   nition    of the trigonometric functions sine and cosine is the one based on
geometric visualization usually given in high school: cos x and sin x are the coordinates
of the point p = (p1, p2)     r2 on the unit circle, such that x is the angle measured in
radian between the line segment between (0, 0) and (1, 0) and the line segment between
(0, 0) and p.

while this    de   nition    allows to obtain many important properties of sine and cosine
using geometric arguments, it is not mathematically rigorous, and, for example, provides
no clue how to compute values like sin 1. the problem is related to the fact that the
angle measured in radian between the line segment between (0, 0) and (1, 0) and the line

8 convergence of k-valued functions

116

segment between (0, 0) and p is supposed to be the length of the segment of the unit
circle between (1, 0) and p (taken in the counter-clockwise direction).

in the following def. and rem. 8.21, we will provide a mathematically rigorous de   nition
of sine and cosine using power series, and we will then verify that the functions have the
familiar properties one learns in high school. however, as the computation of lengths
of curved paths is actually beyond the scope of this lecture, we will not be able to see
that our sine and cosine functions are precisely the same we visualized in high school
(the interested reader is referred to ex. 1 in sec. 5.14 of [wal02]).

de   nition and remark 8.21. we de   ne the sine function, denoted sin, and the
cosine function, denoted cos by

(8.41b)

(a) sin and cos are well-de   ned and continuous: for both series and each z     c, we can
estimate the absolute value of the nth summand by the nth summand of the series
for the exponential function e|z| (cf. (8.36)), which we know to be convergent from
ex. 8.11(b). thus, by th. 8.9, both series in (8.41) have radius of convergence    
and are continuous by cor. 8.10.

(b) cos : r        r (i.e. cos   r) has a smallest positive zero        r+. we de   ne    := 2  .

are    = 3.14159 . . .

in particular, the
summands of the series in (8.41) converge monotonically to 0 (for k     2) and, since
the series are alternating for x 6= 0, th. 7.85 applies and (7.79) yields
   
=: g(x),
         

the zeros of x 7    f (x) are       2,   2, i.e.    2 is its smallest positive zero; the zeros
of x 7    g(x) are    p6     2   3,   p6 + 2   3,p6     2   3,p6 + 2   3, i.e. p6     2   3

identities (8.44i) can be restated as sine and cosine being periodic functions with period

proof. (8.44a) is immediate from (8.41) since, for z = 0, all summands of the sine
series are 0 and all summands of the cosine series are 0, except the    rst one, which is
(   1)0 00
(8.44b) is also immediate from (8.41), since (   z)2n+1 = (   1)2n+1z2n+1 =    z2n+1 and
(   z)2n = (   1)2nz2n = z2n.

for both series on the right-hand side and each z     c, we can estimate the absolute
value of each summand by the corresponding summand of the exponential series for e|z|
(cf. (8.36)), showing they have radius of convergence     and are continuous by cor. 8.10.
in particular, their continuity in z = 0 proves (8.44j).
(cid:4)
theorem 8.23. one has sin(r) = cos(r) = [   1, 1], i.e. the range of both sine and

starting at (1, 0).

eiz     e   iz (8.46a)

= cos z + i sin z     cos(   z)     i sin(   z) = 2i sin z

proves (8.46c).

as a    rst application of (8.46), we can now determine all solutions to the equation
ez = 1 and all zeros (if any) of exp, sin, and cos:

theorem 8.25. the set of (complex) solutions to the equation ez = 1 consists precisely
of all integer multiples of 2  i, the exponential function has no zeros (neither in r nor
in c), and the set of all (real or complex) zeros of sine and cosine consists of a discrete
set of real numbers. more precisely:

exp   1{1} = {2k  i : k     z},
exp   1{0} =    ,
sin   1{0} = {k   : k     z},
cos   1{0} =(cid:8)(2k + 1)   

2 : k     z(cid:9).

(8.47a)
(8.47b)
(8.47c)

(8.47d)

proof. we start by considering the zeros of the functions cos, sin : r        r: due to
2 [ such that cos(   x) = cos x (by (8.44b)) implies   
(8.44f), cos x > 0 for each x     [0,   
to be the only zero of cos in the interval ]       
2 ]. then, since cos(x +   ) =     cos x for
each x     r by (8.44h),   
2 +   ],
and, thus, using that cos has period 2   according to (8.44i), adding integer multiples of
2   to   

2 +    are the only zeros of cos in the interval ]      

2 and   

2 ,   

2 ,   

2

2 and   

since, by (8.44g), sin x =     cos(x +   

2 +    must generate precisely all zeros of cos : r        r, i.e.
2 : k     z(cid:9).
2 + k    : k     z(cid:9) =(cid:8)(2k + 1)   
r     cos   1{0} =(cid:8)   
2 ) for each x     r, we also obtain
r     sin   1{0} =(cid:8)      
2 + x : x     r     cos   1{0}(cid:9) = {k   : k     z}.
= (cid:0) cos(2  ) + i sin(2  )(cid:1)k

we consider (8.47a) next. if k     z, then
e2k  i =(cid:0)e2  i(cid:1)k (8.46a)

= 1k = 1,

proving          . for the remaining inclusion, assume z     exp   1{1}, i.e. ez = 1, and write
z = x + iy with x, y     r. then

1 = |ez| = ex |eiy|

(8.46a)

= ex(cid:12)(cid:12) cos y + i sin y| = exp(sin y)2 + (cos y)2

(8.44e)

= ex,

   rst implying x = 0 and, then, using (8.46a) once again, 1 = ez = eiy = cos y + i sin y
implies cos y = 1 and sin y = 0, i.e. y     {2k   : k     z}, proving          .
to    nish the proof of (8.47c), assume sin z = 0. then eiz = cos z = cos(   z) = e   iz,
implying e2iz = 1 and, by (8.47a), there is k     z such that 2iz = 2k  i, i.e. z = k  ,
proving (8.47c). since, by (8.44g), cos z = sin(z +   
2 ) for each z     c, we also obtain
(8.47d):

cos   1{0} =(cid:8)      

2 + z : z     sin   1{0}(cid:9) =(cid:8)(2k + 1)   

2 : k     z(cid:9).

finally, if z = x + iy with x, y     r, then |ez| = ex |eiy| = ex 6= 0 proves (8.47b).

to be strictly increasing on ]

existence of inverse functions, denoted by

arcsin : [   1, 1]        [     /2,   /2],
arccos : [   1, 1]        [0,   ],

respectively, where all four inverse functions are continuous, arcsin is strictly increasing,
arccos is strictly decreasing, arctan is strictly increasing, and arccot is strictly decreasing.

of course, using (8.45) and (8.50), respectively, one can also obtain the inverse functions
on di   erent intervals, and, in the literature, such inverse functions are, indeed, considered
as well. somewhat confusingly, it is common to denote all these di   erent functions by
the same symbols, namely the ones introduced in (8.51). here, we will not need to pursue
this any further, i.e. we will only consider the inverse functions precisely as de   ned in
(8.51), which are also known as the principle inverse functions of sin, cos, tan, and cot,
respectively.

8.5 polar form of complex numbers, fundamental theorem

theorem 8.28. for each complex number z     c, there exist real numbers r     0 and
       r such that
(8.52)
moreover, if (8.52) holds with r     0 and        r, then r is the modulus of z and, for
z 6= 0,    is uniquely determined up to addition of an integer multiple of 2  , i.e.

proof. for z = 0, there is nothing to prove, so we assume z 6= 0 and set r := |z|. we

in particular,    1            1. thus, letting

   := arccos   ,

we obtain        [0,   ],    = cos   , and sin        0, yielding
sin    =p1     (cos   )2 =p1       2

as desired. if y     0, then the above shows the existence of        r such that   z = x    iy =
rei   = r cos    + ir sin   . letting    :=      , we, once again, have z = r cos        ir sin    =
re   i   = rei  , as desired, completing the existence proof for the representation (8.52).
now assume (8.52) holds with r     0. then

|z| = r|ei  | = rp(sin   )2 + (cos   )2 = r.

finally, if r ei  1 = r ei  2 with r > 0, then ei(  1     2) = 1, i.e. i(  1       2)     {2k  i : k     z}
by (8.47a).
(cid:4)
de   nition and remark 8.29. the representation of z     c given by (8.52) is called its
polar form, where (r,   ) are also called polar coordinates of z,    is called an argument of
z. for z 6= 0, one can    x the argument uniquely by the additional requirement        [0, 2  [
(but one also    nds other choices, for example       ]      ,   ], in the literature). the above
terminology is consistent with the common use of calling (r,   ) polar coordinates of the
vector z = (x, y)     r2(= c) (in contrast to the cartesian coordiantes (x, y)), where r
constitutes the distance of the point z = (x, y) from the origin (0, 0) and    is the angle
between the vector z = (x, y) and the x-axis (cf. the three introductory paragraphs
of the previous sec. 8.4). as promised, we can now better understand the geometric
interpretation of complex multiplication already described in rem. 5.12: if z1 = r1ei  1
and z2 = r2ei  2, then z1z2 = r1r2ei(  1+  2), i.e. complex multiplication, indeed, means
multiplying absolute values and adding arguments.
corollary 8.30. if z     c, then |z| = 1 holds if, and only if, there exists        r such
that z = ei       in other words, the map

f : r        {z     c : |z| = 1},

f (  ) := ei  ,

(8.55)

is surjective. moreover f (  1) = f (  2) holds if, and only if,   1       2 = 2  k for some
k     z.
proof. everything is immediate from th. 8.28.

k = ek2  i = 1 for each k     {1, . . . , n} and the   1, . . . ,   n are all distinct
proof. it is    n
by cor. 8.30, since, for k, l     {1, . . . , n} with k 6= l, (k     l)/n /    z. as   1, . . . ,   n are
n distinct zeros of the polynomial p : c        c, p (z) := zn     1, and p has at most n
zeros by th. 6.6(a),   1, . . . ,   n constitute all solutions to zn = 1.
(cid:4)

we are now in a position to prove one of the central results of analysis and algebra,
namely the fundamental theorem of algebra. the following proof does not need any tools
beyond the ones provided by this class     it is actually mainly founded on continuous
functions attaining a min and a max on compact sets according to th. 7.54 and the
existence of nth roots of unity according to cor. 8.31.

theorem 8.32 (fundamental theorem of algebra). every polynomial p : c        c,
p (z) := pn
j=0 ajzj, of degree n     1 (i.e. a0, . . . , an     c with an 6= 0) has at least one
zero z0     c.
proof. dividing the equation p (z) = 0 by an 6= 0, it su   ces to consider the case an = 1.
we therefore assume

   z   c

p (z) = zn + an   1zn   1 +        + a1z + a0.

claim 1. the function |p| attains its global min on c, i.e. there exists z0     c such that
|p| is minimal in z0.
proof. we    rst note

   z6=0

p (z) = zn(cid:0)1 + r(z)(cid:1), where
set m := |a0| +        + |an   1| and r := max{1, 2m}.
then

r(z) :=

2     m.

this estimate together with |p (0)| = |a0|     m shows that the min of |p| on the compact
disk br(0) (see ex. 7.47(a)) (such a min z0     br(0) exists due to th. 7.54) must be
the global min of |p| on c.
n
claim 2. if |p| has a min in z0     c, then p (z0) = 0.
proof. proceeding by contraposition, we assume p (z0) 6= 0 and show that |p| does not
have a min in z0. we need to construct z1     c such that |p (z1)| < |p (z0)|. to this end,

9 di   erential calculus

9.1 de   nition of di   erentiability and rules

the basic idea of di   erential calculus is to locally approximate nonlinear functions f by
linear functions. in our case, f will be de   ned on a subset m of r and, given        m
and r-valued f , we will investigate the question if we can de   ne a number f   (  )     r
that represents the slope of the graph of f at    such that the line through    with slope
f   (  ) (called the tangent of f in   ) can be considered as a local approximation of the
graph of f .
if such a local approximation of f in    is at all reasonable, then, for x 6=   ,

f (x)     f (  )

x       

should provide    good    approximations of f   (  ) if x tends to   . this leads to the following
def. 9.1, where we also allow c-valued functions (while the above-described geometric
interpretation only works for r-valued functions, it can be applied to both the real and
the imaginary parts of a c-valued function, cf. rem. 9.2 below); but note that we do
not consider di   erentiability of functions f : c        c, which would lead to the notion
of complex di   erentiability or holomorphicity, which is studied in the    eld of complex
analysis and is beyond the scope of this class.

de   nition 9.1. let a < b, f : ]a, b[       k (a =       , b =     is admissible), and       ]a, b[.
then f is said to be di   erentiable at    if, and only if, the following limit in (9.1) exists
in the sense of def. 8.17 (where x 7    f (x)   f (  )
plays the role of x 7    f (x) in def. 8.17).
the limit is then called the derivative of f in   . many symbols are used in the literature
to denote derivatives, the following provides a selection:

x     

f   (  ) :=    xf (  ) :=

df (  )

dx

:= lim
x     

f (x)     f (  )

x       

= lim
h   0

f (   + h)     f (  )

h

.

(9.1)

note both limits occurring in (9.1) are, indeed, identical, since the sequence (xk)k   n in
]a, b[ converges to    if, and only if, the sequence (hk)k       with hk := xk        converges
to 0. the number in (9.1) (if it exists) is also called a di   erential quotient, whereas
f (x)   f (  )
f is called di   erentiable if, and only if, it is di   erentiable at each       ]a, b[. in that case,
one calls the function

x     

f    : ]a, b[       k,

x 7    f   (x),

the derivative of f .

remark 9.2. in the situation of def. 9.1, the complex-valued function f : ]a, b[       c
is di   erentiable at       ]a, b[ if, and only if, both functions re f, im f : ]a, b[       r are
di   erentiable, and, in that case

f   (  ) = (re f )   (  ) + i (im f )   (  ).

limn       re zn = re    and limn       im zn = im    hold.
de   nition 9.3. if f : ]a, b[       r as in def. 9.1 is di   erentiable at       ]a, b[, then the
graph of the a   ne function

theorem 9.4. if f : ]a, b[       k as in def. 9.1 is di   erentiable at       ]a, b[, then it is

then f has a continuous, strictly increasing (resp. decreasing) inverse function f   1 de-
   ned on the interval j := f (i), i.e. f   1 : j        i, and, for each        i with f   (  ) 6= 0,

9.2 higher order derivatives and the sets c k

de   nition 9.12. let a < b, i :=]a, b[, f : i        k (a =       , b =     is admissible). if f
is di   erentiable, then f    might or might not itself be di   erentiable. if f    is di   erentiable,
then its derivative is denoted by f       and is called the second derivative of f . clearly, this
process can be iterated, leading to the following general recursive de   nition of higher-
order derivatives:
let f (0) := f . for k     n0 assume the kth derivative of f , denoted by f (k) exists on
i. then f is said to have a derivative of order k + 1 at        i if, and only if, f (k) is
di   erentiable at   . in that case, de   ne

f (k+1)(  ) := (f (k))   (  ).

(9.19)

if f (k+1)(  ) exists for all        i, then f is said to be (k + 1)-times di   erentiable and the
function f (k+1) : i        k, x 7    f (k+1)(  ), is called the (k + 1)st derivative of f . it is
common to write f    := f (1), f       := f (2), f          := f (3), but f (k) if k     4.
if f (k) exists, it might or might not be continuous (cf. ex. 9.13(c) below). one de   nes

(note c 0(i, k) = c(i, k) and c(i, k)     c 1(i, k)     c 2(i, k)     . . . ). finally, we de   ne
the notation c k(i) := c k(i, r) for k     n0     {   }.
example 9.13. (a) one has sin     c   (r) with sin    = cos, sin       =     sin, sin          =     cos,
(b) a simple induction shows, for each polynomial p : r        k, p (x) = pn

9.3 mean value theorem, monotonicity, and extrema

theorem 9.14. let a < b. if f : ]a, b[       r is di   erentiable in       ]a, b[ and f has a
local min or max in   , then f   (  ) = 0.

proof. suppose f has a local max at   . then there exists    > 0 such that |h| <    implies
f (   + h)     f (  )     0. now let (hk)k   n be a sequence in ]0,   [ with limk       hk = 0. then
f (      hk)     f (  )     0 for all k     n implies

f   (  ) = lim

f   (  ) = lim

(9.22)

showing f   (  ) = 0. now, if f has a local min at   , then    f has a local max at   , and
f   (  ) =    (   f )   (  ) = 0 establishes the case.
remark 9.15. for f : r        r, f (x) := x3, it is f   (0) = 0, but f does not have a local
min or max at 0, showing that, while being necessary for an di   erentiable function f to
have a local extremum at   , f   (  ) = 0 is not a su   cient condition for such an extremum
at   . points    with f   (  ) = 0 are sometimes called stationary or critical points of f .

(cid:4)

   

now, we    rst prove an important special case of the mean value theorem:

theorem 9.16 (rolle   s theorem). let a < b. if f : [a, b]        r is continuous on the
compact interval [a, b], di   erentiable on the open interval ]a, b[, and f (a) = f (b), then
there exists       ]a, b[ such that f   (  ) = 0.
proof. if f is constant, then f   (  ) = 0 holds for each       ]a, b[.
if f is nonconstant,
then there exists x    ]a, b[ with f (x) 6= f (a). if f (x) > f (a), then th. 7.54 implies the
existence of       ]a, b[ such that f attains its (global and, thus, local) max in   . then
th. 9.14 yields f   (  ) = 0. the case f (x) < f (a) is treated analogously.
(cid:4)

theorem 9.17 (mean value theorem). let a < b. if f : [a, b]        r is continuous on
the compact interval [a, b] and di   erentiable on the open interval ]a, b[, then there exists
      ]a, b[ such that

(9.23)

f (b)     f (a)

= f   (  ).

b     a

proof. one applies rolle   s th. 9.16 to the auxiliary function

   : [a, b]        r,   (x) := f (x)        (x     a), where    :=

f (b)     f (a)

b     a

.

(9.24)

since f is continuous on [a, b] and di   erentiable on ]a, b[, so is   . moreover   (a) = f (a) =
  (b), i.e. rolle   s th. 9.16 applies and yields       ]a, b[ satisfying 0 =      (  ) = f   (  )       ,
proving (9.23).

corollary 9.18. let c < d and f : ]c, d[       r be di   erentiable (c =       , d =     is
admissible).

(a) if f        0 (resp. f        0), then f is increasing (resp. decreasing). moreover, if the

inequalities are strict, then the monotonicity of f is strict as well.

(b) if f        0, then f is constant.
proof. if c < a < b < d and f        0 (resp. f        0, resp. f        0), then (9.23) implies
f (b)     f (a) (resp. f (b)     f (a), resp. f (b) = f (a)). moreover, strict inequalities for f   
yield strict inequality between f (b) and f (a).

showing f   (  )     0. analogously, one obtains that f   (  )     0 provided there does not exist

theorem 9.20 (su   cient conditions for extrema). let c < d, let f : ]c, d[       r be

(a) if f   (x) > 0 for each x    ]c,   [ and f   (x) < 0 for each x    ]  , d[, then f has a strict

(b) if f   (x) < 0 for each x    ]c,   [ and f   (x) > 0 for each x    ]  , d[, then f has a strict

min at   . likewise, if f      (  ) exists and is positive, then f has a strict min at   .

proof. we just present the proof for (a); (b) is proved analogously. if f   (x) > 0 for each
x    ]c,   [, then (9.23) shows f (  )    f (a) > 0 for each c < a <   ; analogously, if f   (x) < 0

have shown f to have a strict max at   . if f      (  ) exists and is negative, then lem. 9.19

f   (x) = ex + x ex = (1 + x) ex,

from th. 9.14, we know that f can have at most one extremum, namely at    =    1,
where f   (  ) = 0. since f      (  ) = e   x > 0, th. 9.20(b) implies that f has a strict min at
   1.

9.4 l   h  opital   s rule

we need a slight generalization of the mean value th. 9.17:

theorem 9.22. let a < b. if f, g : [a, b]        r are continuous on the compact interval
[a, b], di   erentiable on the open interval ]a, b[, and g   (x) 6= 0 for each x    ]a, b[, then
there exists       ]a, b[ such that

f (b)     f (a)
g(b)     g(a)

=

f   (  )
g   (  )

.

(9.26)

proof. first note that the mean value th. 9.17 and g    6= 0 imply g(b)    g(a) 6= 0. de   ne
the auxiliary function

h : [a, b]        r,

h(x) := f (x)    (cid:0)g(x)     g(a)(cid:1) f (b)     f (a)

g(b)     g(a)

.

(9.27)

then h is continuous on [a, b] and di   erentiable on ]a, b[. moreover, h(a) = f (a) = h(b).
applying th. 9.17 to h, yields the existence of some       ]a, b[ satisfying h   (  ) = 0.
however, (9.27) implies h   (  ) = 0 is equivalent to (9.26).

(cid:4)

l   h  opital   s rule is a result that can help to determine (function) limits (cf. def. 8.17).

theorem 9.23 (l   h  opital   s rule). let        r and either i =]a,   [ with a <    or
i :=]  , b[ with    < b. moreover, assume f, g : i        r are di   erentiable, g   (x) 6= 0 for
each x     i, and one of the following two conditions (a), (b) is satis   ed:
(a) limx      f (x) = limx      g(x) = 0.
(b) limx      g(x) =     or limx      g(x) =       , where def. 8.17 is extended to the case

       {      ,   } in the obvious way.

then

f   (x)
g   (x)

lim
x     

=        lim
x     

f (x)
g(x)

=   .

(9.28)

the above statement also holds for        {      ,   } and/or        {      ,   } if, as in (b),
one extends def. 8.17 to these cases in the obvious way.

proof. first, we assume (a). consider the case        r. since f and g are continuous, (a)
implies f and g remain continuous, if we extend them to    by letting f (  ) := g(  ) = 0.
this extension will now allow us to apply th. 9.22 to f and g. to prove (9.28), let

(xk)k   n be a sequence in i with limk       xk =   . then (9.26) yields, for each k     n,
some   k    ]xk,   [ if xk <    and some   k    ]  , xk[ if    < xk, satisfying

f (xk)

from the sandwich th. 7.16, we obtain limk         k =   , i.e. (9.29) and limx     
g(x) =    (also for        {      ,   }). now consider the case        {      ,   }
imply limx     
and let (xk)k   n be as before. if    =    , then choose 1     c     i and set   i :=]0, c   1[; if
   =       , then choose    1     c     i and set   i :=]c   1, 0[. we apply what we have already
proved above to the auxiliary functions

  f :   i        r,

  f (x) := f (1/x),

  g :   i        r,

  g(x) := g(1/x)

at      := 0. from the chain rule (9.15), we know   f   (x) =     f    (1/x)
each x       i. thus, limx     

f    (x)

proving limx     
we now assume (b), still letting (xk)k   n be as before. note that g   
6= 0 implies g
is injective by rolle   s th. 9.16. then the intermediate value theorem implies g is
either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. we proceed with the proof for the case
i =]a,   [, the proof for i =]  , b[ can be done completely analogous. we    rst consider
the case where g is strictly increasing, i.e. limx      g(x) =    . assume        r and    > 0.
then limx

10 the riemann integral on intervals in r

10.1 de   nition and simple properties

given a nonnegative function f : m        r+
of the set    under the graph    of f , i.e. of the set

0 , m     r, we aim to compute the arearm f

(cid:8)(x, y)     r2 : x     m and 0     y     f (x)(cid:9).

this area rm f (if it exists) will be called the integral of f over m . moreover, for
functions f : m        r that are not necessarily nonnegative, we would like to count
areas of sets of the form (10.1) (which are below the graph of f and above the set
m    =(cid:8)(x, 0)     r2 : x     m(cid:9)     r2) with a positive sign, and whereas we would like to
count areas of sets above the graph of f and below the set m with a negative sign. in
other words, making use of the positive and negative parts f + and f    of f = f +     f   
as de   ned in (6.1i) and (6.1j), respectively, we would like our integral to satisfy

(10.1)

zm

f =zm

f +    zm

f   .

(10.2)

di   culties arise from the fact that both the function f and the set m can be extremely
complicated. to avoid dealing with complicated sets m , we restrict ourselves to the

10 the riemann integral on intervals in r

140

situation of integrals over compact intervals, i.e. to integrals over sets of the form m =
[a, b]. moreover, we will also restrict ourselves to bounded functions f , which we now
de   ne:
de   nition 10.1. let     6= m     r and f : m        r. then f is called bounded if, and
only if, the set {|f (x)| : x     m}     r+

0 is bounded, i.e. if, and only if,

kfksup := sup{|f (x)| : x     m}     r+
0 .

(10.3)

the basic idea for the de   nition of the riemann integral rm f is rather simple: de-
compose the set m into small pieces i1, . . . , in and approximaterm f by the    nite sum
j=1 f (xj)|ij|, where xj     ij and |ij| denotes the size of the set ij. de   nerm f as the
pn

limit of such sums as the size of the ij tends to zero (if the limit exists). however, to
carry out this idea precisely and rigorously does require some work.

as stated before, we will assume that m is a closed bounded interval, and we will choose
the ij to be closed bounded intervals as well. to emphasize we are dealing with intervals,
in the following, we will prefer to use the symbol i instead of m .
de   nition 10.2. if a, b     r, a     b, and i := [a, b], then we call

|i| := b     a = |a     b|,

(10.4)

the length or the (1-dimensional) size, volume, or measure of i.
de   nition 10.3. given a real interval i := [a, b]     r, a, b     r, a < b, the (n + 1)-tuple
    := (x0, . . . , xn )     rn +1, n     n, is called a partition of i if, and only if, a = x0 <
x1 <        < xn = b. we call x0, . . . , xn the nodes of    , and let   (   ) := {x0, . . . , xn}
be the set of all nodes. a tagged partition of i is a partition together with an n -tuple
(t1, . . . , tn )     rn such that tj     [xj   1, xj] for each j     {1, . . . , n}. given a partition    
(with or without tags) of i as above and letting ij := [xj   1, xj], the number

|   | := max(cid:8)|ij| : j     {1, . . . , n}(cid:9),

is called the mesh size of    . it is sometimes convenient, if we extend our de   nitions to
trivial intervals, consisting of just one point: for a = b, we have i = [a, a] = {a}. we
then de   ne     = x0 = a to be a partition of i,   (   ) = {x0}, and a is then the only tag
that makes     into a tagged partition. we also set i0 := i = {a}, and the mesh size in
this case is |   | := 0.
de   nition 10.4. let     be a partition of i = [a, b]     r, a     b, as in def. 10.3. given
a function f : i        r that is bounded according to def. 10.1, de   ne

g : i        c is denoted by r(i, c). if g     r(i, c), then
re g + izi

is called the riemann integral of g over i.

remark 10.6. if i = [a, b]     r,     is a partition of i, and f : i        r is bounded,
then (10.6) implies

mj(f )

(4.9c)

=    mj(   f )

(10.7) implies

r(   , f ) =    r(   ,   f )

(b) an example of a function that is not riemann integrable for a < b is given by the

dirichlet function

f : [a, b]        r,

for x irrational,
for x rational,

f (x) :=(0
since r(   , f ) = 0 and r(   , f ) =pn
obtains j   (f, i) = 0 6= (b     a) = j   (f, i), showing that f /    r(i).
de   nition 10.8. (a) if     is a partition of [a, b]     r as in def. 10.3, then another
partition        of [a, b] is called a re   nement of     if, and only if,   (   )       (      ), i.e. if,
and only if, the nodes of        include all the nodes of    .

j=1 |ij| = b     a for every partition     of i, one

(10.14)

a < b.

(b) if     and        are partitions of [a, b]     r, then the superposition of     and       , denoted
    +       , is the unique partition of [a, b] having   (   )      (      ) as its set of nodes. note
that the superposition of     and        is always a common re   nement of     and       .

lemma 10.9. let a, b     r, a < b, i := [a, b], and suppose f : i        r is bounded with
m := kfksup     r+

0 . let        be a partition of i and assume

   := #(cid:16)  (      ) \ {a, b}(cid:17)     1

(10.15)

is the number of interior nodes that occur in       . then, for each partition     of i, the
following holds:

r(   , f )     r(    +       , f )     r(   , f ) + 2    m |   |,
r(   , f )     r(    +       , f )     r(   , f )     2    m |   |.

(10.16a)

(10.16b)

proof. we carry out the proof of (10.16a)     the proof of (10.16b) can be conducted
completely analogous. consider the case    = 1 and let    be the single element of
  (      )\{a, b}. if          (   ), then     +        =    , and (10.16a) is trivially true. if    /      (   ),
then xk   1 <    < xk for a suitable k     {1, . . . , n}. de   ne
i       := [  , xk]

(10.17)

i    := [xk   1,   ],

and

then we obtain

m    := inf{f (x) : x     i   }, m       := inf{f (x) : x     i      }.

(10.18)

r(    +       , f )     r(   , f ) = m    |i   | + m       |i      |     mk |ik| = (m        mk)|i   | + (m           mk)|i      |.
(10.19)
together with the observation

0     m        mk     2m,

0     m           mk     2m,

(10.19) implies

0     r(    +       , f )     r(   , f )     2m(cid:0)|i   | + |i      |(cid:1)     2m |   |.

the general form of (10.16a) follows by an induction on   .

theorem 10.10. let a, b     r, a     b, i := [a, b], and let f : i        r be bounded.
(a) suppose     and        are partitions of i such that        is a re   nement of    . then

r(   , f )     r(      , f ), r(   , f )     r(      , f ).

r(   n, f ) = j   (f, i).

(10.25a)

(10.25b)

proof. (a): if        is a re   nement of    , then        =     +       . thus, (10.22) is immediate
from (10.16).

(b): this also follows from (10.16):

r(   , f )

(10.16a)

    r(    +       , f )

(10.7)

    r(    +       , f )

(10.16b)

    r(      , f ).

(10.26)

10 the riemann integral on intervals in r

144

(c): one just combines (10.8) with (b).
(d): for a = b, there is nothing to show. for a < b, let (   n)n   n be a sequence of
partitions of i such that limn       |   n| = 0, and let        be an arbitrary partition of i with
numbers    and m de   ned as in lem. 10.9. then, according to (10.16a):

r(   n, f )     r(   n +       , f )     r(   n, f ) + 2    m |   n|

for each n     n.

(10.27)

from (b), we conclude the sequence(cid:0)r(   n, f )(cid:1)n   n is bounded. according to the bolza-

no-weierstrass th. 7.27, if we can show that the sequence has j   (f, i) as its only cluster
point, then the    rst equality of (10.24) must hold. thus, according to prop. 7.26, it suf-
   ces to show that every converging subsequence of (r(   n, f ))n   n converges to j   (f, i).
to this end, suppose (r(   nk, f ))k   n is a converging subsequence of (r(   n, f ))n   n with
   := limk       r(   nk, f ). first note        j   (f, i) due to the de   nition of j   (f, i). more-
over, (10.27) implies limk       r(   nk +       , f ) =   . since r(      , f )     r(   nk +       , f ) and       
is arbitrary, we obtain j   (f, i)       , i.e. j   (f, i) =   . thus, we have shown that, indeed,
every subsequence of (r(   n, f ))n   n converges to    = j   (f, i). in the same manner, one
conducts the proof of j   (f, i) = limn       r(   n, f ). then (10.25a) is immediate from
the de   nition of riemann integrability, and (10.25b) follows from (10.25a), since (10.7)
implies r(   , f )       (   , f )     r(   , f ) for each tagged partition     of i.
(cid:4)
theorem 10.11. let a, b     r, a     b, i := [a, b].

referred to as the mean value of f on i.

the theorem   s name comes from the fact that, for a < b, |i|   1ri f is sometimes
proof. (a): first, consider k = r, i.e. f, g : i        r and   ,        r. for a = b,
there is nothing to prove, so let a < b. let (   n)n   n be a sequence of partitions of i,
   n = (xn,0, . . . , xn,nn), in,j := [xn,j   1, xn,j], satisfying limn       |   n| = 0. note that, for
each n     n and each j     {1, . . . , nn},

mn,j(f + g) = inf{f (x) + g(x) : x     in,j}

    inf{f (x) : x     in,j} + inf{g(x) : x     in,j}
= mn,j(f ) + mn,j(g),

mn,j(f + g) = sup{f (x) + g(x) : x     in,j}

and j   (  f, i) =    j   (f, i) =    j   (f, i) for        0, j   (  f, i) =    j   (f, i) =    j   (f, i) for

(b): once again, consider k = r    rst. for a = b, there is nothing to prove, so let
a < b. for m = 1, there is still nothing to prove. for m = 2, we have a = y0 <
y1 < y2 = b. consider a sequence (   n)n   n of partitions of i,    n = (xn,0, . . . , xn,nn),
such that limn       |   n| = 0 and y1       (   n) for each n     n. de   ne       n := (xn,0, . . . , y1),

limn       |      n| = limn       |         n| = 0. moreover,

implying j   (f, i) = j   (f, j1)+j   (f, j2) and j   (f, i) = j   (f, j1)+j   (f, j2). this proves
ri f =rj1
f provided f     r(i)     r(j1)     r(j2). so it just remains to show the
claimed equivalence between f     r(i) and f     r(j1)     r(j2). if f     r(j1)     r(j2),
then j   (f, i) = j   (f, j1)+j   (f, j2) = j   (f, j1)+j   (f, j2) = j   (f, i), showing f     r(i).
conversely, j   (f, i) = j   (f, i) implies j   (f, j1) = j   (f, j1) + j   (f, j2)     j   (f, j2)    
j   (f, j1), showing j   (f, j1) = j   (f, j1) and f     r(j1); f     r(j2) follows completely
analogous. the general case now follows by induction on m . if, f     r(i, c), then one
computes, using the real-valued case,

(c): if f, g : i        r are bounded and f     g, then, for each partition     of i, r(   , f )    
r(   , g) and r(   , f )     r(   , g) are immediate from (10.7). as these inequalities are
preserved when taking the sup and the inf, respectively, all claims of (c) are established.
(d): we will see in th. 10.17(c) below, that f     r(i, k) implies |f|     r(i). let     be

proof. suppose, for each    > 0, there exists a partition     of i such that (10.37) is

(10.38)
showing j   (f, i)     j   (f, i). as the opposite inequality always holds, we have j   (f, i) =
j   (f, i), i.e. f     r(i) as claimed. conversely, if f     r(i) and (   n)n   n is a sequence of
partitions of i with limn       |   n| = 0, then (10.25a) implies that, for each    > 0, there
is n     n such that r(   n, f )     r(   n, f ) <    for each n > n .
(cid:4)
the previous theorem will allow us to prove that every continuous function on [a, b] is
riemann integrable. however, we will also need to make use of the following result:

proposition 10.13. let i = [a, b]     r, a     b, f : i        r. if f is continuous, then f
is even uniformly continuous, i.e.

        r+         r+    x,y   i (cid:0)|x     y| <        |f (x)     f (y)| <   (cid:1).

(10.39)

proof. arguing by contraposition, we assume f not to be uniformly continuous on i.
then the negation of (10.39) must hold, i.e.

     0   r+         r+    x,y   i (cid:0)|x     y| <        |f (x)     f (y)|       0(cid:1).

in particular, for each n     n, there exist xn, yn     i such that

|xn     yn| <   n := 1/n

(10.40)

(10.41)

and |f (xn)     f (yn)|       0. then the sequence (xn)n   n is bounded and the bolzano-
weierstrass th. 7.27 provides a convergent subsequence (x  (n))n   n, i.e. there is        r
with limn       x  (n) =   . clearly,        [a, b] and (10.41) implies limn       y  (n) =    as
well. however, due to |f (x  (n))     f (y  (n))|       0 > 0, the sequences (cid:0)f (x  (n))(cid:1)n   n and
(cid:0)f (y  (n))(cid:1)n   n can not both converge to f (  ), showing that f can not be continuous. (cid:4)
caveat 10.14. it is important in prop. 10.13 that f is de   ned on a compact interval i.
the examples f : ]0, 1]        r, f (x) := 1/x, and f : r        r, f (x) := x2 are examples
of continuous functions that are not uniformly continuous.

theorem 10.15. let i = [a, b]     r, a     b.
(a) if f : i        c is continuous, then f is riemann integrable over i.
(b) if f : i        r is increasing or decreasing, then f is riemann integrable over i.
proof. (a): as f is continuous if, and only if, re f and im f are both continuous, it
su   ces to consider a real-valued continuous f . for a = b, there is nothing to prove, so
let a < b. first note that, if f is continuous on i = [a, b], then f is bounded by th.
7.54. moreover, f is uniformly continuous due to prop. 10.13. thus, given    > 0, there

149

is    > 0 such that |x     y| <    implies |f (x)     f (y)| <   /|i| for each x, y     i. then, for
each partition     of i satisfying |   | <   , we obtain

r(   , f )     r(   , f ) =

n

xj=1

(mj     mj)|ij|    

  
|i|

n

xj=1

|ij| =   ,

(10.42)

as |   | <    implies |x     y| <    for each x, y     ij and each j     {1, . . . , n}. finally,
(10.42) implies f     r(i) due to riemann   s integrability criterion of th. 10.12.
(b): suppose f : [a, b]        r is increasing. then f is bounded, as f (a)     f (x)     f (b)
for each x     [a, b].
if f (a) = f (b), then f is constant. thus, assume f (a) < f (b).
moreover, if     = (x0, . . . , xn ) is a partition of i as in def. 10.3, then

(10.43)
thus, given    > 0, we have r(   , f )     r(   , f ) <    for each partition     of i satisfying
|   | <   /(f (b)     f (a)). in consequence, f     r(i), once again due to riemann   s integra-
bility criterion of th. 10.12. if f is decreasing, then    f is increasing, and th. 10.11(a)
establishes the case.
(cid:4)

de   nition and remark 10.16. let m     c. a function f : m        c f is called
lipschitz continuous in m with lipschitz constant l if, and only if,

   l   r+

0

   x,y   m |f (x)     f (y)|     l|x     y|.

(10.44)

every lipschitz continuous function is, indeed, continuous, since, if        m and (yn)n   n
is a sequence in m with limn       yn =   , then (10.44) implies
|f (  )     f (yn)|     l|       yn|,

(10.45)

   n   n

proving limn       f (yn) = f (  ). moreover, it is not too much harder to prove lipschitz
continuous functions are even uniformly continuous, but we will not pursue this right
0        r, f (x) :=    x, is an example of a continuous
now. on the other hand, f : r+
function (actually, even uniformly continuous) that is not lipschitz continuous.

theorem 10.17. let a, b     r, a     b, i := [a, b].
(a) if f     r(i, r) and    : f (i)        c is lipschitz continuous, then        f     r(i, c).
(b) if f     r(i, c) and    : f (i)        r is lipschitz continuous, then        f     r(i, r).
(c) if f     r(i), then |f|, f 2, f +, f        r(i). in particular, we, indeed, have (10.2)
from the introduction (with m replaced by i). if, in addition, there exists    > 0
such that f (x)        for each x     i, then 1/f     r(i). moreover, |f|     r(i) also
holds for f     r(i, c).

(d) if f, g     r(i), then max(f, g), min(f, g)     r(i). if f, g     r(i, k), then   f , f g    
r(i, k). if, in addition, there exists    > 0 such that |g(x)|        for each x     i, then
f /g     r(i, k).

proof. (a),(b): first, we carry out the proof for the case f     r(i),    : f (i)        r.
thus, let f     r(i) and let    : f (i)        r be lipschitz continuous. then there exists
l     0 such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)  (x)       (y)(cid:12)(cid:12)     l|x     y|

for each x, y     f (i).

(10.46)

as f     r(i), given    > 0, th. 10.12 provides a partition     of i such that r(   , f )    
r(   , f ) <   /l, and we obtain

r(   ,        f )     r(   ,        f ) =

= l(cid:0)r(   , f )     r(   , f )(cid:1) <   .

(10.47)

thus,        f     r(i) by another application of th. 10.12. we now prove (a) as stated,
i.e. with    c-valued: assume    to be l-lipschitz, l     0. for each x, y     f (i), one has

| re   (x)     re   (y)|

(10.48a)

(10.48b)

showing re    and im    are l-lipschitz, such that re(       f ) and im(       f ) are rie-
it remains to show (b) as
mann integrable by the real-valued case treated above.
i.e. with f c-valued and    r-valued: assume    : f (i)        r to be l-
stated,
if f     r(i, c), then re f, im f     r(i, r), and, given    > 0,
lipschitz, l     0.
riemann   s integrability criterion of th. 10.12 provides partitions    1,    2 of i such that
r(   1, re f )     r(   1, re f ) <   /2l, r(   2, im f )     r(   2, im f ) <   /2l, where r and r
denote upper and lower riemann sums, respectively (cf. (10.7)). letting     be a joint
re   nement of    1 and    2, we have (cf. def. 10.8(a),(b) and th. 10.10(a))

r(   , re f )     r(   , re f ) <   /2l, r(   , im f )     r(   , im f ) <   /2l.

(10.49)

recalling that, for each g : i        r and     = (x0, . . . , xn )     rn +1, n     n, a = x0 <

thus,        f     r(i, r) by th. 10.12.
(c): |f|, f 2, f +, f        r(i) follows from (b) (for |f| also for f     r(i, c)), since each of
the maps x 7    |x|, x 7    x2, x 7    max{x, 0}, x 7        min{x, 0} is lipschitz continuous
on the bounded set f (i) (recall that f     r(i) implies that f is bounded). since
f = f +     f   , (10.2) is implied by (10.28). finally, if f (x)        > 0, then x 7    x   1 is
lipschitz continuous on the bounded set f (i), and f   1     r(i) follows from (b).
(d): for f, g     r(i), we note that, due to

f g =

(10.52)

max(f, g) = f + (g     f )+,
min(f, g) = g     (f     g)   ,

everything is a consequence of (c). for f, g     r(i, c), due to

  f = (re f,     im f ),
f g = (re f re g     im f im g, re f im g + im f re g),
1/g = (re g/|g|2,     im g/|g|2),

(10.53b)
(10.53c)

(10.53d)
(10.53e)
(10.53f)

everything follows from the real-valued case together with (c) and th. 10.11(a), where
|g|        > 0 guarantees |g|2       2 > 0).

10.2

important theorems

this section compiles a number of important theorems on riemann integrals, which, in
particular, provide powerful tools to actually evaluate such integrals.

10 the riemann integral on intervals in r

152

10.2.1 fundamental theorem of calculus

we provide two variants of the fundamental theorem with slightly di   erent    avors: in
the    rst variant, th. 10.19(a), we start with a function f , obtain another function f
by means of integrating f , and recover f by taking the derivative of f . in the second
variant, th. 10.19(b), one    rst di   erentiates the given function f , obtaining f := f    ,
followed by integrating f , recovering f up to an additive constant.

notation 10.18. if a, b     r, a     b, i := [a, b], f : i        c, then denote

z b

a

f :=zi

f,

[f (t)]b

a := [f ]b

b := f (a)     f (b),

(10.54a)

(10.54b)

where f     r(i, c) for (10.54a).
theorem 10.19. let a, b     r, a < b, i := [a, b].
(a) if f     r(i, k) is continuous in        i, then, for each c     i, the function

fc : i        k, fc(x) :=z x

c

f (t) dt ,

(10.55)

is di   erentiable in    with f    c(  ) = f (  ). in particular, if f     c(i, k), then fc    
c 1(i, k) and f    c(x) = f (x) for each x     i.

(b) if f     c 1(i, k) or, alternatively, f : i        k is di   erentiable with integrable

derivative f         r(i, k), then

f (b)     f (a) = [f (t)]b

a =z b

a

f    (t) dt ,

(10.56a)

and

f (x) = f (c) +z x

c

f    (t) dt

for each c, x     i.

(10.56b)

proof. it su   ces to prove the case k = r, since the case k = c then follows by applying
the case k = r to re fc and im fc (for (a)) and to re f and im f (for (b)). thus, for
the rest of the proof, we assume k = r.

(a): we need to show that

a(h) = 0, where a(h) :=

lim
h   0

fc(   + h)     fc(  )

h

    f (  ).

(10.57)

one computes

a(h) =

(cid:0)f (t)     f (  )(cid:1) dt .

(10.58)

10 the riemann integral on intervals in r

153

now, given    > 0, the continuity of f in    allows us to    nd    > 0 such that |(f (t)   f (  )| <
  /2 for each t     i with |t       | <   . thus, for each h with |h| <   , we obtain

|a(h)|

hz   +h

  

(cid:12)(cid:12)f (t)     f (  )(cid:12)(cid:12) dt    

  h
2h

<   ,

(10.59)

thereby proving limh   0 a(h) = 0, i.e. f (  ) = f    c(  ).
(b): first assume f     c 1(i). then f     is continuous on i, and we can apply (a) to the
function

g : i        r, g(x) :=z x

a

f    (t) dt ,

(10.60)

to obtain g    = f    . thus, for h := f     g, we obtain h        0, showing that h must be
constant on i, i.e. h(x) = h(a) = f (a)     g(a) = f (a) for each x     i. evaluating at
x = b yields

f (a) = h(b) = f (b)    z b

a

f    (t) dt ,

(10.61)

thereby establishing the case.

now we consider the remaining case of a di   erentiable f with integrable derivative
f         r(i). consider a partition     = (x0, . . . , xn ) of i as in def. 10.3. then, for
each j     {1, . . . , n}, the mean value theorem provides   j    ]xj   1, xj[ such that f (xj)    
f (xj   1) = (xj     xj   1) f    (  j). thus,

f (b)     f (a) =

n

xj=1(cid:0)f (xj)     f (xj   1)(cid:1) =

n

xj=1
(xj     xj   1) f    (  j) =   (   , f    ).

(10.62)

if we choose a sequence of partitions     of i such that |   |     0, then the integrability of
f implies that the right-hand side of (10.62) converges tor b
a f    , once again establishing
the case.
(cid:4)
de   nition 10.20. if i     r, f : i        k, and f : i        k is a di   erentiable function
with f     = f , then f is called a primitive or antiderivative of f .

example 10.21. due to the fundamental theorem, if we know a function   s antideriva-
tive, we can easily compute its integral over a given interval. here are three simple

10.2.3 change of variables

theorem 10.24. let i, j     r be intervals,        c 1(i) and f     c(j, c). if   (i)     j,
then the following change of variables formula holds for each a, b     i:
(f       )      .

(f       )   (x) =      (x)f (  (x)).

(f       )    : i        c,

improper integrals

for our de   nition of the riemann integral in def. 10.5, it was important that we con-
sidered bounded functions on compact intervals (where the boundedness of the intervals
was more important than the closedness)     for unbounded functions and/or unbounded
intervals, even def. 10.4 of lower and upper riemann sums no longer makes sense.

still, for su   ciently benign functions, it is possible to extend the notion of a de   nite
riemann integral to both unbounded intervals and unbounded functions, and in such
situations we will speak of improper integrals (cf. def. 10.29 below).

de   nition 10.26. let     6= i     r be an interval. we call f : i        r to be locally
riemmann integrable if, and only if, f     r(j) for each compact interval j     i. let
rloc(i) denote the set of all locally riemmann integrable functions on i.
remark 10.27. in particular, locally riemmann integrable functions are bounded on
every compact interval. moreover, rloc(i) = r(i) if, and only if, i is a compact interval.
for example, for each a, b     r with a < b, the function given by the assignment rule

f (x) :=

1

(x     a)(x     b)

is clearly locally riemmann integrable, but not bounded on each of the intervals ]      , a[,
]a, b[, and ]b,   [.

   

before we can de   ne improper riemann integrals, we de   ne, in partial extension of def.
8.17:

de   nition 10.28. let m     r.
if m is unbounded from above (resp. below, then
f : m        k is said to tend to        k (or to have the limit        k) for x         (resp., for
x           ) (denoted by limx         f (x) =   ) if, and only if, for each sequence (  k)k   n in m
with limk         k =     (resp. with limk         k =       ), the sequence (f (  k))k   n converges
to        k, i.e.

lim

f (x) =

all the above limits of riemann integrals (if they exist) are called improper riemann
integrals. in each case, if the limit exists, we call f improperly riemann integrable and
write f     r(i).
remark 10.30. (a) the de   nitions in def. 10.29 are consistent with what occurs if
the limits are proper riemann integrals: let a, c, b     r, a < c < b, and f     r[a, b].

as an improper integral, then we call the improper integralri f absolutely convergent.

   

before we can proceed to prop. 10.35 about convergence criteria for improper integrals,
we need to prove the analogon of th. 7.19 for limits of functions.
proposition 10.34. let     6= m     r, a     r     {      }, b     r     {   }, and assume

if f is increasing and a is not bounded from above,

sup a if f is increasing and a is bounded from above,
   
inf a if f is decreasing and a is bounded from below,
       if f is decreasing and a is not bounded from below,
sup a if f is decreasing and a is bounded from above,

if f is decreasing and a is not bounded from above,

proof. we prove (10.82a) for the case, where f is increasing     the remaining case of
(10.82a) as well as (10.82b) can be proved completely analogous. let (xk)k   n be a
sequence in m \ {b} such that limk       xk = b. we have to show that limk       f (xk) =   ,
where    := sup a for a bounded from above and    :=     for a not bounded from above.
seeking a contradiction, assume limk       f (xk) =    does not hold. due to the choice of
b, there then must be    > 0 and a subsequence (yk)k   n of (xk)k   n such that (yk)k   n is
strictly increasing and

gent.

since limk       yk = b and f is increasing, this means sup a               or sup a =   , which
means a contradiction in each case. thus, limk       f (xk) =    must hold and the proof
is complete.
(cid:4)
proposition 10.35. let a < c < b (a =       , b =     is admissible). let i    ]a, b[ be
one of the three kinds of intervals occurring in def. 10.29 (i.e. i = [c, b[, i =]a, c], or
i =]a, b[), and assume f     rloc(i).
(a) if g     rloc(i), 0     f     g, and ri g exists, then ri f exists as well. conversely, if
(b) if ri f is an improper integral that is absolutely convergent, then it is also conver-
analogous, and the case i =]a, b[ then also follows. first, suppose 0     f     g, and ri g
exists. since 0     f , the function

0     g     f and ri g diverges, then ri f diverges as well.

proof. (a): we consider the case i = [c, b[     the proof for the case i =]a, c] is completely

f : [c, b[       r+

0 , f (x) :=z x
g    z b
f    z x
f is also bounded from above (in the sense that {f (x) : x     [c, b[} is bounded from
above), i.e. prop. 10.34 yields that limx   b f (x) = limx   br x
now suppose 0     g     f andri g diverges. as the function f above, the function
