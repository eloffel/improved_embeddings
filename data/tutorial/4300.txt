introduction to  calculus 


1.4  velocity and distance 

the  right  way  to  begin  a  calculus  book  is  with  calculus.  this  chapter  will jump 
directly into the  two  problems  that the subject was invented  to solve. you  will  see 
what the questions are, and you will see an important part of  the answer. there are 
plenty of  good  things left for the other chapters, so why not get started? 

the book  begins with an example that is familiar to everybody who drives a car. 
driver  sees it  happening.  the example  is  the  relation 
it  is  calculus  in  action-the 
between  the  speedometer  and  the  odometer.  one measures  the  speed  (or  velocity); 
the other measures the distance traveled. we will write v for the velocity, and f for 
how far the car has gone. the two instruments sit together on the dashboard: 

fig. 1.1  velocity  v and total distance f (at one instant of time). 

notice  that the units  of  measurement  are different for  v  and f.the distance f is 
measured in kilometers or miles (it is easier to say miles). the velocity v  is measured 
in  km/hr or miles per  hour. a  unit  of  time enters the velocity  but  not  the distance. 
every formula to compute v  from f will have f divided by  time. 

the central question of calculus is the relation between v  and f. 

1  introduction to calculus 

can you find v if  you know f ,  and vice versa, and how? if we know the velocity over 
the whole history of the car, we should be able to compute the total distance traveled. 
in other words, if  the speedometer record is complete but the odometer is missing, 
its information could be recovered. one way  to do it (without calculus) is to put in 
a new odometer and drive the car all over again at the right speeds. that seems like 
a  hard  way;  calculus may  be  easier. but  the  point  is  that  the  information  is  there. 
if  we  know everything about v, there must be a method to find f .  

what happens in the opposite direction, when f  is known? if you have a complete 
record of distance, could you recover the complete velocity? in principle you could drive 
the car, repeat the history, and read off the speed. again there must be a better way. 
the whole subject  of calculus is built on the relation between u and f .  the question 
we  are raising here is not some kind  of joke,  after which  the book  will  get serious 
and the mathematics will  get  started. on the contrary, i am serious  now-and 
the 
mathematics has already started. we need to know how to find the velocity from a 
record  of  the  distance.  (that  is  called  &@erentiation,  and  it  is  the  central  idea  of 
dflerential  calculus.) we  also  want  to  compute  the  distance from  a  history  of  the 
velocity. (that is integration, and it is the goal of  integral calculus.) 

differentiation  goes  from  f  to  v; integration  goes  from  v  to  f .   we  look  first 

at examples in which these pairs can be computed and understood. 

constant velocity 

suppose  the  velocity  is  fixed  at  v = 60 (miles  per  hour).  then  f  increases  at  this 
constant  rate.  after  two  hours  the  distance  is  f  = 120  (miles). after  four  hours 
f  = 240  and after  t  hours f  = 60t. we  say that  f  increases  linearly with  time-its 
graph is a straight line.

fig. 1.2  constant velocity v = 60 and linearly increasing distance f = 60t. 

notice that this example starts the car at full velocity. no time is spent picking up 
speed. (the velocity is a "step function.") notice also that the distance starts at zero; 
the car is new. those decisions make the graphs of  v and f  as neat as possible. one 
is the horizontal line v = 60. the other is the sloping line f  = 60t. this v, f ,  t relation 
needs algebra but not calculus: 

if v is constant and f starts at zero then f = vt. 

the opposite  is also true.  when f  increases linearly, v  is constant.  the division  by 
time  gives  the  slope.  the  distance is fl  = 120  miles  when  the  time  is  t 1  = 2  hours. 
later f' = 240 at t ,  = 4. at both points, the ratio f / t  is 60 miles/hour. geometrically, 
the velocity is the slope of  the distance graph: 

slope = 

change in distance - vt
t 

change in time 

- - -  
- v.

1.1  velocity and distance 

fig. 1.3  straight lines f = 20 + 60t (slope 60) and f = -30t  (slope  -30). 

the slope of the f-graph  gives the v-graph. figure 1.3  shows two more possibilities: 

1.  the distance starts at 20  instead of  0. the distance formula  changes from  60t 

to 20 + 60t. the number 20 cancels when we  compute change in  distance-so 
the slope is still 60. 

2.  when v is negative, the graph off  goes downward. the car goes backward  and 

the slope off = - 30t is v = - 30. 

i don't  think  speedometers go below zero.  but driving backwards,  it's  not  that safe 
to watch.  if  you go fast enough, toyota  says they  measure "absolute  valuesw-the 
speedometer reads + 30 when the velocity is  - 30. for the odometer, as far as i know 
it just  stops. it should go backward.? 

velocity  vs. distance: slope  vs. area 

how  do you  compute f' from  v?  the  point  of  the  question  is  to  see  f  = ut  on  the 
graphs. we want to start with the graph of  v and discover the graph off. amazingly, 
the opposite of  slope is area. 

the distance f  is the area under the v-graph. when  v is constant, the region  under 
the graph is a rectangle.  its height is v, its width is t, and its area is v times t. this is 
integration, to go from v  to f  by  computing the  area. we  are glimpsing two  of  the 
central facts of  calculus. 

1a  the slope  of  the f-graph  gives  the  velocity  v.  the area  under  the v-graph 
gives the distance f. 

that is certainly  not  obvious, and  i hesitated a long time before i wrote it down in 
this first section. the best way to understand  it is to look first at more examples. the 
whole point of  calculus is to deal with velocities that are not constant, and from now 
on v has several values. 

example 
(forward and back) there is a motion that you will understand right away. 
the car goes forward with velocity  v,  and comes back  at the same speed. to say it 
more correctly,  the  velocity  in the second  part  is  - v.  if  the forward  part  lasts until 
t = 3, and the backward part continues to t = 6, the car will come back where it started. 
the total distance after both  parts will be f = 0. 

-- 

+this actually happened in ferris bueller's  day 08,when the hero borrowed his father's  sports 
car  and  ran  up  the  mileage.  at  home  he  raised  the  car  and  drove  in  reverse.  i  forget  if  it 
worked. 

1  introductionto calculus 

1u(r) = slope of f ( t )  

fig. 1.4  velocities + v and  - v give motion forward and back, ending at f(6)=0. 

the v-graph shows velocities + v and  - v.  the distance starts up with slope + v 
and reaches f = 3v.  then the car starts backward. the distance goes down with slope 
- v and returns to f = 0 at t = 6. 

notice  what  that means.  the total area "under"  the  v-graph is zero! a  negative 
velocity makes the  distance graph go downward (negative slope). the car is moving 
backward. area  below the axis in the v-graph is counted as negative. 

functions 

this forward-back example gives practice with a crucially important idea-the 
cept of  a "jiunction." we seize this golden opportunity to explain functions: 

con-

the number v(t) is the value of the function  t. at the time t. 

the time  t is the input  to the function.  the velocity  v(t) at that  time is  the output. 
most people  say "v  oft"  when they  read  v(t).  the number  "v  of  2"  is the  velocity 
when  t = 2.  the forward-back  example has v(2) = + v and v(4) = - v.  the function 
contains the whole history, like a memory bank  that has a record  of  v  at each t. 

it is simple to convert forward-back  motion into a formula. here is v(t): 

the ,right side contains the instructions for finding v(t). the input t is converted into 
the output  + v  or  - v.  the velocity v(t) depends on  t.  in  this  case the  function  is 
"di~continuo~s,~'because the needle jumps at t = 3.  the velocity is not dejined at that 
instant. there is no v(3). (you might  argue that  v  is zero at the jump,  but  that leads 
to trouble.) the graph off'  has a corner, and we  can't  give its slope. 

the problem  also involves a  second function, namely the distance. the principle 
behind f(t) is the  same: f (t) is the distance at time t.  it is the  net  distance  forward, 
and again the instructions change at t = 3. in the forward  motion, f(t) equals  vt  as 
before. in the backward half, a calculation  is built into the formula for f(t): 

at  the  switching time  the  right  side gives two  instructions (one on each  line). this 
would  be  bad  except  that  they  agree:  f (3)= 3 v . v h e  distance  function  is  "con-

1.1  velocity and distance 

tinuous." there is no jump in f, even when there is a jump in v.  after t = 3 the distance 
decreases because of  - vt.  at  t = 6 the second instruction  correctly gives f (6) = 0. 

notice something more. the functions were given by graphs before they were given 
by  formulas. the graphs tell you f and v  at every time  t-sometimes  more clearly 
than the formulas. the values f (t) and v(t) can also be given by  tables or equations 
or a  set  of  instructions.  (in some way  all functions are instructions-the 
function 
tells  how  to  find  f  at  time  t.)  part  of  knowing  f  is  knowing  all  its  inputs  and 
outputs-its  domain and range: 

the domain of a function  is the set  of inputs. the range is the set of outputs. 

the domain  of  f  consists of  all times 0 < t < 6.  the range consists of  all distances 
0 <f(t) < 3v.  (the  range  of  v  contains  only  the  two  velocities  + v  and  - v.) 
we  mention  now,  and  repeat  later,  that  every  "linear"  function  has  a  formula 
f (t) = vt + c. its graph is a line and v is the slope. the constant c moves the line up 
and down. it adjusts the line to go through any desired starting point. 

summary: more about  functions 

may i collect together the ideas brought out by this example? we had two functions 
v  and  f.  one  was  velocity,  the  other  was  distance.  each  function  had  a  domain, 
and  a  range,  and  most  important  a graph.  for  the  f-graph  we  studied  the  slope 
(which agreed  with  v).  for  the  v-graph we  studied the area (which agreed with  f). 
calculus produces functions in  pairs,  and  the  best  thing a book  can do early is  to 
show you  more of  them.

note about the definition of a function.  the idea behind the symbol f (t) is absolutely 
crucial to mathematics. words don't do it justice! by definition, a function is a "rule" 
that assigns one member of  the range to each member of  the domain. or, a function 
is a set of pairs (t, f (t)) with no t appearing twice. (these are "ordered  pairs" because 
we  write t before f (t).) both of those definitions are correct-but 
somehow they are 
too passive. 

in practice what matters is the active part. the number f (t) is produced from the 
number t. we  read a graph, plug into a formula, solve an equation, run a computer 
program.  the input  t is  "mapped"  to the output f(t), which  changes as t changes. 
calculus is about the rate of change. this rate is our other function v. 

fig. 1.5  subtracting 2 from f affects the range. subtracting 2 from  t  affects the domain. 

1  introduction to calculus 

it is quite hard at the beginning, and not automatic, to see the difference between 
f (t) - 2 and f (t - 2). those are both new functions, created  out of  the original f (t). 
in f (t)- 2, we  subtract  2 from all the distances. that moves the whole graph down. 
in f(t - 2), we  subtract  2 from  the  time.  that  moves  the  graph  over  to  the  right. 
figure 1.5 shows both  movements,  starting from f (t) = 2t + 1. the formula  to find 
f (t - 2) is 2(t - 2) + 1, which is 2t - 3. 

a graphing calculator also moves the graph, when you change the viewing window. 
you  can pick  any  rectangle  a < t < b,  c <f(t) < d.  the screen  shows that  part  of 
the graph. but on the calculator, the function f ( t )remains the same. it is the axes that 
get renumbered. in our figures the axes stay the same and the function is changed. 
there are two more basic ways to change a function. (we are always creating new 
is what mathematics is all about.) instead of  subtracting or adding, 
functions-that 
we can multiply the distance by 2. figure  1.6 shows 2f  (t). and instead of  shifting the 
time, we  can speed  it up.  the function  becomes  f(2t). everything happens twice as 
fast  (and  takes  half  as  long).  on  the  calculator  those  changes  correspond  to  a 
"zoom"-on 

the f axis or the t axis. we soon come back  to zooms.

1.1  exercises 

each section of the book contains read-through questions. they 
allow you  to outline the section yourself-more  actively than 
reading a summary. this is probably the best way to remember 
the important ideas.

1.2  calculus without  limits 

the next page is going to reveal one of  the key ideas behind calculus. the discussion 
is just  about  numbers-functions 
and  slopes can wait.  the  numbers  are  not  even 
special, they can be any numbers. the crucial point  is to look at their differences: 

suppose the numbers are f =  0 
their differences are v  =

the differences are printed in between, to show 2 -0 = 2 and 6 - 2 = 4 and 7 - 6 = 1. 

1.2  calculus without limits

notice  how  4 - 7 gives  a negative  answer  -3.  the numbers  in f  can go  up or down,
the differences  in v can  be positive  or negative. the idea  behind calculus  comes  when
you  add up  those differences:

2+4+1-3+5=9

the  sum  of differences  is  9. this  is  the last  number  on  the top  line  (in f). is  this an
accident,  or  is  this  always  true?  if we  stop  earlier, after  2 + 4 + 1, we  get  the 7 in  f.
test  any  prediction  on  a  second  example:

suppose  the numbers  are  f=  1 
their  differences  are  v =

10

the  f's are  increased  by  1. the  differences are  exactly the  same-no change.  the
sum of differences  is  still 9. but  the last  f  is now  10.  that  prediction  is not  right, we
don't always  get  the last f.

the  first  f  is  now  1. the  answer  9 (the  sum  of  differences)  is  10  - 1, the  last f

minus the first f.  what  happens  when  we  change  the f's in  the  middle?

suppose  the numbers  are  f=  1 
their  differences  are  v =

12

-5 

10

the  differences  add  to 4 + 7 - 5 + 3 = 9. this  is  still  10  - 1. no  matter  what f's we
choose  or  how  many,  the  sum  of differences  is  controlled  by  the  first  f  and  last f.
if this is  always  true,  there must  be  a clear  reason  why  the  middle f's cancel out.

the sum  of differences is (5 - 1) + (12  - 5) + (7 - 12) + (10  - 7) = 10 - 1.

the 5's  cancel, the 12's  cancel, and the 7's cancel. it is only  10 - 1 that doesn't cancel.
this  is  the key  to calculus!

example  1  the  numbers  grow  linearly:  f=  2 

their  differences  are  constant:  v =  1

the sum of differences  is certainly 5. this agrees with  7 - 2 =fast -ffirst.  the numbers
in  v remind  us  of constant  velocity.  the  numbers  in  f  remind  us  of a straight  line
f= vt + c.  this  example  has  v = 1 and  the  f's  start  at  2. the  straight  line  would
come  from f= t + 2.

1 + 3 + 5 + 7 agrees  with  42 = 16.  it is  a  beautiful  fact  that  the  first j odd  numbers
always  add up  to j2. the  v's are  the  odd numbers,  the  f's are  perfect  squares.
note  the  letter j  is  sometimes  useful  to  tell  which  number  in f  we  are  looking  at.
for  this example  the zeroth  number  is fo = 0  and  the jth number  is fj =j2. this  is a
part  of algebra,  to give  a formula for the f's instead  of a list  of numbers. we  can also
use j  to  tell  which  difference  we  are  looking  at.  the  first  v is  the  first  odd  number
v, = 1. the jth difference  is  the jth odd number  vj = 2j-  1. (thus  v4  is  8 - i = 7.)  it
is  better  to  start  the differences  with j = 1, since  there is  no  zeroth  odd  number  vo.
with  this notation  the jth  difference  is  vj =fj -f  -1. sooner  or  later  you  will  get
comfortable  with  subscripts like j and j - 1, but it  can  be later.  the important  point
is that the sum  of the v's equals  flast -first.  we now connect  the  v's to slopes and the
f's to  areas.

fig.  1.7  linear  increase  in  v =  1, 3, 5, 7.  squares  in  the  distances  f= 0,  1, 4, 9,  16.

figure  1.7  shows  a natural  way to  graph  example  2, with  the  odd numbers  in  v and
the squares in f.  notice an important difference  between  the v-graph  and the f-graph.
the  graph  of f  is  "piecewise linear."  we  plotted  the  numbers  in  f  and  connected
them  by  straight  lines.  the  graph  of v is  "piecewise constant." we  plotted  the  differ-
ences  as  constant  over  each  piece.  this  reminds  us  of the  distance-velocity  graphs,
when  the  distance  f(t) is  a  straight  line  and the  velocity  v(t)  is  a horizontal  line.

now  make  the  connection  to  slopes:

the  slope  of the f-graph  is  distance 

distance  up 

distance  across 

change  in  f
change  in
change in  t

over each piece, the change in t (across) is 1. the change in f  (upward) is the difference
that  we  are  calling  v. the  ratio is  the  slope  v/1l  or just  v. the  slope  makes  a  sudden
change  at  the  breakpoints  t = 1, 2, 3, ....  at  those  special  points  the  slope  of  the
f-graph  is  not  defined-we  connected  the  v's  by  vertical  lines  but  this  is  very
debatable.  the  main idea  is  that between  the  breakpoints,  the  slope  of f(t) is  v(t).

now  make  the  connection  to  areas:

the total area under the v-graph is  flast -ffirst

this area, underneath  the staircase  in figure  1.7,  is composed  of rectangles. the base
of every  rectangle  is  1. the  heights  of  the  rectangles  are  the  v's.  so  the  areas  also
equal  the  v's, and  the total  area  is  the  sum  of the  v's.  this  area  is  flast -first.

even  more  is  true.  we  could  start  at  any  time  and  end  at  any  later  time
necessarily  at  the  special  times  t = 0,  1, 2, 3, 4.  suppose  we  stop  at  t = 3.5.
-not 
only  half of the  last  rectangular  area  (under v = 7) will be  counted.  the  total  area  is
1 + 3 + 5 +  2(7) = 12.5.  this still  agrees  with flast  -first  = 12.5 - 0. at  this new ending
time  t = 3.5,  we  are  only  halfway  up  the  last  step in  the f-graph.  halfway  between
9 and  16  is  12.5.

this  is  nothing  less  than  the  fundamental  theorem  of calculus.  but  we  have  only
used  algebra  (no curved  graphs  and  no  calculations  involving  limits).  for  now  the
theorem  is restricted to piecewise linear f(t) and piecewise  constant  v(t). in chapter 5
that  restriction  will be  overcome.

notice  that a proof of 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 42  is suggested  by  figure  1.7a.  the  triangle
under  the  dotted  line  has  the  same  area  as  the  four rectangles  under  the  staircase.
-4 8, which  is  the  perfect  9quare  42
the  area  of the  triangle  is    . base . height = 
when  there  are j  rectangles  instead  of 4,  we  get 

.j.  2j =j2 for  the  area.

1.2  calculus wnhout limits 

the next  examples show other patterns, where f and v  increase exponentially or 
oscillate around zero. i hope you like them but i don't  think you have to learn them. 
they  are like the special functions 2'  and  sin t and  cos t-except 
they  go in  steps. 
you get a first look at the important functions of calculus, but you only need algebra. 
calculus is needed for  a steadily changing velocity, when the graph off 

is curved. 

the last  example will  be  income  tax-which 

really  does go. in  steps. then  sec- 
tion  1.3 will  introduce the  slope of  a  curve. the crucial step for curves is working 
with limits. that will take us from algebra to calculus. 

exponential velocity and distance 

start with the numbers f = 1,2,4,8, 16. these are "powers of 2."  they start with the 
zeroth power, which is 2'  = 1. the exponential starts at 1 and not 0. after j steps there 
are j factors of  2,  and & equals 2j. please recognize the diflerence between 2j and j2 
and 2j. the numbers 2j grow linearly, the numbers j2grow quadratically, the numbers 
2'  grow exponentially. at j = 10 these are 20  and  100 and  1024. the exponential 2' 
quickly becomes much larger than the others. 

the differences off = 1,2,4,8, 16 are exactly v = 1,2,4,8.. we get the same beauti- 
ful numbers.  when the f's  are powers  of  2,  so are  the  v's.  the formula vj = 2"-' 
is 
slightly different from & = 2j, because the first v  is numbered v,.  (then v,  = 2'  = 1. 
the zeroth power of every number is 1, except that 0'  is meaningless.) the two graphs 
in  figure 1.8 use  the same numbers but  they look different, because f is piecewise 
linear and  v  is piecewise constant.

fig. 1.8  the velocity and distance grow exponentially (powers of 2). 

where will calculus come in? it works with the smooth curve f (t)= 2'.  this expo- 
nential growth is critically important for population  and money in a bank  and the 
national debt. you  can spot it by  the following test: v(t) is proportional to f (t). 
remark  the  function  2'  is  trickier  than  t2. for  f = t2 the  slope is  v = 2t.  it  is 
proportional  to t and  not  t2. for f = 2'  the slope is  v = c2',  and  we  won't  find the 
constant  c = .693 ... until  chapter 6.  (the number  c is  the  natural logarithm  of  2.) 
problem 37 estimates c with a calculator-the 
important thing is that it's  constant. 

oscillating velocity and  distance 

we have seen a forward-back motion, velocity  v followed by  - v.  that is oscillation 
of  the simplest kind. the graph off  goes linearly up and linearly down. figure 1.9 
shows another oscillation that returns to zero, but the path is more interesting. 

the numbers in f are now 0, 1, 1,0, -1, -l,o. since f6  = 0 the motion brings us 

back to the start. the whole oscillation can be  repeated. 

1  lnhoductlonto calculus 

the differences in v  are 1,0, -1,  -1,0,  1. they add up to zero, which agrees with 
jast  -airst. it is the same oscillation as in f (and also repeatable), but shifted in time. 
the f-graph  resembles (roughly) a sine  curve. the v-graph resembles (even more 
roughly) a cosine curve. the waveforms in nature are smooth curves, while these are 
"digitized"-the  way  a digital watch goes forward in jumps. you recognize that the 
change from analog to digital brought the computer revolution. the same revolution 
is coming in cd players. digital signals (off or on, 0 or 1 )  seem to win every time. 
the piecewise v  and f start again at t = 6. the ordinary sine and cosine repeat at 
the "period" is 6 or 2n. (with t in degrees 
full circle. the period becomes 2n when angles are measured in 
are degrees times 2n/360.) a watch 

t =2n. a repeating motion is periodic-here 
the period is 360-a 
radians. we  virtually always use radians-which 
has a period of  12 hours. if  the dial shows am  and pm,  the period is 

. 

fig. 1.9  piecewise constant "cosine" and piecewise linear "sine." they both repeat. 

a short burst o f  speed 

the next example is a car that is driven fast for a short time. the speed is  v until 
the  distance reaches  f = 1, when  the  car  suddenly stops. the  graph  of  f  goes  up 
linearly with  slope  v ,  and then across with  slope zero: 

v(t) = 

v  u p t o  
0  after 

t = t  

t = t 

f (0= 

vt  up to 
after 
1 

t = t 
t = t 

this is  another example of  "function  notation."  notice the  general  time  t  and  the 
particular stopping time t. the distance is f (t). the domain off  (the inputs) includes 
all times t 3 0. the range of  f (the outputs) includes all distances 0 ff < 1. 

figure 1.10 allows us to compare three cars-a 

jeep and a corvette and a maserati. 
they have different speeds but  they all reach f = 1. so the areas under the v-graphs 
are all 1. the rectangles have height  v and base  t = 1/ v.

optional remark 
it is natural to think about faster and faster speeds, which means 
steeper slopes. the f-graph  reaches  1 in  shorter  times. the extreme case is  a  step 
function,  when  the graph  of  f goes straight  up. this is the unit step  u(t),which  is 
zero up to t =0 and jumps  immediately to  u = 1 for t >0. 

1.2  calculus without limits 

13

what  is the slope  of the step function?  it is zero except  at the jump. at that moment,
which  is  t = 0,  the slope  is  infinite. we  don't have  an  ordinary  velocity  v(t)-instead
we  have  an  impulse  that  makes  the  car jump.  the  graph  is  a  spike  over  the  single
point  t = 0,  and it  is  often denoted  by  6-so the  slope  of  the step function  is  called
a  "delta function." the  area  under  the infinite  spike  is  1.

you  are  absolutely  not  responsible  for  the  theory  of  delta  functions!  calculus  is

about  curves,  not jumps.

our  last example  is  a real-world  application of slopes  ands rates-to explain  "how
taxes  work."  note  especially  the  difference  between  tax  rates  and tax  brackets  and
total  tax. the  rates  are  v, the  brackets  are on  x, the total  tax  is  f.

example  3 

income  tax is piecewise  linear.  the  slopes  are  the  tax rates  .15,.28,.31.

suppose  you  are  single  with  taxable  income  of x dollars  (form  1040,  line  37-after
all  deductions).  these  are  the  1991  instructions  from  the internal  revenue  service:

if x  is not  over  $20,350,  the  tax is  15%  of x.
if $20,350  < x < $49,300,  the tax  is  $3052.50  + 28%  of the  amount  over  $20,350.
if x  is  over  $49,300,  the tax  is  $11,158.50  + 31%  of the  amount  over  $49,300.

the  first  bracket  is  0 < x < $20,350.  (the irs  never  uses  this symbol  <,  but  i  think
it is ok here. we know  what it means.) the second bracket  is  $20,350  < x < $49,300.
the  top bracket  x > $49,300  pays tax at  the top rate of 31%.  but only the income  in
that bracket  is  taxed  at  that  rate.

figure  1.11  shows the rates and the brackets and  the tax due. those are not average
rates, they  are  marginal rates. total tax divided by total  income would be the average
rate. the marginal rate of.28 or .31  gives the tax on each additional dollar of income-
it  is the  slope at the point  x. tax is  like area or distance-it adds  up. tax  rate is like
slope  or  velocity-it  depends where  you are. this  is often  unclear  in the news  media.

answer  the  bracket  begins  at  x = $49,300  when  the  tax  is  f(x) = $11,158.50.  the
slope  of the line is  the tax rate  .31.  when  we  know a point  on  the line and the slope,
we  know  the equation. this  is  important  enough  to  be  highlighted.

section  2.3  presents  this "point-slope  equation"  for any  straight line.  here  you  see it
for one  specific  example.  where does  the number  $11,158.50  come  from?  it is  the tax
at  the end  of the  middle  bracket,  so it  is the  tax  at the  start of the top  bracket.

1  introduction to calculus 

figure 1.11  also  shows  a  distance-velocity  example.  the  distance  at  t = 2  is 
f (2)= 40  miles. after  that  time  the  velocity  is  60 miles  per  hour.  so the line with 
slope 60 on the f-graph  has the equation 

f (t) = starting distance + extra distance =40 + 60(t - 2). 

the starting  point  is (2'40). the new  speed 60 multiplies the extra time  t - 2.  the 
point-slope equation makes sense.  we now  review this section, with comments. 

central idea  start with any numbers in f. their differences go in v.  then the sum 
of  those differences is ha,,-ffirst. 
subscript notation  the numbers are f,,  fl, ... and the first difference is v,  =fl -f,. 
a typical number is fi and the jth  difference is vj =fi -fi-
. when those differences 
are added, all f's  in the middle (like f,)  cancel out: 

examples  fi =j or j2or 2'.  then vj = 1 (constant) or 2j - 1 (odd numbers) or 2'-  '. 

functions  connect  the  f's  to  be  piecewise linear. then  the  slope  v  is  piecewise 
constant. the area under the v-graph from any t,,,,,  to any ten, equals f (ten,)-f (t,,,,,). 

units  distance in miles and velocity in miles per hour. tax in dollars and tax rate 
in (dollars paid)/(dollars earned). tax rate is a percentage like .28, with no units.

1.3  the velocity at an instant 

we  have arrived at the central problems that calculus was invented to solve. there 
are two questions, in opposite directions, and i hope you could see them coming. 

1.  if  the velocity is changing, how  can you  compute the distance traveled? 
2.  if  the graph of  f(t) is not  a straight line, what  is its slope? 

find  the distance from the velocity, find the velocity from the distance. our goal is 
to do both-but 
not  in  one section. calculus may  be  a good  course, but  it is  not 
magic. the first step is to let the velocity change in the steadiest possible way. 
question 1  suppose  the  velocity at each time t is v(t) = 2t. find f (t). 
with zr=  2t, a physicist would say that the acceleration is constant (it equals 2). the 
driver steps on the  gas, the  car accelerates, and  the speedometer goes steadily up. 
and faster. if we  measure t in seconds and v in feet 
the distance goes up too-faster 
per  second, the distance f comes out in feet. after  10 seconds the  speed is  20 feet 
per  second. after  44  seconds the  speed  is  88 feetlsecond  (which is  60 miles/hour). 
the acceleration is clear, but  how far  has the car gone? 

1.3  the velocity at an instant 

question 2  the distance traveled by time t is f  ( t )= t2. find the velocity v(t). 
the graph off (t)= t2 is on the right of figure 1.12. it is a parabola. the curve starts 
at zero, when the car is new. at  t = 5 the distance is f = 25. by  t = 10, f  reaches 100. 
velocity is distance divided by time, but what happens when the speed is changing? 
dividing  f =  100  by  t = 10  gives  v = 10-the 
average  veeocity  over  the  first  ten 
seconds. dividing f = 121 by t = 11 gives the average speed over 11 seconds. but how 
do we  find the instantaneous velocity-the 
reading on the speedometer at the exact 
instant when  t = lo?

i hope you see the problem. as  the car goes faster, the graph of  t 2  gets steeper- 

because more distance is covered in each second. the average velocity between t = 10 
and  t = 11 is a good approximation-but  only an approximation-to 
the speed at 
the moment  t = 10. averages are easy to find: 

average  velocity  is f (1 1) -f (10) -- 121 - 100 

= 21.

11- 10 

1 

the car covered 21 feet in that  1 second. its average speed was 21 feetlsecond. since 
it was gaining speed, the velocity at the beginning of  that second was below 21. 

geometrically, what  is  the average? it is  a  slope, but  not  the slope of  the curve. 
the average velocity is the slope of a straight line. the line goes between two points 
on the curve in figure 1.12. when we  compute an average, we  pretend the velocity 
is constant-so  we go back to the easiest case. it only requires a division of  distance 
by  time: 

average velocity = 

change in f
change in  t  ' 

calculus and the law  you  enter a highway at  1 :00. if  you exit  150 miles away at 
3 :00, your average speed is 75 miles per hour. i'm  not sure if  the police can give you 
a ticket. you could say to the judge, "when  was i doing 75?" the police would have 

1  introductionto calculus 

to admit  that they have  no idea-but 
must have been doing 75 sometime.? 

they  would  have  a  definite feeling that  you 

we  return  to  the  central  problem-computing 

v(10)  at  the  instant  t = 10.  the 
average velocity  over the next  second is 21.  we  can also find the average over the 
half-second between t = 10.0 and t = 10.5. divide the change in distance by the change 
in time: 

f (10.5) -f (10.0) - (10.5)2- (10.0)2- 110.25 - 100 = 20.5. 

- 

- 

10.5 - 10.0 

.5 

.5 

that average of  20.5 is closer to the speed at t = 10. it is still not exact. 

the way  to find  v(10) is to  keep  reducing the  time  interval. this is  the  basis  for 
chapter 2, and the key to id128. find the slope between points  that are 
closer and closer on the curve. the "limit"  is the slope at a single point. 

algebra gives the  average velocity  between  t = 10 and any later  time  t = 10 + h. 

the distance increases from  lo2 to (10 + h)l. the change in time is h.  so divide: 

this formula fits our previous calculations. the interval from t = 10 to t = 11 had 
h = 1, and the average was  20 + h = 21.  when  the time step was  h =i,the average 
was  20 + 4= 20.5.  over  a  millionth  of  a  second  the  average  will  be  20  plus 
1/1,000,000-which 
conclusion:  the velocity at  t = 10 is v = 20.  that is the slope of  the curve. it agrees 
with the v-graph  on the left side of  figure 1.12, which also has v(10) = 20. 

is very near 20. 

we  now  show that the two graphs match  at all times. if  f (t) = t 2  then  v(t) = 2t. 
you  are seeing the key computation of  calculus, and we  can put it into words before 
equations.  compute the distance at time  t + h,  subtract the distance at time  t,  and 
divide by  h.  that gives the average velocity: 

this fits the previous calculation, where t  was  10. the average was 20 + h.  now the 
average is 2t + h. it depends on the time step h, because the velocity is changing. but 
we  can see what happens as h approaches zero. the average is closer and  closer to 
the speedometer reading of  2t, at the exact moment when the clock shows time t: 
i 1e  as h approaches zero, the average velooity 2t + h approaches v(t) = 2t. 
i 
note  the computation (3) shows how calculus needs algebra. if  we  want the whole 
v-graph, we have to let time be a "variable."  it is represented by the letter t. numbers 
are enough at the specific time t = 10 and the specific step h = 1-but 
algebra gets 
beyond that. the average between any t and any t + h is 2t + h. please don't  hesitate 
to put  back numbers for the letters-that 

checks the algebra. 

+this is our first encounter with the much despised "mean value theorem." if the judge can 
prove  the  theorem,  you  are  dead.  a  few  u-graphs  and  f-graphs  will  confuse the  situation 
(possibly also a delta function). 

1.3  the velochy at an instant 

there is also a step beyond algebra! calculus requires the limit of the average. as 
h shrinks to zero, the points on the graph come closer. "average  over an interval" 
becomes  "velocity  at an  instant.''  the general theory  of  limits  is  not  particularly 
simple, but here we  don't  need it. (it isn't  particularly hard either.) in this example 
the  limiting  value  is  easy  to  identify.  the  average 2t + h approaches 2t,  as  h -, 0. 

what  remains  to do in this section? we  answered  question 2-to 

find  velocity 
from distance. we  have not answered question 1. if  v(t) = 2t increases linearly with 
time, what is the distance? this goes in the opposite direction (it is integration). 

the fundamental theorem of  calculus says that no new work is necessary. zfthe 
slope o f f  (t) leads to v(t), then the area under that  v-graph leads back  to the f-graph. 
the odometer readings f  = t2 produced speedometer readings v = 2t. by  the funda- 
mental theorem, the area under 2t should be  t2. but we  have certainly not proved 
actually computing the area. 
any fundamental theorems, so it is better to be safe-by 
fortunately, it is the area of a triangle. the base of  the triangle is t and the height 

is v = 2t. the area agrees with f (t): 

area = i(base)(height)= f(t)(2t)= t2. 

(4) 

example 1  the graphs are shifted in time. the car doesn't start until t = 1. therefore 
v =  0 and  f = o   up  to  that  time.  after  the  car  starts  we  have  v =  2(t - 1) and 
f = (t -
you  see how the time delay of  1 enters the formulas. figure 1.13 shows 
how it affects the graphs.

example 2  the acceleration changes from  2 to another constant a. the velocity 
changes from v = 2t to v = at. the acceleration is the slope ofthe velocity curve! the 
distance is also proportional to a, but notice the factor 3: 

acceleration a  9  velocity v = at  9  distance f = fat2. 

if a equals 1, then v = t and f  = f t2. that is one of  the most famous pairs in calculus. 
if a equals the gravitational constant g, then v = gt is the velocity of  a falling body. 
the speed doesn't  depend  on  the mass  (tested by  galileo at the leaning tower of 
pisa). maybe he saw the distance f = &gt2more easily than the speed v = gt. anyway, 
this is the most famous pair in physics.

example 3  suppose f (t) = 3t + t2. the average velocity from t to t + h is 

f (t + h) -f (t) - 3(t + h) + (t + h)2 - 3t - t2

vave = 

h 

h 

the change in distance has an extra 3h (coming from 3(t + h) minus 3t). the velocity 
contains an additional  3 (coming from  3h  divided  by  h).  when  3t  is added  to the 
distance, 3 is added to the velocity. if galileo had thrown a weight instead of dropping 
it, the starting velocity vo  would have added vot to the distance. 

functions across  time 

the idea  of  slope is not  difficult-for  one straight line. divide  the change in f by 
the change in t. in chapter 2, divide the change in y by  the change in x. experience 
shows that the hard  part is to see what happens to the slope as the line moves. 

figure  1.l4a shows the line between points a and b on the curve. this is a "secant 
line."  its  slope is an average velocity. what  calculus  does  is to bring  that  point  b 
down the curve toward a.

this question was created by steve monk at the university of washington-where 

57% of  the class gave the right  answer.  probably 97% would  have found  the  right 
slope from a formula. figure 1.14b shows the opposite problem. we know the veloc- 
ity, not  the distance.  but calculus answers questions about both functions. 

question 3  which car is going faster at time  t = 3/4? 
answer  car c has higher speed. car d has greater acceleration. 

if  the cars start together, is d  catching up  to  c at the  end?  between 

question 4 
t = $  and t = 1, do the cars get closer or further apart? 
answer  this time more than half the class got it wrong. you won't  but you can see 
why they did. you have to look at the speed graph and imagine the distance graph. 
when car c is going faster, the distance between them

1.3  the velochy at an instant 

to repeat: the cars start together, but they don't  finish together. they reach the 
same speed at t = 1, not the same distance. car c went faster. you really should draw 
their distance graphs, to see how they bend. 

these problems help to emphasize one more point. finding the speed (or slope) is 

entirely different from finding the distance (or area): 

1.  to find the slope of  the f-graph  at a'particular time t, you don't  have to know 

2.  to find the area  under the  v-graph up to a particular  time t, you  do have to 

the whole history. 

know the whole history. 

a short record of  distance is enough to recover v(t).  point b moves toward point a. 
the problem of  slope is local-the 
speed is completely decided by f (t) near point a. 
in contrast, a short record of  speed is not enough to recover the total distance. we 
have to know what the mileage was earlier. otherwise we can only know the increase 
in mileage, not the total.

1.4  circular motion 

this section introduces completely new distances and velocities-the 
sines and cosines 
from  trigonometry. as  i write that last word, i ask myself how much trigonometry it 
is essential to know. there will be the basic picture of a right triangle, with sides cos t 
and sin t  and  1. there will  also be  the crucial equation (cos t)2+ (sin t)2= 1, which 
is  pythagoras'  law  a'  + b2 = c2. the squares of  two  sides add  to the square of  the 
hypotenuse (and the  1 is really  12). nothing else is needed immediately. if  you don't 
know trigonometry, don't  stop-an 
you  will  recognize the wavy  graphs of  the sine and cosine. w e  intend  to jind  the 
slopes  of  those  graphs.  that can  be  done without  using  the formulas for  sin(x + y) 
and cos (x + y)-which 
later give the same slopes in a more algebraic way. here it is 
only basic things that are needed.? and anyway, how complicated can a triangle be? 

important part can be learned now. 

remark  you might think trigonometry is only for surveyors and navigators (people 
with triangles). not at all! by far the biggest applications are to rotation and vibration 
and  oscillation.  it  is  fantastic  that  sines  and  cosines  are  so  perfect  for  "repeating 
motionw-around  a circle or up and down. 

?sines and cosines are so important that i added a review of trigonometry in section 1.5. but 
the concepts in this section can be more valuable than formulas.

our underlying  goal  is  to  offer  one more  example in  which  the  velocity  can  be 
computed by common sense. calculus is mainly an extension of  common sense, but 
here that extension is not needed. we will find the slope of the sine curve. the straight 
line f = vt  was  easy  and  the  parabola  f = +at2  was  harder.  the new  example also 
involves realistic motion, seen every day. we start with circular motion, in which the 
position is given and the velocity will be found. 

a  ball goes  around a circle of radius one. the center is at x  = 0, y = 0 (the origin). 
the x and y coordinates satisfy x 2  + y 2  = 12, to keep the ball on the circle. we specify 
its position in figure 1.16a by giving its angle with the horizontal.  and we  make the 
ball travel with constant speed, by  requiring that the angle is equal to the time t. the 
ball goes counterclockwise.  at  time  1 it reaches the point where the angle equals  1. 
the angle is measured  in radians rather than degrees, so a full circle is completed at 
t = 271  instead of  t = 360. 

the ball starts on the x axis, where the angle is zero. now  find it at time t: 

the ball is at  the point  where x = cos t and y = sin t. 

this is where trigonometry is useful. the cosine oscillates between  1 and  - 1, as the 
ball goes from far right  to far left and back  again. the sine also oscillates between  1 
and  - 1, starting from  sin 0 = 0. at  time  7112  the  sine (the height) increases  to one. 
the cosine is zero and the ball reaches the top point x  = 0, y = 1. at time 71  the cosine 
is  - 1 and the sine is back  to zero-the 
coordinates  are (- 1,o). at  t = 271  the circle 
is complete (the angle is also 271), and x = cos 27~ = 1, y = sin 271 = 0.

i introduction to calculus 

important  point:  the  distance  around  the  circle (its circumference) is  2nr = 2n, 
because the radius is 1. the ball travels a distance 2n in a time 2n. the speed equals 
1. it remains to find the velocity, which involves not only speed but direction. 

degrees vs. radians  a full circle is 360 degrees and 271  radians.  therefore 

1 radian = 36012~ degrees = 57.3 degrees 
1 degree = 2711360 radians = .01745 radians 

radians  were  invented to avoid  those  numbers! the speed is  exactly  1, reaching t 
radians at time t. the speed would be .01745, if  the ball only reached t degrees. the 
ball would complete the circle at time t = 360. we cannot accept the division of the 
circle into 360 pieces (by whom?), which produces these numbers. 
to check degree mode vs. radian mode, verify that sin l o  z .017 and sin 1 = 34. 

velocity  of the  ball 

at  time t, which direction is the ball going? calculus watches the motion  between t 
and t + h.  for a ball on a string, we  don't  need calculus-just 
let go.  the direction 
of motion is tangent to the circle. with no force to keep it on the circle, the ball goes 
oflon a tangent. if the ball is the moon, the force is gravity. if it is a hammer swinging 
around on a chain, the force is from the center. when the thrower lets go, the hammer 
takes  off-and 
it is an art to pick  the  right moment. (i once saw a friend hit  by  a 
hammer  at mit.  he survived, but  the  thrower  quit  track.)  calculus will  find  that 
same tangent direction, when the points at t and t + h come close. 
the "velocity triangle"  is in  figure 1.16b. it is the same as the position triangle, 
but rotated through 90". the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, in the direction the 
ball is moving. its length equals 1 (the speed). the angle t still appears, but now it is 
the angle with the vertical. the upward component of velocity is cos t, when the upward 
component  of position  is  sin t.  that  is  our  common  sense calculation,  based  on  a 
figure rather than  a formula. the rest  of  this section depends on it-and  we  check 
v = cos t at special points. 

at  the starting time t = 0, the movement is all upward. the height is sin 0 = 0 and 
the upward velocity is cos 0 = 1. at  time ~ 1 2 ,  the ball reaches the top. the height is 
sin 4 2  = 1 and  the  upward  velocity  is  cos n/2 = 0.  at  that  instant  the  ball  is  not 
moving up or down. 

the horizontal  velocity contains a minus sign. at  first the ball travels to the left. 
the value of  x is cos t, but the speed in  the x direction is  -sin t. half of  trigonometry 
is  in  that  figure  (the  good  half),  and  you  see  how  sin2 t + cos2 t = 1 is  so  basic. 
that equation applies to position and velocity, at every time. 

application of plane geometry: the right triangles in figure 1.16 are the same size 
angle t above the ball equals the 

and shape. they look congruent and they are-the 
angle t  at the center. that is because the three angles at the ball add to  180". 

oscillation: up and  down motion 

we now use circular motion to study straight-line motion. that line will be the y axis. 
instead of  a ball going around a circle, a mass will move up and down. it oscillates 
between y = 1 and y = - 1. the mass is the "shadow of the ball," as we  explain in a 
moment. 

1.4  circular motion 

there is a jumpy  oscillation  that we  do not  want,  with  v = 1 and  v = -1. that 
"bang-bang"  velocity  is  like  a  billiard  ball,  bouncing between  two  walls  without 
slowing down. if  the distance between the walls is 2, then at t = 4 the ball is back to 
the start. the distance graph is a zigzag (or sawtooth) from section 1.2. 
we prefer a smoother motion. instead of velocities that jump between +1 and -1, 
a real oscillation slows down to zero and gradually builds up speed again. the mass 
is on a spring, which pulls it back. the velocity drops to zero as the spring is fully 
stretched. then  v  is negative,  as the  mass  goes  the  same distance in  the  opposite 
direction. simple  harmonic motion  is  the  most  important  back  and  forth  motion, 
while f = vt  and f = fat2 are the most important one-way motions.

fig. 1.17  circular motion of the ball and harmonic motion of the mass (its shadow). 

how do we  describe this oscillation? the best way is to match it with the ball on 
the circle. the height  of the ball will be  the height  of the mass. the "shadow  of  the 
ball"  goes  up  and  down,  level  with  the  ball.  as  the  ball  passes  the  top  of  the 
circle, the mass stops at the top and starts down. as the ball goes around the bottom, 
the mass stops and turns back up the y axis. halfway up (or down), the speed is  1. 
figure 1.17a shows the mass at a typical time t. the height is y =f (t)= sin t, level 
with the ball. this height oscillates between f = 1 and f = -1. but the mass does not 
move with  constant  speed.  the speed of the mass is changing although the  speed of 
the ball is always 1 .  the time for a full cycle is still 2n, but within that cycle the mass 
speeds up and slows down. the problem is to find the changing velocity u.  since the 
distance is f = sin t, the velocity will be  the slope of  the sine curve. 

the  slope  of the  sine curve 

at  the top  and  bottom  (t = n/2 and  t = 3~12) the ball  changes direction and v = 0. 
the slope at the top and bottom of  the sine curve is zero.? at  time zero, when the ball 
is going straight up, the slope of  the sine curve is v = 1. at  t = n,when  the ball and 
mass and f-graph  are going down, the velocity is v = -1. the mass goes fastest at 
the center. the mass goes slowest (in fact it stops) when the height reaches a maximum 
or minimum. the velocity triangle yields v  at every time t. 

to find the upward velocity of  the mass, look at the upward velocity of  the ball. 
those velocities are the  same!  the mass and  ball  stay level, and  we  know  v  from 
circular motion: the upward velocity is v = cos t. 

?that  looks  easy  but  you  will  see  later  that  it  is  extremely  important. at  a maximum  or 
minimum the slope is zero. the curve levels off. 

1  introductionto calculus 

figure 1.18 shows the result we  want. on the right, f = sin t gives the height. on 
the left is the velocity v = cos t. that velocity is the slope of  the f-curve.  the height 
and  velocity  (red lines) are oscillating together,  but  they  are out of  phase-just 
as 
the  position  triangle  and  velocity triangle  were  at  right  angles.  this is absolutely 
fantastic, that in calculus the two most famous functions of trigonometry form a pair: 
the slope of the sine  curve is given by the cosine curve. 

when the distance is f  (t) = sin t, the velocity is v(t)= cos t .  

admission  of  guilt:  the  slope  of  sin t  was  not  computed  in  the  standard  way. 
previously we compared (t + h)'  with t2,and divided that distance by h. this average 
velocity approached the slope 2t as h became small. for  sin t we could have done the 
same: 

change in sin t 

--

sin (t + h) - sin t 

average velocity = 

(1) 
this is where we need the formula for sin (t + h), coming soon. somehow the ratio in 
(1) should approach cosmtas h -,0. (it d,oes.)the sine and cosine fit the same pattern 
as t2 and 2 t o u r  shortcut was to watch  the shadow of  motion  around a circle.

fig. 1.i 8  v = cos t when f = sin t (red); v = -sin  t when f = cos t (black). 

question 1  what if the ball goes twice as fast,  to reach angle 2t at time t? 
answer  the speed is now 2. the time for a full circle is only n. the ball's  position 
is x = cos 2t and y = sin 2t. the velocity is still tangent to the circle-but 
the tangent 
is  at  angle  2t  where  the  ball  is.  therefore cos 2t  enters  the  upward  velocity  and 
-sin  2t  enters the  horizontal  velocity. the difference is  that  the  velocity triangle is 
twice as big. the upward  velocity is not  cos 2t but  2 cos 2t. the horizontal  velocity 
is  -2 sin 2t. notice these 2's! 

question 2  what is the area under the cosine curve from  t  = 0 to t = n/2? 
you  can  answer  that,  if  you  accept  the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus-
computing areas is the opposite of computing slopes. the slope of  sin t  is cos t, so the 
area under cos t is the increase in  sin t. no reason to believe that  yet, but  we  use it 
anyway. 

from sin 0 = 0 to sin n/2 = 1, the increase is 1. please realize the power of calculus. 

no other method could compute the area under a cosine curve so fast. 

1.4  circular motion 

the  slope  of the  cosine,curve 

i cannot resist uncovering another distance and velocity (another f-v  pair) with no 
extra work. this time f is the cosine. the time clock starts at the top of  the circle. 
the old time t = n/2is now t = 0.the dotted lines in figure 1.18 show the new start. 
but the shadow has exactly the same motion-the  ball keeps going around the circle, 
and the mass follows it up and down. the f-graph  and v-graph are still correct, both 
with a time shift of  4 2 .  

the new f-graph  is the cosine. the new v-graph is minus the sine. the slope of the 
cosine curve follows the negative of the sine curve. that is another famous pair, twins 
of  the first: 

when the distance is f (t)= cos t, the velocity is v(t) = - sin t. 

you could see that coming, by watching the ball go left and right (instead of  up and 
down). its distance across is f = cos t. its velocity across is v = -sin t. that twjn pair 
completes the calculus in chapter 1 (trigonometry to come). we review the ideas: 

v  is the velocity 

the slope of  the distance curve 
the limit of  average velocity over a short time 
the derivative of  f. 

f is the distance 

the area under the velocity curve 
the limit of  total distance over many short times 
the integral of  v. 

id128: compute  v from  f . 
integral calculus: compute f from  v. 
with constant velocity, f equals vt. with constant acceleration, v = at and f =t a t  2. 
in harmonic motion,  v = cos t  and f = sin t. one part  of  our goal is to extend that 
list-for  which  we  need the tools of  calculus. another  and more important  part  is 
to put these ideas to use. 

before  the chapter  ends, may  i add a note about the book  and the course? the 
book is more personal than usual, and i hope readers will approve. what i write is 
very  close to what i would say, if  you  were in this room.  the sentences are spoken 
before they are written.? calculus is alive and moving forward-it  needs to be taught 
that way. 

one new  part  of  the  subject has come with  the computer.  it  works with  a finite 
step h, not an "infinitesimal"  limit. what it can do, it does quickly-even 
if it cannot 
find  exact  slopes or  areas.  the  result  is  an  overwhelming growth  in  the  range  of 
problems  that  can  be  solved. we  landed  on  the  moon  because  f  and  v  were  so 
accurate. (the moon's  orbit  has sines and  cosines, the spacecraft starts with  v = at 
and f = )at2. only the computer can account for the atmosphere and the sun's gravity 
and  the changing mass  of  the spacecraft.) modern mathematics is a  combination of 
exact formulas  and  approximate  computations. neither  part  can  be  ignored,  and  i 
hope you will see numerically what we derive algebraically. the exercises are to help 
you master both parts.

the  course  has  made  a  quick  start-not  with  an  abstract  discussion of  sets or 
functions or limits, but with the concrete questions that led to those ideas. you have 
seen  a  distance function  f  and a  limit  v  of  average  velocities.  we  will  meet  more 
functions and more limits (and their definitions!) but it is crucial to study important 
examples early. there is a lot to do, but the course has definitely begun.

1.5  a review of  trigonometry 

trigonometry begins with a right triangle. the size of the triangle is not as important 
as the angles. we focus on one particular angle-call 
it 8-and  on the ratios between 
the  three  sides x, y, r.  the  ratios  don't  change if  the  triangle  is  scaled  to  another 
size. three sides give six ratios, which are the basic functions of  trigonometry: 

n 
r x

tan  8 

of course those six ratios are not independent. the three on the right come directly 
from the three on the left. and  the tangent  is the sine divided by  the cosine: 

note  that  "tangent  of  an  angle"  and  "tangent  to  a  circle"  and  "tangent  line  to a 
graph" are different uses of the same word. as the cosine of 8 goes to zero, the tangent 
of  8 goes to infinity. the side x becomes zero, 8 approaches 90", and the triangle is 
infinitely steep. the sine of  90" is y/r = 1. 

triangles have a  serious limitation.  they are excellent for angles up to 90  , and 
they are ok up to  180", but after that they fail. we cannot put a 240" angle into a 
triangle. therefore we  change now to a circle. 

1  introduction to calculus 

fig. 1.20  trigonometry on a circle. compare 2 sin 8 with sin 28 and tan 8 (periods 2n, n, n). 

angles  are  measured  from  the  positive  x  axis  (counterclockwise). thus  90"  is 
straight up,  180"  is to the left, and 360"  is in the same direction as 0". (then 450"  is 
the same as 90  .) each angle yields a point on the circle of  radius r. the coordinates 
x  and  y  of  that  point  can  be  negative (but never  r). as  the  point  goes around the 
circle, the six ratios cos 8, sin 9, tan 8, .. . trace out six graphs. the cosine waveform 
is the same as the sine waveform-just 

shifted by  90". 

one more change comes with the move to a circle. degrees are out. radians are 
in. the distance around the whole circle is 2nr. the distance around to other points 
is or.  we measure  the  angle  by  that  multiple 8. for  a half-circle the distance is m, 
so  the  angle  is  n  radians-which 
the distance around to angle 8 is r times 8. 

is  180".  a  quarter-circle  is  4 2  radians  or  90". 

when r = 1 this is the ultimate in simplicity: the distance  is 8. a 45"  angle is q of 
the length of  the circular arc is 27~18.similarly for 1": 

a circle and 27118  radians-and 

360" = 2n radians 

1"  = 27~1360radians 

1  radian = 3601271 degrees. 

an  angle going clockwise is negative. the angle  -n/3 is  - 60" and takes us 4of  the 
wrong way  around the circle. what is the effect on the six functions? 
certainly the radius  r  is  not  changed when  we  go to  - 8. also  x  is not  changed 
(see figure 1.20a).  but  y  reverses sign, because  -8  is  below  the  axis  when  +8 is 
above. this change in y  affects y/r and y / x  but not  xlr: 

the cosine is even (no change). the sine and tangent are odd  (change sign). 

the same point  is 2 of  the right  way  around. therefore 2 of  2n radians  (or 300") 
gives  the  same  direction  as  -n/3 radians  or  -60".  a  diflerence of  2n  makes  no 
to x, y, r. thus sin 8 and cos 8 and the other four functions have period 27~. 
di$erence 
we  can go five times or a hundred  times around  the circle, adding  10n or 200n to 
the angle, and the six functions repeat themselves. 

example  evaluate the six trigonometric functions at 8 = 2n/3 (or 8 = -4 4 3 ) .  
this angle is shown in  figure 1.20a (where r = 1). the ratios are 

cos 8 = x/r = -1/2 
sec e = - 2 

sin 8 = y/r = &/2 
csc e = 2/& 

tan  8 = y/x = -& 
cot e=  -i/d 

those numbers illustrate basic facts about the sizes of  four functions: 

the tangent and cotangent can fall anywhere, as long as cot 8 = l/tan 8. 

1.5  a review of ttlgonometry 

the numbers reveal more. the tangent  -3 is the ratio  of  sine to cosine. the 
secant  -2 is  l/cos 8. their squares are 3 and 4 (differing by  1). that may not seem 
remarkable, but it is. there are three relationships in the squares of those six numbers, 
and they are the key identities of  trigonometry: 

everything flows  fvom  the  pythagoras formula  x2 + y2 = r2. dividing  by  r2 gives 
( ~ / r ) ~+ (y/r)2= 1. that is cos2 8+ sin28= 1. dividing by x2 gives the second identity, 
which is  1 + ( y / ~ ) ~  
dividing by  y2 gives the third.  all  three will  be needed 
the first one has to be unforgettable. 
throughout the book-and 

= ( r / ~ ) ~ .  

distances and addition formulas 

to compute the distance between points we  stay with pythagoras.  the points are in 
figure 1.21a. they are known  by  their  x  and y coordinates,  and d is  the distance 
between them. the third point completes a right triangle. 

for the x distance along the bottom we don't  need help. it is x,  - xl (or ix2 - x1i 
since distances can't  be negative). the distance up the side is  ly2 - y, 1.  pythagoras 
immediately gives the distance d: 

distance between points = d = j(x2  - x , ) ~+ (y2- y1)'. 

(1) 

x=coss 
y = sin s 

fig. 1.21  distance between points and equal distances in two circles. 

by  applying this distance formula in two identical circles, we  discover the cosine 

of s - t. (subtracting angles is important.) in figure 1.2 1 b, the distance squared is 

d2= (change in x ) ~  + (change in y)* 
= (coss - cos t)* + (sin s - sin t)2. 

(2) 
figure 1 . 2 1 ~  shows  the  same  circle  and  triangle  (but  rotated).  the  same  distance 
squared is 

d2= (cos(s - t) -

+ (sin (s - t))2. 

(3) 
now multiply out the squares in equations (2) and (3). whenever (co~ine)~ + (sine)2 
appears, replace it by  1. the distances are the same, so (2) = (3): 

(2) = 1 + 1 - 2 cos s cos t - 2 sin s sin t 

1  introduction to calculus 

after canceling 1 + 1 and then  -2, we have the "addition formula"  for cos (s - t): 

the cosine of  s - t equals cos s cos t + sin s sin t. 
the cosine of  s + t equals cos s cos t - sin s sin t. 

(4) 

(5) 

the easiest is t = 0. then cos t = 1 and sin t = 0. the equations reduce to cos s = cos s. 
to go from (4) to (5) in all cases, replace t by  -t. no change in cos t, but a "minus" 
the  special  case  s =  t,  we  have  cos(t + t ) =  

appears  with 
(cos t)(cos t) - (sin t)(sin t). this is a much-used formula for cos 2t: 

the  sine.  in 

double  angle: cos 2t = cos2 t - sin2 t = 2 cos2 t - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2 t. 

(6) 

we  also need  addition  formulas  and  double-angle  formulas  for  the  sine  of  s - t 

i am constantly using cos2 t + sin2 t = 1, to switch between sines and cosines. 
and s + t and 2t. for that we connect sine to cosine, rather than (sine)2 to (co~ine)~. 
the connection goes back to the ratio y/r in our original triangle. this is the sine of 
the angle 0 and also the cosine of  the complementary angle 7112  - 0: 

sin 0 = cos (7112 - 0) 

and 

cos 0 = sin (7112 - 0). 

(7) 

the complementary angle is 7112  - 0 because the two angles add to 7112  (a right angle). 
by  making this connection  in  problem  19, formulas (4-5-6)  move from cosines to 
sines: 

sin (s - t) =sin s cos t - cos s sin t 
sin(s + t) = sin s cos t + cos s sin t 
sin 2t = sin(t + t) = 2 sin  t cos t 

(8) 

(9) 

(10) 

i want to stop with these ten formulas, even if  more are possible. trigonometry is 
full of  identities that connect its six functions-basically  because all those functions 
come from a single right triangle. the x, y, r ratios and the equation x2 + y2 = r2 can 
be rewritten in many ways. but you have now seen the formulas that are needed by 
ca1culus.t they give  derivatives in  chapter 2 and  integrals  in  chapter 5.  and  it  is 
typical  of  our  subject  to  add  something  of  its  own-a 
limit  in  which  an  angle 
approaches zero.  the essence of  calculus is in  that  limit.

the  graphs  on  the  back  cover  of  the  book  show  y = sin n.  this  is  very  different 
from y = sin x. the graph  of  sin x is  one continuous  curve. by  the  time it  reaches 
x = 10,000, the curve has gone up and down 10,000/27r times. those 1591 oscillations 
would be so crowded that you couldn't  see anything. the graph of  sin n has picked 
10,000 points from the curve-and 
for some reason those points seem to lie on more 
than 40 separate sine curves. 

the second graph shows the first 1000 points. they don't seem to lie on sine curves. 
most people see hexagons. but  they are the same thousand points! it is hard to believe 
that the graphs are the  same, but  i have learned what to do.  tilt the second graph 
and  look from  the  side  at  a  narrow  angle. now  the  first  graph  appears.  you  see 
"diamonds."  the narrow angle compresses the x axis-back 
to the scale of  the first 
graph. 

the  effect  of  scale is  something we  don't  think  of.  we  understand  it  for maps. 
computers can zoom in or zoom out-those  are changes of scale. what our eyes see 



1.6  a thousand points of light 

depends on what is "close."  we think  we  see sine curves in the  10,000 point graph, 
and they raise several questions: 

1.  which points are near (0, o)? 
2.  how many  sine curves are there? 
3.  where does the middle curve, going upward from (0, 0), come back  to zero? 

a point near (0,o) really means that sin n is close to zero. that is certainly not true 
of  sin 1 (1 is one radian!). in fact sin 1 is up the axis at .84, at the start of the seventh 
sine curve.  similarly sin 2 is  .91 and  sin 3 is  .14. (the numbers  3 and  .14 make  us 
think  of  n. the sine of  3 equals the sine of  n - 3. then sin .l4 is near  .14.) similarly 
sin 4, sin 5,  . . . , sin 21 are not especially close to zero. 

the first  point  to come close is  sin 22.  this is because  2217  is near  n.  then  22 is 

close to 771,  whose sine is zero: 

sin 22 = sin (7n - 22) z sin (-  .01) z - .01. 

that  is  the  first  point  to  the  right  of  (0,o) and  slightly  below.  you  can  see  it  on 
graph 1, and more clearly on graph 2.  it begins a curve downward. 

the next  point  to come close is sin 44. this is because 44 is just  past  14n. 

44 z 14n + .02 

so 

sin 44 z sin .02 z .02. 

this point  (44, sin 44) starts  the middle sine curve. next  is (88, sin 88). 

now  we  know something.  there are 44 curves. they begin near  the heights sin 0, 
sin 1, . . . , sin 43. of these 44 curves, 22 start upward  and 22 start downward. i was 
confused at first, because i could only find 42 curves. the reason is that sin 11 equals 
- 0.99999 and sin 33 equals .9999. those are so close to the bottom and top that you 
can't  see  their  curves.  the  sine  of  11 is  near  - 1 because  sin 22  is  near  zero.  it  is 
almost impossible to follow a single curve past the top-coming 
back down it is not 
the curve you think  it is. 

the points on the middle curve are at n = 0 and 44 and 88 and every number 44n. 
where  does  that  curve  come  back  to zero? in  other  words,  when  does  44n come 
very  close  to  a  multiple  of  n?  we  know  that  44  is  14n + .02.  more  exactly  44  is 
14n + .0177. so we  multiply  .0177 until we  reach n: 

if  n=n/.0177 

then  44n=(14n+.0177)n3  14nn+n. 

this  gives  n = 177.5. at  that  point  44n = 7810.  this  is  half  the period  of  the  sine 
curve. the sine of  7810 is very  near zero. 

if  you follow the middle sine curve, you will  see it come back  to zero above 7810. 
the  actual  points  on  that  curve  have  n = 44  177 and  n = 44  178, with  sines just 
above and below zero. halfway between is n = 7810. the equation for  the middle sine 
curve is y  = sin (nx/78lo). its period  is  15,620-beyond  our graph. 

question  the fourth point on that middle curve looks the same as the fourth point 
coming down from sin 3. what is this "double  point?" 
answer  4 times 44 is  176. on the curve going up, the point is (176, sin 176). on the 
curve coming down it is (1 79, sin 179). the sines of  176 and  179 difler only by .00003. 
the second graph spreads out this double point. look above  176 and  179, at the 

center of  a hexagon. you  can follow the sine curve all the way across graph 2. 

only  a  little  question  remains. why  does  graph  2 have  hexagons?  i don't  know. 
the problem  is with  your  eyes. to understand the hexagons, doug hardin  plotted 
points  on straight lines as well  as sine curves.  graph 3 shows y = fractional part  of 
n/2x.  then  he  made  a  second  copy,  turned  it  over,  and  placed  it  on  top.  that 
produced  graph 4-with 

hexagons.  graphs 3 and 4 are on the next page. 

36 

1  introduction to calculus 

this is  called  a moivt pattevn.  if  you  can get a  transparent  copy of  graph 3, and 
turn  it  slowly  over  the  original,  you  will  see fantastic hexagons.  they  come  from 
interference  between periodic patterns-in 
our case 4417 and 2514 and 1913 are near 
271.  this interference is an enemy of  printers, when color screens don't line up. it can 
cause  vertical  lines  on a tv. also in making cloth, operators get dizzy from seeing 
moire  patterns  move.  there  are good  applications in  engineering  and  optics-but 
we  have to get back  to calculus. 

1.7  computing in calculus 

software is  available  for  calculus  courses-a 
lot  of  it.  the  packages  keep  getting 
better. which program to use (if any) depends on cost and convenience and purpose. 
how to use it is a much harder question. these pages identify some of  the goals, and 
also  particular  packages  and  calculators.  then  we  make  a  beginning  (this  is  still 
chapter 1) on the connection of  computing to calculus. 

the discussion will  be informal.  it makes  no sense to copy  the manual.  our aim 
is  to  support, with  examples  and information,  the effort  to  use  computing  to  help 
learning. 

for calculus, the gveatest  advantage  of the  computev  is  to o$er  graphics.  you  see 
the  function,  not  just  the  formula.  as  you  watch,  f ( x )  reaches  a  maximum  or  a 
minimum  or zero.  a separate graph shows its derivative. those statements are not 
100% true, as everybody learns right away-as 
soon as a few functions are typed in. 
but  the  power  to see  this subject  is  enormous,  because  it  is  adjustable. if  we  don't 
like the picture  we  change to a new  viewing window. 

this  is  computer-based  graphics.  it  combines  numerical  computation  with 
gvaphical computation. you get pictures as well as numbers-a  powerful combination. 
the computer offers the experience of  actually working with a function. the domain 
and range  are not just  abstract  ideas.  you choose  them. may  i  give a few  examples. 

example i  certainly  x3 equals  3"  when  x = 3.  do  those  graphs  ever  meet  again'? 
at  this point we  don't  know the full meaning of  3", except when x is a nice number. 
(neither does  the  computer.)  checking  at  x = 2  and  4,  the  function  x3 is  smaller 
both  times:  23 is below  3* and 43 = 64 is below  34 = 81. if  x3 is always less than  3" 
we  ought to know-these 

are among the basic functions of  mathematics. 

1.7  computing in calculus 

the computer will answer numerically or graphically. at  our command, it solves 
x3 = 3x. at another command, it plots both functions-this 
shows more. the screen 
proves  a point  of  logic (or mathematics) that escaped  us.  if  the  graphs cross once, 
they must cross again-because  3" is higher at 2 and 4. a crossing point near 2.5 is 
seen by  zooming in. i am less interested in  the exact number  than  its position-it 
comes before x = 3 rather than after. 

a few  conclusions from such a basic example: 
1.  a supercomputer is not necessary. 
2.  high-level programming is not necessary. 
3.  we can do mathematics without completely understanding  it. 

the third point doesn't sound so good. write it differently: we can learn mathematics 
while doing  it. the hardest  part  of  teaching calculus is  to turn  it  from a  spectator 
sport into a workout.  the computer makes that possible. 

example 2 
where do they meet again? is it before or after 2? 

(mental computer) compare x2 with  2x. the functions meet  at x = 2. 

that is mental  computing because the  answer happens  to  be  a  whole number  (4). 
now we  are on a different track.  does an accident like z4 = 42 ever happen  again? 
can the machine tell us about integers? perhaps it can plot the solutions of xb = bx. 
i asked mathernatica for a formula, hoping to discover x as a function of  b-but 
the 
program just  gave back the equation.  for once the machine typed help icstead of 
the user. 

well, mathematics is not helpless. i am proud of  calculus. there is a new exercise 

at the end of  section 6.4, to show that we  never see whole numbers again. 

example 3  find the number b for which xb = bx has only one  solution(at  x = b). 
when b is 3, the second solution is below  3. when b is 2, the second solution (4) is 
above 2.  if  we  move b from 2 to 3, there must be  a special "double  point"-where 
the graphs barely  touch  but  don't  cross. for  that  particular  b-and 
one value-the 

curve xb never goes above bx. 

only for  that 

this special point b can be found with computer-based graphics. in many ways it 
is  the  "center point  of  calculus."  since the  curves  touch  but  don't  cross,  they  are 
tangent. they have the same slope at the double point. calculus was created to work 
with  slopes, and  we  already know  the  slope of  x2. soon  comes xb. eventually we 
discover the slope of  bx, and identify the most important number in calculus. 

the point is that this number can be discovered first by experiment. 

example 4  graph y(x) = ex- xe. locate its minimum. 

the next example was proposed by don small. solve x4 - 1 l x 3  + 5x - 2 = 0.the 
first tool is algebra-try 
to factor the polynomial. that succeeds for quadratics, and 
then gets extremely hard.  even if  the computer  can do algebra better  than we  can, 
factoring is seldom the way to go. in reality we  have two good choices: 

1.  (mathematics)use the derivative. solve by  newton's  method. 
2.  (graphics)plot  the function  and zoom  in. 

both will be done by the computer. both have potential problems! newton's method 
is fast, but that means it can fail fast. (it is usually terrific.) plotting the graph is also 
solutions can be  outside the viewing window. this particular function is 
fast-but 

1  lntroductlon to calculus 

zero only  once,  in  the  standard  window  from  -10  to  10. the graph  seems to  be 
leaving zero, but mathematics again predicts a second crossing point.  so we  zoom 
out before we zoom in. 

the use of the zoom is the best part  of graphing. not only do we  choose the domain 
and range, we change them. the viewing window is controlled by four numbers. they 
can  be  the  limits  a <x <b  and  c d y d d.  they  can  be  the  coordinates  of  two 
opposite corners: (a, c) and (b, d).  they can be  the  center position (a, b)  and  the 
scale factors c and d. clicking on opposite corners of the zoom box is the fastest way, 
unless the center is unchanged and we  only need  to give scale factors. (even faster: 
use  the  default  factors.)  section 3.4  discusses  the  centering  transform  and  zoom 
transform-a  change of  picture on the  screen and  a  change of  variable within the 
function. 
example 5  find all real solutions to x4 - 1 lx3 + 5x - 2 =0. 

example 6  zoom  out  and  in  on  the  graphs  of  y = cos 40x  and  y = x sin (llx). 
describe what you see. 

u(ample 7  what  does  y = (tan x - sin x)/x3 become  at  x = o?  for  small  x  the 
machine eventually can't  separate tan x from sin x. it may  give y = 0. can you  get 
close enough to see the limit of y? 

for these examples, and for most computer exercises in this book, a menu-driven 
system is entirely adequate.  there is  a list  of  commands to choose from. the user 
provides a formula for y(x), and many functions are built in. a calculus supplement 
can be  very useful-microcalc  or  true basic  or exploring calculus or  mpp (in 
the public domain). specific to graphics are surface  plotter and master grapher and 
gyrographics (animated). the best software for id202 is matlab. 

powerful packages are increasing in convenience and decreasing in cost. they are 
capable of  symbolic computation-which  opens up a third avenue of  computing in 
calculus. 

symbolic  computation 

in symbolic computation,  answers can be formulas as well as numbers and graphs. 
the derivative of  y = x2 is seen as "2x."  the derivative of  sin t is "cos  t."  the slope 
of  bx is known to the program.  the computer does more than  substitute numbers 
into formulas-it  operates directly on the formulas. we need to think where this fits 
with learning calculus. 

in a way, symbolic computing is close to what we ourselves do. maybe too close- 

there is some danger that  symbolic manipulation is all we  do. with  a higher-level 
language and enough power, a computer can print the derivative of  sin(x2). so why 
learn the chain rule? because mathematics goes deeper than "algebra with formulas." 
we deal with  ideas. 

i  want  to say clearly: mathematics is not formulas, or computations, or even proofs, 
but  ideas. the symbols and  pictures are the language. the book  and the professor 
and the computer can join  in teaching it. the computer should be  non-threatening 
(like this book  and your professor)-you 
can work  at your own pace. your part is 
to learn by  doing. 

example 8  a computer algebra system quickly finds  100 factorial. this is  loo! = 
(100)(99)(98)... (1). the number  has  158 digits (not  written out  here). the last  24 

1.7  computing in calculus 

digits are zeros. for  lo! = 3628800 there are seven digits and two zeros. between  10 
and  100, and beyond, are simple questions that need ideas: 

1.  how many digits (approximately) are in the number  n!? 
2.  how many zeros (exactly) are at the end of  n!? 

for question 1,the computer shows more than n digits when n = 100. it will never 
show more than n2 digits, because none of the n terms can have more than n digits. 
a  much tighter bound  would be 2n, but is it true? does n!  always have fewer  than 
2n digits? 

for question 2, the zeros in  lo! can be explained. one comes from  10, the other 
from 5 times 2. (10 is also 5 times 2.) can you explain the 24 zeros in  loo!? an idea 
from the card game blackjack applies here too: count the$ves. 

hard question: how many zeros at the end of  200!? 
the  outstanding package for full-scale symbolic computation is mathematica.  it 
was used  to draw graphs for this book,  including y = sin n on the back cover.  the 
complete command was list plot [table [sin [n],  (n, 10000)]].  this system has rewards 
and  also drawbacks,  including the  price.  its  original purpose,  like  mathcad and 
macsyma  and  reduce,  was not  to teach calculus-but 
it can. the computer 
algebra system maple is good. 

as i  write  in  1990, derive  is  becoming  well  established for  the  pc.  for  the 
macintosh, calculus til is a  "sleeper"  that deserves to be widely known. it builds 
on  maple and is much  more  accessible for calculus. an  important  alternative  is 
theorist. these are menu-driven (therefore easier at the start) and not expensive. 

i strongly recommend that students share terminals and work together. two at a 
terminal  and  3-5  in  a  working  group  seems  to  be  optimal.  mathematics  can  be 
learned by  talking and writing-it 
is a human activity. our goal is not to test but to 
teach and learn. 
writing in calculus  may i emphasize the importance of writing? we totally miss it, 
when the answer is just  a number. a one-page report is harder on instructors as well 
as students-but  much  more  valuable. a  word  processor keeps it neat.  you  can't 
write  sentences without  being forced  to organize ideas-and 
part  of  yourself goes 
into it. 

i will propose a writing exercise with options. if  you have computer-based graph- 
ing, follow through on examples 1-4  above and report. without a computer, pick a 
paragraph from this book that should be clearer and make it clearer. rewrite it with 
examples. identify the key idea at the start, explain it, and come back to express it 
differently at the end. ideas are like surfaces-they 

can be seen many ways. 

every reader will understand that in software there is no last word. new packages 
keep  coming  (analyzer and  epic  among  them).  the  biggest  challenges  at  this 
moment are three-dimensional graphics and calculus workbooks. in 30, the problem 
is the position of  the eye-since 
the screen is only 20. in workbooks, the problem is 
to get past symbol manipulation  and reach ideas. every teacher, including this one, 
knows how hard  that is and hopes to help. 

graphing calculators 

the most  valuable feature for calculus-computer-based  graphing-is 
available on 
hand calculators. with trace and zoom their graphs are quite readable. by  creating 
the graphs you  subconsciously learn about functions. these are genuinely personal 
computers, and the following pages aim to support and encourage their use. 

1  introduction to calculus 

programs for a  hand-held  machine tend  to be  simple and  short. we  don't  count 
the zeros in  100 factorial (probably we could). a calculator finds crossing points and 
maximum  points  to good accuracy. most of  all it allows you to explore calculus by 
yourself. you  set the viewing window and define the function. then you see it. 

there is a choice of  calculators-which  one to  buy?  for this book  there was  also 
a  choice-which 
one  to  describe? to provide  you  with  listings for useful  programs, 
we  had to choose. fortunately the logic is so clear that you can translate the instruc- 
tions into any language-for 
a computer as well as a calculator. the programs given 
here are the "greatest  common denominator"  of  computing in calculus. 

the range of choices starts with the casio fx  7000g-the 

first and simplest, with 
very limited memory but a good screen. the casio 7500,8000, and 8500 have increas- 
ing memory and extra features. the sharp el-5200 (or 9000 in canada and europe) 
is comparable to the casio  8000. these machines  have algebraic entry-the  normal 
order  as in  y = x + 3.  they  are  inexpensive  and  good.  more  expensive  and  much 
more  powerful  are  the  hewlett-packard  calculators-the  hp-28s and  hp-48sx. 
they  have  large  memories  and  extensive  menus  (and  symbolic  algebra). they  use 
reverse polish  notation-numbers 
first  in  the  stack,  then  commands.  they  require 
extra  time  and effort, and  other books do justice  to their amazing capabilities. it is 
estimated that those calculators could  get 95 on a typical calculus exam. 

while this  book  was  being written,  texas  instruments produced  a new  graphing 
calculator: the ti-81. it is closer to the casio and sharp (emphasis on graphing, easy 
to learn,  no  symbolic algebra, moderate price). with  earlier  machines as a  starting 
point, many improvements were added. there is some risk in a choice that is available 
only at  before this textbook  is published, and we  hope that the experts we asked are 
right. anyway, our programs are jbr the  ti-81. it is impressive. 

these few  pages are no substitute for the manual that comes with  a calculator. a 
absolute favorites 
valuable supplement is a guide directed especially at calculus-my 
are calculus activities for  graphic calculators by dennis pence (pws-kent, 1990 for 
the casio and sharp and hp-28s, 1991 for the ti-81). a series of  calculator enhance- 
ments, using hp's,  is being published  by  harcourt  brace jovanovich.  what follows 
is an introduction to one part of  a calculus laboratory. later in the book, we  supply 
ti-81  programs  close to  the  mathematics  and  the  exercises that  they  are prepared 
for. 

a few  words to start: to select from a menu, press the item number and  e n t e r. 
edit  a  command  line  using  d e l(ete)  and  i n s(ert).  every  line  ends  with 
e n t e r.  for calculus select  radians  on the  m 0 d e  screen.  for powers  use  *  . for 
special  powers  choose  x2, x-l,  &.multiplication  has  priority,  so  (-)3  + 2 x 2 
produces  1. use keys for  s i n ,   i f , i s, .. . when  you press letters,  i  multiplies  s . 
if  a  program  says  3 + c ,   type  3  s t 0  c  e n t e r.  storage locations are  a  to  z 

or greek 8. 

functions  a graphing calculator  helps you (forces you?) to understand  the concept 
of  a  function.  it  also  helps  you  to  understand  specific functions-especially  when 
changing the viewing window. 

to evaluate y = x2 - 2x just  once, use the home screen. to define y(x) for repeated 
use, move to the function edit screen: press  m 0 d e,  choose  f u n c t io n, and press 
y =. then type in the formula. important  tip: for  x  on the ti-81, the key  x i  t  is faster 
than  two steps  a  l  p h a  x.  the  y = edit  screen is the same place where the formula 
is needed for graphing. 

1.7  computing in calculus 

example  y i = x ~ - ~ xenteronthey=screen. 4  s t 0  x  enteronthehome 
screen.  y 1  e n t e r  on the y-vars screen. the screen shows 8, which is  y(4).  the 
formula remains when the calculator is off. 

graphing  you specify the x range and  y range. (we should say x domain but we 
don't.) the screen is a grid of 96 x 64 little rectangles called "pixels."  the first column 
of  pixels represents  x m i n  and  the  last  column is  x m a x . press  r a n g e  to reset. 
with x r e s = 1 the function is evaluated 96 times as it is graphed. x s c l  and y s c l 
give the spaces between ticks on the axes. 

the  z 0 0 m menu is a fast way to set ranges. z 0 0 m  s t a n d a r d gives the default 

-1o<x<10, 

-10<y<10.  z o o m   t r i g  gives  - 2 n < x < h ,   - 3 < y < 3 .  

the keystroke  g r a p h  shows the graphing screen with the current functions. 

example  set  the  ranges  (-)2  < x < 3  and  (-)  150 < y  6 50.  press  y =  and  store 
e n t e r .   press  graph.  you  won't  see 
y1  = x   (in  ~ a t h ) ~ - 2 8 x ~ + l 5 ~ + 3 6  
much  of  the  graph!  press  r a n g e  and  reset  (-)i  0 < x  < 30, (-)4000  < y  < 2300. 
press g r a p h.  see a cubic polynomial. 

"smart graph"  recalls the graph instantly without redrawing it, if no settings have 
changed. the  d r a w  menu is for points, lines, and shaded regions. this is perfect for 
our piecewise linear functions-just  connect the breakpoints with lines. in section 3.6 
the lines show an iteration by its "cobweb." 
programming  this book  contains  programs  that  you  can  type in  once and save. 
we  chose  autoscaling, newton's  method,  secant  method,  cobweb  iteration,  and 
numerical integration. you will create others-to  do calculations or to add features 
that are not available as single keystrokes. the calculator is like a computer, with a 
fairly small set of instructions. one digerence: memory is too precious to store com- 
ments with the code. you  have to see the logic by  rereading the program. 

to enter the world  of  programming, press  p r g m.  each  p r g m  submenu lists all 
digit, a letter,  or 6 (37 names). the program  title has up to 
programs  by  name-a 
eight characters. select the e d i t  submenu and press g  for the edit screen. type the 
title g r a p h s and press  e n t e r.  practice on this one: 
: " x ~ + x "  st0  (y-vars)  y1  enter

trace and zoom  the best feature is graphing. but a whole graph can be like a 
whole  book-too  much  at  once.  you  want  to  focus  on  one part.  a computer  or 
calculator  will trace along the graph, stop at a point, and zoom in. 

there is also  z 0  0  m  0 u t,  to widen the ranges  and see more.  our eyes work  the 
same way-they 
put  together  information  on  different scales.  looking  around  the 
room uses an amazingly large part of  the human brain. with a big enough computer 
we  can  try  to imitate  the eyes-this 
is  a key  problem  in artificial intelligence. with 
a small computer and a zoom feature, we  can use our eyes to understand  functions. 
press  t r a c e  to locate  a point  on  the graph.  a blinking  cursor  appears. move 
cursor stays on the graph. its coordinates  appear at the bottom of 
left or right-the 
the screen. when x changes by a pixel, the calculator evaluates y(x). to solve y(x) = 0, 
read  off x at the point when y is nearest  to zero. to minimize or maximize y(x), read 
off  the smallest and largest  y. in all these problems, zoom in for more accuracy. 

to blow  up a  figure we  can  choose new  ranges.  the fast  way  is  to  use  a  z 0  0  m 
command. forapresetrange,use  z o o m  s t a n d a r d  or  z o o m  t r  ig.toshrink 
or stretch by  x f a c t  or  y f a c t  (default values 4), use  z 0  0  m  in  or  z 0  0  m  0  u  t . 
choose the center point  and press  e n t e  r. the new  graph  appears. change those 
scaling  factors  with  z 0  0  m  s e t  f a c t o r s. best  of  all,  create your  own  viewing 
window. press  z  0 0 m  b o x . 

to draw the box, move the cursor to one corner.  press  e n t e r  and this point is 
a  small  square.  the  same  keys  move  a  second  (blinking) square  to  the  opposite 
corner-the 
box grows as you move. press  e  n  t  e  r,  and the box is the new viewing 
window.  the graphs show the same function with  a change of  scale. section 3.4 will 
discuss the mathematics-here  we  concentrate  on the graphics.

create a box to see this function near x = .01. the y range is now 

scaling is crucial.  for a new  function it can be  tedious. a formula for y(x) does 
not easily reveal the range of y's,  when a <x <b is given. the following program is 
often more convenient than zooms. it samples the function l=  19 times across the 
x-range (every 5 pixels). the inputs xmin, xmax,  y,  are previously stored on other 
screens. after  sampling, the program sets the y-range from c = ymin  to d = ymax 
and draws the graph. 
notice the loop with counter k. the loop ends with the command  i s > ( k,l  , 
which  increases  k  by  1 and  skips a  line  if  the  new  k  exceeds  l.  otherwise the 
command g o t o  1 restarts the loop. the screen shows the short form on the left.

2.1  the  derivative of  a function 

this  chapter  begins  with  the  definition  of  the  derivative.  two  examples  were  in 
chapter 1.  when  the  distance is  t 2 ,  the  velocity is  2t.  when  f ( t )  = sin t  we  found 
v(t)= cos t. the velocity  is now  called  the derivative  o f f  (t). as  we  move to a  more 
formal  definition  and  new  examples,  we  use  new  symbols  f'  and  dfldt  for  the 
derivative. 

2a  at  time t, the derivativef' ( t )or df /dt or v(t) is 
f'(t)= lim  fct  -t at) -f (0 

at+o 

at 

( 1 )

the ratio on the right is the average velocity over a short time at. the derivative, on 
the left side, is its limit as the step at  (delta t )  approaches zero. 
go slowly  and  look  at each  piece.  the distance at  time  t + at  is  f (t + at). the 
distance  at  time  t  is f(t). subtraction  gives  the  change  in  distance,  between  those 
times. we often write a f  for this difference: a f  =f (t + at) -f (t). the average velocity 
is the ratio aflat-change 

in distance divided by  change in time. 

the limit of  the average velocity is the derivative, if  this limit exists: 

df  - lim  -.af 
- -  
dt 
a t - 0   at 

this is the neat notation that  leibniz invented: af/at approaches df /dt. behind the 
innocent word  "limit"  is a process that this course will help you understand. 

note that af  is not  a  times f !  it  is the change in f .   similarly at  is not a  times t. 
it is the  time  step,  positive  or negative and  eventually  small.  to have  a  one-letter 
symbol we  replace at  by  h. 

the  right  sides of  (1) and  (2)contain  average  speeds. on the  graph  of  f(t), the 

distance up is divided by  the distance  across. that gives the average slope af /at. 

the left sides of  ( 1 )  and (2)are instantaneous speeds dfldt. they give the slope at 
the instant t. this is the derivative dfldt (when at  and af  shrink to zero). look again 

2.1  the  derivative of a function 

at the calculation for f(t) = t 2: 

- -- f(t+at)-f(t)  - t2+2tat+(at)'-t2
af

= 2t + at. 

important point: those steps are taken before at  goes to zero. if  we set at = 0 too 
soon,  we  learn  nothing. the  ratio  af/at  becomes 010  (which is  meaningless).  the 
numbers af  and at must approach zero together, not separately. here their ratio is 
2t + at, the average speed. 
to repeat:  success came by  writing out (t + at)2 and subtracting t2 and dividing 
by at. then and only then can we  approach at = 0. the limit is the derivative 2t. 

there are several new things in formulas (1) and (2). some are easy but important, 
others are more  profound.  the idea  of  a  function  we  will  come back  to,  and  the 
definition of  a limit. but the notations  can be  discussed right  away. they are used 
constantly  and you also need to know how to read them aloud: 
f (t) = "f  of  t"  = the value of  the function f at time t 
at = "delta  t"  = the time step forward or backward  from t 

f (t + at) = "f  of  t plus delta  t"  = the value off  at time t + at 

af  = "delta  f" = the change f (t + at) -f (t) 

af/at  = "delta  f over delta  t"  = the average velocity 

ff(t)= "f  prime of  t"  = the value of  the derivative at time t 
df  /dt = "d f d t"  = the same as f '  (the instantaneous velocity) 
lim  = "limit  as delta  t goes to zero"  = the process that starts with 
at+o 

numbers af  /at and produces  the number df  /dt. 

from those last words you see what  lies behind  the notation dfldt.  the symbol at 
indicates  a  nonzero  (usually  short)  length  of  time.  the  symbol  dt  indicates  an 
infinitesimal (even  shorter) length  of  time.  some mathematicians  work  separately 
with  df  and  dt,  and  df/dt  is  their  ratio.  for  us  dfldt  is  a  single  notation  (don't 
cancel d and don't  cancel a). the derivative dfldt  is  the  limit of  aflat.  when  that 
notation dfldt  is awkward, use f '  or v. 

remark  the  notation  hides  one thing  we  should  mention.  the  time  step can  be 
negative just  as easily as positive. we  can compute the  average af/at  over  a  time 
interval before  the time t, instead of  after. this ratio also approaches dfldt. 

the notation also hides another thing: the derivative might not exist. the averages 
aflat  might  not  approach  a  limit  (it has to be  the  same limit  going forward  and 
backward  from time  t). in that case ft(t) is not defined. at  that instant  there is no 
clear reading on the speedometer. this will happen in example 2. 

example 1  (constant velocity  v = 2) the distance f is  v times t. the distance at 
time t + at  is  v times t + at.  the diference af 

is  v times at: 

af  - vat 
---- 
at 
at 

- v  so the limit is  - = v.

df
dt 

the derivative of  vt  is  v.  the derivative of  2t is 2.  the averages aflat  are always 
v = 2, in this exceptional case of a constant velocity. 

2  derivatives 

example 2  constant velocity 2 up to time t = 3, then stop. 
for small times we  still have f ( t )  = 2t. but  after the  stopping time, the distance is 
fixed at f ( t )  = 6. the graph is flat beyond  time  3. then f (t + at) =f ( t )  and af = 0 
and the derivative of a constant function  is zero: 

t > 3: 

f ' ( t )  = lim  f  ( t  + at) - f  (0 = lim  - = 0. 

0 
a t - o   at 

a ~ + o  

at 

in this example the derivative  is not defined at the instant  when t = 3. the velocity 
falls suddenly from 2 to zero. the ratio af/at depends, at that special moment,  on 
whether at  is positive or negative. the average velocity after time t = 3 is zero. the 
average velocity before that time is 2. when the graph off  has a corner,  the graph 
of v has a jump.  it is a step function. 

one new part of that example is the notation (dfldt or f'  instead of v). please look 
also at the third figure. it shows how the function takes t (on the left) to f (t). especially 
it shows at  and af. at  the start, af/at is 2. after the stop at t = 3, all t's  go to the 
same f ( t )  = 6. so af = 0 and df /dt = 0.

here is a completely different slope, for the "demand function" f ( t )  = lit. the demand 
is l / t  when the price is t .  a high price t means a low demand l l t .  increasing the price 
reduces the demand.  the calculus question  is: how  quickly  does  l / t  change when t 
changes? the "marginal  demand"  is the slope of  the demand curve. 

the big thing is to find the derivative of  l / t  once and for all. it is  -l / t 2 .

line  1 is  algebra, line  2  is  calculus. the  first  step in  line  1  subtracts  f ( t )  from 
f(t + at). the difference is  l / ( t+ at) minus  l / t .  the common denominator is t times 
t + at-this  makes the algebra possible. we can't  set at  = 0 in line 2, until we have 
divided by at. 
the  average  is  af/at = -l / t ( t+ at). now  set  at  = 0.  the  derivative  is  -l / t 2 .  
section 2.4 will discuss the first of many cases when substituting at  = 0 is not possible, 
and the idea of  a limit has to be made clearer. 

2.1  the derhrathre of a function 

fig. 2.2  average slope is  -&,true slope is  -4.  increase in t produces decrease in f. 

check the algebra at t = 2 and t + at = 3. the demand  llt drops from  112 to 113. 
the difference is af  = - 116, which  agrees with  -1/(2)(3) in line 1. as  the steps af 
and at  get smaller, their ratio approaches  -1/(2)(2)= -114. 

this derivative is negative. the function llt is decreasing, and af  is below zero. the 

graph is going downward in figure 2.2,  and its slope is negative: 

an  increasing f (t) has positive  slope.  a  decreasing f (t) has negative slope. 

the slope  -l/t2 is very negative for small t. a price increase severely cuts demand. 
the next figure makes a small but important point. there is nothing sacred about t. 
x.  a quantity can depend on position  instead 
other letters can be  used-especially 
of time. the height changes as we  go west. the area of  a square changes as the side 
changes. those are not affected by  the passage of  time, and there is no reason to use 
t. you  will often see y =f (x), with x across and y up-connected 

by  a function f. 

similarly, f is not the only possibility. not every function is named f! that letter 
is  useful  because  it  stands for  the  word  function-but  we  are perfectly  entitled to 
write y(x) or y(t) instead off (x) or f (t). the distance up is a function of  the distance 
across. this relationship "y  of  x"  is all-important to mathematics. 

the slope is also a function. calculus is about two functions, y(x) and dyldx. 

question  if  we  add  1 to y(x), what happens to the slope? answer nothing. 
question  if  we  add  1 to the slope, what happens to the height? answer 

the symbols t  and  x  represent  independent  variables-they 

take  any value  they 
want to (in the domain). once they are set, f (t) and y(x) are determined. thus f and 
y represent  dependent  variables-they  depend on  t  and  x.  a change at  produces a

change  af.  a  change  ax  produces  ay.  the  independent  variable  goes  inside  the 
parentheses in f ( t )and y(x). it is not the letter that matters, it is the idea: 

independent variable t or x 
dependent  variable f or g or y  or z  or u 
derivative dfldt or dfldx or dyldx or  --    

the derivative dyldx comes from [change in y] divided by  [change  in x]. the time 
step becomes a  space step, forward  or backward.  the slope is  the  rate  at which  y 
changes with x. the derivative of a function is its "rate of change." 

i mention that physics books use x(t)for distance. darn it. 
to emphasize the definition of  a derivative, here it is again with  y  and x:

a x + o  

the notation yl(x)pins down the point x  where the slope is computed. in dyldx that 
extra precision is omitted. this book  will  try for a reasonable compromise between 
logical perfection and ordinary simplicity. the notation dy/dx(x)is not good; yl(x)is 
better; when x  is understood  it need not  be written in parentheses. 

you  are allowed to say that  the function is y = x2 and the derivative is y'  = 2x-

even if  the strict notation  requires y(x)= x2 and yl(x)= 2x. you  can  even  say that 
the  function is  x2 and  its derivative is  2x  and  its second  derivative is  2-provided 
everybody knows what you mean. 

here is an example. it  is a little early and optional but  terrific. you  get excellent 

practice with letters and symbols, and out come new derivatives. 

example 4 

if  u(x)has slope duldx, what is the slope off ( x )= ( ~ ( x ) ) ~ ?  

from the derivative of  x2 this will give the derivative of  x4. in that case u = x2 and 
f  = x4. first point: the derivative of u2is not ( d ~ l d x ) ~ .we do not square the derivative 
2x. to find the "square  rule"  we  start as we  have to-with  af =f ( x  + ax) -f (x): 

af = ( u ( x  + ax))^  - ( u ( x ) ) ~[u(x+ ax)+ u(x)][ u ( x   + ax)- ~ ( x ) ] .  

=

this algebra  puts  af  in  a convenient form. we  factored a'  - b2 into  [a + b] times 
[a - b]. notice that we  don't  have (am)"we have af, the change in u2.now divide 
by  ax and take the limit:

(5)

this  is  the  square  rule:  the  derivative  of  (u(x))'  is  2u(x) times  duldx.  from  the 
derivatives of  x2 and  l / x  and sin x  (all known) the examples give new  derivatives. 

example 5  (u = x 2 )the derivative of  x4 is  2u duldx = 2(x2)(2x)= 4x3. 

example 6  (u = l / x )the derivative of  1/x2is  2u duldx = (2/x)(- 1/x2) = -2/x3. 

example 7 

(u = sin x, duldx = cos x) the derivative of  u2 = sin2x  is  2 sin x cos x. 

mathematics is  really about ideas. the notation is created to express those ideas. 
newton and leibniz invented calculus independently, and newton's  friends spent a 
lot  of  time  proving  that  he  was  first. he  was,  but  it  was  leibniz  who  thought  of 

2.1  the derivative of a  function 

writing dyldx-which 
caught on. it is the perfect way to suggest the limit of  aylax. 
newton was one of  the great scientists of  all time, and calculus was one of  the great 
inventions  of  all time-but 
the notation must  help. you  now  can write and  speak 
about the derivative. what is needed is a longer list of  functions and derivatives.

2.2  powers and polynomials -this section has two main goals.  one is to find the derivatives of  f (x) = x3 and x4 

and x5 (and more generally f (x) = xn). the power  or exponent  n is at first a positive 
integer. later we allow  x" and x2s2 and every xn. 

the other goal is different.  while computing these derivatives, we  look  ahead  to 

their  applications.  in  using  calculus,  we  meet  equations  with  derivatives  in  them- 
"diflerential equations." it is too early to solve those equations. but it is not too early 
to see the purpose  of  what  we  are doing.  our examples come from economics and 
biology. 

2.2  powers and polynomials 

51 

with  n = 2,  the  derivative  of  x2 is  2x. with  n = - 1, the  slope of  x-'  is  - 1xp2. 
those are two pieces in a beautiful  pattern, which  it  will  be  a  pleasure  to discover. 
we begin with x3 and its derivative  3x2, before jumping  to xn. 
example 1  if f (x) = x3 then af  = (x + h)3 - x3 = (x3 + 3x2 h + 3xh2 + h3) - x3. 
step 3:  h goes to zero. 

step 2:  divide by  h. 

step 1:  cancel x3. 

- = 3x2 + 3xh + h2  approaches  - = 3x2. 
af 
h 

df 
dx 

that is straightforward, and you see the crucial step. the power (x + h)3 yields four 
separate terms  x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3. (notice  1, 3, 3, 1.) after  x3 is  subtracted, we 
can divide by  h. at  the limit (h = 0) we  have  3x2. 

for  f(x) = xn the  plan  is  the  same.  a step  of  size h leads  to  f(x + h) = (x + h)". 
one reason for algebra is to calculate powers like (x + h)", and if  you have forgotten 
the binomial  formula we  can recapture its main point.  start with n = 4: 

multiplying the four x's gives x4. multiplying the four h's gives h4. these are the easy 
terms, but not the crucial ones. the subtraction (x + h)4 - x4 will remove x4, and the 
limiting step h -, 0 will wipe out h4 (even after division by h). the products  that matter 
are  those  with exactly  one  h.  in  example  1 with  (x + h)3, this  key  term  was  3x2 h. 
division by  h left  3x2. 

with  only one h,  there are n places it  can come from.  equation (1) has four  h's  in 
parentheses, and four ways to produce x3 h. therefore the key term is 4x3 h. (division 
by  h leaves 4x3.) in general there are n parentheses and n ways to produce xn- ' h,  so 
the binomial formula  contains nxn - ' h: 

subtract xn from (2). divide by h. the key term is nxn-'.  the rest disappears as h + 0: 

af  - (x + h)" - xn  nxn-' h + ..- + hn 
- -  
ax

so 

df 
-=nxn-l. 
dx 

the terms replaced by  the dots involve h2 and h3 and higher powers.  after dividing 
by h, they still have at least one factor h. all those terms vanish as h approaches zero. 
example 2  (x + h)4 = x4 + 4x3 h + 6x2 h2 + 4xh3 + h4.  this is n = 4 in detail. 
subtract x4, divide by  h, let h + 0. the derivative is 4x3. the coefficients 1,4, 6, 4, 1 
are in pascal's  triangle below. for (x + h)5 the next row is  1, 5, 10, 2. 

remark  the missing terms in the binomial  formula (replaced by the dots) contain 
all  the  products  xn-jhj. an  x  or an  h comes from  each  parenthesis.  the  binomial 
coefficient "n  choose j"  is the number  of  ways to choose j  h's  out  of n parentheses. it 
involves n factorial,  which is n(n - 1) ... (1). thus 5! = 5  4  3  2  1 = 120.

and .-ii2? 

that list is a good start, but plenty  of  functions are left. what comes next  is really 

simple. a  tremendous  number of  new functions are "linear  combinations"  like 

what  are their derivatives? the answers are known for x3 and x2, and  we  want  to 
multiply  by  6 or divide by  2 or add or subtract. do  the same to  the derivatices: 

2c  the derivative of c times f (x) is c times f '(x). 
20  the derivative of  f (x) + g(x) is  f '(x) + gf(x). 

the number c can be any constant. we can add (or subtract) any functions. the rules 
allow any combination of  f and g :  the derivative  of 9f  (x) - 7g(x) is 9f  '(x) - 7g1(x). 

2.2  powers and polynomials 

53 

the reasoning is direct. when f (x) is multiplied by c, so is f (x + h). the difference 
af  is also multiplied by  c. all averages af  /h contain c, so their limit is cf  '. the only 
incomplete step is the last one (the limit).  we still have to say  what "limit"  means. 
rule 2d is similar. adding f + g means adding af  + ag.  now divide by  h.  in the 
limit  as  h +0  we  reach  f '  + g'-because 
a  limit  of  sums is  a  sum  of  limits.  any 
example  is  easy  and  so  is  the  proof-it 
is  the  definition  of  limit  that  needs  care 
(section 2.6). 

you can now find  the derivative of every polynomial.  a  "polynomial"  is a combina- 
tion of 1, x, x2, . . . ,xn-for  example 9 + 2x - x5. that particular polynomial has slope 
2 - 5x4. note  that  the  derivative  of  9 is zero!  a constant just  raises  or lowers the 
graph, without changing its slope. it alters the mileage before starting the car. 

the disappearance of  constants  is  one  of  the  nice  things  in  differential  calculus. 
the  reappearance  of  those  constants  is  one  of  the  headaches  in  integral  calculus. 
when you find v  from f ,  the starting mileage doesn't  matter. the constant in f has 
no effect on v. (af  is measured by  a  trip  meter; at  comes from  a  stopwatch.) to find 
distance from velocity, you need  to know  the mileage at the start. 

a  look at  differential equations (find y  from dyldx) 

we know that y = x3 has the derivative dyldx = 3x2. starting with  the function, we 
found its slope. now reverse that process.  start  with the slope andfind the function. 
this is what  science does all the time-and 

it  seems only  reasonable to say so. 

begin with dyldx = 3x2. the slope is given, the function y is not given. 

question  can you  go backward to reach y = x3? 
answer  almost  but  not  quite.  you  are only  entitled  to  say  that  y = x3 + c.  the 
constant  c  is  the  starting  value  of  y  (when  x = 0). then  the  dzrerential  equation 
dyldx = 3x2 is solved. 

every  time  you  find  a  derivative,  you  can  go  backward  to  solve  a  differential 
equation. the function y = x2 + x has the slope dyldx = 2x + 1. in reverse, the slope 
2x + 1 produces x2 + x-and 
all the other functions x2 + x + c, shifted up and down. 
after going from distance f to velocity v,  we  return to f + c. but there is a lot more 
to differential equations. here are two crucial points: 

1.  we reach dyldx by way of aylax, but we have no system to go backward. with 

dyldx = (sin x)/x we  are lost. what function has this  derivative? 

2.  many  equations  have  the  same solution y = x3. economics  has  dyldx = 3ylx. 
geometry has dyldx = 3y213. these equations involve y as well as dyldx. func- 
tion  and slope are mixed together! this is typical  of  differential equations. 

to summarize: chapters 2-4  compute and use derivatives. chapter 5 goes in reverse. 
integral calculus discovers the function from its slope. given dyldx we find y(x). then 
chapter 6  solves  the  differential  equation  dyldt = y,  function  mixed  with  slope. 
calculus moves from  derivatives to integrals to diferential  equations. 

this  discussion  of  the  purpose  of  calculus  should  mention  a  sp~cific example. 
differential equations are applied to an epidemic (like aids). in most epi  emics the 
number  of  cases  grows  exponentially.  the  peak  is  quickly  reached  by  e ,  and the 
epidemic dies down. amazingly, exponential growth is not happening witb aids- 
the best fit to the data through  1988 is a cubic polynomial (los alamos sciehce, 1989): 

4:


the number of  cases fits a cubic within  2%: y = 174.6(t - 1981.2)3+ 340. 

2  derivatives 

this  is  dramatically  different  from  other  epidemics.  instead  of  dyldt =y  we  have 
dyldt = 3y/t. before this book is printed, we may know what has been preventing d 
(fortunately).  eventually  the  curve  will  turn  away  from  a  cubic-i 
hope  that 
mathematical models will lead to knowledge that saves lives.

marginal cost and  elasticity in economics 

first  point  about  economics: the marginal cost and marginal income are crucially 
important. the average cost of  making automobiles may  be  $10,000.  but  it is the 
$8000 cost of the next car that decides whether ford makes it. "the average describes 
the past, the marginal predicts the future."  for bank deposits or work hours or wheat, 
which come in smaller units, the amounts are continuous variables. then the word 
"marginal"  says one thing: take the derivative.? 

the average pay over all the hours we ever worked may be low. we wouldn't  work 
another hour for that! this average is rising, but  the pay  for each additional hour 
rises faster-possibly 
it jumps. when $10/hour increases to $15/hour after a 40-hour 
week,  a  50-hour  week  pays  $550.  the  average income  is  $ll/hour.  the marginal 
income is $15/hour-the  overtime rate. 

concentrate next  on cost. let y(x) be  the cost of  producing x  tons  of  steel. the 
cost of  x + ax  tons is y(x + ax).  the extra cost is the difference ay.  divide by  ax, 
the number of  extra tons. the ratio ay/ax is the average cost per  extra ton. when 
ax  is an ounce instead of  a ton, we  are near the marginal cost dyldx. 

example: when the cost is x2, the average cost is x2/x = x. the marginal cost is 

2x. figure 2.4 has increasing slope-an 

example of  "diminishing returns to scale."

fig. 2.4  marginal exceeds average. constant elasticity e = +i.  perfectly elastic to perfectly 

inelastic (rcurve). 

this  raises  another  point  about  economics. the  units  are arbitrary. in  yen  per 
kilogram the numbers look different. the way to correct for arbitrary units is to work 
with percentage change or relative change. an increase of ax tons is a relative increase 
of axlx. a cost increase ay is a relative increase of ayly. those are dimensionless, the 
same in tons/tons or dollars/dollars or yen/yen. 

a third example is the demand y at price x. now dyldx is negative. but again the 
units are arbitrary. the demand is in liters or gallons, the price is in dollars or pesos. 

?these  paragraphs  show  how  calculus  applies  to  economics.  you  do  not  have  to  be  an 
economist to  understand them.  certainly the  author is  not,  probably  the  instructor is  not, 
possibly the student is not. we can all use dyldx. 

2.2  powen and polynomials 

relative changes are better. when the price goes up by  lo%, the demand may drop 
by  5%. if  that ratio stays the same for small increases, the elasticity of demand  is f. 
actually this number should be  -f.the price rose, the demand dropped. in our 
definition, the elasticity will  be  -4.in conversation between economists the minus 
sign is left out (i hope not forgotten). 
definition  the elasticity of  the demand function y(x) is 

e(x)  =  lim  - - -. 

ay/y  - dyldx
y / x  

ax-o axlx 

elasticity is "marginal"  divided by  "average."  e(x)is also relative change in y divided 
by relative change in x. sometimes e(x)is the same at all prices-this 
important case 
is discussed below. 

example 1  suppose the  demand  is  y  = c/x when  the  price  is  x.  the  derivative 
dy/dx = -c/x2comes from calculus. the division y/x = c/x2is only algebra. the ratio 
is e =  - 1 :  

for the demand y  = c/x, the elasticity is (- c/x2)/(c/x2)= -1 .  

all demand curves are compared with this one. the demand is inelastic when 1 el  < 1 .  
it  is  elastic when  iel  > 1.  the  demand  20/& 
is  inelastic (e = -f), while  x - ~is 
elastic (e = -3). the power  y = cxn, whose  derivative we  know,  is the function  with 
constant elasticity n: 

if  y = cxn  then  dyldx = cnxn-'  and  e = cnxn- l/(cxn/x) = n. 

it is because y  = cxnsets the standard that we  could come so early to economics. 

in the special case when  y = clx, consumers spend the same at all prices.  price x 

times quantity y  remains constant at xy = c. 

example 2  the  supply  curve  has  e > 0-supply 
increases  with  price.  now  the 
baseline case is  y = cx. the slope is  c  and  the average is y/x = c. the elasticity  is 
e = c / c =   1 .  

compare e = 1 with e = 0 and e = cq.  a constant supply is "perfectly  inelastic." 
the power  n  is zero  and  the  slope is  zero:  y = c. no  more is  available when  the 
harvest is over. whatever the price,  the farmer cannot suddenly grow more wheat. 
lack of  elasticity makes farm economics difficult. 

the other extreme e = a~is "perfectly  elastic."  the supply is unlimited at a fixed 
price  x.  once  this  seemed  true  of  water  and  timber.  in  reality  the  steep  curve 
x = constant is leveling off  to a flat curve y = constant. fixed price is changing to 
fixed supply, e = cq  is becoming e = 0, and the supply of  water follows a "gamma 
curve"  shaped like t. 

example 3  demand  is  an  increasing  function  of  income-more 
income,  more 
demand. the  income  elasticity  is  e(i)= (dy/di)/(y/i).a luxury  has  e > 1 (elastic). 
doubling your  income more than  doubles the demand for caviar.  a  necessity  has 
e < 1 (inelastic). the demand for bread does not double. please recognize how the 
central ideas of  calculus provide a language for the central ideas of  economics. 
important note  on  supply = demand this is  the  basic  equation  of  microeconomics. 
where the supply curve meets the demand curve, the economy finds the equilibrium 
price. supply = demand assumes perfect  competition. with many suppliers, no one can 
raise the price. if  someone tries, the customers go elsewhere.

the opposite case is a monopoly-no  competition. instead of many small producers 
of  wheat, there is one producer of electricity. an airport is a monopolist (and maybe 
the national football  league). if  the price is raised,  some demand remains. 

price fixing  occurs when several producers act like a monopoly-which 

antitrust 
laws try to prevent. the price is not  set by  supply = demand. the calculus problem 
is different-to  maximize profit.  section 3.2 locates the maximum where the marginal 
profit  (the slope!) is zero. 
question on income elasticity  from  an income  of  $10,000 you  save  $500. the 
income  elasticity  of  savings  is  e = 2.  out  of  the  next  dollar  what  fraction  do you 
save? 
answer 
the  savings  is  y = cx2 because  e  = 2.  the  number  c  must  give  500 = 
lo4 = &. this is 
so c is 5 
~(10,000)~, 
the marginal savings, ten cents on the dollar. average savings is 5%, marginal savings 
is  lo%, and e = 2. 

then the slope dyldx is 2cx = 10

2  derivatives -2.3  the  slope and the tangent  line  -

58 

chapter 1 started with straight line graphs. the velocity was constant (at least piece- 
wise). the distance function  was linear. now  we  are facing polynomials  like x3 - 2 
or x4 - x2 + 3, with other functions to come soon. their graphs are definitely curved. 
most functions are not close to linear-except 
if  you focus all your attention near a 
single point. that is what we  will do. 

over a very short range a curve looks straight. look through a microscope, or zoom 
in with a computer, and there is no doubt. the graph of distance versus time becomes 
nearly linear. its slope is the velocity at that moment. we want  to find the line that 
the graph stays closest to-the  "tangent linew-before 

it curves away. 

the tangent line is easy to describe. we are at a particular point  on the graph of 
y =f (x).  at  that  point  x  equals  a  and  y  equals  f (a) and  the  slope  equals  f '(a). 
the  tangent  line  goes  through  that  point  x = a,  y =f (a)  with  that  slope  m = fl(a). 
figure 2.5 shows the line more clearly than any equation, but  we  have to turn the 
geometry  into algebra. we need the equation  of  the line. 
example 1  suppose y = x4 - x2+ 3. at the point x = a = 1, the height is y =f(a)= 3. 
the slope is dyldx = 4x3 - 2x. at  x = 1 the slope is 4 - 2 = 2.  that is fl(a): 

the numbers x  = 1, y = 3, dyldx = 2 determine the tangent line. 

the equation of  the tangent line is y - 3 = 2(x - l), and this section explains why. 

fig. 2.5  the tangent  line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom). 

the  equation  of a  line 

a straight  line is determined  by  two conditions. we  know  the line if  we  know  two 
of  its points.  (we still have to write down the equation.) also, if  we  know  one point 
and the slope, the line is  set. that is  the  situation  for the  tangent  line, which  has a 
known slope at a known point: 

1.  the equation of  a line has the form y = mx + b 
2.  the number  m is the slope of  the line, because dyldx = m 
3.  the number  b adjusts the line to go through  the required  point. 

i will  take those one at a time-first 
1.  the graph of y = mx + b is not curved. how do we know? for the specific example 
y = 2x + 1, take two points whose coordinates x, y satisfy the equation: 
x=o, y =  1  and  x = 4 ,  y = 9   both satisfy  y =  2x+ 1. 

y = mx + b,  then  m,  then b. 

2.3  the slope and the tangent line 

those points (0, 1) and (4,9)lie on the  graph.  the point  halfway  between has x = 2 
and  y = 5. that point  also satisfies y = 2x + 1.  the halfway point  is on  the graph.  if 
we  subdivide  again,  the  midpoint  between  (0, 1) and  (2, 5) is  (1, 3). this  also  has 
y = 2x + 1. the graph contains all halfway points and must  be straight. 
2.  what is the correct slope m for the tangent line? in our example it is m =f  '(a) = 2. 
the curve and its tangent line have the same slope at the crucial point: dyldx = 2. 
allow me to say in another way why the line y = mx + b has slope m. at  x  = 0 its 
height is y = b. at  x = 1  its height is y = m + b. the graph has gone one unit  across 
(0 to 1) and  m units up (b to m + b). the whole idea is 
m -
- - 
1  ' 

distance across 

distance  up 

slope = 

each  unit  across  means  m  units  up,  to  2m + b  or  3m + b.  a straight  line  keeps  a 
constant slope, whereas the slope of  y = x4 - x2 + 3 equals 2 only at x  = 1. 
3.  finally we decide on b. the tangent line y = 2x + b must go through x = 1, y = 3. 
therefore b = 1. with letters instead  of  numbers, y = mx + b leads to f  (a) = ma + b. 
so we know b: 

(2)i 

2e  the equation of the tangent line has b =f (a)- ma: 

y = m x + f ( a ) - m a  

or 

y - f ( a ) = m ( x - a ) .  

that last form  is  the  best. you  see immediately  what  happens  at x  = a. the  factor 
x  - a is zero. therefore y =f (a) as required. this is the point-slope form  of the equa- 
tion, and we  use it constantly: 

y - 3 = 2 ( x - 1 )  

or 

y  - 3  - distance  up 
--
x - 1 

distance  across 

= sbpe 2. 

example 2  the  curve  y = x3 - 2  goes  through  y = 6  when  x  = 2.  at  that  point 
dyldx = 3x2 = 12. the point-slope  equation  of  the tangent line uses 2 and 6 and  12: 

y - 6 =   12(x-2),  which is also  y=  12x-  18. 

there is another important line. it is perpendicular to the tangent line and perpen-
dicular to the curve. this is the normal line in figure 2.6.  its new feature is its slope. 
when the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope  - llm. (rule: slopes of

has slope  - 1/ 12: 

tangent  line: y  - 6 = 12(x - 2) 

normal  line: y  - 6 = - &(x - 2). 

light rays travel in the normal direction. so do brush fires-they  move perpendicular 
to the fire line. use the point-slope form! the tangent  is y = 12x - 18, the normal is 
not y = - &x  - 18. 
example 3  you  are on a  roller-coaster  whose  track  follows y = x2 + 4. you  see a 
friend at (0,o)and want  to get  there quickly. where do you  step off? 

solution  your path will be the tangent line (at high speed). the problem is to choose 
x  = a so  the tangent  line passes  through x = 0, y  = 0. when  you  step off at x  = a, 

the height  is y = a2+ 4 and the  slope is 2a 
the equation of  the  tangent  line is y - (a2+ 4) = 2a(x - a) 
this line goes through (0,o)if  - (a2+ 4) = - 2a2 or a = + 2. 

the same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers. releasing 
a ball  at the right  time to hit a target  60 feet away is an amazing display of calculus. 
quarterbacks  with  a  moving target  should  read  chapter 4  on related  rates. 

here is a  better example than a  roller-coaster.  stopping at a red  light  wastes  gas. 
it is smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate.  when  a car is waiting in front 
of  you, the timing  needs calculus: 

example 4  how much  must  you  slow  down when  a  red  light  is  72 meters  away? 
in  4  seconds  it  will  be  green.  the  waiting  car will  accelerate  at  3 meters/sec2. you 
cannot pass  the car. 

strategy  slow down immediately  to the speed  v at which  you  will just  catch that 
car. (if you  wait  and brake later, your  speed will  have  to go below  v.)at  the catch- 
up time  t ,  the  cars have  the  same speed and same distance.  two conditions,  so the 
distance functions in  figure 2.6d are tangent. 

solution  at  time  t, the  other  car's  speed  is  3 ( t -  4). that  shows the  delay  of  4 
seconds.  speeds are equal when  3(t - 4) = v or  t =  v + 4. now  require  equal dis- 
tances.  your distance is  v  times  t. the other car's  distance is  72 + $at2: 
7 2 + 5 3 ( ~ - 4 ) ~ = v tbecomes  7 2 + f - f - v 2 = v ( 3 v + 4 ) .  

the solution is  v = 12 meters/second. this is 43 km/hr or 27  miles per  hour. 

without  the  other  car, you  only  slow  down  to  v =  7214 = 18  meters/second. as 

the light  turns green,  you  go through  at 65 km/hr or 40 miles per  hour. try it. 

the  secant  line connecting two  points on a  curve 

instead  of  the tangent  line  through  one point,  consider  the  secant  line  through two 
points.  for the tangent  line the points  came together. now  spread  them  apart. the 
point-slope form of  a  linear  equation is replaced  by  the  two-point form. 

the equation of the curve is still y =f (x). the first point  remains at x = a, y  =f  (a). 
the other point is at x  = c, y  =f (c). the secant line goes between  them. and we want 
its equation. this time we  don't  start with  the slope-but 

rn is easy to find. 

2.3  the slope and the tangent line 

example 5  the curve y = x3 - 2 goes  through x = 2,  y = 6.  it also goes through 
x = 3, y = 25. the slope between those points is 

m =  

change in y - 25 - 6 
3 - 2 
change in x 

---

- 19.

the point-slope form (at the first point) is y - 6 = 19(x- 2).  this line automatically 
goes through the second point (3,25).  check: 25 - 6 equals 19(3- 2).  the secant 
has the right slope 19 to reach the second point. it is the average slope aylax. 

a  look  ahead  the second point  is  going to approach the first  point.  the secant 
slope aylax  will  approach the tangent slope dyldx. we  discover the derivative (in 
the limit). that is the main point now-but  not forever. 

soon you  will  be  fast  at derivatives.  the  exact  dyldx  will  be  much  easier than 
aylax.  the  situation  is  turned  around  as  soon  as  you  know  that  x9 has  slope 
9x8. near  x = 1,  the  distance  up  is  about  9  times  the  distance  across.  to  find 
ay  = l.0019- 19,just multiply ax = .001 by 9. the quick approximation is .009, the 
calculator gives ay  = .009036. it is easier to follow the tangent line than the curve. 

come back  to the secant line, and change numbers to letters. what line connects 
x = a, y =f (a) to x = c, y =f (c)? a mathematician puts formulas ahead of  numbers, 
and reasoning ahead of  formulas, and ideas ahead of  reasoning: 

(1) the slope is m = 

distance up  -- f (c)-f (a) 
distance across 

c - a 

(2) the height is y =f (a) at x = a 
(3) the height is y =f (c) at x = c  (automatic with correct slope). 

-  - 

the t 

f ~ v a ruses the slope between the 
f4d -f@ 
c - a  

(3)

at  x = a the right side is zero. so y =f (a) on the left side. at x = c the right side has 
two factors c - a. they cancel to leave y =f (c). with equation (2) for the tangent line 
and equation (3) for the secant line, we  are ready for the moment of  truth. 

the  secant  llne approaches the  tangent  llne 

what comes now is pretty basic. it matches what we did with velocities: 

average velocity = 

a  distance -- f (t + at) -f (t)
a  time 

at 

the limit is  df  /dt. we  now  do exactly the  same thing with  slopes.  the secant tine 
turns into the tangent line as c approaches a:

there stands the fundamental idea of id128! you have to imagine more 
secant lines than i can draw in figure 2.7, as c comes close to a. everybody recognizes 
c - a  as ax.  do you  recognize f (c) -f (a) as f (x + ax) -f (x)? it is af,  the change 
in height. all lines go through x = a, y =f (a). their limit is the tangent line.

intuitively, the limit is pretty clear. the two points come together, and the tangent 
line touches the curve at one point. (it could touch again at faraway points.) mathe- 
matically this limit can be tricky-it 
takes us from algebra to calculus. algebra stays 
away from 010,  but calculus gets as close as it can. 

the new limit for df  /dx looks different, but it is the same as before: 

f'(a) = lim f ( 4  -f (a)

example 6  find the secant lines and tangent line for y =f (x) = sin x at x = 0. 
the starting point is x = 0, y = sin 0. this is the origin (0,o). the ratio of distance up 
to distance across is (sin c)/c: 

secant equation y = -x 

sin c

tangent equation y = lx. 

as  c approaches zero, the secant line becomes the tangent line. the limit of (sin c)/c 
is not 010, which is meaningless, but  1, which is dyldx. 
example 7  the gold you  own will  be  worth & million dollars in t years.  when 
does the rate of  increase drop to  10% of  the current  value, so you  should  sell the 
gold and buy a bond? at  t = 25, how far does that put you ahead of & = 5? 
solution  the rate of increase is the derivative of &,which is  1/2&.  that is  10% 
of the current value &when 1/2&  = &/lo.  therefore 2t = 10 or t = 5. at that time 
you sell the gold, leave the curve, and go onto the tangent line: 

y - f i = $ ( t - 5 )  

becomes  y - f i = 2 f i  

at 

t=25. 

with  straight  interest  on  the  bond,  not  compounded,  you  have  reached 
y = 3 f i   = 6.7  million dollars.  the gold is worth a measly five million.

this section does two things. one is  to compute the derivatives of  sin x  and cos x. 
the other is to explain why these functions are so important. they describe oscillation, 
which will be expressed in words and equations. you will see a "di~erential equation." 
it involves the derivative of  an unknown function y(x). 

the differential equation will  say that  the second  derivative-the  derivative of  the 
derivative-is  equal and opposite to y.  in symbols this is  y" = - y.  distance in  one 
direction leads to acceleration in the other direction. that makes y and y'  and y" all 
oscillate. the solutions to y" = - y are sin x and cos x and all their combinations. 

we begin with the slope. the derivative of y = sin x is y' = cos x. there is no reason 
for that to be a mystery, but i still find it beautiful. chapter 1 followed a ball around 
a circle; the shadow went up and down. its height was sin t and its velocity was cos t .  

2.4  the derhrutii of the sine and cosine 

we now find that derivative by  the standard method of  limits, when y(x) = sin x:

sin (x + h) - sin x 

h 

the sine is harder to work with than x2 or x3. where we had (x + h)2 or (x + h)3, we 
now have sin(x + h). this calls for one of  the basic "addition  formulas"  from trigo- 
nometry, reviewed in section 1.5: 

sin (x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h 
cos(x + h) = cos x cos h - sin x sin h. 

equation (2) puts ay  = sin (x + h) - sin x in a new form: 

sin x cos h + cos x sin h - sin x

the ratio  splits into two simpler pieces on the right.  algebra and trigonometry got 
us  this far, and now comes the calculus problem.  what happens as h +o?  it  is no 
longer easy to divide by  h. (i will not even mention the unspeakable crime of writing 
(sin h)/h = sin.) there  are two  critically important  limits-the 
first is zero  and  the 
second is one: 

cos h - 1 

lim 
h - 0  

h 

= 0 

and 

sin h 

lim --- 1. 
h - 0  

h 

the  careful reader  will  object  that  limits have  not  been  defined! you  may  further 
object to computing these limits separately, before combining them into equation (4). 
nevertheless-following 
the principle of ideas now, rigor later-i  would like to pro- 
ceed. it is entirely true that the limit of  (4) comes from the two limits in (5): 

dy- -- (sin x)(first limit) + (cos x)(second limit) = 0 + cos x. 
dx 

(6)

the secant slope ay/ax has approached the tangent  slope dyldx. 

.995 

we cannot pass over the crucial step-the 

two limits in (5). they contain the real 
ideas. both ratios become 010 i f  we just  substitute h = 0. remember that the cosine of 
a zero angle is  1, and the sine of  a zero angle is 0. figure 2.8a shows a small angle h 
(as near  to zero  as we  could reasonably  draw). the edge of  length sin h is close to 
zero, and the edge of length cos h is near  1. figure 2.8b shows how the ratio of  sin h 
to h (both headed for zero) gives the slope of  the sine curve at the start. 

when two functions approach zero, their ratio might do anything. we might have 

-995 r cos 
lhno  clue  comes from  010.  what  matters  is  whether  the  top  or  bottom goes  to  zero 

more quickly. roughly speaking, we  want to show that (cos h - l)/h is like h2/h and 
(sin h)/h is like hlh. 
time out  the graph  of  sin x is in  figure 2.9 (in black). the graph of  sin(x + ax) 
sits just  beside it (in red). the height difference is af  when the shift distance is ax.

fig. 2.9 

now  divide by that small number ax  (or h).  the second figure shows af  /ax. it is 
close  to cos x.  (look how  it  starts-it 
is not  quite cos x.)  mathematics will  prove 
that the limit is cos x exactly, when  ax -, 0. curiously, the reasoning concentrates 
on only one point (x = 0). the slope at that point is cos 0= 1. 
we  now  prove  this:  sin ax  divided  by  ax  goes to  1. the sine curve starts with 
slope 1. by  the addition formula for sin (x + h), this answer at one point will lead to 
the slope cos x at all points. 
question  why does the graph of f(x + ax) shift left  from f (x) when ax > o? 
answer  when x = 0, the shifted graph is already showing f (ax). in figure 2.9a, the 
red  graph is shifted left  from the black graph. the red  graph shows sin h when the 
black graph shows sin 0. 

the  limit of (sin  h ) / h  is 4 

there are several ways to find this limit. the direct approach  is to let  a computer 
draw a graph. figure 2.10a is very convincing. the function  (sin h)/h approaches 1at 
the key point  h = 0. so does (tan h)/h. in practice, the only danger is that you might 
get a message like "undefined function"  and no graph. (the machine may refuse to 
divide by zero at h = 0. probably you can get around that.) because of the importance 
of this limit, i want to give a mathematical proof that it equals 1.

fig. 2.40  (sin h)/hsqueezed between cos x and 1; (tan h)/h decreases to  1. 

figure 2.10b indicates, but still only graphically, that sin h stays below h. (the first 
graph  shows  that  too;  (sin h)/h  is  below  1.) we  also  see  that  tan h stays above  h. 
remember that  the tangent is the ratio of  sine to cosine. dividing by  the cosine is 
enough to push  the tangent above h.  the crucial inequalities (to be  proved when  h 
is small and positive) are 

s i n h < h  

and 

t a n h > h .  

(7) 

2.4  the  derlvcrthre of the sine and cosine 

since tan h = (sin h)/(cos h), those are the same as 

sin h 

h 

< 1 

and  -> cos h.

sin h 

h 

what happens as h goes to zero? the ratio (sin h)/h is squeezed between cos h and  1. 
but  cos h is  approaching  i!  the  squeeze  as  h + 0  leaves  only  one  possibility for 
(sin h)/h, which is caught in between:  the ratio (sin h)/h approaches 1. 

figure 2.10 shows that "squeeze play."  lftwo functions  approach the same limit, so 

does any function  caught in between. this is proved at the end of  section 2.6. 

for negative values of  h,  which are absolutely allowed, the result is the same. to 
the left of zero, h reverses sign and sin h reverses sign. the ratio (sin h)/h is unchanged. 
(the sine is an odd function: sin (- h) = - sin h.)  the ratio is an even function, sym- 
metric around zero and approaching 1 from both sides. 

the proof depends on sin h < h < tan h,  which is displayed by  the graph but not 

explained. we go back to right triangles. 

fig. 2.11  line shorter than arc: 2 sin h < 2h. areas give h < tan h. 

figure 2.11a  shows why  sin h < h.  the  straight  line  pq  has  length  2 sin h.  the 
circular arc must  be  longer, because  the shortest  distance between  two  points  is a 
straight  line.?  the arc pq  has length 2h.  (important:  when  the radius is  1, the arc 
length  equals the angle. the full  circumference is  2n  and the full angle is  also  2n.) 
the straight distance  2 sin h is less than the circular distance  2h,  so  sin h < h. 

figure 2.1 1b shows why h < tan h.  this time we look at areas. the triangular area 
is f(base)(height)= i(l)(tan h). inside that triangle is the shaded sector of  the circle. 
its area is h/2n times the area of  the whole circle (because the angle is that fraction 
of  the whole angle). the circle has area nr2 = n,  so multiplication by  h/2n gives fh 
for the area of the sector. comparing with the triangle around it, f tan h > fh. 

the  inequalities sin h < h < tan h  are  now  proved.  the  squeeze  in  equation  (8) 
produces (sin h)/h -, 1.  q.e.d.  problem 13 shows how to prove sin h < h from areas. 
note  all angles x and h are being measured in radians. in degrees, cos x is not  the 
derivative of  sin x. a degree is much less than a radian, and dyldx is reduced by  the 
factor 2~1360. 

the  limit of  (cos h - 1)/h is  0 

this second limit is different. we will show that 1 - cos h shrinks to zero more quickly 
than  h.  cosines are connected to sines by  (sin h)2 + (cos h)2 = 1. we  start from the 

+if we  try to prove that, we will  be here all night. accept it  as true. 

2  derivatives 

known fact sin h < h and work it into a form involving cosines: 

(1 - cos h)(l + cos h) = 1 - (cos h)2 = (sin h)2 < h2. 

note that everything is positive.  divide through by  h and also by  1 + cos h: 

(9) 

o <  

1 - cos h

1 + cos h ' 

our ratio is  caught in the middle.  the right  side goes to zero because h +0. this is 
another "squeezew-there 

is no escape. our ratio goes to zero. 

for cos h - 1 or for negative  h,  the signs change but minus zero is still zero. this 

confirms equation (6). the slope of  sin x is cos x. 

remark  equation (10) also shows that  1 - cos h is approximately ih2. the 2 comes 
from  1 + cos h.  this is  a  basic  purpose of  calculus-to 
find  simple approximations 
like $h2. a  "tangent  parabola"  1 - $h2 is close to the top of  the cosine curve. 

the  derivative of the  cosine 

this will  be  easy.  the  quick  way  to differentiate  cos x  is  to shift  the  sine curve  by 
xl2.that yields the cosine curve (solid line in figure 2.12b).the derivative also shifts 
by  4 2  (dotted line). the derivative  of cos x is  - sin x. 

notice  how  the  dotted  line  (the slope) goes below  zero when  the  solid line  turns 
downward.  the  slope equals  zero  when  the  solid  line  is  level.  increasing functions 
have positive  slopes. decreasing functions  have negative slopes. that is important, and 
we  return to it. 

there  is  more information  in  dyldx  than  "function  rising"  or "function  falling." 
the slope tells how  quickly the function goes up or down. it gives the rate of  change. 
the slope of  y = cos x can be  computed  in the normal way, as the limit of  aylax: 

ay  - cos(x + h) - cos x

(11)
the  first  line  came  from  formula  (3) for  cos(x + h). the  second  line  took  limits, 
reaching 0 and  1 as before.  this confirms the graphical proof  that  the slope of  cos x 
is  - sin x.

the  second derivatives of the  sine and cosine 

we now introduce the derivative  of the derivative. that is the second  derivative  of  the 
original  function.  it  tells  how  fast  the  slope  is  changing,  not  how  fast  y  itself  is 

2.4  the  derivative of the sine and cosine 

changing. the second derivative is the "rate of change of the velocity." a straight line 
has constant slope (constant velocity), so its second derivative is zero: 

f (t) = 5t  has  df  /dt = 5  and  d2f /dt2 = 0. 

the parabola y = x2 has slope 2x (linear) which has slope 2 (constant). similarly 

f(t)=rat2  has  df/dt=at  and  d2f/dt2=a. 

there  stands the notation  d2f/dt2 (or  d2y/dx2) for  the  second derivative. a  short 
form is f "  or y".  (this is pronounced  f double prime or y double prime). example: 
the second derivative of  y = x3 is y" = 6x. 

in the distance-velocity problem, f "  is acceleration. it tells how fast v is changing, 
while  v  tells  how  fast  f  is  changing.  where  df/dt  was  distanceltime,  the  second 
derivative is di~tance/(time)~. the acceleration due to gravity is about 32 ft/sec2 or 
9.8 m/sec2, which means that v increases by 32 ftlsec in one second. it does not mean 
that the distance increases by  32 feet! 

the graph of y = sin t increases at the start. its derivative cos t is positive. however 
the second derivative is  -sin t.  the curve is bending down  while going up.  the arch 
is "concave  down"  because y" = - sin t is negative. 

at  t = n the curve reaches zero and goes negative. the second derivative becomes 

positive. now  the curve bends upward. the lower arch is "concave  up." 

y" > 0 means that y'  increases so y bends upward (concave up) 
y" < 0 means that y'  decreases so y bends down (concave down). 

chapter 3 studies these things properly-here  we  get an advance look for sin t. 

the remarkable fact  about  the  sine and cosine is  that y" = -y.  that is  unusual 
and special: acceleration = -distance.  the greater the distance, the greater the force 
pulling back: 

y = sin t  has  dy/dt = + cos t  and  d2y/dt2= - sin t  = - y. 
y = cos t  has  dy/dt = - sin t  and  d  y/dt2 = - cos t = - y. 

question  does d2y/dt2 < 0 mean that the distance y(t) is decreasing? 
answer  no.  absolutely  not!  it means that  dy/dt is  decreasing, not  necessarily y. 
at  the start of  the sine curve, y is still increasing but y" < 0. 

sines and cosines give simple harmonic motion-up 

and down, forward and back, 
out and in, tension and compression. stretch a spring, and the restoring force pulls 
it back. push a swing up, and gravity brings it down. these motions are controlled 
by  a diyerential equation: 

all  solutions are combinations of  the sine and cosine: y = a sin t + b cos t. 
this is not  a course on differential equations. but you have to see the purpose of 
calculus. it models events by equations. it models oscillation by  equation (12). your 
heart fills and empties. balls bounce. current alternates. the economy goes up and 
down: 

high prices -+ high production -,low prices -, -.. 

we can't  live without oscillations (or differential equations).

is  2u duldx. 

what are the derivatives of  x + sin x and x sin x and  l/sin x and xlsin x and sinnx? 
those are  made  up from  the familiar pieces  x  and  sin x,  but  we  need  new  rules. 
fortunately they are rules that apply to every function, so they can be  established 
once and for all. if  we  know the separate derivatives of  two functions u and v,  then 
the derivatives of  u + v  and uu  and  llv and u/u  and un are immediately available. 

this is a straightforward section, with those five rules to learn. it is also an impor- 
tant section, containing most of  the working tools of  id128. but  i am 
afraid that five rules and thirteen examples (which we need-the  eyes glaze over with 
formulas alone) make a long list. at  least the easiest rule comes first.  when we add 
functions,  we add their derivatives. 

sum rule 

d 
the derivative of  the sum u(x) + v(x) is -
dx 

du 
dv
(u + v) = -+ -.
dx  dx 

example 1  the derivative of  x + sin x is  1 + cos x.  that  is  tremendously simple, 
but it is fundamental. the interpretation for distances may be more confusing (and 
more interesting) than the rule itself: 

suppose a train moves with velocity  1. the distance at time t is t. on the train 
a professor paces back and forth (in simple harmonic motion). his distance from 
his seat is sin t. then the total distance from his starting point is t + sin t, and 
his velocity (train speed plus walking speed) is  1 + cos t. 
if  you add distances, you add velocities. actually that example is ridiculous, because 
the professor's maximum speed equals the train speed (= 1). he is running like mad, 
not pacing. occasionally he is standing still with respect to the ground. 

the sum rule is a special case of  a bigger  rule called "linearity." it applies when 
we  add or subtract functions and multiply them by constants-as 
in 3x - 4 sin x. by 
linearity the derivative is 3 - 4 cos x. the rule works for all functions u(x) and v(x). 
a linear combination is  y(x) = au(x) + bv(x), where  a  and  b are  any  real  numbers. 
then aylax  is 

2  derivatives 

the limit  on the  left is  dyldx.  the limit  on the  right  is a dujdx + b dvldx.  we  are 
allowed to take limits separately and add. the result is what we  hope for: 

rule  of linearity 

d 
the derivative of  au(x) + bv(x) is -
dx 

dv
(au + bu) = a -+ b -.
dx 

du 
dx 

the prorluct  rule comes next. it can't  be so simple-products  are not linear. the 
sum rule is what  you would have done anyway, but  products give something new. 
the krivative of u times v  is not  duldx times dvldx. example: the derivative of  x5 
is  5x4.  don't  multiply  the  derivatives  of  x3 and  x2.  (3x2 times  2x  is  not  5x4.) 
for a product of  two functions,  the derivative has two terms. 

product  rule  (the key  to this section) 

du
the derivative of  u(x)v(x)  is  -(uu) = u -+ v -.
dx 

d 
dx 

dv 
dx 

example 2  u = x3 times v = x2 is uv  = x5. the product rule leads to 5x4: 

example 3  in the slope of  x sin x, i don't  write dxldx = 1 but it's there: 

d 
-(x sin x) = x cos x + sin x. 
dx 

example 4 

if  u = sin x and v = sin x then uv  = sin2 x. we get two equal terms: 

d 
sin x -(sin x) + sin x -
dx 

d
dx 

(sin x) = 2 sin x cos x. 

this confirms the "square  rule"  2u duldx, when u is the same as v.  similarly the slope 
of  cos2 x is  -2 cos x sin x (minus sign from the slope of  the cosine). 

question  those answers for sin2 x and cos2 x have opposite signs, so the derivative 
of  sin2 x + cos2 x is zero (sum rule). how do you see that more quickly? 
example 5  the derivative of  uvw  is uvw' + uv'w + u'vw-one 
the derivative of  xxx is xx + xx + xx. 

derivative at a time. 

fig. 2.13  change in length =au +av.  change in area = u av + v au +au av. 

2.5  the  product and quotient and power rules 

after those examples we  prove the product rule. figure 2.13 explains it best. the 
area of  the big rectangle is uv.  the important  changes in area are the two strips  u av 
and v au.  the corner area au  av  is much smaller. when we divide by ax,  the strips 
give u av/ax and v aulax. the corner gives au  avlax, which approaches zero. 

notice  how  the  sum  rule  is  in  one  dimension  and  the  product  rule  is  in  two 

dimensions. the rule for uvw  would be in three dimensions. 

the extra area comes from the whole top strip plus the side strip. by  algebra, 

this increase is u(x + h)av + v(x)au-top  plus side. now  divide by  h (or ax) and let 
h + 0. the left side of  equation (4) becomes the derivative of  u(x)v(x). the right side 
becomes  u(x) times  dvldx-we 
v(x) times  duldx. 
that proves the product rule-definitely 

can  multiply  the  two  limits-plus 

useful. 

we  could go immediately to the  quotient rule for u(x)/v(x). but start with  u = 1. 

the derivative of  l/x is  - 1/x2 (known). what is the derivative of  l/v(x)?

it is worth checking the units-in 

the reciprocal rule and others. a test of  dimen- 
sions is automatic in science and engineering, and a good  idea in mathematics.  the 
test ignores constants and plus or minus signs, but  it  prevents bad  errors. if  v  is in 
dollars and x is in hours, dv/dx is in dollars per  hour. then dimensions agree: 

hour 

and also  - w 

- dvldx 

dollars/hour 

v 

 dollar^)^ 

from  this  test,  the  derivative of  l/v cannot  be  l/(dv/dx). a similar test  shows that 
einstein's formula e = mc2 is dimensionally possible. the theory  of  relativity might 
be  correct! both  sides have  the  dimension  of  (mas~)(distance)~/(time)~, when  mass 
is converted to energy.? 

example6  the derivatives ofx-',  x - ~ ,  x-"  are  -1xp2,  - z x - ~ ,  -nx-"-i. 

those come from the reciprocal rule with  v = x and x2 and any xn: 

the  beautiful  thing  is  that  this  answer  -nx-"-' 
multiply  by the exponent and reduce it by one. 

fits  into the  same pattern  as xn. 

for  negative and positive  exponents the derivative  of xn is nxn- l.

those formulas are often seen in calculus. if you have a good memory they are worth 
storing.  like most  mathematicians, i  have  to check  them  every  time  before  using 
them (maybe once a year). it is really the rules that are basic, not the formulas. 

the next rule applies to the quotient u(x)/v(x). that is u times llv. combining the 

product rule and reciprocal rule gives something new and important: 

quotient rule 

the derivative of  - is  - -- u --

u(x) 
u(x) 

1 du 
vdx 

dvldx - v  duldx - u  dvldx

v2 

v2 

you must memorize that last formula. the v2 is familiar. the rest is new, but not very 
new.  if  v = 1  the  result  is  duldx  (of  course).  for  u = 1  we  have  the  reciprocal 
rule.  figure 2.14b  shows  the  difference  (u + au)/(v + av) - (ulv).  the  denominator 
v(v+ av) is responsible for v2. 
example 8  (only practice) if  u/v = x5/x3 (which is x2) the quotient rule gives 2x: 

example 9  (important)  for  u = sin x  and  v = cos x,  the quotient  is sin xlcos x = 
tan x. the derivative of  tan x is sec2 x. use the quotient rule and cos2 x + sin2 x = 1: 

cos x(cos x) - sin x(-  sin x) - 1---

c0s2x 

c0s2x 

- sec2 x. 

(11)

again  to memorize: (tan x)' = sec2 x.  at  x =0, this slope is  1. the graphs  of  sin x 
and  x  and  tan x  all start with  this  slope  (then they  separate). at  x = n/2 the  sine 
curve is flat (cos x = 0) and the tangent curve is vertical (sec2 x = co). 

the slope generally blows  up faster than  the function. we  divide by  cos x, once 
for the tangent and twice for its slope. the slope of  l/x is  -l/x2. the slope is more 
sensitive than the function, because of  the square in the denominator.

that one i hesitate to touch at x = 0. formally it becomes 010.  in reality it is more 
like 03/02, and the true derivative is zero. figure 2.10 showed graphically that (sin x)/x 
is flat at the center point.  the function is even (symmetric across the y  axis) so its 
derivative can only be zero. 

this section is full of rules, and i hope you will allow one more. it goes beyond xn 
in  (sin x ) ~  or (tan x)'  or 
to (u(x)r. a  power  of  x  changes to a  power  of  u(x)-as 
(x2+ i)*. the derivative contains nun-'  (copying nxn- '),  but there is an extra factor 
duldx. watch that factor in 6(sin x)'  cos x and 7(tan x ) ~sec2 x and 8(x2 + l)'(2x): 

power  rule 

the derivative of 

[u(x)in 

is  n[~(x)]~-' ;i; 

du

for n = 1 this reduces to du/dx = duldx. for n = 2 we  get the square rule 2u duldx. 
next comes u3. the best approach is to use mathematical induction, which goes from 
each n to the next power n + 1 by  the product  rule: 

that is exactly equation (12) for the power n + 1. we get all positive powers this way, 
going up from n = 1-then 

the negative powers come from the reciprocal rule. 

figure 2.15  shows  the  power  rule  for  n = 1,2,3.  the  cube  makes  the  point 
best.  the  three  thin  slabs are  u  by  u  by  au.  the  change  in  volume  is  essentially 
3u2au.  from  multiplying  out  ( ~ + a u ) ~ ,the  exact  change  in  volume 
is 
3u2 au + ~ u ( a u ) ~+ (a~)~-which also accounts for three narrow boxes and a midget 
cube in the corner. this is the binomial formula in a picture.

our last step finally escapes from a very  undesirable restriction-that  n must be 
a  whole  number.  we  want  to allow fractional powers n = p/q,  and  keep the  same 
formula. the derivative of  xn is still nxn- ' 
to deal with square roots i can write (&)'  = x. its derivative is 2&(&)' 

= 1. 

therefore (&)' 

is 1/2&  which fits the formula when n = f.now try n = p/q:

x = co.the graph climbs faster than a line and slower than a parabola (4 is between 
1 and 2).  its slope follows the cube root curve (times j). 

we stop now! i am sorry there were so many rules. a computer can memorize 
them all, but it doesn't  know what they mean and you do. together with the chain 
rule that dominates chapter 4, they achieve virtually all the derivatives ever computed 
by  mankind. we list them in one place for convenience.

you  have  seen  enough  limits to be  ready for  a  definition. it is true that  we  have 
survived this far without  one, and we  could continue.  but this seems a  reasonable 
time to define limits more carefully. the goal is to achieve rigor without rigor mortis. 
first  you  should  know  that  limits of  ay/ax  are by  no means the only limits in 
mathematics. here are five completely different examples. they involve n + a,not 
ax +0: 

1.  a,  = (n - 3)/(n + 3)  (for large n,  ignore the 3's  and find a,  + 1) 
2.  a,  =)a,-,  + 4  (start with any a, and always a,  + 8) 
3.  an=id203  of  living to year n  (unfortunately an +0) 
4.  a,  = fraction of  zeros among the first n digits of  n  (an+h?) 
5.  a, = .4, a2 = .49, a,  = .493,  .... no  matter what  the remaining decimals are, the 

a's  converge to a limit. possibly a,  + .493000 . . .,but not likely. 

the problem is to say  what the limit symbol  +  really means. 

a good starting point is to ask about convergence to zero. when does a sequence 
of positive numbers approach zero? what does it mean to write an +o?  the numbers 
a,, a,,  a,,  ..., must  become  "small,"  but  that  is too  vague.  we  will  propose  four 
definitions of convergence to zero, and i hope the right one will be clear. 

1. all the numbers a,  are below  10- lo. that may be enough for practical purposes, 

but it certainly doesn't  make the a,  approach zero. 
a,, 

2.  the sequence is getting closer to zero-each 

is smaller than the preceding 

a,.  this test is met by  1.1, 1.01, 1.001, ... which converges to 1 instead of 0. 

3. for any small number you think of,  at least one of  the an's is smaller. that pushes 
something toward zero, but not necessarily the whole sequence. the condition would 
be satisfied by  1, ), 1, f, 1, i,. . . ,which does not approach zero. 

4. for any small number you  think of,  the an's eventually go below that number and 

stay below. this is the correct definition. 

i want to repeat that. to test for convergence to zero, start with a small number- 

say  10-lo. the  an's must  go  below  that  number.  they may  come back  up and go 
below again-the 
first million terms make absolutely no difference. neither do the 
next  billion,  but  eventually all  terms  must  go  below  lo-''.  after  waiting longer 
(possibly a  lot  longer), all  terms  drop below 
the  tail  end  of  the  sequence 
decides everything. 
question 1  doesthesequence  lo-,, 
answer  yes.  these up and down numbers eventually stay below any e .  

...approacho? 

1 0 - ~ , 1 0 - ~ ,  

a , < ~ i f n > 3  

a,,< e  if n > 6 

non-convergence 

fig. 2.17  convergence means: only a finite number of  a's  are outside any strip around l. 

question 2  does lo-', 
answer  no. this sequence goes below 

2.6  limits 
lo-*,  lo-',,  10-lo, ... approach zero? 

but does not stay below. 

there  is  a  recognized  symbol  for  "an  arbitrarily  small  positive  number."  by 
worldwide agreement, it  is the greek letter e  (epsilon). convergence to zero means 
that the sequence eventually goes below e and stays there. the smaller the e, the tougher 
the test and the longer we  wait. think of  e  as the tolerance, and keep reducing it. 

to emphasize that  e  comes from outside, socrates can choose it. whatever  e  he 
proposes, the a's  must eventually be smaller. after  some a,,  all the a's  are below  the 
tolerance e.  here is the exact statement: 

for  any e  there is an n  such that a,  < e  if n > n. 

once you see that idea, the rest is easy. figure 2.17 has n = 3 and then n = 6. 
example i  the  sequence f, $, 8, . . . starts upward  but  goes  to zero.  notice  that 
1,4,9, . . . , 100, . . . are squares, and 2,4, 8, . . . , 1024, . . . are powers of 2. eventually 2" 
grows faster than n2, as in alo = 100/1024. the ratio goes below any e. 
example 2  1, 0, f, 0, f, 0, . . . approaches zero.  these a's  do not decrease steadily 
(the mathematical word for steadily is  monotonica ally") but still their limit is zero. 
the choice e = 1 / 1 0  produces the right response: beyond azool all terms are below 
1/1000. so n = 2001 for that e. 
the sequence 1, f, f, 4,f, f, . . . is much slower-but 
next we allow the numbers a,  to be negative as well as positive. they can converge 
upward toward zero, or they can come in from both sides. the test still requires the 
a, to go inside any strip near zero (and stay there). but now the strip starts at -e. 
the distance from  zero is the absolute value  la,l.  therefore  a,  -,0 means  lanl + 0. 

it also converges to zero. 

the previous test can be applied to lanl: 

for  any e  there is an n  such that la,l  < e  if n > n. 

example 3  1, -f, f , -4,. . . converges to zero because 1, f,f,$, . . . converges to zero. 
it is a short step to limits other than  zero.  the limit is l  if  the numbers a, - l 

converge to zero. our final test applies to the absolute value la, - li: 
for  any e  there is an n  such that (a, - l(< e  if  n > n. 

this is the definition of convergence! only a finite number of a's are outside any strip 
around l (figure 2.18). we write a,  -,l or lim -a,= l or limn,,  a,  = l. 

fig. 2.18  a, -,0in example 3;a, -* 1 in example 4;a, -, rn in example 5 (but a,,,  -a, -,0). 

example 4  the  numbers  3, 2, g,  . . . converge  to  l = 1. after  subtracting  1 the 
differences 3, f ,  k, . . . converge to zero. those difference are la,  - li. 

the distance between terms is getting smaller. but those numbers a,,  a,,  a3, a,,  . . . go 
past  any  proposed  limit  l. the second  term  is  15. the fourth term  adds on 3 + 4, 
so  a,  goes  past  2.  the  eighth  term  has  four  new  fractions 4 + &+ f + $,  totaling 
more than $ + $ + $ + & = 3. therefore a,  exceeds 23. eight more terms will add more 
than 8 times &, so a,,  is beyond  3. the lines in figure 2.18~ are infinitely long, not 
stopping at any l. 

in the language of chapter 10, the harmonic series 1 + 3 + 3 + 

does not converge. 
the sum is infinite, because the "partial  sums"  a,  go beyond  every limit l (a,,,, 
is 
past  l = 9). we  will  come  back  to infinite series, but  this  example makes  a  subtle 
point: the steps between the a,  can go to zero while still a, -, a. 

thus the  condition  a,+,  - a,  -, 0 is not  suficient  for  convergence.  however this 
condition is necessary. if we do have convergence, then a,,,  - a,  -, 0. that is a good 
exercise in the logic of  convergence, emphasizing the difference between "sufficient" 
and "necessary."  we discuss this logic below, after proving that [statement  a] implies 
[statement  b]: 

if [a,  converges to l] then [a,+ , - a,  converges to zero]. 

(1) 
proof  because the a,  converge, there is a number n beyond which  (a, - l( < s and 
also  la, + , - li  < e. since a, +,  - a,  is the  sum of  a, +,  - l and  l - a,,  its absolute 
value cannot exceed e + e  = 2s. therefore a,+ , - a,  approaches zero. 
objection by  socrates:  we  only got  below  2s and he asked for s.  our reply: if  he 
particularly wants la, + , - a, 1  < 1/ 10, we start with s = 1/20. then 2s = 1/10. but this 
juggling is not necessary. to stay below  2s is just  as convincing as to stay below s. 

the  logic of  "if"  and "only  if" 

the following page is inserted to help with the language of mathematics. in ordinary 
language we might say "i  will come if  you call."  or we  might say "i  will come only 
if  you  call."  that is different! a  mathematician  might  even  say "i  will  come if and 
only if  you call."  our goal is to think through  the logic, because it is important and 
not  so fami1iar.t 

statement  a  above  implies  statement  b.  statement  a  is  a,  -, l;  statement  b  is 
a,+,  - a,  -, 0.  mathematics  has  at  least  five  ways  of  writing  down  a => b,  and  i 
though  you  might  like  to  see  them  together.  it  seems  excessive to  have  so  many 
expressions for the same idea, but authors get desperate for a little variety. here are 
the five ways that come to mind: 

a  implies b 

if a  then b 

a  is a suflcient  condition for b 

b is true if  a  is true 

?logical thinking is much more important than  e  and 6. 

examples  if [positive numbers are decreasing] then [they  converge to a limit]. 
if [sequences  a,  and b,  converge] then [the  sequence a, + b,  converges]. 
if [ f (x) is the integral of  v(x)] then [v(x) is the derivative of  f (x)]. 

those are all true, but not proved. a  is the hypothesis, b is the conclusion. 

now we go in the other direction. (it is called the "converse,"  not the inverse.) we 
exchange a  and b.  of  course stating the converse does not  make it  true! b  might 
imply a, or it might  not.  in the first two examples the converse was  false-the 
a, 
can  converge  without  decreasing,  and  a, + b,  can  converge  when  the  separate 
sequences do not.  the converse of  the  third  statement is  true-and 
there  are five 
more ways to state it: 

a*  b 

a  is implied by  b 

i f  b then a 

a  is a necessary condition for b 

b is true only i f  a  is true 

those words "necessary"  and "sufficient"  are not always easy to master. the same 
is true of the deceptively short phrase "if  and only if."  the two statements a*  b and 
a e b are completely different and they both require proof.  that means two separate 
proofs. but  they can be  stated together for convenience (when both are true): 

a - b  

a  implies b and b implies a 

a  is equivalent to b 

a  is a necessary and suficient condition for b 

a  is true if and only i f  b  is true 

[a,  + l] - [2an -, 2l] - [a,  + 1 + l + 11 - [a,  - l+ 01. 

examples 

rules for limits 

calculus needs  a definition of  limits,  to define dyldx. that  derivative contains  two 
limits: ax  + 0 and aylax + dyldx. calculus also needs rules for  limits, to prove the 
sum rule and product rule for derivatives. we  started on the definition, and now we 
start on the rules. 

given two convergent sequences, a,  + l and b,  + m, other sequences also converge: 

addition:  a, + b,  + l + m 

subtraction:  a,  - b,  -, l - m 

multiplication:  a,b,  -, lm 
we check the multiplication rule, which  uses a convenient identity: 

division:  a,/b,  + lim 

(provided m # 0) 

a,b,  - lm = (a, - l)(b, - m) + m(a, - l) + l(b, - m). 

(2) 
suppose jan - lj < e beyond some point n, and 1 b,  - mi < e beyond some other point 
n'.  then beyond  the larger.of n and n',  the right side of  (2) is small. it is less than 
e  e + me + le. this proves that (2) gives a,b,  + lm. 
an  important special case is can -, cl. (the sequence of  b's  is c, c, c, c, . . . .)  thus a 

constant can be brought  "outside"  the limit, to give lim can = c lim a,. 

the  limit of  f ( x )  as  x  -, a 

the final step is to replace  sequences by  functions. instead of  a,, a2, . . . there is a 
continuum of  values f(x).  the  limit is  taken  as x  approaches a  specified point  a 
(instead  of  n -, co).  example:  as  x  approaches  a = 0,  the  function  f (x) = 4 - x2 
approaches l = 4. as  x approaches a = 2, the function 5x approaches l = 10. those 
statements are fairly obvious, but we  have to say what they mean. somehow it must 
be this: 

i f  x is close to a then f (x) is close to l. 

if  x - a is small, then f (x) - l should be small. as  before, the word small does not 
say everything. we really mean "arbitrarily small,"  or "below  any e."  the difference 
f(x) - l must  become  as small as anyone wants,  when  x  gets near  a. in that case 
lim,,, 

f (x) = l. or we  write f (x) -, l as x -, a. 

the statement is awkward because it involves two limits. the limit x + a is forcing 
f (x) + l. (previously n + co  forced a,  + l.) but it is wrong to expect the same e  in 
both limits. we  do not and cannot require that  jx - a1 < e  produces  ) f (x) - li  < e. 
it  may be necessary to push  x extremely close to a (closer than e). we must guarantee 
that if  x is close enough to a, then if  (x) - li  < e. 

we have come to the "epsilon-delta definition" of limits. first, socrates chooses e. 
he has to be  shown that f (x) is within  e  of  l, for every x near a. then somebody 
else  (maybe plato) replies  with  a  number  6.  that gives  the  meaning  of  "near  a." 
plato's  goal is to get f(x) within  e  of  l, by  keeping x within 6 of a: 

if  0 < lx - a1 < s 

then 

(f(x) - li  < e. 

(3) 

the input tolerance is 6 (delta), the output  tolerance is e.  when plato can find a 6 
for every e, socrates concedes that the limit is l. 

example  prove that lim  5x = 10.  in this case a = 2 and l = 10. 

x+2 

socrates asks for 15x - 101 < e.  plato responds by requiring ix - 21  < 6. what 6 should 
he choose? in this case 15x - 101 is exactly 5 times jx - 21.  so plato picks 6 below ~ / 5  
(a  smaller 6 is always ok). whenever jx - 21  < 45, multiplication by  5 shows that 
15x - 101 < e. 

remark 1 
in figure 2.19,  socrates chooses the height of  the box. it extends above 
and below l, by the small number e.  second, plato chooses the width. he must make 
the box narrow enough for the graph to go out the sides. then if  (x) - ll< e. 

1 limit l is not f ( o )  

f ( x )  = step function 

i 
i 

fig. 2.19  s chooses height 2.5,  then p chooses width 26. graph must go out the sides. 

when f(x) has a jump,  the box  can't  hold it. a step function has no limit  as x 
approaches the jump, because the graph goes through the top or bottom-no  matter 
how thin the box. 

remark 2  the second figure has f (x) +l,  because in taking limits we  ignore the 
jinalpoint x = a. the value f (a) can be anything, with no effect on l. the first figure 
has more: f (a) equals l. then a special name applies-  f is continuous.the left figure 
shows a continuous function, the other figures do not. 

we  soon come back  to continuous functions. 

remark 3  in the example with f = 5x and 6 = 45, the number 5 was the slope. that 
choice barely kept the graph in the box-it 
goes out the corners. a little narrower, 
say  6 = ~110, and  the  graph  goes  safely  out  the  sides.  a  reasonable  choice  is 
to  divide e  by  21 ff(a)l. (we double the slope for  safety.) i  want  to  say why  this  6 
works-even 

if  the e-6  test is seldom used in practice. 

the ratio off (x) - l to x - a is distance up over distance across. this is af/ax, 
close to the slope f'(a).  when  the distance across is 6, the distance up or down is 
near 61 ff(a)l. that  equals ~ / 2  for  our  "reasonable  choice"  of  6-so  we  are  safely 
below  e.  this choice solves most exercises. but example 7 shows that a limit might 
exist even when the slope is infinite. 

example 7 

lim  ,/x  - 1 = 0  (a one-sided limit). 
x + 1 +  

notice the plus sign in  the symbol x + 1+ . the number x approaches a = 1 only from 
above. an  ordinary limit x + 1 requires us to accept x on both sides of  1 (the exact 
value x = 1 is not considered). since negative numbers are not allowed by the square 
root, we  have a one-sided limit. it is l = 0. 

suppose e  is  1/10. then the response could  be  6 = 1/100. a  number below  1/100 
has  a  square  root  below  1/10.  in  this  case  the  box  must  be  made  extremely 
narrow, 6 much smaller than e, because the square root starts with infinite slope. 

those examples show  the point of  the 6-6  definition. (given e, look for 6. this 
came from cauchy in  france, not socrates in  greece.) we  also see its bad feature: 
the  test  is  not  convenient. mathematicians  do not  go  around  proposing 8's  and 
replying with 8's.  we may live a strange life, but not that strange. 

it is easier to establish once and for all that  5x approaches its obvious limit  5a. 
the  same  is  true  for  other  familiar  functions:  xn+an  and  sin x +sin a  and 
(1 - x)-' -t (1 - a)- '-except 
at  a = 1.  the  correct  limit  l  comes  by  substituting 
x = a into the function. this is exactly the property of  a "continuous function."  before 
the section on continuous functions, we  prove the squeeze theorem using e  and 6. 

proof  g(x) is squeezed between f (x) and h(x). after subtracting l, g(x) - l is between 
f(x) - l and h(x) - l. therefore 
if 

if(x) - l(< e   and  ih(x)-  lj < e. 

ig(x) - li  < e 

for any e, the last two inequalities hold in  some region 0 < jx- a1 < 6.  so the first 
one also holds. this proves that g(x) +l.  values at x = a are not  involved-until 
we  get to continuous functions.

-1continuous functions 


2.7

this will be a brief section. it was originally included with limits, but the combination 
was too long. we are still concerned with the limit off (x) as x -,a, but a new number 
is involved. that number is f (a), the value off  at x = a. for a "limit,"  x approached 
a but never reached it-so 
f(a) was ignored. for a "continuous  function,"  this final 
number f (a) must be right. 

may i summarize the usual (good) situation as x approaches a? 

1.  the number f (a) exists 
2.  the limit of  f (x) exists 
3.  the limit l equals f (a) 

(f  is defined at a) 
(it was called l) 
(f (a) is the right value) 

in such a case, f (x) is continuous at x = a. these requirements are often written in a 
single line: f (x) +f (a) as x -,a. by way of contrast, start with four functions that are 
not continuous at x = 0. 

fig. 2.20  four types of discontinuity (others are possible) at x =0. 

in figure 2.20, the first function would be continuous if  it had f (0)= 0. but it has 
f(0) = 1. after changing f (0) to the right value, the problem is gone. the discontinuity 
is  removable.  examples 2,  3, 4 are more important  and more  serious. there is no 
"correct"  value for f (0): 

2.  f (x) = step function  (jump from 0 to 1 at x = 0) 
3.  f (x) = 1/x2  (infinite limit as x +0) 
4.  f (x) = sin (1/x)  (infinite oscillation as x +0). 

the graphs show how the limit fails to exist. the step function has a jump  discontinu- 
ity. it has one-sided limits, from the left and right. it does not have an ordinary (two- 
sided) limit. the limit from the left (x +0-) is 0. the limit from the right (x +0') 
is  1. another step function is x/lxl, which jumps  from  -1 to 1. 
in the graph of  l/x2, the only reasonable limit is l= + co.i cannot go on record 
as saying that this limit exists. officially, it doesn't-but  we  often write it anyway: 
l/x2+ m as x +0. this means that  l/x2 goes (and stays) above every l as x +0. 

in the same unofficial way  we  write one-sided limits for f (x)= l/x: 

from the left,  lim  - = - co.  from the right,  lim  - = + oo.

remark 
l/x has  a  "pole"  at  x = 0.  so  has  l/x2 (a  double  pole).  the  function 
l/(x2 - x) has poles at x = 0 and x = 1. in each case the denominator goes to zero 
and the function goes to + oo or  - oo. similarly llsin x has a pole at every multiple 
of n (where sin x is zero). except for l/x2 these poles are "simplew-the  functions are 
completely smooth at x = 0 when we  multiply them by x: 
and  ( )(a)are continuous at x =0.

(x)(!-)  =1  and  (x) 

1 

l/x2 has  a double pole,  since it  needs multiplication by  x2 (not just  x). a ratio  of 
polynomials p(x)/q(x) has  poles  where  q = 0,  provided  any  common factors like 
(x + 1)/(x+ 1) are removed first. 
jumps and  poles  are the  most  basic  discontinuities, but  others can  occur.  the 
fourth graph shows that sin(l/x) has no limit as x +0. this function does not blow 
up;  the sine never  exceeds  1. at  x = 4 and $ and & it equals sin 3 and sin 4 and 
sin 1000. those numbers are positive and negative and (?). as  x gets small and  l/x 
gets large, the sine oscillates faster and faster. its graph won't  stay in a small box of 
height e,  no matter how narrow the box. 

continuous functions 

definition  f is  "continuous at  x = a"  if  f (a) is defined and f (x) 4f (a) as x -,a. 
iff  is continuous at every point where it is defined, it is a continuous function. 

2.7  continuous funchons

objection  the  definition  makes  f(x)=  1/x  a continuous  function!  it  is not  defined
at  x = 0,  so its continuity  can't  fail. the logic requires  us to  accept this,  but  we don't
have  to  like  it.  certainly  there  is no  f(0)  that  would  make  1lx  continuous  at  x = 0.

it  is amazing  but  true  that  the  definition  of "continuous  function"  is still  debated
(mathematics  teacher,  may  1989). you see the reason-we 
speak about  a discontinu-
ity  of  l/x,  and  at  the  same time  call it  a continuous  function.  the  definition  misses
the  difference  between  1/x  and  (sin x)/x.  the function  f(x)  = (sin x)/x  can  be  made
continuousat all x.  just set f(0) =  1.

we  call a function  "continuable'iif its definition  can  be extended  to  all x in  a way
that  makes  it continuous.  thus  (sin x)/x  and  \/;  are  continuable.  the functions  l/x
and  tan  x  are  not  continuable.  this  suggestion  may  not  end the  debate,  but  i  hope
it is helpful.

example 

sin x  and  cos  x and  all  polynomials  p(x)  are  continuous  functions.

example2  the  absolute  value  ixl is continuous.  its  slope jumps  (not  continuable).

example3  any  rational  function  p(x)/q(x)  is continuous  except  where  q = 0.

example4  the  function  that  jumps  between  1 at  fractions  and  0  at  non-fractions
is discontinuous everywhere. there  is a  fraction  between  every  pair  of non-fractions
and  vice versa. (somehow  there  are  many  more  non-fractions.)

example5  the  function  02  is zero  for  every  x,  except  that  00 is  not  defined.  so
define  it  as  zero  and  this  function  is continuous.  but  see the  next  paragraph  where
00  has  to  be  1.

we could  fill the  book  with proofs  of continuity,  but  usually  the  situation  is clear.
"a  function  is continuous  if  you  can  draw  its  graph  without  lifting  up  your  pen."
at  a jump,  or  an  infinite  limit,  or  an infinite  oscillation,  there  is no  way across  the
discontinuity  except  to  start  again  on  the  other  side. the  function  x" is continuous
for n > 0. it is not  continuable  for  n < 0. the function  x0 equals  1 for every x, except
that  00 is not  defined. this  time continuity  requires  00 =  1.

the interesting  examples  are  the  close ones-we 

have  seen two  of  them:

example6 

sin x 

x 

and 

1 -cos  x

x

are  both  continuable  at  x = 0.

those  were  crucial  for  the  slope  of  sin x.  the  first  approaches  1 and  the  second
approaches  0.  strictly  speaking  we  must  give  these  functions  the  correct  values
(1 and  0) at  the  limiting  point  x = o-which  of  course  we do.

it  is important  to know  what  happens  when  the  denominators  change  to  x2.

example7 

sin x 

blows  up  but 

1 -cos  x 

x2 

has  the  limit 

1
2

at  x =  0.

since (sin x)/x  approaches  1, dividing  by  another  x  gives a function  like  1lx.  there
is a simple pole.  it  is an example  of 0/0,  in which  the  zero  from  x2 is reached  more
quickly  than  the  zero  from  sin x. the  "race to  zero" produces  almost  all  interesting
problems  about  limits.

this answer  will be found again (more easily) by "1'hbpital's  rule."  here i emphasize 
not the answer but the problem. a central question of  id128 is to know 
how fast  the limit  is approached.  the speed  of approach is exactly the information in 
the derivative. 

these  three  examples  are all  continuous  at  x = 0.  the  race  is  controlled  by  the 

slope-because  f (x) -f (0) is nearly f '(0) times x: 

derivative  of  sin x is  1  - sin x decreases like x 
derivative of  sin2x is 0  - sin2x  decreases faster  than x 
derivative of  xli3 is  cq  - x1i3decreases more  slowly than x. 

differentiable functions 

the absolute value 1x1 is continuous at x = 0 but has no derivative. the same is true 
for  x113. asking for  a  derivative  is  more  than  asking for  continuity. the  reason  is 
fundamental, and carries us  back  to the key definitions: 

continuous at x:  f (x + ax) -f(x) -+ 0 as ax  -+ 0 

derivative  at x: 

f (x + a.u) -f ( x )

ax 

-+f"(x) as ax  -+  0.

in the first case, af  goes to zero (maybe slowly). in the second case, af  goes to zero 
as fast  as ax  (because aflax  has a limit). that requirement is stronger: 

21  at  a  point  where f(x)  has a derivative, the function must  be  continuous. 
but f (x) can be continuous with no derivative. 

proof  the limit of  af  = (ax)(af/ax)  is  (o)(df/dx) = 0.  so f (x + ax) -f (x) -+ 0. 
the continuous function x113has no derivative at x = 0, because +xw2i3blows up. 
the  absolute  value  1x1  has  no  derivative because  its  slope jumps.  the  remarkable 
function 4cos 3x +  cos 9x + 
is continuous at all points and has  a  derivative  at 
no  points. you  can draw its graph without  lifting your  pen (but not easily-it 
turns 
at every point). to most people, it belongs with space-filling curves and unmeasurable 
areas-in 
a  box  of  curiosities.  fractals  used  to  go  into  the  same  box!  they  are 
beautiful  shapes,  with  boundaries  that  have  no  tangents.  the  theory  of  fractals  is 
very alive, for good mathematical  reasons, and we  touch  on it in section 3.7. 

i hope you have a clear idea  of  these basic definitions  of  calculus: 

1  limit  ( n -+ ,xor s -+a)  2  continuity  (at x = a)  3  derivative  (at x = a). 

those go back  to e  and  6, but  it  is  seldom  necessary  to follow  them  so far. in the 
same  way  that  economics  describes  many  transactions,  or  history  describes  many 
events,  a  function comes from many  values f (x). a few points  may  be  special, like 
market crashes or wars or discontinuities. at  other points dfldx  is the best guide to 
the function. 

2.7  continuous functions 

this chapter ends with two essential facts about a continuous function  on a closed 
interval. the interval is a 6 x < b,  written simply as [a, b1.t  at  the endpoints a and 
b we  require f (x) to approach f (a) and f(b). 

extreme  value property  a continuous function on the finite interval  [a, b]  has a 
maximum value m and a minimum value m.  there are points x,,, 
in [a, b] 
where it reaches those values: 

and x,, 

f(xmax)=m  3 f(x)  3 f(xmin)=m  for all x in  [a, b]. 

intermediate  value property 
if  the number f is between f(a)  and f(b),  there is a 
point c between  a and b where f (c) = f. thus if  f is between the minimum m  and 
the maximum m, there is a point c between xmin and x,,,  where f (c)= f. 

examples show  why  we  require closed  intervals and  continuous functions.  for 
0 < x < 1 the  function f (x) = x  never  reaches  its  minimum  (zero). if  we  close  the 
interval by defining f (0) = 3 (discontinuous) the minimum is still not reached. because 
of  the jump, the intermediate value f = 2 is also not reached. the idea of  continuity 
was inescapable, after cauchy defined the idea of  a limit.

applications of  the  derivative 


chapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. this chapter concentrates on using 
them. our computations produced  dyldx for functions built from xn and sin x  and 
cos x. knowing the slope, and if  necessary also the second derivative, we can answer 
the questions about y =f(x)  that this subject was created for: 

1.  how does y change when x  changes? 
2.  what is the maximum value of  y?  or the minimum? 
3.  how can you  tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives? 

the information in dyldx is entirely local. it tells what is happening close to the point 
and nowhere else. in chapter 2, ax and ay went to zero. now we want to get them 
back. the local information explains the larger picture, because ay is approximately 
dyldx times ax. 

the problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal-the  average slope to the 
instantaneous  slope. those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. points 
of  equality  are  assured  by  the  mean  value  theorem-which 
is  the  local-global 
connection at the center of  id128. but we  cannot predict where  dyldx 
equals  aylax.  therefore we  now  find  other  ways  to  recover  a  function  from  its 
derivatives-or 

to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration. 

it may seem surprising that we learn about y from dyldx. all  our work has been 
going the other  way! we  struggled with y to squeeze out dyldx. now we  use dyldx 
to  study y. that's  life.  perhaps it  really  is  life,  to  understand  one  generation  from 
later generations. 

3.1  linear approximation 

the book  started with a straight line f = vt. the distance is linear when the velocity 
is constant. as  soon as v  begins to change, f = v t  falls apart. which velocity do we 
choose, when  v(t) is not  constant? the solution is to take very short time intervals, 

91 

3 applications of  the derivative 

in which v is nearly constant: 

f  = vt 

is completely false 

af  = vat 

is nearly true 

df = vdt 

is exactly true. 

for a brief  moment the functionf(t) is linear-and 

stays near its tangent line. 

in section 2.3 we found the tangent line to y =f(x). at x = a, the slope of the curve 
and the  slope of  the line are f'(a). for points  on the line,  start at y =f(a). add  the 
slope times the "increment"  x - a: 

( 1 )  
we  write  a  capital  y  for the line and  a  small y  for the  curve. the whole point  of 
tangents is that  they are close (provided we  don't  move  too far  from  a): 

y =f(a) +f  '(a)(x - a). 

that  is  the  all-  urpose  linear  approximation.  figure 3.1  shows  the  square  root 
function  y = a n d  its tangent  line  at  x = a = 100. at  the  point  y = @=lo, 
the slope is  1/2&  = 1/20. the table beside the figure compares y(x) with  y(x). 

fig. 3.1  y ( x )is  the linear approximation to f i near x = a = 100. 

the accuracy gets worse  as x  departs from  100. the tangent  line leaves the curve. 
the arrow points to a good approximation at 102, and at 101 it would be even better. 
in this example y is larger than y-the 
straight line is above the curve. the slope of 
the line stays constant, and  the  slope of  the  curve is  decreasing. such a curve will 
soon be called "concave  downward,"  and its tangent lines are above it. 

look again at x = 102, where the approximation  is good. in chapter 2, when we 

were approaching dyldx, we  started with ay/ax: 
jie-m

slope  z 

102- 100

now that is turned around! the slope is  1/20. what we  don't know  is j102: 

jz  w j-5+ (slope)(102 - 100). 

(4) 
you  work with what  you have. earlier we  didn't  know dyldx, so we  used  (3). now 
we  are  experts  at  dyldx, and  we  use  (4). after  computing  y'  = 1/20 once  and  for 

3.1  linear approximation 

all, the tangent  line stays near & for every number near  100. when  that nearby 
number is  100 + ax, notice the error as the approximation is squared: 

the desired answer is 100 + ax, and we  are off  by the last term involving  ax)^. the 
whole point of  linear approximation is to ignore every term after ax. 

there is nothing magic about x = 100, except that it has a nice square root. other 
points  and  other functions allow y x y  i  would  like  to express  this  same idea  in 
different symbols. instead  of  starting from  a and  going  to x, we  start from  x  and  go a 
distance ax  to x + ax. the letters are different but the mathematics is identical.

example 1  an  important linear approximation: (1 + x)" x 1 + nx for x  near zero. 
example 2  a  second important approximation:  1/(1 + x)" x 1 - nx for x  near zero. 
discussion  those are really the same. by changing n to -n in example 1, it becomes 
example 2. these are linear approximations using the slopes n and  -n at x =0: 

( 1  + x)"  z  1 + (slope at  zero) times ( x  - 0)= 1 + nx. 

here is the same thing with f (x) = xn. the basepoint in equation (6)is now  1  or x: 

(1 +ax)"  x 1 + nax 

( x  + ax)"  z xn+ nxn-'ax. 

better than that, here are numbers. for n = 3 and  -1 and  100, take ax = .01: 

actually that last number is no good. the 100th power is too much. linear approxi- 
mation gives 1 + 100ax = 2, but a calculator gives (l.o1)'oo= 2.7. ... this is close to 
e,  the  all-important number  in  chapter 6.  the  binomial  formula  shows  why  the 
approximation failed: 

linear approximation forgets the  ax)^  term. for ax = 1/100 that error is nearly 3. 
it  is  too  big  to  overlook.  the  exact  error  is 
f"(c), where  the  mean  value 
theorem in  section 3.8  places  c between  x  and x + ax.  you  already see the point: 

y  - y is of order  ax)^. linear  approximation, quadratic error. 

differentials 

there  is  one more notation for this linear  approximation. it  has  to be  presented, 
because it is often used. the notation is suggestive and confusing at the same time- 

3  applications of  the derivative 

it keeps the same symbols dx and dy that appear in the derivative. earlier we  took 
great pains to emphasize that dyldx is not an ordinary fraction.7 until this paragraph, 
dx and dy have had no independent meaning. now they become separate variables, 
like  x  and  y  but  with  their  own  names.  these  quantities  dx  and  dy  are  called 
dzrerentials. 

the symbols dx and dy measure changes along  the  tangent  line. they do for the 
approximation  y(x) exactly  what  ax  and  ay  did  for  y(x). thus  dx  and  ax  both 
measure distance across. 

figure 3.2 has ax = dx. but the change in y does not equal the change in  y.  one 
is  ay  (exact  for  the  function). the  other  is  dy  (exact  for  the  tangent  line).  the 
differential dy is equal to ay,  the change along the tangent line. where ay  is the true 
change, dy is its linear approximation (dy/dx)dx. 

you  often see dy written as f'(x)dx.

x + d x = x + a x  

dy =f '(x) dx. 

emmple 3  y = x2 has dyldx = 2x so dy = 2x dx.  the  table  has  basepoint  x = 2. 
the prediction dy differs from the true ay  by  exactly (ax)2 = .0l and  .04 and  .09. 

the  differential  dy =f'(x)dx  is  consistent  with  the  derivative dyldx =f'(x).  we 
finally  have  dy =(dy/dx)dx, but  this  is  not  as  obvious  as  it  seems!  it  looks  like 
cancellation-it 
is really  a  definition. entirely  new  symbols could be  used,  but  dx 
and dy  have two advantages: they suggest small steps and they  satisfy dy =f'(x)dx. 
here are three examples and three rules: 

d(sin x) = cos x dx 

d(cf) = c df 

science and engineering and virtually  all applications of  mathematics depend on 

linear approximation. the true function is "linearized,"using its slope v: 

increasing the time by  at  increases the distance by  x vat 
increasing the force by  af  increases the deflection by  x vaf 
increasing the production  by  ap  increases its value by  z vap. 

+fraction or not, it is absolutely forbidden to cancel the d's. 

3.1  linear approximation 

the goal  of  dynamics or statics or economics is  to  predict  this  multiplier v-the 
derivative  that  equals  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line.  the  multiplier  gives  a  local 
prediction of the change in the function. the exact law is nonlinear-but  ohm's law 
and hooke's law and newton's  law are linear approximations. 

absolute  change, relative change, percentage change 

the change ay  or af  can be measured in three ways. so can ax:

relative change is often more realistic than absolute change. if we know the distance 
to the moon within three miles, that is more impressive than knowing our own height 
within one inch. absolutely, one inch is closer than three miles. relatively, three miles 
is much closer: 

3 miles 

300,000 miles 

< 

1 inch 

70 inches 

or 

.001%< 1.4%. 

example 4  the radius of  the earth is within 80 miles of  r = 4000 miles. 

(a) find the variation dv in the volume  v = jnr3, using linear approximation. 
(b) compute the relative variations dr/r and dv/v and av/k 

solution  the job  of  calculus is  to  produce the  derivative. after  dv/dr = 4nr2, its 
work  is  done.  the  variation  in  volume  is  dv = 4n(4000)'(80)  cubic miles.  a  2% 
relative variation in r gives a 6% relative variation in  v: 

without calculus we  need  the exact volume at r = 4000 + 80 (also at r = 3920): 

one comment on dv = 4nr2dr. this is (area of  sphere) times (change in radius). it is 
the  volume of  a  thin  shell around  the sphere. the shell is  added  when  the  radius 
grows by dr. the exact av/v is 3917312/640000%, but calculus just  calls it 6%.

our  goal  is  to  learn  about f(x)  from  dfldx.  we  begin  with  two  quick  questions. 
if  dfldx  is positive,  what does that  say about f ?  if  the slope is negative,  how is that 
reflected  in the function? then the third  question is the critical one: 

how do you  identify a maximum or minimum?  normal  answer:  the slope is  zero. 

this may  be  the most  important  application  of  calculus, to reach  df1d.x  = 0. 

take the easy questions first. suppose dfldx  is positive for every x between a  and b. 
all  tangent  lines  slope upward.  the function f(x)  is increasing  as x goes from  n  to b. 

3b  if  dfldx  > 0 then f(x)  is  increasing. 

if  dfldx  < 0  then f(x)  is  decreasing. 

to  define  increasing  and  decreasing, look  at  any  two  points  x < x .   "increasing" 
requires f(x) < f(x). "decreasing"  requires j(x) > f ( x ) .  a positive  slope does not mean 
a positive function.  the function itself can be  positive or negative. 

example 1  f(x) = x2 - 2x  has  slope 2x - 2.  this slope is  positive  when  x > 1  and 
negative  when  x < 1. the function  increases after  x = 1 and decreases before  x = 1. 

3.2  maximum and minimum problems 

fig. 3.3  slopes are  - +. slope is  + - + - + so f is up-down-up-down-up. 

we  say that  without  computing f(x) at any point! the parabola  in  figure 3.3  goes 
down to its minimum at x  = 1 and up again. 
example 2  x2 - 2x + 5  has the same slope. its graph is shifted  up by  5, a number 
that disappears in dfldx.  all  functions with  slope 2x - 2 are parabolas x2 - 2x + c, 
shifted up or down according to c. some parabolas cross the x  axis (those crossings 
are  solutions  to f(x) = 0). other  parabolas  stay  above  the  axis.  the  solutions  to 
x2 - 2x + 5  = 0 are complex  numbers  and we  don't  see them. the special parabola 
x2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)2grazes the  axis at x  = 1. it has a  "double  zero,"  where f(x) = 
dfldx  = 0. 

example 3  suppose  dfldx  = (x- l ) ( x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4).  this  slope  is  positive 
beyond  x = 4  and  up  to  x  = 1  (dfldx  = 24  at  x  = 0). and  dfldx  is  positive  again 
between  2 and 3. at  x  = 1, 2, 3,4, this slope is zero and f(x) changes direction. 

here f ( x )  is a fifth-degree polynomial, because f '(x)is fourth-degree. the graph of 
f goes  up-down-up-down-up.  it  might  cross  the  x  axis  five  times.  it  must  cross 
at  least  once (like this  one). when  complex numbers  are allowed,  every  fifth-degree 
polynomial has five roots. 

you  may feel that "positive slope  implies increasing function" 

is obvious-perhaps 

it is. but there is still something delicate. starting from dfldx  > 0 at every single point, 
we have to deduce f ( x )  >f(x) at pairs  of points. that is a "local  to global"  question, 
to be  handled by  the mean value theorem. it could also wait for the fundamental 
theorem  of  calculus:  the  diflerence f ( x )  -f ( x )  equals  the  area  under  the graph  of 
dfldx.  that area is positive, so f ( x )  exceeds f(x). 

maxima and  minima 

which x makesf(x) as large as possible? where is the smallest f(x)? without calculus 
we are reduced to computing values of f(x) and comparing. with calculus, the infor- 
mation is in dfldx. 

suppose the  maximum  or minimum  is  at a  particular  point  x. it  is  possible  that 
no derivative.  but  ifdfldx  exists, it  must  be zero. the 
the graph has  a corner-and 
tangent line is level. the parabolas in figure 3.3 change from decreasing to increasing. 
the slope changes from negative to positive. at  this crucial point  the slope  is zero. 

3  applications of  the derivative 

3c  local  maximum  or  minimum  suppose  the  maximum  or  minimum 
occurs at a  point  x  inside  an interval where f(x) and df[dx  are defined. then 
f '(x) = 0. 

the word  "local"  allows  the possibility  that  in  other  intervals, f(x) goes higher  or 
lower.  we  only look near x, and we  use the definition  of dfldx. 
start with f(x + ax) -f(x).  if f(x)  is  the  maximum,  this  difference is  negative  or 

zero. the step ax  can be forward or backward: 

if  ax > 0: 

f(x + ax)-f(x) - negative < 0  and in the limit  -df  6 0.

both arguments apply.  both  conclusions dfldx <0 and dfldx  2 0 are correct. thus 
dfldx  = 0. 

maybe  richard  feynman said it best.  he showed  his friends a  plastic  curve that 
was made in  a  special way - "no  matter how you  turn  it, the tangent  at the lowest 
point is horizontal." they checked it out. it was true. 

surely you're  joking, mr. feynman! is a good book (but rough on mathematicians). 

example 3 (continued)  look  back  at  figure 3.3b.  the  points  that  stand  out 
are not  the  "ups"  or  "downs"  but  the  "turns."  those  are stationary points,  where 
dfldx  = 0. we see two maxima and two minima. none of  them are absolute maxima 
or minima, because f(x) starts at  - co and ends at + co. 

example 4 
f(x) = 4x3 - 3x4 has  slope  12x2 - 12x3. that  derivative  is  zero  when 
x2 equals  x3, at the  two  points  x = 0 and  x = 1.  to decide  between  minimum  and 
maximum (local or absolute), the first step is to evaluate f(x) at these stationary points. 
we find f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. 

now look at large x. the function goes down to  - co in both directions. (you can 

mentally substitute x = 1000 and x = - 1000). for large x,  - 3x4 dominates 4x3. 
conclusion  f = 1 is  an  absolute  maximum. f = 0 is  not  a  maximum  or  minimum 
(local or absolute). we have to recognize this exceptional possibility, that a curve (or 
a car) can pause for an instant (f' = 0) and continue in the same direction. the reason 
is the "double  zero"  in  12x2 - 12x3, from its double factor x2.

3.2  maximum and minimum problems 

example 5  define f(x) = x + x-i  for x > 0. its derivative  1 - 1/x2 is zero at x = 1. 
at  that point f(1) = 2 is the  minimum value.  every combination  like f + 3 or 4 + 
is larger than fmin  = 2.  figure 3.4 shows that the maximum of  x + x- ' is + oo.? 
important  the maximum always occurs at a stationarypoint (where dfldx  = 0) or a 
rough point  (no derivative) or an endpoint  of  the domain. these are the three  types 
of  critical points.  all  maxima  and minima  occur  at critical  points!  at  every  other 
point df/dx  > 0 or df/dx  < 0. here is the procedure: 

1. solve df/dx  = 0 to find the stationary points f(x). 
2.  compute f(x) at every critical point-stationary  point, rough point, endpoint. 
3.  take the maximum and minimum of  those critical values of f(x). 

example 6  (absolute value f(x) = 1x1) the minimum  is zero at a  rough  point.  the 
maximum is at an endpoint. there are no stationary points. 

the derivative of  y = 1x1  is never zero.  figure 3.4 shows the maximum  and mini- 

mum on the interval  [- 3,2].  this is typical of  piecewise linear functions. 

question  could the minimum be zero when the function never reaches f(x) = o? 
answer  yes, f(x) = 1/(1+ x ) ~  approaches but never reaches zero as x + oo. 
remark 1  x + foo and f(x) -, + oo are avoided  when f is continuous on a closed 
interval a < x < b.  then f(x) reaches its maximum and its minimum (extreme value 
theorem). but x -, oo and f(x) + oo are too important to rule out. you  test x + ca 
by considering large x. you recognize f(x) + oo by going above every finite value. 

remark 2  note  the  difference between critical  points (specified by  x) and  critical 
values (specified by f(x)). the example x + x- had the minimum point x = 1 and the 
minimum value f(1) = 2. 

maximum and  minimum in applications 

to find a  maximum  or minimum,  solve f'(x) = 0. the slope is zero at the top and 
bottom of the graph. the idea is clear-and 
then check rough points and endpoints. 
but to be honest, that is not where the problem  starts. 

in  a  real 'application,  the first step (often the hardest) is to choose  the unknown 
and find  the function.  it  is  we  ourselves who  decide  on  x  and f(x).  the  equation 
dfldx  = 0 comes in the middle of  the problem,  not at the beginning. i will  start on 
a new example, with a question instead of  a function. 

example 7  where should  you get onto an expressway for minimum driving time, 
if  the expressway speed is 60 mph and ordinary driving speed is 30 mph? 
i know this problem well-it 
comes up every morning. the mass pike goes to mit 
and i have to join  it somewhere. there is an entrance near route  128 and another 
entrance further in. i used to take the second one, now i take the first. mathematics 
should decide which is faster-some  mornings  i think  they are maxima. 

most models are simplified, to focus on the key idea. we will allow the expressway 
to be entered at any point x (figure 3.5). instead of two entrances (a discrete problem) 

?a good word is approach when f(x) + a.infinity is not reached. but i still say "the maximum 
is xi." 

3  applications of the derivative 

we  have a continuous choice (a calculus problem). the trip has two parts, at speeds 
30 and 60:

we have the function f(x). now comes calculus. the first  term uses  the power  rule: 
the derivative of  u1i2 is ~ ~ ' ~ ~ d u / d x .a2+ x2 has duldx = 2x:

here u =

f  ' ( x )= --(a2+ x2)- li2(2x)- -

to solve f  '(x) = 0, multiply  by  60 and square both sides: 

(a2+ x2)- 'i2(2x) = 1  gives  2x = (a2+ x2)'i2  and  4x2 = a2+ x2. 

(2) 

thus  3x2 = a2.  this  yields  two  candidates,  x  = a/& 
and  x = - a/&.  but  a 
negative  x  would  mean  useless  driving on  the  expressway.  in  fact f'  is  not  zero  at 
x  = - a/&.  that false root entered when  we  squared 2x.

i notice something surprising. the stationary point  x  = a/&  does not depend  on 
b. the total time  includes the constant b/60, which  disappeared  in  dfldx. somehow 
b must enter the answer, and this is a warning to go carefully. the minimum might 
occur at a rough  point  or an endpoint. those are the other critical  points  off, and 
our drawing may  not  be  realistic. certainly we  expect x 6 b, or we  are entering the 
expressway beyond  mit.

3.2  maximum and minimum problems 

the comparison f * <f ** should  be  automatic.  entering  at x = 0  was  a  candidate 
and calculus didn't  choose it. the derivative  is  not zero at x = 0. it is not smart to 
go perpendicular to the expressway. 

the  second  comparison  has  x = b.  we  drive  directly  to  mit at  speed  30.  this 
option has to be taken seriously. in fact it is optimal when b is small or a is large. 
this choice x = b can arise mathematically in two ways. if all entrances are between 
0 and b,  then  b is an endpoint. if  we  can enter beyond  mit, then  b is a rough point. 
the  graph  in  figure 3 . 5 ~  has  a  corner  at  x = b,  where  the  derivative jumps.  the 
reason is that distance on the expressway is the absolute value ib  - xi-never  negative. 

either way x = b is a critical  point.  the optimal x is the smaller of a/&  and b. 

if  a/&  < b:  stationary point  wins, enter at x = alfi,  total  time f * 
if  a / f i   2 b:  no stationary point, drive directly  to mit, time f *** 

the  heart  of  this  subject  is  in  "word  problems."  all  the calculus is  in  a  few  lines, 
computingf '  and solving f '(x) = 0. the formulation took longer. step 1 usually does: 

1.  express the quantity to be minimized  or maximized  as a function f(x). 

the variable x has to be  selected. 

2.  compute f '(x), solve f '(x) = 0, check critical points for fmin  and fmax. 
a picture of  the problem (and the graph of f(x)) makes all the difference. 

example 7  (continued)  choose  x  as  an  angle  instead  of  a  distance.  figure 3.6 
shows the triangle with angle x and side a. the driving distance to the expressway is 
a sec x. the distance on the expressway is b - a tan x. dividing by the speeds 30 and 
60, the driving time has a nice form: 

f(x) = total time = -30 
the derivatives of  sec x and tan x go into dfldx:

3  applications of the derivative 

example 8 
in mechanics, nature chooses minimum energy. a spring is pulled  down 
by  a  mass,  the energy is f(x),  and dfldx  = 0 gives equilibrium.  it is  a  philosophical 
question why so many laws of physics involve minimum energy or minimum time- 
which  makes the mathematics easy. 

the  energy  has  two  terms-for 

the  spring  and  the  mass.  the  spring energy  is 
in stretching (x > 0 is  downward) and also  positive in  compression 
as the mass 

+kx2-positive 
(x < 0). the potential energy of  the mass is taken  as  - mx-decreasing 
goes down. the balance is at the minimum of f(x) = 4 kx2 - mx. 

i  apologize  for  giving  you  such  a  small  problem,  but  it  makes  a  crucial  point. 

when f(x) is quadratic, the equilibrium equation dfldx  = 0 is linear. 

graphically, x = m/k is at the bottom of the parabola. physically, kx = m is a balance 
of  forces-the 
spring force  against  the  weight.  hooke's  law  for  the  spring force  is 
elastic constant k times displacement  x. 

example 9  derivative of cost = marginal cost (our first management example). 
the  paper  to  print  x  copies  of  this  book  might  cost  c = 1000 + 3x  dollars.  the 
derivative is dcldx = 3. this is the marginal cost of  paper for each additional book. 
if  x increases by  one book, the cost  c increases  by  $3. the marginal cost is like the 
velocity  and the total cost is like the distance. 

marginal cost is in dollars per  book. total cost is in  dollars. on the plus  side, the 
income is i(x) and the marginal income is dlldx. to apply calculus, we  overlook the 
restriction  to whole  numbers. 

suppose the number of  books increases  by  dx.?  the cost  goes  up  by  (dcldx) dx. 
the  income  goes  up  by  (dlldx) dx.  if  we  skip  all  other  costs,  then  profit  p(x) = 
income  i(x)- cost  c(x). in most cases p increases  to a maximum  and falls back. 

at  the high  point  on the profit  curve, the marginal profit  is zero: 

profit  is maximized  when marginal income i'  equals marginal cost  c'. 

this basic rule of economics comes directly from calculus, and we give an example: 

c(x)= cost of  x  advertisements = 900 + 400x - x2 

setup cost 900, print  cost 400x, volume savings x2 

i(x)= income due to x  advertisements = 600x - 6x2 

sales 600 per  advertisement, subtract 6x2 for diminishing  returns 

optimal decision dcldx = di/dx  or  400 - 2x = 600 - 12x  or  x = 20 

profit  = income - cost  = 9600 - 8500 = 1 100. 

the next  section shows how to verify that this profit is a maximum  not a minimum. 

the first exercises ask  you to solve dfldx  = 0. later exercises also look  for f(x). 

+maybe dx  is a id128  book. i  apologize for that.

w = lov.  if  the  swim  direction is  at angle 8 with  the direct 
line, choose 8 to minimize and maximize the arrival time. 

13.3  second derivatives: bending and acceleration 

when f '(x) is positive, f(x) is increasing. when dyldx is negative, y(x) is decreasing. 
that  is  clear, but  what  about  the  second derivative? from  looking  at  the  curve, 
can you decide the sign off "(x) or d2y/dx2? the answer is yes and the key is in the 
bending. 
a straight line doesn't bend. the slope of y = mx + b is m (a constant). the second 
derivative is zero. we have to go to curves, to see a changing slope. changes in the 
herivative show up in fv(x): 

f = x2 has f'= 2x and f "  = 2  (this parabola bends up) 
y = sin x has dyldx = cos x and d 'y/dx2 = - sin x  (the sine bends down) 

3  applications of the derivative 

the slope 2x  gets larger  even  when  the parabola  is falling.  the sign off  or f '  is not 
revealed by f ". the second derivative tells about change in slope. 

a function with f "(x)> 0 is concave up. it bends upward as the slope increases. it 
is  also  called  convex.  a  function  with  decreasing  slope-this  means f "(x)< 0-is 
concave down. note  how  cos x  and  1 + cos x  and even  1+ $x + cos x  change from 
concave  down  to concave up  at  x = 7~12. at  that  point f "  = - cos x  changes from 
negative  to positive.  the extra  1 + $x tilts the graph but  the bending is the same. 

tangent below 

fig. 3.7 

increasing slope =concave up (f"  >0). concave down is f" <0. inflection point f" = 0. 

here is another way to see the sign off  ". watch the tangent lines. when the curve 
is  concave up,  the  tangent  stays below  it.  a linear  approximation is  too low.  this 
includes  the  term with f "  > 0. 
section computes a  quadratic approximation-which 
when  the curve bends down (f" < o), the opposite  happens-the 
tangent  lines are 
above the curve. the linear approximation is too high,  and f "  lowers it. 

in physical motion, f "(t) is the acceleration-in  units of di~tance/(time)~. accelera-
tion  is  rate  of  change  of  velocity.  the oscillation  sin 2t  has  v = 2 cos 2t  (maximum 
speed 2) and a = - 4 sin 2t (maximum acceleration 4). 

an  increasing  population  means f '  > 0. an  increasing growth  rate  means f "  > 0. 

those are different. the rate can slow down while the growth continues. 

maximum vs.  minimum 

remember  that f '(x) = 0  locates  a  stationary  point.  that  may  be  a  minimum  or  a 
maximum.  the second derivative  decides! instead  of  computing f(x) at many  points, 
stationary point.  it is a minimum  iff  "(x) > 0. 
we compute f "(x) at one point-the 

3d  when f'(x) = 0 and f "(x) > 0,  there is a local minimum at x. 
when f '(x) = 0 and f"(x) < 0,there is a local maximrcm at x. 

to the left of a minimum, the curve is falling. after the minimum, the curve rises. the 
slope has changed from negative to positive. the graph bends upward and f "(x)> 0. 
at  a maximum  the slope drops from positive to negative.  in the exceptional case, 
when f '(x) = 0  and  also f "(x)= 0,  anything  can  happen.  an  example  is  x3, which 
pauses  at x = 0 and continues up (its slope is  3x2 2 0). however  x4 pauses  and goes 
down (with a very  flat graph). 

we  emphasize  that  the  information  from fr(x) and f "(x) is  only  "local ."  to  be 
certain  of  an absolute minimum  or maximum,  we  need  information  over  the  whole 
domain. 

3.3  second derhmthres: bending and acceleration 

example i f(x) = x3 - x2  has  f '(x) = 3x2- 2x  and  f "(x)= 6x - 2. 
to find the maximum and/or minimum,  solve 3x2 - 2x = 0.  the stationary  points 
are x = 0 and x = f . at  those points we  need the second derivative. it is f "(0)= - 2 
(local maximum) and f "(4)= + 2 (local minimum). 

between  the  maximum  and  minimum  is  the  inflection  point.  that  is  where 
f "(x) = 0. the curve changes from concave down to concave up.  this example has 
f "(x) = 6x - 2,  so the inflection point is at x = 4. 

inflection points 

in mathematics it is a special event when a function passes through zero. when the 
function isf, its graph crosses the axis. when the function is f',  the tangent  line is 
horizontal. when f "  goes through zero, we have an injection point. 

the direction of bending changes at an inflection point.  your eye picks that out in 
a graph. for an instant the graph is straight (straight lines have f "  = 0). it is easy to 
see crossing points and stationary points and inflection points. very few people can 
recognize where f "'= 0 or f '" = 0. i am not sure if  those points have names. 

there is a genuine maximum or minimum when f '(x) changes sign. similarly, there 
is a genuine inflection point when f "(x) changes sign. the graph is concave down on 
one  side  of an  inflection point  and  concave  up on  the  other  side.?  the tangents  are 
above the curve on one side and below it on the other side. at  an inflection point, 
the tangent line crosses the curve (figure 3.7b). 
notice that a parabola y = ax2+ bx + c has no inflection points: y" is constant. a 
cubic curve has one inflection point, because f "  is linear. a fourth-degree curve might 
or might  not have  inflection points-the  quadratic fm(x) might  or might not  cross 
the axis. 

example 2  x4 - 2x2 is w-shaped, 4x3 - 4x has two bumps,  12x2 - 4 is  u-shaped. 
the table shows the signs at the important values of  x:

between zeros of f(x) come zeros off '(x) (stationary points). between zeros off '(x) 
come zeros off "(x) (inflection points). in this example f(x) has a double zero at the 
origin, so a single zero off'  is caught there. it is a local maximum, since f "(0) < 0. 
just  for  mathematics. we  know  the  world 
population  will  keep rising.  we  don't  know  if  the  rate  of  growth  will  slow down. 
remember: the rate of growth stops growing at the inflection point. here is the  1990 
report of  the un population  fund. 

inflection points  are important-not 

the next  ten  years will  decide whether the world  population  trebles or merely 
doubles before it finally stops growing. this may decide the future of  the earth as 
a habitation for humans. the population, now 5.3 billion, is increasing by a quarter 
of a million every day. between 90 and 100 million people will be added every year 

?that rules out f(x) = x4, which has f" = 12x2 > 0 on both sides of zero. its tangent line is 
the x axis. the line stays below the graph-so  no inflection point. 

3  applications of  the derivative 

during the  1990s; a billion  people-a  whole china-over 
growth will  come in the poorest  countries. 

the decade. the fastest 

a  few  years  ago  it  seemed  as  if  the  rate  of  population  growth  was  slowing? 
everywhere  except  in  africa  and  parts  of  south  asia.  the  world's  population 
seemed set to stabilize around  10.2 billion  towards the end of  the next century. 

today, the  situation looks less promising.  the world  has  overshot  the marker 
points  of  the  1984 "most  likely"  medium  projection.  it  is  now  on  course for  an 
eventual  total that  will be closer to  11 billion  than to  10 billion. 

if  fertility  reductions  continue  to be  slower than projected,  the  mark  could  be 
missed again. in that case the world  could be headed  towards  a total of  up to  14 
billion people. 

starting  with  a  census,  the  un  follows  each  age  group  in  each  country.  they 
estimate the death rate and fertility rate-the  medium  estimates are published. this 
report is saying that we  are not  on track  with  the estimate. 

section 6.5 will come back to population, with an equation that predicts 10 billion. 
it assumes we are now at the inflection point. but china's  second census just  started 
on july  1 ,   1990. when it's  finished we will know if  the inflection point is still ahead. 

you now understand the meaning off "(x).its sign gives the direction of bending- 
the change in the slope. the rest of  this section computes how much the curve bends- 
using the size off" and not just  its sign. we find quadratic approximations based on 
fl'(x). in some courses they are optional-the  main  points are highlighted. 

centered differences and second differences 

calculus begins with average velocities, computed  on either  side of  x: 

we  never  mentioned  it,  but  a  better  approximation  to j"(x)comes  from  averaging 
those  two averages.  this  produces  a  centered difference,  which  is  based  on  x + ax 
and x  - ax. it divides by  2 ax: 

f f ( x )z -2 [ 

1  .f(s+ a x )  -f ( x )  + y

'

a x  

) -f  - a )1  f(-y+ a x )-f'(x - a x )  

2 a x  

a x 

= 

. 

(2)

we claim this  is  better.  the test  is to try  it  on powers  of  x. 
for f(x) = x these  ratios all  give f'  = 1  (exactly). for f ( x ) = x2, only  the  centered 
difference correctly gives f'  = 2x. the one-sided  ratio  gave 2.x + ax  (in chapter 1 it 
was 2t + h). it  is  only  "first-order  accurate."  but  centering leaves no error. we  are 
averaging  2x + ax  with  2x - ax.  thus  the  centered  difference  is  "second-order 
accurate." 

i  ask  now:  what ratio converges  to the second  derivative?  one answer  is  to  take 
differences of  the  first  derivative. certainly  af'lax  approaches f  ".  but  we  want  a 
ratio  involving f  itself.  a  natural  idea  is  to  take  diflerences  of  diferences,  which 
brings us to "second differences": 

f ( x + a x ) - f ( x )   -f ( 4 - f ( x - a x )

on  the  top,  the  difference  of the  difference  is  a(af)= a2f.  it  corresponds  to  d2f.
on the  bottom,  (ax)2  corresponds to  dx 2 . this  explains  the way  we place  the 2's  in
d 2f/dx 2. to say it differently:  dx is squared,  dfis not squared-as  in distance/(time) 2.
note  that (ax)2 becomes  much smaller  than ax.  if we divide  af by  (ax) 2, the ratio
blows  up. it is the extra cancellation in the second  difference  a2fthat allows  the limit
to exist.  that  limit  is f"(x).
application  the  great  majority  of  differential  equations  can't  be  solved  exactly.
a  typical  case is f"(x) =  - sinf(x) (the pendulum  equation).  to  compute  a  solution,
i  would  replace f"(x)  by  the  second  difference  in  equation  (3).  approximations  at
points spaced  by  ax  are  a very large  part  of scientific  computing.

to  test  the  accuracy  of  these  differences,  here  is  an  experiment  on  f(x)=

sin  x + cos x.  the table  shows  the errors  at x =  0 from  formulas  (1),  (2),  (3):

the  one-sided  errors  are  cut  in  half  when  ax  is  cut  in  half.  the  other  columns
decrease  like (ax)2. each  reduction  divides  those errors  by  4.  the  errors from  one-
sided differences are o(ax) and the errors from  centered differences are o(ax) 2.
the  "big  0" notation  when  the  errors  are  of  order  a x,  we  write  e = o(ax).  this
means  that  e <  cax  for  some  constant  c.  we  don't  compute  c-in fact  we  don't
want  to  deal  with  it.  the  statement  "one-sided  errors  are  oh  of delta  x"  captures
what  is  important. the  main  point  of the  other columns  is  e =  o(ax) 2 .

linear  approximation  vs.  quadratic  approximation

the  second  derivative  gives  a  tremendous  improvement  over  linear  approximation
f(a) +f'(a)(x - a).  a tangent  line  starts  out  close  to  the  curve,  but  the  line  has no
way  to  bend.  after  a  while  it  overshoots  or  undershoots  the  true  function  (see
figure 3.8).  that  is  especially  clear  for  the  model f(x) = x 2, when  the tangent  is  the
x  axis  and  the  parabola  curves  upward.

you  can  almost  guess  the  term  with  bending.  it should involve f", and  also (ax) 2.
it might  be  exactly f"(x) times  (ax) 2 but it  is  not. the  model function  x 2 hasf" =  2.
there  must  be  a factor 1 to  cancel  that 2:

at  the  basepoint  this is f(a) =f(a). the  derivatives  also  agree  at  x = a. furthermore
the  second derivatives agree. on  both  sides  of  (4),  the  second  derivative  at  x = a  is
f"(a).

the  quadratic  approximation  bends  with  the  function.  it  is  not  the  absolutely
final  word,  because  there  is  a  cubic  term  -f"'(a)(x - a)3  and  a  fourth-degree  term
n f""(a)(x - a)4  and  so  on. the  whole  infinite  sum is  a "taylor  series."  equation  (4)
carries  that series  through  the quadratic  term-which  for practical  purposes  gives  a
terrific  approximation.  you will  see  that in numerical  experiments.

3 applications of  the derivative 

two things to mention. first, equation (4)shows why f" > 0 brings the curve above 
the tangent line. the linear part gives the line, while the quadratic part is positive 
and bends  upward.  second, equation (4) comes from (2) and (3). where one-sided 
differences give f(x + a x )  x f(x) +f '(x)ax, centered differences give the quadratic: 

from (2):  f(x + ax)  a f(x - ax) + 2 f f ( x )  ax 
from (3):  f ( x + a x )   a  2f(x)-f(x-a~)+f"(x)(ax)~. 

add  and  divide  by  2.  the  result  is f(x + ax) xf(x) + r ( x ) a x  +4f  ax)^. this  is 
correct through (ax)2and misses by  (ax)',  as examples show: 

example4 

( 1  + x)"  x  1 + n x + f n ( n -   l)x2. 

the first derivative at x  = 0  is  n. the second derivative is n(n - 1). the cubic term 
would be $n(n - l)(n- 2)x3.we  are just  producing the binomial expansion!

reading a graph is like appreciating a painting. everything is there, but you have to 
know what to look for. one way to learn is by  sketching graphs yourself, and in the 
past  that  was  almost  the  only  way.  now  it  is  obsolete  to  spend  weeks  drawing 
curves-a 
computer  or graphing  calculator  does it  faster  and better.  that doesn't 
remove  the  need  to  appreciate  a  graph  (or  a  painting),  since  a  curve  displays  a 
tremendous amount of  information. 

this section combines two approaches. one is to study actual machine-produced 
graphs (especially electrocardiograms). the other is to understand  the mathematics 
of  graphs-slope, 
concavity,  asymptotes,  shifts,  and  scaling.  we  introduce  the 
centering transform and zoom  transform. these two approaches are like the rest  of 
calculus,  where  special derivatives  and  integrals  are done by  hand  and day-to-day 
applications are by computer.  both  are essential-the  machine can do experiments 
that we could never do. but without the mathematics our instructions miss the point. 
to create good graphs you have to know  a few of  them  personally. 

reading an  electrocardiogram (ecg or  ekg)

the graphs of  an ecg  show  the electrical potential  during a  heartbeat.  there are 
from leads attached  to the chest, and six from leads to the arms 
twelve graphs-six 
500 - and left leg. (it doesn't  hurt, but everybody is nervous.  you  have to lie still, because 
400-
contraction of other muscles will mask the reading from the heart.) the graphs record 
300-
electrical impulses, as the cells depolarize and the heart contracts.

first of all the graphs show the heart rate. the dark vertical lines are by convention 
f  second apart. the light lines are & second apart. if  the heart beats every f second
(one dark  line) the  rate  is  5 beats  per  second  or  300  per  minute.  that  is  extreme 
tachycardia-not 
compatible with  life. the normal  rate is  between  three dark lines 
per beat (2 second, or 100 beats per minute) and five dark lines (one second between 
beats,  60 per  minute). a  baby  has  a faster  rate, over  100 per  minute.  in  this  figure 
. a rate below 60 is bradycardia, not in itself dangerous. for a resting 
the rate is 
athlete that is normal. 

doctors memorize the six rates 300,  150, 100, 75, 60, 50. those correspond to 1, 2,
3,  4,  5, 6 dark lines between heartbeats.  the distance is easiest to measure  between 
spikes (the peaks of  the r wave). many doctors put a printed  scale next to the chart. 
one textbook  emphasizes that  "where  the next  wave falls determines  the  rate.  no 
mathematical  computation  is  necessary."  but  you  see  where  those  numbers  come 
from.

the  next  thing  to  look  for  is  heart  rhythm.  the  regular  rhythm  is  set  by  the 

pacemaker, which produces the p wave. a constant distance between waves is good- 
and then each beat is examined. when there is a block in the pathway, it shows as 
a delay in the graph. sometimes the pacemaker fires irregularly. figure 3.10 shows 
sinus arrythmia (fairly normal). the time between  peaks is changing. in  disease or 
emergency, there are potential pacemakers in all parts of  the heart. 

i  should have  pointed  out  the  main parts.  we  have four chambers, an  atrium- 
ventricle pair  on  the  left  and  right.  the  sa  node  should  be  the  pacemaker.  the 
stimulus spreads from  the  atria  to  the  ventricles-  from  the  small  chambers  that 
"prime the pump" to the powerful chambers that drive blood through the body. the 
p wave comes with contraction of  the atria. there is a pause of & second at the av 
node. then the big qrs wave starts contraction of  the ventricles, and the t wave is 
when the ventricles relax. the cells switch back to negative charge and the heart cycle 
is complete.

the ecg shows when the pacemaker goes wrong. other pacemakers take over- 

the av  node will pace at 60/minute. an  early firing in the ventricle can give a wide 
spike in the qrs complex, followed by  a long pause. the impulses travel by  a slow 
path.  also  the  pacemaker  can  suddenly  speed  up  (paroxysmal  tachycardia  is 
150-250/minute). but the most critical danger is fibrillation. 

figure 3.10b shows a dying heart. the ecg indicates irregular contractions-no 

normal pqrst sequence at all. what kind of  heart would generate such a rhythm? 
the  muscles  are quivering  or  "fibrillating"  independently. the pumping action is 
nearly  gone,  which  means  emergency  care. the  patient  needs  immediate  cpr- 
someone to do the pumping that the heart can't do. cardio-pulmonary resuscitation 
is a combination of  chest pressure and air pressure (hand and mouth) to restart the 
rhythm.  cpr  can  be  done on  the  street.  a hospital applies a  defibrillator, which 
shocks the heart back  to life. it depolarizes all the heart cells, so the timing can be 
reset.  then  the  charge  spreads  normally  from  sa  node  to  atria  to  av  node  to 
ventricles. 

this discussion has not used all twelve graphs to locate the problem. that needs 
uectors. look ahead at section 11.1 for the heart vector, and especially at section 1 1.2 
for its twelve projections.  those readings distinguish between  atrium and ventricle, 
left and right, forward and back. this information is of  vital importance in the event 
of  a heart attack. a "heart  attack" is a myocardial infarction (mi). 

an mi occurs when part of an artery to the heart is blocked (a coronary occlusion). 

3 applications of  the derivative 

rg. 3.10  doubtful rhythm. serious fibrillation. signals of a heart attack. 

infarction 

an  area is without  blood  supply-therefore  without  oxygen or glucose. often the 
attack is in the thick  left  ventricle, which  needs  the most  blood.  the cells are first 
ischemic, then injured, and finally infarcted (dead). the classical ecg signals involve 
those three 1's: 

ischemia: reduced blood supply, upside-down t wave in the chest leads. 
injury: an  elevated segment between s and t means a recent attack. 
infarction:  the q wave, normally a  tiny dip or absent, is as wide as a small 
square (& second). it may occupy a third of  the entire qrs complex. 

the q wave gives the diagnosis. you  can find all three i's  in figure 3.10~. 

it is absolutely amazing how much a good graph can do. 

the  mechanics of graphs 

from the meaning of  graphs we  descend to the mechanics. a formula is now given 
for f(x). the problem is to create the graph. it would be too old-fashioned to evaluate 
ax) by  hand  and  draw  a  curve  through  a  dozen points. a computer has  a  much 
better idea of a parabola than an artist (who tends to make it asymptotic to a straight 
line). there are some things a computer knows, and other things an artist knows, 
and still others that you and i know-because  we  understand derivatives. 

our job  is to apply calculus. we extract information from f '  and f "  as well  asf. 
small movements in the graph may go unnoticed, but the important properties come 
through. here are the main tests: 

(above or below axis: f = 0 at crossing point) 
(increasing or decreasing: f '  = 0 at stationary point) 
(concave up or down: f" = 0 at injection point) 

1. the sign off (x) 
2.  the sign of f(x) 
3.  the sign of f"(x) 
4.  the behavior of f(x) as x + oo and x -, - oo 
5.  the points at which f(x) + oo or f(x) -, - oo 
6.  even or odd? 

periodic? 

jumps in f o r  f '? 

endpoints? 

f(o)? 

the sign of f(x) depends on  1 - x2. thus f(x) > 0 in the inner interval where x2 < 1. 
the graph bends upwards (f"(x) > 0) in that same interval. there are no inflection 
points, since f "  is never  zero. the stationary point where f' vanishes is x = 0.  we 
have a local minimum at x = 0. 
the guidelines (or asymptotes)meet the graph at infinity. for large x the important 
terms are x2 and  -x2. their ratio is + x2/-x2 = - 1-which 
is the limit as x -, or, 
and x -, - oo. the horizontal asymptote is the line y  = - 1. 
the other infinities, where f blows up, occur when  1 - x2 is zero. that happens at 
x =  1 and x = - 1. the vertical asymptotes are the lines x = 1 and x = -1. the graph 

3.4  graphs 

in figure 3.1 l a  approaches those lines. 
if f(x) +b as x -,+ oo  or  - oo,  the line y = b is a horizontal  asymptote 
if f(x) + + go  or  - go  as x  -,a, the line x = a is a vertical  asymptote 
ifflx) - (mx + b) +0 as x -+  + oo  or  - a ,  the line y = mx + b is a sloping asymptote. 
finally comes the vital fact that this function is even: f(x) =f(-  x) because squaring 

x  obliterates the sign. the graph is symmetric across the y  axis. 

to summarize  the  eflect  of  dividing  by  1 - x2: no effect near  x = 0.  blowup at  1 

and  -1 from zero in the denominator. the function approaches  -1 as 1x1  -+ oo.

this example divides by  x - 1. therefore x = 1 is  a  vertical  asymptote, where f(x) 
becomes infinite. vertical asymptotes come mostly from zero denominators. 

look beyond x = 1. both f(x) and f"(x) are positive for x > 1. the slope is zero at 

x = 2. that must be a local minimum. 

what happens as x  -+ oo? dividing x2 by x - 1, the leading term is x. the function 
expect a sloping asymptote. to find it, do the 

becomes large. it grows linearly-we 
division properly: 

the last term goes to zero. the function approaches y  = x + 1 as the asymptote. 

this function is not odd or even. its graph is in figure 3.11b. with zoom out you 

see the asymptotes. zoom in for f  = 0 or f' = 0 or f" = 0. 

fig. 3.11  the graphs of  x2/(1 - x2) and x2/(x - 1) and sin x + 3 sin 3x. 

example 3 

f(x) = sin x +  sin 3x  has the slope  f '(x) = cos x + cos 3x. 

above  all these functions are periodic.  if  x  increases by  2n, nothing  changes. the 
graphs from 2n to 47c are repetitions of the graphs from 0 to 271. thusf(x + 2 4  =f(x) 
and  the period  is  2n. any  interval of  length  27c  will  show a  complete picture, and 
figure 3.1 1c picks the interval from  -n to n. 

the  second  outstanding  property  is  that f  is  odd.  the  sine  functions  satisfy 
f(-  x) = -f(x). the graph is symmetric through the origin. by reflecting the right half 
through the origin, you get the left half. in contrast, the cosines in f f ( x )are even. 
to find the zeros of f(x) and f'(x) and f "(x),rewrite those functions as 
f(x) = 2 sin x - $ sin3x  f'(x) = - 2 cos x + 4 cos3x  f"(x) = - 10 sin x + 12 sin3x. 

3 applications of the derivative 

we  changed  sin 3x  to  3 sin x - 4 sin3x. for  the  derivatives  use  sin2x = 1 - cos2x. 
now find the zeros-the 

crossing points, stationary points, and inflection points: 

f = o  

2 sin  x = $  sin3x  * sin  x = o   or  sin2x=$ * x=o,  f n  

5  sin x = 6  sin3x 

f " = o  
x=o,  +66",  +114",  f n  
that is more  than  enough information  to  sketch the  gra  h.  the stationary  points 
n/4, n/2,  3 4 4  are evenly spaced. at  those points f(x) is ,/!i3 
(maximum), 213 (local 
minimum), d l 3  (maximum). figure 3.1 1c shows the graph. 

sin x = o   or  sin2x=2 

i would like to mention a beautiful continuation of  this same pattern: 
f(x) = sin x +3 sin 3x + :sin 5x + ..-
f'(x)  = cos x + cos 3x + cos 5x + -.. 
if  we  stop after ten terms, f(x) is extremely close to a step function.  if  we  don't  stop, 
the exact step function  contains infinitely many sines. it jumps from  -4 4  to +4 4  as 
x goes past zero. more precisely it is a "square  wave,"  because the graph jumps back 
down at n  and repeats.  the slope cos x + cos 3x + ..-also has  period  2n. infinitely 
many cosines add up to a delta function!  (the slope at the jump  is an infinite spike.) 
these sums of  sines and cosines are fourier series. 

graphs by computers and calculators 

we  have come to a  topic  of  prime importance.  if  you have graphing software for a 
computer, or if you have a graphing calculator, you can bring calculus to life. a graph 
presents y(x) in a new  way-different 
from the formula. information that is buried 
in  the  formula  is  clear  on  the  graph.  but  don't  throw  away  y(x) and  dyldx.  the 
derivative is far from obsolete. 

these pages discuss how calculus and graphs go together.  we work  on a crucial 
find where y(x) reaches its minimum. there is 
problem  of  applied mathematics-to 
no need to tell you a hundred applications. begin with the formula. how do you find 
the point x* where y(x) is smallest? 

first, draw the graph. that shows the main features. we should see (roughly) where 
x* lies. there may be several minima, or possibly none. but what we see depends on 
a decision that is ours to make-the 

range of  x and y in the viewing window. 

if nothing is known about y(x), the range is hard to choose. we can accept a default 
range,  and  zoom  in  or  out.  we  can  use  the  autoscaling  program  in  section 1.7. 
somehow x* can be  observed on the screen. then the problem is to compute it. 

i would like to work  with  a  specific example. we  solved it  by  calculus-to 

find 
the best point x* to enter an expressway. the speeds in section 3.2 were  30 and 60. 
the length of the fast road will be b = 6. the range of  reasonable values for  the entering 
point is 0 < x <6. the distance to the road in figure 3.12 is a = 3. we drive a distance 
,/=at speed 30 and the remaining distance 6 - x at speed 60:

this is the function to be minimized. its graph is extremely flat. 

it may seem unusual for the graph to be so level. on the contrary, it is common. 

ajat  graph is the whole point of  dyldx = 0. 

the  graph  near  the  minimum  looks like  y = cx2. it  is  a  parabola  sitting  on  a 
horizontal  tangent.  at  a  distance  of  ax = .01, we  only  go up by  c(ax)~ = .0001 c. 
unless c is a large number, this ay  can hardly be seen.

fig. 3.12  enter at x. the graph of driving time y(x). zoom boxes locate x*. 

the solution is  to change scale. zoom in on  x*. the tangent line stays flat, since 
dyldx is still zero. but the bending from c is increased. figure 3.12 shows the zoom 
box  blown  up into a new graph of  y(x). 

a calculator has one or more ways to find x*. with a trace mode, you direct a 
cursor  along the  graph.  from  the  display  of  y  values, read  y,,, 
and x*  to the 
nearest pixel. a zoom gives better  accuracy, because it  stretches the axes-each 
pixel represents a smaller ax  and  ay.  the ti-81 stretches by  4 as default. even 
the actual zoom  box on  the 
better, let the  whole  process be  graphical-draw 
screen. pick  two opposite corners, press  enter,  and  the  box  becomes the new 
viewing window (figure 3.12). 
the first zoom narrows the search for x*. it lies between x = 1 and x = 3. we build 
a new zoom  box and zoom in again. now  1.5  < x*  <2.  reasonable accuracy 
comes quickly. high accuracy does not come quickly. it takes time to create the box 
and execute the zoom. 
question 1  what happens as we  zoom in, if  all boxes are square (equal scaling)? 
answer  the picture gets flatter and flatter. we  are zooming in to the tangent line. 
changing x to x/4 and y to  y/4,  the parabola  y = x2 flattens to  y =  x2/4. to see 
any bending, we  must  use a long thin zoom box. 

i want  to change to a totally different approach.  suppose we  have a formula for 
dyldx. that derivative was produced by  an infinite zoom! the limit of  ay/ax came by 
brainpower alone: 

-dy  = 
dx

call this f(x). 

is harder to pinpoint. 

this function is  zero at x*. the computing problem is  completely changed: solve 
ax) =0.  it is  easier to find a  root  of  f(x) than  a minimum  of  y(x).  the graph  of f(x) 
crosses the x axis. the graph of  y(x) goes flat-this 
take the model function y =x2 for 1x1 c .01. the slope f = 2x changes from  -.02 
to +.02. the value of  x2 moves only by  .0001 -its  minimum point is hard to see. 
to repeat: minimization is easier with dyldx. the screen shows an order of magni- 
tude improvement, when  we  trace or zoom on f(x) = 0.  in  calculus, we  have  been 
taking the derivative for granted. it is natural to get blask about dyldx = 0. we forget 
how intelligent it is, to work  with the slope instead of  the function. 
question 2  how do you get another order of  magnitude improvement? 
answer  use  the  next  derivative! with a formula for dfldx,  which is dzy/dx2, the 
convergence is even faster. in two steps the error goes from .o1 to .0001 to .00000001. 
another infinite zoom went into the formula for dfldx,  and newton's  method  takes 
account of  it. sections 3.6 and 3.7 study f(x) = 0.

bra. the equation simplifies to 60x = 30 
4x2 = 32+ x2. then 3x2 = 3'. 

the expressway example allows perfect accuracy. we can solve dyjdx = 0 by alge- 
dividing by 30 and squaring yields 

the exact solution is x* = & = 1.73205.. . 
a model like this is a benchmark, to test competing methods. it also displays what 
we  never appreciated-the 
extreme flatness of  the graph.  the difference in driving 
time between entering at x* = & and x = 2 is one second. 

the  centering transform and zoom transform 

for a  photograph  we  do two  things-point 
the  right  way  and  stand at the  right 
distance. then take the picture. those steps are the same for a graph. first we pick 
the new  center point.  the graph is shifted, to move  that point  from (a,b)  to (0,o). 
then we  decide how far the graph should reach.  it fits in a rectangle, just  like the 
photograph.  rescaling to x/c and y/d puts the desired section of  the curve into the 
rectangle. 

a good photographer  does more (like an artist). the subjects are placed and the 
camera is focused. for good graphs those are necessary too. but an everyday calcula- 
tor or computer or camera is built to operate without an artist-just 
aim and shoot. 
i want to explain how to aim at y = f(x). 

we  are doing exactly what  a calculator does, with  one big  difference. it doesn't 
change coordinates. we  do. when x = 1, y = - 2 moves to the center of  the viewing 
window, the calculator still shows that point as (1, -2). when the centering transform 
acts on y + 2 = m(x - i), those numbers disappear. this will be  confusing unless  x 
and y also change. the new  coordinates are x = x - 1 and  y = y + 2.  then  the  new 
equation is  y = mx. 

the main point (for humans) is to make the algebra simpler. the computer has no 
preference for  y = mx  over  y - yo = m(x - x,).  it accepts 2x2 - 4x  as easily  as x2. 
but we  do prefer  y = mx  and y = x2, partly because their graphs go through (0,o). 
ever since zero was invented, mathematicians have liked that number best. 

example 4  the parabola y = 2x2- 4x  has its minimum when dyldx = 4x - 4 = 0. 
thus x = 1 and y = - 2.  move this bottom  point to the center: y = 2x2- 44 is 

the new parabola y = 2x2 has its bottom at (0,o). it is the same curve, shifted across 
and up. the only simpler parabola is y = x2. this final step is the job  of  the zoom. 
next  comes scaling.  we  may  want more detail (zoom in  to see the tangent line). 
we  may want a big picture (zoom out to check asymptotes). we  might stretch one 
axis more than the other, if  the picture looks like a pancake or a skyscraper. 

36  a z m m  tram@rna scdes the x and  y axes by c and d :  

x =  ex  and  y =  hy  change  y= f ( x )   to  y =  df(x/c). 

the new x and y are boldface letten, and the graph is re&. 

often c = d. 

3.4  graphs 

example 5  start with  y = 2x2. apply  a square zoom with  c = d.  in  the new  xy 
coordinates, the equation is y/c = ~ ( x / c ) ~ .the number 2 disappears if c = d = 2.  with 
the right centering and the right zoom, every parabola that opens upward is y = x2. 
question 3  what happens to the derivatives (slope and bending) after a zoom? 
answer  the slope (first derivative) is multiplied by  d/c. apply the chain rule to y = 
df(x/c). a square zoom has d/c = 1-lines  keep their slope. the second derivative is 
multiplied by d/c2, which changes the bending. a zoom out divides by small numbers 
c = d, so the big picture is more, curved. 

combining the centering and zoom  transforms, as we  do in practice, gives y  in 

terms of  x: 

y =f(x)  becomes  y=f(x+a)-b 

andthen  y = d   f  - + a  )-bl.

fig. 3.14  change of  coordinates by  centering and zoom. calculators still show (x, y). 

question 4  find x and y ranges after two transforms. start between  -1 and  1. 
answer  the  window  after  centering is  -1 <x - a < 1 and  -1 <y - b < 1.  the 
window after zoom is  -1<c(x - a) < 1 and  -1 <d(y - b) < 1. the point (1, 1) was 
originally in the corner. the point (c-'  + a, d  + b) is now in the corner. 
the numbers a, b, c, d are chosen to produce a simpler function (like y = x2). or 
else-this 
are chosen to make x and y 
"dimensionless."  an  example is y =f cos 8t. the frequency 8 has dimension l/time. 
the amplitude f is a distance. with  d = 2 cm  and c = 8 sec, the units are removed 
and y = cos t. 

is important in applied mathematics-they 

may  i  mention one transform  that  does  change the slope? it  is  a  rotation. the 
whole plane is turned. a photographer might use it-but  normally people are sup- 
posed to be  upright. you  use rotation when you turn a map or straighten a picture. 
in the next  section, an unrecognizable hyperbola is turned into  y = 1/x.

here is  a list of  the most important curves in mathematics, so you can tell what is 
coming. it is not easy to rank the top four: 

1.  straight lines 
2.  sines and cosines (oscillation) 
3.  exponentials (growth and decay) 
4.  parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas (using 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2). 

the curves that i wrote last, the greeks would have written first. it is so natural to 
go  from linear equations to quadratic equations. straight lines use  1,x, y.  second 
degree curves include  x2, xy, y2. if  we  go  on  to  x3 and  y3, the  mathematics  gets 
complicated. we now study equations of second degree, and the curves they produce. 
it is quite important to see both the equations and the curves. this section connects 
two great parts of  mathematics-analysis  of  the equation and geometry of  the curve. 
together they produce "analytic geometry."  you  already know about functions and 
graphs. even more basic: numbers correspond to points. we speak about "the  point 
(5,2)." euclid might not have understood. 

where  euclid  drew  a  45" line through the origin, descartes wrote down y = x. 
analytic geometry has become central to mathematics-we  now look at one part of it. 

fig. 3.15  the cutting plane gets steeper: circle to ellipse to parabola to hyperbola. 

3  appllcatlonr of the derhrathre 

conic sections 

the parabola and ellipse and hyperbola have absolutely remarkable properties. the 
greeks discovered  that  all these  curves come from  slicing  a  cone  by  a plane.  the 
curves are "conic sections." a level cut gives a circle, and a moderate angle produces 
an ellipse. a  steep cut  gives  the  two  pieces  of  a  hyperbola  (figure 3.15d).  at  the 
borderline,  when  the slicing angle matches the cone  angle, the plane carves out  a 
parabola. it has one branch like an ellipse, but it opens to infinity like a hyperbola. 
throughout  mathematics,  parabolas  are  on  the  border  between  ellipses  and 

hyperbolas. 

to repeat: we can slice through cones or we  can look for equations. for a cone 
of  light, we  see  an ellipse on  the  wall.  (the wall  cuts into the light  cone.) for  an 
equation  ax^ + bxy + cy2+ dx + ey + f = 0, we  will work to make it simpler. the 
graph will be centered and rescaled (and rotated if  necessary), aiming for an equation 
like y = x2. eccentricity and polar coordinates are left for chapter 9. 

the  parabola y = m2+ bx + c 

you  knew  this  function  long  before  calculus. the  graph  crosses  the  x  axis  when 
y = 0. the quadratic formula solves y = 3x2- 4x + 1 = 0, and so does factoring into 
(x - 1)(3x- 1). the crossing points x = 1 and x =f come from algebra. 
the other important  point  is  found by  calculus.  it  is  the minimum  point, where 
dyldx = 6x - 4 = 0. the x coordinate is 8 =f ,  halfway between  the crossing points. 
the height is ymin = -i.this is the vertex  v in figure 3.16a-at 
the bottom of  the 
parabola. 

a parabola has no asymptotes. the slope 6x - 4 doesn't  approach a constant. 

to center  the  vertex  shift left  by  3  and  up  by  f .  so introduce the new  variables 
x = x - $   and  y = y + f .   hen x = f  and y =  - 3   correspond to x =  y=o-which 
is the new  vertex: 

y = 3x2- 4x + 1  becomes  y = 3x 2. 

(1) 
check the algebra. y = 3x2 is the same as y +f = 3(x -3)2. that simplifies to  the 
original equation y = 3x2- 4x + 1. the second graph shows the centered parabola 
y = 3x2, with the vertex moved to the origin. 
to zoom in on the  vertex  rescale x and  y by  the zoom factor a: 

y = 3 x 2   becomes  y/a = 3 ( ~ / a ) ~ .  

the final equation has x and y in boldface. with a = 3 we  find y = x2-the  graph is 
magnified by  3. in two steps we  have reached the model parabola opening upward.

3.5  parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas 

a parabola has another important point-the 

focus.  its distance from the vertex 
is  called p.  the special parabola y = x2 has p = 114, and other parabolas  y = a x 2  
have p = 1/4a. you magnify by  a factor a to get y = x2. the beautiful property of  a 
parabola is that every ray coming straight down is reflected to the focus. 

problem 2.3.25  located the focus f-here  we  mention two applications. a  solar 
collector and a  tv  dish  are parabolic.  they concentrate sun rays and tv signals 
onto a point-a  heat cell or a receiver collects them at the focus. the 1982 umap 
journal explains how  radar  and  sonar use  the same idea. car headlights turn the 
idea around, and send the light outward. 

here is a classical fact about parabolas. from each point  on the curve, the distance 
to the focus  equals  the  distance  to the  "directrix." the directrix is  the line y = -p 
below  the vertex (so the vertex is halfway between focus and directrix). with p = 4, 
the distance down from any (x, y) is y + 4.  match that with the distance to the focus 
at (0,a)- 

this is the square root below. out comes the special parabola y = x2: 

y + 4 =  - (square both sides)  - y = x2. 

(2) 

the exercises give practice with all the steps we  have taken-center 
y = a x 2 ,  rescale it to y = x2, locate the vertex and focus and directrix. 
summary for  other parabolas  y = ax2+ bx + c has its vertex where  dy/dx is zero. 
thus 2ax + b = 0 and  x = -b/2a.  shifting across to that  point  is  "completing  the 
square": 

the parabola to 

ax2+ bx + e  equals  a (x + - + c. 

: l ) i  

here c = c - (b2/4a) is the height of the vertex. the centering transform x = x + (b/2a), 
y = y - c produces y = ax2. it moves the vertex to (0, 0), where it belongs. 

for the ellipse and hyperbola, our plan of  attack is the same: 

1.  center the curve to remove any linear terms dx and ey. 
2.  locate each focus and discover the reflection property. 
3.  rotate to remove bxy if  the equation contains it. 

ellipses -+ - = 1 

x2  y2
a 2   b2 

(circles  have a= b )

this equation makes the ellipse symmetric about (0, 0)-the 
center. changing x to 
-x  or y to  -y  leaves the same equation. no extra centering or rotation is needed. 
the equation also shows that x2/a2 and y2/b2 cannot exceed one. (they add to 
one and can't be negative.) therefore x2 < a2, and x stays between  -a and a. similarly 
y stays between b and  -b.  the ellipse is inside a rectangle. 

by  solving for y we  get a function (or two functions!) of  x: 

the graphs are the top half (+) and bottom half (-)  of the ellipse. to draw the ellipse, 
plot  them together. they meet when  y = 0,  at x = a on the far right of  figure 3.17 
and at x = - a on the far left. the maximum y = b and minimum y = -b are at the 
top and bottom of  the ellipse, where we  bump into the enclosing rectangle. 
a  circle is a special case of  an ellipse, when a = b.  the circle equation x2 + y2 = r2 
is the ellipse equation with a = b = r. this circle is centered at (0,o); other circles are 

3 applications of the derivative 

centered at x = h, y = k.  the circle is determined by  its radius r and its center (h, k): 

equation of  circle:  (x - h)'  + (y - k)2= r2. 

(4) 
in  words,  the  distance  from  (x, y)  on  the  circle to  (h, k)  at  the  center  is  r.  the 
equation has linear terms  -2hx and  -2ky-they  disappear when the center is (0,o). 

example 1  find the circle that has a diameter from (1,7) to (5, 7). 
solution  the center is halfway at (3,7). so r = 2 and (x - 3)2+ (y - 7)2= 22. 
example2  find  the center and radius of  the circle x2 - 6x + y2 - 14y = - 54. 
solution  complete x2 - 6x to the square (x - 3)2 by  adding 9. complete y2 - 14y 
to  (y - 7)2 by  adding  49.  adding  9  and  49  to  both  sides  of  the  equation  leaves 
(x - 3)2+ (y - 7)2= 4-the 
quicker solution  match the given equation with (4). then h = 3, k = 7, and r = 2: 
x2 - 6x + y2 - 14y = - 54  must agree with  x2 - 2hx + h2 + y2 - 2ky + k2 = r2. 
the change to x = x - h and  y= y - k moves the center of  the circle from (h, k) 

same circle as in example 1. 

to (0,o). this is equally true for an ellipse:

when we  rescale by  x = xja and y = ylb, we  get the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1. 

the unit circle has area n. the ellipse has area nab (proved later in the book). the 

distance around the circle is 2n. the distance around an ellipse does not  rescale-it 
has no simple formula.

now we leave circles and concentrate on ellipses. they have two foci (pronounced 
fo-sigh). for a parabola, the second focus is at infinity. for a circle, both foci are at 
the center. the foci of  an ellipse are on its longer axis (its major axis), one focus on 
each side of  the center: 

~ , i s a t x = e = j a ~ - b ~  and 

f 2 i s a t x = - c .  

the  right  triangle in  figure 3.17  has  sides a, b,  c.  from  the  top  of  the  ellipse, the 
distance to each focus is a. from the endpoint at x = a, the distances to the foci are 
a + c and a - c. adding  (a + c) + (a - c) gives  2a.  as  you  go around  the ellipse, the 
distance to f ,  plus  the distance to f2 is constant (always 2a). 

3.5  parabolas,  ellipses, and  hyperbolas

3h  at all points on the ellipse, the  sum of distances  from the foci is 2a. this
is  another  equation  for the ellipse:

from  f1  and  f2  to (x, y): 

(x-  )2 +y 2  + 

/(x 

2 =  2a. 

(5)

to draw an ellipse,  tie a string of length  2a to the foci.  keep the string taut and your
moving  pencil  will create  the  ellipse.  this  description  uses  a and  c-the  other form
uses  a and b (remember  b2 + c2  = a2). problem  24  asks you  to  simplify  equation  (5)
until  you  reach  x 2/a2  + y 2/b 2 =  1.

the  "whispering  gallery"  of the  united  states  senate  is  an ellipse.  if you  stand at
one focus  and  speak  quietly,  you  can be  heard  at the  other focus  (and nowhere  else).
your  voice  is  reflected  off  the  walls  to  the  other  focus-following  the  path  of the
string.  for a parabola  the rays come in to the focus from infinity-where  the second
focus is.

a  hospital  uses  this reflection  property  to  split  up  kidney  stones.  the  patient  sits
inside  an ellipse  with  the kidney  stone  at  one focus.  at  the other  focus  a lithotripter
sends  out hundreds  of small  shocks.  you  get a spinal  anesthetic  (i mean  the patient)
and the  stones  break  into tiny  pieces.

the  most  important  focus  is  the  sun.  the  ellipse  is  the  orbit  of  the  earth.  see
section  12.4  for  a  terrible  printing  mistake  by  the  royal  mint,  on  england's  last
pound  note.  they  put  the sun  at the center.
question  1  why  do  the whispers  (and  shock  waves)  arrive  together  at  the second
focus?
answer  whichever  way  they  go,  the distance  is  2a. exception:  straight path  is 2c.
question 2  locate  the ellipse  with  equation 4x 2  + 9y 2  = 36.
answer  divide  by  36  to  change  the  constant  to  1. now  identify  a and  b:

answer  change  x

other way  to  center  it.

notice  the minus sign for a hyperbola. that makes all  the  difference.  unlike an ellipse,
x and  y  can  both  be  large.  the  curve  goes  out to  infinity.  it is  still  symmetric,  since
x can  change  to  - x and  y  to  - y.

the center  is  at  (0, 0).  solving for y  again  yields  two  functions  (+  and  -):

a  - = 1  gives

or  y =

(6)

the hyperbola has two branches  that never meet.  the upper branch, with a plus  sign,
has  y >  a. the  vertex  v1  is  at  x = 0,  y  = a-the  lowest  point  on  the  branch.  much
further out,  when  x  is large,  the  hyperbola  climbs up  beside  its  sloping asymptotes:

fig. 3.18  the hyperbola iy2 - &x2 = 1 has a = 2, b = 3, c = ,/-. 

f ,  differ by 2a = 4. 

the distances to f 1  and 

the asymptotes are the lines yla = x/b and yla = - x/b. their slopes are a/b and - a/b. 
you can't  miss them in figure 3.18. 
for  a  hyperbola,  the  foci  are inside  the  two  branches. their  distance from  the 
center is still called c.  but now c = ,/=, which is larger than a and b. the vertex 
is a distance c - a from one focus and c + a from the other. the diflerence  (not the 
sum) is (c + a) - (c - a) = 2a. 

all points on the hyperbola have this property:  the diflerence between distances to 
the foci  is constantly 2a. a ray coming in to one focus is reflected toward the other. 
the reflection is on the outside of  the hyperbola, and the inside of  the ellipse. 

here is an application to navigation. radio signals leave two fixed transmitters at 
the  same time.  a ship receives the  signals a  millisecond apart. where is the  ship? 
answer:  it  is  on  a  hyperbola  with  foci  at  the  transmitters.  radio  signals  travel 
186 miles  in a millisecond, so  186 = 2a. this determines the curve. in  long range 
navigation  (loran) a  third  transmitter  gives  another  hyperbola.  then  the  ship 
is located exactly. 

question 4  how do hyperbolas differ from parabolas, far from the center? 
answer  hyperbolas have asymptotes. parabolas don't. 

the hyperbola has a natural rescaling. the appearance of x/b is a signal to change 
to x .  similarly yla  becomes  y. then  y =  1 at the vertex, and  we  have a  standard 
hyperbola: 

y2/a2 - x2/b2 = 1  becomes  y 2  - x 2  = 1. 

a 90" turn gives x 2  - y2 = l-the  hyperbola opens to the sides. a 45" turn produces 
2x y = 1.  we  show  below  how  to  recognize  x2 + x y  + y2 = 1  as  an  ellipse  and 
x2 + 3xy + y2 = 1 as a hyperbola. (they are not circles because of the xy term.) when 
the xy coefficient increases past 2, x2 + y2 no longer indicates an ellipse. 
question 5  locate the hyperbola with equation 9y2 - 4x2 = 36. 
answer  divide by  36. then y2/4 - x2/9 = 1. recognize a = & and b = fi. 
question 6  locate the uncentered hyperbola 9y2 - 18y - 4x2 - 4x = 28. 
answer  complete  9~~ - 18y  to  9(y - 1)2 by  adding  9.  complete  4x2 + 4x  to 
4(x + $)2  by adding  4(3)2 = 1.  the equation  is rewritten as 9(y -  - 4(x + $)2  = 
28 + 9 - 1. this is the hyperbola in question 5 - except its center is (-  $,i). 

3.5  parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas 

to summarize: find the center by  completing squares. then read  off  a and b. 

the  general equation ax2 + bxy + cy2 + dx + ey + f = 0 

this  equation  is  of  second  degree,  containing  any  and  all  of  1, x, y, x2, xy, y2. 
a plane  is  cutting  through  a  cone.  is  the  curve  a parabola  or  ellipse  or  hyperbola? 
start with the most important  case ax2 + bxy + cy2 = 1. 

i i  the equation ax2 + bxy + cyz = 1 produces a hyperbola if b~ > 4ac and 

an ellipse if b2 < 4ac. a parabola has b2 = 4ac. 

i 

to recognize the curve,  we  remove  bxy  by  rotating  the plane.  this also changes a 
the combination b~ - 4ac is not changed (proof omitted). an example 
and c-but 
is  2xy = 1,  with  b~ = 4.  it  rotates  to  y2 - x2 = 1,  with  - 4ac = 4.  that  positive 
number  4 signals a  hyperbola-since  a = - 1 and c = 1 have opposite signs. 
another example is x2 + y2 = 1. it is a circle (a special ellipse). however we rotate, 
the equation stays the same. the combination b~ - 4ac = 0 - 4  1  1 is negative, as 
predicted  for ellipses. 

to rotate by  an angle a, change x  and y to new  variables  x'  and y': 
=  x cos a + y sin  a 
y'  = - y sin  a + x cos a. 

(7) 
substituting for x and y changes  ax^ + bxy + c y 2  = 1 to a ' x ' ~  + b'xly' + cryf2 = 1. 
the formulas for a', b',  c' are painful  so i go to the key point: 

x = x'  cos a - y' sin  a 
y = x' sin  a + y'  cos a 

and 

b'  is zero if the rotation angle  a has tan  2a = b/(a - c). 

with  b' = 0, the curve is easily recognized from  a ' x ' ~  + c'yr2 = 1. it is a hyperbola 
if  a' and c' have opposite signs. then b ' ~  - 4a1c' is positive. the original b~ - 4ac 
was also positive, because this  special combination stays constant during rotation. 
centering. to find the center, 
after the xy term is gone, we  deal with x and y-by 
complete squares as in questions  3 and 6. for total perfection,  rescale to one of  the 
model equations y = x2 or x2 + y2 = 1 or y2 - x2 = 1. 

the remaining question is about f = 0. what is the graph of  ax?  + bxy + cy2 = o? 
the ellipse-hyperbola-parabola have disappeared.  but if  the greeks were right, the 
cone  is  still cut  by  a  plane.  the degenerate case f = 0 occurs when  the  plane  cuts 
right  through  the sharp point  of the cone. 
a level cut  hits  only that one point  (0,o). the equation  shrinks to x2 + y2 = 0, a 
circle with radius zero. a steep cut gives two lines. the hyperbola becomes y2 -?. x2 = 0, 
leaving only its asymptotes y = + x. a  cut at the exact angle of  the cone gives only 
one line, as in x2 = 0. a single point,  two lines, and one line are very extreme cases of 
an ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola. 

all these "conic sections" come from planes and cones. the beauty of the geometry, 
which  archimedes saw, is matched  by  the importance of  the equations. galileo dis- 
covered that projectiles go along parabolas (chapter 12). kepler discovered that the 
earth  travels  on  an ellipse (also chapter  12). finally  einstein  discovered  that  light 
travels on hyperbolas. that is in four dimensions, and not  in  chapter  12.

3  applications of the derivative 

3.6 

iterations xn+ 1 = f(xn) 

iteration  means  repeating  the  same function.  suppose  the  function  is  f(x) = cos x. 
choose any starting value,  say x,  = 1. take its cosine: x,  = cos x,  = .54. then take 
the  cosine of x, . that  produces  x2 = cos .54 = .86.  the iteration is x, + , = cos x,. 
i 
am in radian mode on a calculator, pressing "cos"  each time. the early numbers are 
not important, what is important is the output after  12 or 30 or  100 steps: 

example 1  x12 = .75,  x13 = .73,  x14 = .74,  ...,  x29 = .7391,  ~ 3 ,
the goal is to explain why the x's  approach  x* = .739085 ..... every starting value 
x,  leads to this same number x*.  what is special about  .7391? 

 = .7391. 

note  on iterations  do x1 = cos x,  and x2 = cos x,  mean  that  x,  = cos2 x,?  abso- 
lutely  not!  iteration  creates a new  and different function cos (cos x). it  uses  the cos 
button, not  the squaring button. the third  step creates f(f(f(x))). as  soon as you 
can, iterate with x,+,  = 4 cos x,.  what limit do the x's  approach? is it 3(.7931)? 

let me slow down to understand these questions.  the central idea is expressed by 
the equation x,+,  = f(x,).  substituting xo into f gives x,. this output x,  is the input 
that leads to x,.  in its turn, x2 is the input and out comes x,  = f(x2). this is iteration, 
and it produces  the sequence x,, x,, x2, .... 

the x's  may approach a limit x*, depending on the function f. sometimes x* also 
depends  on  the  starting  value  x,.  sometimes  there  is  no  limit.  look  at  a  second 
example, which does not need a calculator. 
example 2  x,+ , = f(x,) = ix, + 4. starting from x,  = 0 the sequence is 
x , = 4 * 0 + 4 = 4 ,   x 2 = i * 4 + 4 = 6 ,  x 3 = l . 6 + 4 = 7  
9

.... 
those numbers 0, 4, 6, 7, 73, . . . seem to be approaching x* = 8. a computer would 
convince us.  so will mathematics, when we  see what is  special about 8: 

x  = 1 . 7 + 4 = 7 l  2, 
4

2 

2 

when  the x's  approach x*, the limit of  x,  +,  = ix, + 4 
is  x* = i  ,x * + 4.  this  limiting  equation  yields  x* = 8. 

8 is the "steady  state"  where input equals output:  8 = f(8).  it is thefixedpoint. 

if  we  start  at  x,  = 8,  the  sequence  is  8, 8, 8, ... . when  we  start  at  x,  = 12,  the 

sequence goes back  toward 8: 

equation for  limit: if  the iterations x, + , = f(x,) converge to x*, then x* = f(x*). 
to repeat: 8 is special because it equals 4  8 + 4. the number .7391.. . is special because 
it equals cos .7391.. . . the graphs of y = x and y  = f(x) intersect at x*. to explain why 
the x's  converge (or why  they don't) is the job  of  calculus. 

example 3  x n + ,  = xi has two fixed  points: 0 = 0'  and  1 = 12. here f(x) = x2. 
starting  from  x,  = 3 the  sequence a, a, &, . . . goes  quickly  to  x* = 0.  the  only 
approaches to x* = 1 are from  x,  = 1 (of course) and  from  x,  = - 1. starting from 
x,  = 2 we  get 4,  16, 256, . . . and the sequence  diverges  to + m. 

each limit x* has a "basin of attraction." the basin contains all starting points x, 
that lead to x*. for examples  1 and 2, every x,  led to .7391 and 8. the basins were 

3.6  iterations x,,  ,= f(xj 

131 

the whole line (that is still to be proved). example 3 had  three basins-the 
interval 
-1  < x,  < 1, the two points  xo = + 1, and all the rest.  the outer basin  ixo( > 1 led 
to + co.i challenge you to find the limits and the basins of attraction (by calculator) 
for f(x) = x - tan x. 
in example 3, x* = 0 is attracting. points near x* move toward x*. the fixed point 
x* = 1 is  repelling.  points  near  1 move  away.  we  now  find  the  rule  that  decides 
whether x* is attracting or repelling. the key is the slope df/dx at x*. 

3j  start from any x, near a fixed point x* = f(x*): 

x*  is attracting if  idf/dxf is below  1  at x* 
x*  is  repelling  if  idfldxl is above 1 at x*. 

first i will give a calculus proof. then comes a picture of convergence, by "cobwebs." 
both methods throw light on this crucial test for attraction: idf/dxl<  1. 

first  proof:  subtract x* = f(x*) from  x,,,  = f(x,).  the  difference  x,,,  - x*  is 
the same as f(x,)  - f(x*). this is af.  the basic idea of calculus is that  af is close 
to f'ax: 

x,+  - x* = f(x,) - f(x*) z f1(x*)(xn- x*). 

(1) 
the  "error"  x,  - x*  is  multiplied  by  the  slope  df/dx.  the  next  error  x,+ ,- x*  is 
smaller or larger,  based  on i f'i  < 1 or i f'i > 1 at x*.  every step multiplies approxi- 
mately by  f1(x*). its  size controls the speed of convergence. 

in  example  1,  f(x)  is  cos x  and  f1(x) is  -sin  x.  there  is  attraction  to  .7391 
because lsin x* i  < 1. in example 2, f is fx + 4 and f' is i.there is attraction to 8. 
in example 3, f is x2 and f' is 2x. there is superattraction to x* = 0 (where f' = 0). 
there is repulsion  from x* = 1 (where f' = 2). 

i admit one major  difficulty. the approximation in  equation (1) only  holds  near 
x*.  if  x,  is  far  away,  does  the  sequence still approach  x*?  when  there  are several 
attracting points,  which  x*  do we  reach?  this  section  starts  with  good  iterations, 
which  solve the  equation  x* = f(x*) or f(x) = 0.  at  the  end  we  discover  newton's 
method. the next  section  produces  crazy  but  wonderful  iterations,  not  converging 
and not blowing up. they lead to "fractals"  and "cantor sets"  and "chaos." 

the mathematics of  iterations is not finished. it may never be finished, but we  are 

converging on the answers. please choose a function  and join  in. 

the  graph of an iteration: cobwebs 

the iteration  x,,  ,= f(x,)  involves two  graphs  at the  same time.  one is  the graph 
of  y = f(x). the other is the graph of  y = x (the 45"  line). the iteration jumps  back 
and forth between these graphs. it is a very convenient way to see the whole process. 
example  1 was x,,,  = cos x,.  figure 3.19 shows the graph of cos x and the  "cob-

web."  starting at (x,,  x,)  on the 45" line, the rule is based on x, = f(x,): 

from (x,,  x,)  go up or down to (x,,  x,) on the curve. 
from (x,,  x,) go across to (x,, x,) on  the 45" line. 

these steps are repeated  forever. from x,  go up to the curve at f(x,). that height 
is x, . now  cross to the 45" line at (x,,  x,).  the iterations are aiming for (x*, x*) = 
(.7391, .7391). this is the crossing point  of  the two graphs y = f(x) and y = x. 

3  applicafions of the derivative 

fig. 3-49  cobwebs go from (xo, xo) to (xo, xl) to (xl ,xl)-line 

to curve to line. 

example 2 was xn+, = f xn+ 4. both graphs are straight lines. the cobweb is one- 
sided, from (0,o) to (0,4) to (4,4) to (4,6) to (6,6). notice how y changes (vertical 
line) and then x changes (horizontal line). the slope of  f(x) is 4,so the distance to 8 
is multiplied by f at every step. 

example 3 was xn+, = xz.  the  graph of  y = x2 crosses the 45" line at two fixed 
points: o2 = 0 and  l 2  = 1. figure 3.20a starts the iteration close to  1, but it quickly 
goes away. this fixed  point  is  repelling because  f'(1) = 2.  distance from  x* = 1 is 
doubled  (at  the  start). one path  moves  down  to  x* = 0-which 
is  superattractive 
because f' = 0. the path from x,  > 1 diverges to infinity. 

example 4  f(x) has two attracting points x* (a repelling x* is always between). 
figure 3.20b shows two crossings with slope zero. the iterations and cobwebs con- 
verge quickly. in between, the graph of f(x) must cross the 45" line from below. that 
requires a slope greater than one. cobwebs diverge from this unstable point,  which 
separates the basins of  attraction. the fixed point  x = n: is in a basin by itself! 

note  1  to draw cobwebs on  a  calculator,  graph  y = f(x) on  top of  y = x.  on  a 
casio,  one  way  is  to  plot  (x,,  x,)  and  give  the  command  l i n e : p l 0t  x ,y 
followed by  e x e. now move the cursor vertically to y = f(x) and press  e x e. then 
move horizontally to y = x and press  e x e. continue. each step draws a line.

for the ti-81 (and also the casio) a short program produces a cobweb. store f(x) 
in the  y = function slot  y 1 . set the range (square window or autoscaling). run the 
program and answer the prompt  with x,: 

note 2  the x's  approach x* from one side when 0 < df/dx < 1. 

note 3  a basin of  attraction can include faraway x,'s  (basins can come in infinitely 
many pieces). this makes the problem  interesting. if  no fixed points are attracting, 
see section 3.7 for "cycles"  and "chaos." 

the  iteration xn+,= x,  - c~(x,,) 

at  this point we  offer the reader a choice. one possibility is to jump  ahead  to the 
next  section on "newton's  method."  that method is an iteration to solve f (x) = 0. 
the function f(x) combines x,  and f (x,) and f '(x,)  into an optimal formula for x,+ ,. 
we will see how quickly newton's method works (when it works). it is the outstanding 
algorithm to solve equations, and it is totally built on tangent approximations. 

the other possibility is to understand (through calculus) a whole family of  itera- 
tions. this family depends on a number c, which is at our disposal. the best choice 
of  c produces  newton's  method.  i  emphasize that  iteration  is  by  no  means a  new 
and peculiar idea. it is a fundamental technique in  scientijic computing. 

we  start by  recognizing that there are many ways to reach f (x*) = 0. (i write x* 
for  the  solution.) a good  algorithm  may  switch  to  newton  as  it  gets  close.  the 
iterations use f (x,)  to decide on the next  point x,,,  : 

notice how  f(x) is constructed from f (x)-they  are different! we move f to the right 
side and multiply by  a "preconditioner"  c.  the choice of  c (or c,,  if  it changes from 
step to step) is  absolutely critical. the starting guess xo is  also important-but 
its 
accuracy is not always under our control. 

suppose the x,  converge to x*. then the limit of  equation (2) is 

(3) 
that gives f (x*)= 0. if  the x,'s  have a limit, it solves the right equation. it is a fixed 
point of f (we can assume cn +c # 0 and f (x,) +f (x*)). there are two key questions, 
and both  of  them are answered by  the slope ft(x*): 

x* = x* - cf  (x*). 

1.  how quickly does x,  approach x* (or do the x,  diverge)? 
2.  what is a good choice of  c (or c,)? 

d w p l e  5  f (x)= ax - b is  zero at  x* = bla.  the iteration  xn+ , = xn- c(ax, - b) 
intends to find bla without actually dividing. (early computers could not divide; they 
used  iteration.) subtracting x* from both  sides leaves an equation for the error: 

x , + ~ - x * = x , - x * -

c(ax, - b). 

replace b by  ax*. the right side is (1 - ca)(x, - x*). this "error  equation"  is 

(error),+ ,= (1 - ca)(error),. 

(4) 

3 applications of the derivative 

at  every step the error is multiplied by ( 1  - ca), which is f'.  the error goes  to zero if 
if'  i  is less than 1.  the absolute value ( 1 - cal  decides everything: 
x, converges to x*  if and only if  - 1 < 1 - ca < 1. 

(5) 

the perfect  choice (if  we  knew  it) is c = l/a, which  turns the multiplier  1 - ca  into 
zero. then one iteration gives the exact answer: x ,  = xo - (l/a)(axo- b)= bla. that 
is the horizontal line in figure 3.21a,  converging in one step. but look at the other 
lines. 

this example did  not need  calculus. linear equations never do. the key  idea is 
that close to x*  the nonlinear equation f ( x )  = 0 is nearly linear. we apply the tangent 
approximation. you are seeing how calculus is used, in a problem that doesn't  start 
by  asking for a derivative. 

the  best choice of  c 

the  immediate  goal  is  to  study  the  errors  x, - x*.  they  go  quickly  to  zero,  if 
the  multiplier  is  small.  to  understand  x,,,  = x, - cf (x,),  subtract  the  equation 
x*  = x* - cf (x*): 

x,+ ,- x*  = x, - x*  - c( f (x,) -f (x*)). 

(6) 

now  calculus  enters.  when you  see  a  &terence  off's  think  of  dfldx.  replace 
.f(x,) -f (x*) by  a(x, - x*), where a  stands for the slope df /dx at x*: 

x,+  - x*  z ( 1  - ca)(x,- x*). 

(7) 
this is the error equation. the new error at step n + 1  is approximately the old error 
multiplied by m = 1 - ca. this corresponds to m = 1 - ca in the linear example. we 
keep returning  to the basic test iml=  i  ff(x*)l< 1: 

there is only one difficulty: w e  don't know x*. therefore we don't  know the perfect 
c. it depends on the slope a =f  '(x*) at the unknown solution. however we can come 
close, by  using the slope at x,: 

choose c, = l /  f '(x,). then x,+  = x, -f ( x j  f  '(x,) = f(x,). 

this is newton's method. the multiplier m = 1 - ca is as near to zero as we can make 
it. by  building dfldx into f(x),newton speeded up the convergence of  the iteration.

the column with  c = 1 is  diverging (repelled from x*). the  second column shows 
convergence (attracted to x*). the third column (newton's  method) approaches x* 
so quickly that  .4501836 and seven more digits are exact for x3. 
how does this convergence match  the prediction? note  that  f '(x) = 2 + sin x  so 
a = 2.435. look to see whether the actual errors x,  - x*, going down each column, 
are multiplied by the predicted m below that column:

the first column shows a multiplier below - 1. the errors grow at every step. because 
m is negative the errors change sign-the 

cobweb goes outward. 

the second column shows convergence with m = .018. it takes one genuine newton 

step, then c is fixed. after n steps the error is closely proportional  to mn = (.018)"- 
that is "linear convergence'' with a good multiplier. 

the  third  column  shows  the  "quadratic  convergence"  of  newton's  method. 
multiplying the error by  m is more  attractive than  ever, because m + 0.  in fact  m 
itself is proportional  to the error, so at each step the error is squared. problem 3.8.31 
will show that (error),.  , <  error):. this squaring carries us from 
to 
lo-'  to "machine  e" 
in three steps. the number of  correct digits is doubled at every 
step as newton converges.

note  1  the choice c = 1 produces x,+,  = x,  - f (x,).  this is  "successive  substitu- 
tion."  the equation f (x) = 0 is  rewritten as x = x - f (x), and each x,  is substituted 
back  to produce x,,  , . iteration with c = 1 does not always fail! 
note 2  newton's  method is successive substitution for f / f ', not f .  then m x 0. 

note 3  edwards and penney happened to choose the same example 2x = cos x. but 
they cleverly wrote it as x,  + , = 4 cos x,,  which has if' i = 14 sin xi< 1. this iteration 
fits into our family with c = i ,  and it succeeds. we asked earlier if  its limit is $(.7391). 
no, it is x* = .45o. .. . 

3  applications of the derivative 

note  4  the choice c = l/f ' ( x o )  is "modified newton."  after  one step of  newton's 
method,  c  is fixed. the steps are quicker,  because they don't  require  a new ff(x,). 
but we need more steps. millions of dollars are spent on newton's  method, so speed 
is important. in all its forms, f (x) = 0 is the central problem  of  computing.

3.7  newton's method (and chaos) 

the equation to be  solved is f (x) =0. its solution x* is the point where the graph 
crosses the x axis. figure 3.22 shows x* and a starting guess x,.  our goal is to come 
as close as possible to x*, based  on the information f (x,)  and f  '(xo). 

section 3.6 reached newton's formula for x, (the next guess). we now do that directly. 
what  do we  see at x,?  the graph has height f (xo) and  slope ft(x0). we  know 
where we  are, and which  direction the curve is going. we  don't  know if  the curve 
bends (we don't  have f "). the best  plan is to follow  the tangent line, which uses all 
the information we  have. 

newton replaces f (x) by  its linear approximation (= tangent approximation): 

we want the left side to be zero. the best we  can do is to make the right side zero! 
the tangent line crosses the axis at x,, while the curve crosses at x*. the new guess 
x, comes from f(x,)  +f '(xo)(xl - x,)  = 0.dividing by f '(xo) and solving for x, ,this 
is step 1 of  newton's  method: 

at  this  new  point, compute f(x, ) and f'(x,  )-the  height and slope at x, . they 
give a new  tangent line, which crosses at x2. at  every step  we  want f  (x, + ,) = 0 and 
we  settle for  f  (x,) +f '(x,)(x,+ ,- x,)  =0.after  dividing by  f '(x,),  the formula for 
x,  + ,is newton's  method.

linear  approximation  involves  three  numbers.  they  are  ax  (across) and  af  (up)
and  the slope  f'(x). if we  know  two  of those numbers,  we  can  estimate  the  third.  it
is  remarkable  to  realize  that calculus  has  now  used  all  three  calculations--they  are
the key  to this subject:

1.  estimate the slope f'(x) from af/ax
2.  estimate the change af from f'(x) ax
3.  estimate the  change ax  from af/f'(x)

(section  2.1)
(section 3.1)
(newton's method)

the  desired  af is  -f(x,).  formula  (3) is exactly  ax =  -f(x,)/f'(x,).

b.
newton's  method  is  a  quick  way  to  find  square  roots-probably  built  into  your
calculator.  the slope  is f'(x,) =  2x,,  and  formula  (3) for  the  new  guess  becomes

this  simplifies  to x, +1 =   (x, + b/x,). guess the square root, divide into b,  and average
the  two  numbers. the  ancient  babylonians  had  this  same  idea,  without  knowing
functions  or  slopes.  they  iterated  xn.  = f(x,):

f(x) =

and

the babylonians  did  exactly the  right thing. the slope f' is zero  at the solution, when
x 2 =  b. that  makes  newton's  method  converge  at high  speed.  the convergence  test
is  if'(x*)i <  1. newton  achieves  f'(x*)= 0-which  is superconvergence.

3.7  newton's method (and chaos) 

to find a,start the iteration xn+ ,= f(xn+ 4/xn) at xo = 1. then x, = f(1 + 4): 

the wrong decimal is twice as far out at each step. the error is squared. subtracting 
x* = 2 from both  sides of  x , + ~= f(xn) gives an error equation which displays that 
square: 

this is  (error).,  ,e  $(error):. 

it explains the speed of  newton's  method. 

remark 1  you  can't  start this iteration at xo = 0. the first step computes 410  and 
blows up.  figure 3.22a  shows why-the 
tangent  line at zero is horizontal.  it will 
never cross the axis. 
remark 2  starting at x,  = - 1, newton converges to  -f i  instead of  + f i  that 
is the other x*. often it is difficult to predict which x* newton's  method will choose. 
around every solution is a "basin  of attraction,"  but other parts of the basin may be 
far away. numerical experiments are needed, with many starts x,.  finding basins of 
attraction was one of  the problems that led to fractals. 

example 2  solve - - a = 0 to find x* = - without dividing by  a. 

1 
x

a 

here f (x)= (llx) - a. newton uses f '(x) = - 1/x2. surprisingly, we  don't  divide: 

do these iterations converge? i will take a = 2 and aim for x* = f.subtracting 4from 
both sides of (7) changes the iteration into the error equation: 

x ~ + ~ = ~ x .

- ~ x ~

becomes  ~ ~ + , - i = - 2 ( x . - i ) ~ .  

(8) 

at  each  step  the error  is  squared.  this is  terrific if  (and  only  if) you  are  close to 
x* = ). otherwise squaring a large error and multiplying by  -2 is not good: 

the algebra in problem  18 confirrhs those experiments. there is fast convergence if 
0 < xo < 1. there is divergence if  x,  is negative or xo > 1. the tangent line goes to a 
negative x, . after that figure 3.22 shows a long trip backwards. 

in the previous section we  drew f(x). the iteration xn+, = f(xn) converged to the 
45" line, where x* = f(x*). in this section we  are drawing f (x). now x* is the point 
on the axis where f (x*) = 0. 

to  repeat: it is f(x*) = 0 that  we  aim for. but  it is the slope ff(x*) that decides 
whether we  get  there.  example 2 has  f(x) = 2x - 2x2. the fixed  points  are x* = f 
(our solution) and x* = 0 (not attractive). the slopes f' (x*) are zero (typical newton) 
and 2 (typical repeller). the key  to newton's  method is ff= 0 at the solution: 

the slope of  f(x)= x -- is  (f'w2 

f '(x) 

"(x).  then ff(x) = 0 when f (x)= 0.

3  applications of the derfvative 

the examples x2 = b and  l/x = a show fast convergence or failure. in chapter 13, 
and in reality, newton's  method  solves much harder equations. here i am going to 
choose a third example that came from pure curiosity about what might happen. the 
results are absolutely amazing. the equation is x2 = - 1. 
example 3  what happens to newton's method ifyou ask it to solve f  (x) = x2 + 1 = o? 
the only solutions are the imaginary numbers x* = i and x* = - i.  there is no real 
square root  of  -1.  newton's  method  might as well  give up.  but  it has  no  way  to 
know  that!  the  tangent  line still crosses the axis at a new  point  x,,,  , even  if  the 
curve y = x2 + 1 never crosses. equation (5) still gives the iteration for b = - 1: 

the x's  cannot approach i or  - i (nothing is imaginary). so what do they do? 

the starting guess xo = 1 is interesting. it is followed by  x, = 0. then x2 divides 
by zero and blows up. i expected other sequences to go to infinity. but the experiments 
showed something different (and mystifying). when x,  is large, x,,, 
is less than half 
as large. after x,  = 10 comes x,,  ,= i(10 - &)= 4.95.  after much indecision and a 
long wait,  a number  near  zero eventually appears. then  the  next  guess divides by 
that small number and goes far out again. this reminded me of  "chaos." 

it is  tempting  to retreat  to ordinary examples, where newton's  method  is  a big 
success.  by  trying exercises from the book  or equations of  your  own, you  will  see 
that  the fast  convergence to $ is  very  typical.  the function  can  be  much  more 
complicated than x2 - 4 (in practice it certainly is). the iteration for 2x = cos x was 
in the previous section, and the error was squared at every step. if  newton's method 
starts close to x*, its convergence is overwhelming. that has to be the main point of 
this section: follow the tangent line. 
instead of  those good functions, may i stay with this strange example x2 + 1 = o? 
it is not so predictable, and maybe not so important, but somehow it is more interest- 
ing. there is no real solution x*, and newton's method x,,,  = +(x, - llx,)  bounces 
around. we will now discover x,. 

a formula for  x, 

the key  is an exercise from trigonometry  books.  most  of  those problems just  give 
practice with sines and cosines, but this one exactly fits +(x, - llx,): 

in the left equation, the common denominator is 2 sin 8 cos 8 (which is sin 28). the 
numerator  is  cos2 0 - sin2 8  (which  is  cos 28).  replace  cosinelsine  by  cotangent, 
and the identity says this: 

if  xo = cot 8 

then  x,  = cot 28. 

then  x2 = cot 48. 

then  x,  = cot 2" 8. 

this is  the  formula.  our points  are  on  the  cotangent  curve.  figure 3.23  starts from 
xo = 2 = cot 8, and every iteration doubles the angle. 

example a  the sequence xo = 1, x, = 0, x2 = m matches the cotangents of ;n/4,;n/2, 
and n. this sequence blows up because x,  has a division by  xl = 0.

fig. 3.23  newton's method for x2 + 1 =0.iteration gives x,  =cot 2"o. 

example b  the sequence i/&,  -1/fi,i/&  matches the cotangents of n/3,2n/3, 
and 4~13. this sequence cycles forever  because xo = x2 = x,  = . . . . 

example c  start with a large xo (a small 8). then x,  is about half  as large (at 20). 
eventually one of  the angles 4 8,8 8, ... hits on a large cotangent, and the x's  go far 
out again. this is typical. examples a  and b were special, when 8/n was  or 3. 

what we have here is chaos. the x's  can't  converge. they are strongly repelled by 
all points. they  are also extremely sensitive to the  value of  8. after  ten  steps 0 is 
multiplied by  2''  = 1024. the starting angles 60" and 61" look close, but  now they 
are different by  1024". if  that were a multiple of  18w, the cotangents would  still be 
close. in fact the xlo's are 0.6 and 14. 

this chaos in mathematics is also seen in nature. the most familiar example is the 
weather,  which  is much  more delicate than  you  might  think.  the headline "fore- 
casting pushed too far"  appeared in science (1989). the article said that the snow- 
balling of small errors destroys the forecast after six days. we can't follow the weather 
equations for a month-the 
flight of a plane can change everything. this is a revolu- 
tionary idea, that a simple rule can lead to answers that are too sensitive to compute. 
we  are  accustomed  to  complicated  formulas  (or  no  formulas).  we  are  not 
accustomed to innocent-looking formulas like cot 2" 8, which are absolutely hopeless 
after  100 steps. 

chaos from a  parabola 

now i get to tell you about new mathematics. first i will change the iteration x,+ ,= 
4(xn- llx,) into one that is even simpler. by switching from x to z = l/(l + x2), each 
new z turns out to involve only the old z  and z2: 

this is  the most famous  quadratic iteration in  the  world. there are books  about it, 
and problem 28 shows where it comes from. our formula for x,  leads to z,:

3 applicaiions of the derhrcrhve 

the sine is just as unpredictable as the cotangent, when 2"8gets large. the new thing 
is to locate this quadratic as the last member (when a = 4) of  the family 

example 2 happened to be the middle member a = 2,  converging to ). i would like 
to give a brief  and very optional report on this iteration, for different a's. 
.the general principle is to start with a number zo between 0 and  1, and compute 
z, ,z2, z3, . .. . it is fascinating to watch the behavior change as a increases.  you can 
see it on your  own computer. here we describe some things to look for. all  numbers 
stay between 0 and 1 and they may approach a limit. that happens when a is small: 

for 0 < a < 1 the z,  approach z* = 0 
for  1 < a < 3 the z,  approach z* = (a - l)/a 

those  limit  points  are the  solutions  of  z = f(z). they  are  the  fixed  points  where 
z* = az* - a(z*)'.  but  remember  the  test  for  approaching  a  limit:  the slope at z* 
cannot  be  larger  than  one.  here  f = az - az2 has  f' = a - 2az.  it is  easy  to  check 
if'i < 1 at the limits predicted above. the hard  problem-sometimes 
is to predict what happens above a = 3. our case is a = 4. 

the z's  cannot approach a limit when ift(z*)l> 1. something has to happen, and 

impossible-

there are at least three possibilities: 

the z,'s  can cycle or jill the whole interval (0,l) or approach a cantor set. 

i start with a random number zo, take  100 steps, and write down steps 101 to 105: 

the  first  column  is  converging to  a  "2-cycle."  it  alternates  between  x = 342 and 
y = .452. those satisfy y = f(x) and  x = f(y) = f(f(x)). if  we  look  at  a double step 
when a = 3.4,  x and y are fixed points of the double iteration z , + ~= f(f(z,)). when 
a increases past  3.45, this cycle becomes unstable. 

at  that point  the period  doublesfrom  2 to 4. with a = 3.5 you see a "4-cycle"  in 
the table-it 
repeats after four steps. the sequence bounces from 375 to .383 to 327 
to so1 and back  to 375. this cycle must be attractive or we would not see it. but it 
also becomes unstable as a increases. next comes an 8-cycle, which is stable in a little 
window (you could compute it) around a = 3.55.  the cycles are stable for  shorter and 
shorter intervals of a's. those stability windows are reduced by the feigenbaum shrink- 
ing factor  4.6692.. .. cycles  of  length  16 and  32  and  64  can  be  seen  in  physical 
experiments, but they are all unstable before a = 3.57.  what happens then? 

the  new  and  unexpected  behavior  is  between  3.57  and  4.  down  each  line  of 
figure 3.24, the computer has plotted the values of zlool to z2000-omitting  the first 
thousand  points  to  let  a  stable  period  (or  chaos) become  established. no  points 
appeared in the big white wedge. i don't  know why. in the window for period 3, you

see only three 2's.  period 3 is followed by 6, 12,24, ... . there is period doubling at the 
end of  every window (including all the windows that are too small to see). you  can 
reproduce this figure by iterating zn+ ,= azn- azz from any zo and plotting the results. 

cantor sets and fracials 

i can't tell what happens at a = 3.8. there may be a stable cycle of some long period. 
the z's  may  come close  to every  point  between  0 and  1. a third  possibility  is  to 
approach a very thin limit set, which looks like the famous cantor set: 

to construct the cantor set, divide [o,l]  into three pieces and remove the open 
interval (4,3). then remove (&,5) and (&#) from what  remains. at  each step 
take out the middle thirds. the points that are left form the cantor set. 

all  the endpoints 3, f, 6, 4, ... are in the set. so is $ (problem 42). nevertheless the 
lengths of  the removed intervals add to  1 and  the cantor set has  "measure  zero." 
what  is  especially  striking is  its self-similarity: between  0  and  you  see  the  same 
cantor set three times smaller. from 0 to 6 the cantor set is there again, scaled down 
by 9. every section, when blown up, copies the larger picture. 

.

fractals  that self-similarity is typical of  a fractal.  there is an infinite sequence of 
scales.  a mathematical  snowflake starts  with  a  triangle  and  adds  a  bump  in  the 
middle of  each  side. at  every  step the  bumps lengthen the  sides by  413.  the final 
boundary is self-similar, like an infinitely long coastline. 

the word "fractal"  comes from fractional dimension. the snowflake boundary has 
dimension larger than  1 and  smaller than  2.  the cantor set has dimension larger 
than 0 and smaller than  1. covering an ordinary line segment with circles of  radius 
r would take clr circles. for fractals it takes c/rd circles-and  d is the dimension. 

3 applications of the derivative 

fig. 3.25  cantor set (middle thirds removed). fractal snowflake (infinite boundary). 

our iteration  zn+ , = 42,  - 42:  has a = 4, at the end of  figure 3.24. the sequence 
z,,  z,, ... goes everywhere and nowhere.  its behavior  is chaotic, and statistical tests 
find no pattern. for all practical  purposes the numbers are random. 

think  what  this  means  in  an  experiment  (or the  stock  market).  if  simple rules 
produce chaos, there is absolutely no way to predict the results. no measurement can 
ever be sufficiently accurate.  the newspapers  report  that  pluto's  orbit is chaotic- 
even  though  it  obeys  the  law  of  gravity.  the motion  is  totally  unpredictable  over 
long times. i don't  know  what  that does for astronomy (or astrology). 

the  most  readable  book  on  this  subject  is  gleick's  best-seller chaos:  making a 
new  science. the most  dazzling books are the beauty of  fractals and  the science 
of  fractal  images, in which  peitgen  and richter  and  saupe show photographs that 
have been  in  art museums around  the world.  the most original books are mandel- 
brot's  fractals and fractal  geometry. our cover has a fractal from figure 13.1 1. 

we  return to friendlier problems  in which calculus is not helpless. 

newton's method vs.  secant  method: calculator  programs 

the hard part  of  newton's  method  is to find df  ldx. we  need it for the slope of  the 
tangent  line.  but  calculus  can  approximate  by  aflax-using 
the  values  of  f(x) 
already computed at x,  and x,  - , . 
the secant method follows the secant line instead of  the tangent line: 

secant: 

x,+,=x,- 

f (x,  where 
(af /ax)n 

af 

-f(xn)-f(xn-1) 

(g)fi- 

xn-xn-1 

(13) 

the secant  line connects the  two latest  points  on the  graph of f(x).  its equation is 
y - f (x,) = (af /ax)(x - x,).  set  y = 0  to  find  equation  (13) for  the  new  x = xn + , , 
where the line crosses the axis. 

prediction: three secant steps are about as good as two newton steps. both should 
give  four  times  as  many  correct  decimals:  (error) -, ( e r r ~ r ) ~ .  probably  the  secant 
method is also chaotic for x2 + 1 = 0. 

these newton  and secant programs are for the ti-8 1. place the formula for f (x) 
in  slot  y 1 and  the  formula  for  f '(x) in  slot  y 2 on  the  y  = function  edit  screen.

interval). in other words it relates df /dx to af /ax. calculus depends on this connec-

tion,  which we  saw first for  velocities.  if the average  velocity  is 75,  is  there a moment
when  the  instantaneous  velocity  is  75?

without  more  information,  the  answer  to  that question  is  no.  the  velocity  could
be  100  and  then  50-averaging  75  but  never  equal  to  75.  if  we  allow  a jump  in
velocity,  it  can  jump  right  over  its  average.  at  that  moment  the velocity  does  not
exist.  (the distance function  in figure  3.26a  has no derivative  at x =  1.)  we  will take
away  this cheap  escape  by  requiring  a derivative  at all  points  inside  the interval.

in  figure 3.26b  the  distance  increases  by  150  when  t  increases  by  2. there  is  a
derivative  df/dt  at  all  interior  points  (but  an  infinite  slope  at  t = 0).  the  average
velocity  is

75.

the  conclusion of the  theorem is  that df/dt =  75  at some point inside the  interval.
there  is  at least  one  point where  f'(c) = 75.

this  is  not a constructive  theorem.  the  value  of c is  not known.  we don't  find  c,

we just  claim  (with proof)  that  such  a point  exists.

3m  mean  value  theorem  suppose f(x) is  continuous  in  the  closed  interval
a < x < b and  has a  derivative  everywhere  in the  open  interval  a < x  < b. then

;f(b) -f(a) 
f::

'(c)  at some  point a < c < b.(1)

the  left  side  is  the  average  slope  af/ax.  it  equals  df/dx  at  c.  the  notation  for  a
closed  interval  [with  endpoints]  is  [a, b].  for  an  open  interval  (without  endpoints)
we  write (a, b).  thus  f'  is  defined  in  (a, b),  and  f  remains  continuous  at  a  and  b.  a
derivative  is  allowed  at those  endpoints  too-but  the theorem  doesn't  require  it.

the  proof  is  based  on  a  special  case-when  f(a) =  0  and  f(b) = 0.  suppose  the
function starts at zero and returns to  zero. the  average  slope  or  velocity  is  zero.  we
have  to  prove  that  f'(c)= 0  at  a  point  in  between.  this  special  case  (keeping  the
assumptions  on  f(x)) is  called  rolle's theorem.

geometrically,  if f  goes  away  from zero  and comes  back,  then f'  = 0 at the turn.

3n  rolle's  theorem  suppose f(a) =f(b)= 0 (zero at  the  ends).  then  f'(c) =0
at some  point  with  a < c < b.

proof  at  a point  inside  the interval  where  f(x) reaches  its maximum  or minimum,
df/dx must be  zero.  that  is an  acceptable  point  c.  figure  3.27a shows  the  difference
between f= 0 (assumed  at  a and  b)  and  f'  = 0 (proved  at c).

3  applications of the derivative 

small problem: the maximum could be reached at the ends a and b, iff (x) < 0 in 
between. at  those endpoints dfldx  might not be zero. but in that case the minimum 
is reached at an interior  point  c, which  is equally acceptable. the key  to our proof 
is that a continuous function  on  [a, b] reaches its maximum and minimum. this is the 
extreme value  theorem.? 

it is ironic that rolle himself did not believe the logic behind calculus. he may not 
have  believed  his  own theorem! probably he didn't  know what it meant-the 
lan-
guage of "evanescent quantities" (newton) and "infinitesimals"  (leibniz) was exciting 
but frustrating. limits were close but never reached. curves had infinitely many flat 
sides. rolle didn't  accept that reasoning, and what was really serious, he didn't accept 
the conclusions. the acadkmie des sciences had to stop his battles (he fought against 
ordinary  mathematicians,  not  newton  and  leibniz).  so he  went  back  to  number 
theory, but  his special case when f (a) =f (b) = 0 leads directly to the big one.

fig. 3.27  rolle's theorem is when f(a) =f(b) = 0 in the mean value theorem. 

proof of the mean value theorem  we are looking for a point where dfldx  equals 
aflax.  the idea is  to  tilt the graph back  to rolle's  special case (when af  was zero). 
in figure 3.27b, the distance f(x) between the curve and the dotted secant line comes 
from subtraction: 

at  a and b,  this distance is f(a) = f(b) = 0. rolle's  theorem applies to f(x). there is 
an interior  point  where ff(c) = 0. at  that point  take  the derivative of  equation (2): 
0 =f '(c) - (af /ax). the desired point  c is found, proving the theorem. 
example 1  the function f (x) = 6goes from zero at x = 0 to ten  at x = 100. its 
average slope  is  af/ax  = 10/100. the  derivative ff(x) = 1 / 2 6  exists  in  the  open 
interval  (0, loo), even  though  it  blows  up  at  the  end  x = 0.  by  the  mean  value 
theorem there must be a point  where  10/100 =f '(c) = 1/2&  that point is c = 25. 
the  truth  is  that  nobody  cares about  the  exact value  of  c.  its existence is  what 
matters.  notice  how  it  affects  the  linear  approximation  f (x)zf (a) + f '(a)(x - a), 
which was basic to this chapter. close becomes exact (  z becomes  =  ) when f '  is 
computed at c instead of  a: 

?if  f ( x )  doesn't  reach  its  maximum  m,  then  1/(m-f ( x ) )would  be  continuous  but  also 
approach infinity. essential fact: a  continuous function  on  [a, b] cannot approach infinity. 

3.8  the  mean  value  theorem  and  l'h6pital's rule

example  2  the  function  f(x)= sin x  starts  from  f(0)= 0.  the  linear  prediction
(tangent line) uses  the slope  cos 0 =  1. the exact  prediction  uses  the  slope  cos c at an
unknown  point between  0 and  x:

(approximate) sin  x e  x 

(exact) sin  x = (cos c)x. 

(4)

the  approximation  is  useful,  because  everything  is computed  at x = a =  0. the exact
formula  is  interesting,  because  cos c < 1  proves  again  that  sin  x < x.  the  slope  is
below  1, so  the  sine  graph  stays  below  the 450  line.

example  3 

if  f'(c) = 0 at all points in an interval then f(x) is constant.

proof  when  f'  is  everywhere  zero,  the  theorem  gives  af= 0.  every  pair  of points
has f(b) =f(a). the  graph  is  a  horizontal  line.  that  deceptively  simple  case  is  a  key
to  the  fundamental  theorem  of calculus.

most applications  of af=f'(c)ax  do  not end up  with a number. they  end up  with
another  theorem (like this one).  the goal is to connect derivatives  (local) to differences
(global).  but the  next  application-l'hopital's rule-manages  to produce  a  number
out  of 0/0.

l'h6pital's  rule

when  f(x) and g(x)  both approach zero,  what happens to their ratio f(x)/g(x)?

f(x) 
g(x)

x2  
x 

or 

sin  x 
x 

or 

x-  sin x 
1 - cos  x 

all  become 

0
-
0

at  x = 0.

since  0/0  is  meaningless,  we  cannot  work  separately  with  f(x)  and  g(x).  this  is  a
"race toward zero,"  in  which  two  functions  become  small  while  their ratio  might  do
anything.  the problem  is  to  find  the  limit  of f(x)/g(x).

one  such  limit  is  already  studied.  it  is  the  derivative! af/ax  automatically  builds

in  a  race  toward  zero,  whose  limit  is df/dx:

f(x) -f(a) 

0  but 

x  - a-- 0 

lim f(-f(a)f'(a). 
x--a 

x-a

(5)

the  idea  of i'h6pital  is  to  use  f'/g' to  handle  f/g. the  derivative  is  the  special  case
g(x) = x - a, with  g' =  1. the  rule  is followed  by  examples  and  proofs.

this is  not  the quotient rule! the derivatives  of f(x) and  g(x) are  taken  separately.
geometrically,  i'h6pital  is  saying  that when functions go to  zero their slopes  control
their size.  an  easy  case is  f= 6(x - a) and g =  2(x - a). the  ratio  f/g is  exactly  6/2,

controlled by  6 and 2. 

the next figure shows the same limit 612, when the curves are tangent to the lines. 
that picture is the key to 1'hdpital's  rule. 
generally the limit off /g can be a finite number l or + oo or  - oo.(also the limit 
point  x = a can represent a finite number or  + oo or  - oo. we  keep it finite.) the 
one absolute requirement is that f (x) and g(x) must separately approach zero-we 
insist  on 010.  otherwise there is no  reason why  equation  (6) should be  true.  with 
f (x) = x and g(x) = x - 1, don't  use l'h6pital: 

ordinary ratios approach lim f (x) divided by  lim g(x). lyh6pital enters only for 010.

the reason behind l'h6pital's  rule  is that the following fractions  are the same: 

that is just  algebra; the limit hasn't  happened yet. the factors x - a cancel, and the 
numbers f (a) and g(a) are zero by  assumption. now take the limit on the right side 
of  (7) as x approaches a. 

what  normally happens is  that  one part  approaches f '  at x = a. the other part 
approaches g'(a). we  hope gl(a) is not zero. in this case we  can divide one limit by 

3.8  the  mean  value  theorem  and  l'h8pltal's rule

the other  limit. that  gives  the "normal"  answer

f(x) 
lim  (x)  = limit  of (7) -
x-a g(x) 

f'(a)
'(a) 
g'(a)

(8)

this  is  also l'h6pital's  answer.  when  f'(x) -+f'(a) and  separately  g'(x) - g'(a), his
overall  limit is f'(a)/g'(a). he published  this rule in the first textbook  ever written  on
differential  calculus.  (that was  in  1696-the  limit  was  actually  discovered  by  his
teacher  bernoulli.)  three  hundred  years  later  we  apply  his  name  to  other  cases
permitted  in (6),  when f'/g' might  approach  a limit even if the separate  parts do not.
to prove  this more general form of l'h6pital's  rule,  we need a more general  mean
value  theorem.  i  regard the  discussion  below  as  optional  in  a  calculus  course
(but required  in a  calculus  book).  the important  idea  already  came  in equation (8).

remark  the  basic "indeterminate" is  oo - oo.  if f(x)  and  g(x)  approach  infinity,
anything  is  possible  for  f(x) - g(x).  we  could  have  x2  - x  or  x - x2  or (x + 2) - x.
their limits  are  oo  and  - 00  and 2.

at  the next  level  are  0/0  and  co/co  and  0  oo.  to find  the limit  in  these cases,  try
l'h6pital's  rule.  see  problem  24  when  f(x)/g(x)  approaches  oo/oo.  when  f(x) - 0
and g(x) -+ co,  apply  the 0/0  rule  to f(x)/(1/g(x)).

the  next  level  has 00  and  1"  and  oo.  those  come  from  limits  of f(x)9(x).  if f(x)
approaches  0,  1, or  cc  while g(x) approaches  0,  oo,  or 0, we  need  more  information.
a really  curious  example  is  x l/in  , which  shows  all three  possibilities 00  and  1"  and
00o.  this  function  is  actually  a constant! it equals  e.

to  go  back  down  a  level,  take  logarithms.  then  g(x) in f(x) returns  to  0/0  and

0 - cc  and l'h6pital's  rule.  but  logarithms  and  e have  to wait  for  chapter 6.

the  generalized  mean  value  theorem

the mvt  can  be extended  to  two functions. the extension  is  due to cauchy,  who
cleared  up  the whole  idea  of limits.  you  will  recognize  the  special  case  g = x  as  the
ordinary  mean  value  theorem.

3q  generalized  mvt 
differentiable on (a, b),  there is a point a < c < b where

if  f(x)  and  g(x)  are  continuous  on  [a, b]  and

[f(b) -f(a)]g'(c) =  [g(b)  - g(a)jf'(c). 

(9)

the  proof comes  by  constructing  a new  function  that has  f(a)= f(b):

f(x) = [f(b) -f(a)]g(x)  - [g(b) - g(a)]f(x).

the  ordinary  mean  value  theorem  leads  to f'(c)= 0-which  is  equation (9).

application 1  (proof of l'h6pital's  rule)  the rule deals with f(a)/g(a) = 0/0. insert-
ing  those zeros  into equation  (9) leaves  f(b)g'(c) = g(b)f'(c). therefore

f(b) 
g(b) 

f'(c)
g'(c)

-

(10)

as  b  approaches  a, so does  c. the point  c is  squeezed  between  a and b.  the limit  of
equation (10)  as  b  -+ a  and  c -+ a  is l'h6pital's  rule.

3 applications of the derlvathre 

(error in linear approximation)  section 3.2  stated that the distance 
application 2 
between a curve and its tangent line grows like ( x - a)'.  now we can prove this, and 
find out more. linear approximation is 

f ( x )  =f (a) +f'(a)(x - a)+ error e(x). 

(11) 
the pattern suggests an error involving f " ( x )  and ( x - a)'.  the key  example f = x2 
shows the need for a factor  (to cancel f"  = 2). the e m  in linear approximation is 

e(x)=if"(c)(x-a)'  with 

a < c < x .  

(12) 

key idea  compare the error e(x)to ( x- a)2.both are zero at x = a: 

e = f ( x ) - f ( a ) - f l ( a ) ( x - a )  
g = ( x - a)' 

e l = f l ( x ) - f t ( a )  
g'  = 2(x - a) 

etl=f"(x) 
gn = 2 

the  generalized  mean  value  theorem  finds  a  point  c  between  a  and  x  where 
e(x)/g(x)= el(c)/g'(c).this  is  equation  (10) with  different  letters.  after  checking 
el(a)=gl(a)= 0, apply  the  same  theorem  to  et(x)and  gt(x). it  produces a  point  c 
between  a and c-certainly  between a and x-where 

el(c)- em(c) 
--- 
gl(c)  g"(4 

e(x)- et'(c)
and therefore  ---
g(x)  gt'(c)' 

with  g = ( x - a)'  and  g"  = 2  and  e"  =f  ", the  equation  on  the  right  is  e(x)= 
9f  "(c)(x- a)'.  the  error  formula  is  proved.  a  very  good  approximation  is 
4f "(a)(x - a)'. 

example 7 

f ( x )  = j;near a = 100:  je;e 

10 + (a)2 + 1(&) 

2'.

that last term predicts e = -.0005. the actual error is j102  - 10.1  = - .000496.

4.1  the  chain rule

-

you  remember  that  the  derivative  of f(x)g(x) is  not  (df/dx)(dg/dx).  the derivative 
of  sin x  times  x2 is  not  cos x  times  2x.  the  product  rule  gave  two  terms,  not  one 
term.  but  there  is  another  way  of  combining the  sine function f and  the  squaring 
function  g  into a  single  function.  the derivative  of  that  new  function  does involve 
the cosine times 2x (but with a certain twist). we will first explain the new function, 
and then find the "chain  rule"  for its derivative. 

may  i  say here that  the chain rule is important. it is easy  to learn, and you  will 
use it  often. i see it as the third  basic way  to find derivatives of  new functions from 
derivatives  of  old  functions.  (so far  the  old  functions  are xn, sin x,  and cos x.  still 
ahead  are ex and log x.)  when f and g  are added and multiplied,  derivatives come 
from the sum rule and product  rule. this section combines f and g in a third  way. 

the  new function  is  sin(x2)-the 

sine of  x2. it  is  created  out  of  the  two  original 
functions:  if  x = 3  then  x2 = 9  and  sin(x2) = sin 9.  there is  a  "chain"  of  functions, 
combining sin x  and  x2 into the composite  function  sin(x2). you  start with  x,  then 
find g(x), then jindf  (g(x)): 

the squaring function gives y = x2. this is g(x). 
the sine function produces z = sin y = sin(x2). this is f(g(x)). 

the "inside function"  g(x) gives y.  this is the input to the "outside function" f(y). that 
is  called  composition.  it  starts with  x  and  ends  with  z.  the composite function  is 
sometimes written fog (the circle shows the difference from an ordinary product fg). 
more often you  will  see f(g(x)): 

other examples are cos 2x and ( 2 ~ ) ~ ,  with g = 2x. on a calculator you  input  x,  then 
push  the "g"  button, then push  the "f"  button: 

from x compute y = g(x) 

from y compute z =f(y). 

there is not a button for every function! but the squaring function and sine function 
are  on  most  calculators,  and  they  are  used  in  that  order.  figure 4.la  shows  how 
squaring will  stretch and squeeze the sine function. 



4.1  the  chaln rule 

that graph of sin x2 is a crazy fm signal (the frequency is modulated). the wave 
goes up and down like sin x, but not at the same places. changing to sin g(x) moves 
the peaks left and right. compare with a product g(x) sin x, which is an am  signal 
(the amplitude is modulated). 
remark  f(g(x))  is  usually  different from  g( f(x)).  the  order  off  and  g  is  usually 
important. for f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x2, the chain in the opposite order g( f(x)) gives 
something different: 

first apply the sine function: y = sin x 
then apply the squaring function: z =(sin x ) ~ .  

that result is often written sin2x, to save on parentheses. it is never written sin x2, 
which is totally different. compare them in figure 4.1.

f(g(x)) is different from g(f(x)).apply g then f,or f  then g. 

example i  the composite functionfig can be deceptive. if g(x) = x3 and fly) = y4, 
how  does f(g(x)) differ from the ordinary product f(x)g(x)? the ordinary product  is 
x7. the chain starts with y = x3, and then z = y4 = x12. the composition of 2t3 and 
y4 gives f(g(x)) = x12. 

example 2 
in  newton's  method,  f(x) is  composed  with  itself.  this  is  iteration. 
every output xn is fed back as input, to find xn + , = f(xn). the example f(x) =f x + 4 
has f(f(x)) =f($x + 4) + 4.  that produces z = &x+ 6. 
the derivative of  f(x) is t .the derivative of  z = f(f(x)) is a, which is f  times f .  
we  multiply derivatives. this is a special case of  the chain rule. 

an  extremely special case is f(x)= x and g(x) = x. the ordinary product is x2. the 
chain f(g(x)) produces only x!  the output from the "identity function"  is g(x) = x.t 
when the second identity function operates on x it produces x again. the derivative 
is  1 times 1. i can give more composite functions in a table:

equals  input: f(g(x)) = x.  these  "inverse functions"  are  in  section 4.3.  the  other 
examples create new functions z(x) and we  want  their derivatives. 

the  derivative of  f(g(x)) 

what is the derivative of  z = sin x2? it is the limit of  azlax. therefore we  look at a 
nearby point  x + ax.  that change in x produces  a change in y = x2-which  moves 
to y + ay  = (x + ax)^.  from  this  change in  y,  there  is  a  change in  z =f(y).  it  is  a 
"domino  effect,"  in which each changed input yields a changed output: ax produces 
ay produces  az. we have to connect  the final az  to the original ax. 

the  key  is  to  write  azlax  as  azlay  times  aylax.  then  let  ax  approach  zero. 

in the limit, dzldx is given by the "chain  rule": 

az  - azay 
----
ax;  ayax 

dz dy 
becomes the chain rule  - = --. 
dydx 

dz 
dx 

(2) 

as ax  goes to zero, the ratio aylax approaches dyldx. therefore ay  must be going 
to zero, and azlay  approaches  dzldy. the limit  of  a  product  is  the product  of  the 
separate limits (end of  quick proof).  we  multiply derivatiues:

i the slope at x  is dfldy (at y) times dg/dx (at x). 

caution  the  chain  rule  does  not  say  that  the  derivative  of  sin x2 is  (cos x)(2x). 
true, cos y is the derivative  of  sin y.  the point  is that  cos y must  be  evaluated at y 
(not at x). we do not want dfldx  at x, we  want  dfldy  at y = x2: 

the derivative of  sin x2 is (cos x2) times (2x). 

(4) 

example 3  if  z =(sin x ) ~  then dzldx = (2 sin x)(cos x). here y = sin x is inside. 

in this  order, z = y2 leads to dzldy = 2y.  it does not  lead to 2x. the inside function 
sin x  produces  dyldx = cos x.  the  answer  is  2y cos x.  we  have  not  yet  found  the 
function whose derivative is 2x cos x.

4.1  the chain rule 

the outside function is z = sin y. the inside function is y = 3x. then dzldy = cos y- 
this is cos 3x, not cos x.  remember the other factor dy/dx = 3. 

i can explain that factor 3, especially if x is switched to t. the distance is z = sin 3t. 
that  oscillates  like  sin t  except  three  times  as fast.  the  speeded-up  function  sin 3t 
completes a  wave  at time  2n/3 (instead  of  2.n). naturally  the  velocity  contains  the 
extra factor  3 from the chain rule. 

example 5  let z =f(y)  = yn. find the derivative of f(g(x)) = [g(x)ln. 
in this case dzldy is nyn-'.  the chain rule multiplies  by dyldx: 

this is the power  rule! it was already  discovered  in section 2.5.  square roots (when 
n = 112) are frequent and important. suppose -y = x2 - 1:

answer 
(dy/dx)(dx/dt). the answer is (1/20)(60) = 3 gallons/hour. 

(gallons/hour) = (gallons/mile) (mileslhour).  the  chain  rule  is  (d y/d t) =

it was here,  over  the chain  rule,  that  the "battle  of  notation"  was won  by  leibniz. 
his notation practically tells you what to do: take the limit  of  each term. (i have to 
mention  that when ax  is approaching zero, it is theoretically possible that ay  might 
hit zero. if that happens, az/ay becomes 010. we have to assign it the correct meaning, 
which is dzldy.) as ax +0,

then azlax approaches f '(y) times gf(x), which is the chain rule (dz/dy)(dy/dx). in the

examples  with  duldx  are extremely  common. i have to ask  you  to accept whatever 
letters may come. what never changes is the key idea-derivative  of  outside function 
times derivative of  inside function. 

4  derivatives by the chain rule 

example 6  the  chain  rule  is  barely  needed  for  sin(x - 1).  strictly  speaking  the 
inside  function  is  u = x - 1.  then  duldx  is just  1 (not  -1). if  y = sin(x - 1) then 
dyldx = cos(x - 1). the graph is shifted and the slope shifts too. 

notice especially: the cosine is computed at x - 1 and not at the unshifted x. 

recognizing f( y) and  g(x) 

a big part of  the chain rule is recognizing the chain. the table started with (x3 + 1)'. 
you look at it for a second. then you see it as us. the inside function is u = x3 + 1. 
with practice this decomposition (the opposite of  composition) gets easy: 

cos (2x + 1) is cos u 

is &  x sin x is  ... (product rule!) 

in calculations,  the careful way is to write down all the functions: 

z = cos u  u = 2x + 1  dzldx = (- sin u)(2) = - 2 sin (2x + 1). 

the quick way is to keep in your mind  "the  derivative of  what's  inside."  the slope 
of  cos(2x + 1) is  -sin(2x + i), times  2 from  the  chain rule. the derivative of  2x + 1 
is remembered-without 
example 7  sin j& is a chain of  z = sin y, y = &,u = 1 - x (three functions). 
with that triple chain you will have the hang of  the chain rule: 

z or u or f or g. 

the  derivative  of  sin f i is (cos j k )

 
(2&) 

(-

this is (dz/dy)(dy/du)(du/dx). evaluate them at the right places y, u, x. 

finally there is the question of  second derivatives. the chain rule gives dzldx as a 

product, so d 2 z / d ~ 2  needs the product rule: 

dz  - dz dy 
-- -- leadsto 
dx  dydx 

----+-
d2z - dz d2y 
d  (dz)  dy
- -
dx2  dydx2  dx  dy  dx' 

that last term needs the chain rule again. it becomes d2z/dy2 times ( d ~ / d x ) ~ .  

example 8  the  derivative  of  sin x2  is  2x cos x2.  then  the  product  rule  gives 
d2z/dx2= 2 cos x2 - 4x2 sin x2. in this case ytt = 2 and (yt)2 = 4x2.

4.2  implicit differentiation and related rates 

we  start  with  the  equations  xy = 2 and  y5+ xy = 3.  as  x  changes,  these  y's  will 
change-to  keep (x, y) on the curve.  we want to know dy/dx at a typical point.  for 
xy = 2 that is no trouble, but the slope of  y5+ xy = 3 requires a new idea. 

is a hyperbola. at  x = 2 the slope is  -214 = -112. 

in the first case, solve for y = 2/x and take its derivative: dy/dx = - 2/x2.the curve 
the problem  with  y5+ xy = 3 is that it can't  be  solved for y.  galois proved that 
there  is  no  solution  formula  for  fifth-degree  equations.?  the function  y(x)  cannot 
be  given  explicitly.  all  we  have  is  the  implicit  definition  of  y,  as  a  solution  to 
y5 + xy = 3.  the point  x = 2,  y = 1  satisfies the equation  and lies on the curve, but 
how to find dyldx? 
this  section answers that question. it is a  situation that  often occurs.  equations 
like sin y + sin x = 1  or y sin y = x (maybe even  sin y = x) are difficult or impossible 
to solve directly for y. nevertheless we can find dyldx at any point. 
the way  out is implicit differentiation. work  with  the equation as it  stands. find 
the x derivative of every term in y5 + xy = 3. that includes the constant term 3, whose 
derivative is zero. 

example i  the power rule for y5 and the product  rule for xy yield 

now  substitute the typical point  x = 2 and y = 1, and solve for dyldx:

this  is  implicit  differentiation (id), and  you  see  the  idea:  include  dyldx  from  the 
chain rule, even if  y is not known explicitly as a function of  x.

again  dy/dx  =  - 1/7.  all these  examples  confirm  the  main  point  of the  section:

(implicit  differentiation)  an  equation  f(x,  y) =  0  can  be  differentiated

4b 
directly  by the  chain  rule,  without  solving  for y in terms  of x.

the example  xy = 2,  done implicitly,  gives  x dy/dx + y =  0. the slope  dy/dx is  - y/x.
that  agrees  with  the explicit  slope  - 2/x 2.

id is explained  better  by examples than theory (maybe everything is). the essential

theory can  be  boiled  down to  one idea:  "go  ahead and differentiate."

example 4  find  the  tangent  direction  to  the circle  x 2  +  y2  = 25.
we can  solve  for y  =  +  25 - x2 , or  operate  directly  on  x 2 + y2 = 25:

2x + 2y

compare  with  the  radius,  which  has  slope  y/x.  the  radius  goes  across  x  and  up  y.
the tangent goes  across  - y and  up x.  the slopes multiply  to give (-  x/y)(y/x) =  - 1.
to emphasize  implicit differentiation,  go on  to the second derivative. the top of the

circle  is concave  down,  so  d2y/dx 2  is  negative.  use  the quotient  rule  on  - x/y:

related  rates

there  is a  group  of problems  that has  never  found  a perfect  place  in calculus.  they
seem  to  fit  here-as  applications  of  the  chain  rule.  the  problem  is  to  compute
df/dt,  but  the  odd  thing  is  that  we  are given another derivative dg/dt. to  find  df/dt,
we  need  a  relation  between f  and  g.

the chain  rule is  df/dt = (df/dg)(dg/dt).  here  the variable  is t because that is typical
in applications.  from  the  rate  of change  of g  we find  the rate of change off. this  is
the problem  of related rates, and  examples  will make  the point.

example  5  the  radius  of a  circle  is  growing  by  dr/dt = 7. how  fast  is  the  circum-
ference  growing?  remember  that  c = 27rr  (this relates  c  to  r).

that  is  pretty  basic,  but  its  implications  are  amazing.  suppose  you  want  to  put  a
rope  around  the  earth  that  any  7-footer  can  walk  under.  if the  distance  is  24,000
miles,  what  is  the  additional  length  of the  rope?  answer:  only  147r  feet.

more  realistically,  if two  lanes  on  a  circular  track  are  separated  by  5 feet,  how
much  head  start  should the  outside runner  get? only  10i  feet.  if your  speed  around
a  turn  is  55  and  the  car in the  next  lane  goes  56,  who  wins?  see  problem  14.

we used all information, including z = 5, except for dxldt = 3dyldt. the term 6dyldt

example 7  a  person 2  meters tall walks directly away from a streetlight that is 8 
meters above the  ground.  if  the  person's  shadow is  lengthening at the  rate of  419

solution  draw a figure! you must relate the shadow length s to the distance x  from 
the streetlight. the problem gives dsldt = 419 and asks for dxldt:

there is a remarkable special case of the chain rule. it occurs when f(y)  and g(x) are 
"inverse functions."  that idea is expressed  by  a  very  short  and powerful  equation: 
f(g(x)) = x. here is what that means. 
inverse functions:  start with any input, say x = 5. compute y =g(x), say y = 3. then 
compute f(y),  and the answer must be 5. what one function does, the inverse function 

4.3 

inverse functions and their derhrathres 

undoes.  if  g(5) = 3 then f(3) = 5.  the inverse function f takes the output y back to the 
input x. 
example 1  g(x) = x - 2 and f(y) =y + 2 are inverse functions.  starting with x = 5, 
the  function g  subtracts  2.  that  produces y = 3.  then  the function f adds 2.  that 
brings back x = 5. to say it directly: the inverse of y = x - 2 is x = y + 2. 
example 2  y =g(x) = $(x - 32)  and  x =f(y) = :y  + 32  are  inverse  functions  (for 
temperature). here  x  is degrees fahrenheit  and  y is degrees celsius.  from  x = 32 
(freezing in fahrenheit) you find y = 0 (freezing in celsius). the inverse function takes 
y = 0 back  to x = 32.  figure 4.4 shows how x = 50  f matches y = 10  c. 

notice  that $(x - 32)  subtracts  32 first.  the inverse gy + 32 adds  32  last.  in the 

same way g multiplies last by $ while f multiplies first by 3.

the inverse function  is written f  =g - ' and pronounced  "g  inverse."  it  is not  l/g(x). 
if the demand y is a function of the price x, then the price is a function of the demand. 
those are inverse functions.  their derivatives obey  a fundamental  rule: dyldx  times 
dxldy equals 1. in example 2, dyldx is 519  and dxldy is 915. 

there is another important point. when f and g are applied in the opposite order, 
they still come back to the start. first f adds 2, then g subtracts 2. the chain g( f(y)) = 
(y + 2) - 2 brings back y. iffis the inverse of g then g is the inverse off. the relation 
is completely symmetric, and so is the definition: 
inverse function:  if y = g(x) then x  = g- '(y). i f x  =g- '(y)  then y = g(x). 
the loop in the figure goes from x to y to x. the composition g- '(g(x)) is the "identity 
function."  instead of  a new  point  z it  returns  to the  original  x. this will make  the 
chain  rule particularly  easy-leading 
example 3  y = g(x) = f i  and x =f(y) = y2 are inverse functions. 
starting  from  x = 9 we  find  y = 3.  the  inverse gives  32 = 9.  the  square of  f i  is 
f(g(x)) = x. in the opposite direction, the square root of  y2 is g(f(y)) = y. 
caution  that example does not allow x to be negative. the domain of  g-the 
set 
restricted to x 2 0. this matches the range of g -  '.

the outputs y2 are nonnegative.  with domain of  g = range of  g-',  the equation x = 
(&)2 

is possible and true. the nonnegative  x goes into g and comes out of g-'. 

to (dy/dx)(dx/dy) = 1. 

in this example y is also nonnegative.  you might think we could square anything, 

but y must come back  as the square root of  y2. so y 2 0. 

to summarize: the domain of a function  matches the range of its inverse. the inputs 

to g-'  are the outputs from g. the inputs to g are the outputs from g-'.

zf g(x)= y then solving that equation for  x gives x =g - l(y):

then x =+(y+ 6)  (this is g-'(y)) 
(thisisg-'(y)) 
t h e n x = 1 3  

in practice that is how g-'  is computed: solve g(x) = y.  this is the reason inverses 
are important. every time we  solve an equation we  are computing a value of g- '. 
not  all equations have one solution. not all functions  have inverses. for each y, 
the equation g(x) = y is only allowed to produce one x. that solution is x =g- '(y). 
if  there is a  second  solution, then g-l  will  not  be  a  function-because  a function 
cannot produce two x's  from the same y. 

example 4  there is  more than  one solution to sin x =f.many  angles have  the 
same  sine.  on  the  interval  0 <x <n,  the  inverse  of  y = sin x  is  not  a  function. 
figure 4.5 shows how two x's  give the same y. 

prevent x from passing n/2 and the sine has an inverse. write x = sin- 'y. 
the function g has no  inverse if  two points x1 and x2 give ax,) =g(x2). its inverse 
would have to bring the same y back to x1 and x2. no function can do that; g-'(y) 
cannot equal both xl and x2. there must be only one x for each y. 
to be invertible over an interval, g must be  steadily increasing or steadily decreasing.

it is time for calculus. forgive me for this very humble example. 

example 5  (ordinary multiplication)  the inverse of y =g(x) = 3x is x =f(y) =iy. 
this  shows with  special  clarity  the  rule  for  derivatives: the  slopes dyldx = 3 and 
dxldy =5 multiply  to give  1. this rule  holds for  all inverse functions, even  if  their 
slopes are not constant. it is a crucial application of  the chain rule to the derivative 
of f(g(x)) = x. 

this is the chain rule with a special feature. since f(g(x)) = x, the derivative of  both 
sides  is  1.  if  we  know  g'  we  now  know f'. that  rule  will  be  tested  on  a familiar 
example. in the next section it leads to totally new derivatives.

inverse functlons and their derhrathres 

example 6  the inverse of  y = x3 is x = y1i3. we can find dxldy two ways: 

the equation (dx/dy)(dy/dx) = 1 is not ordinary algebra, but it is true. those deriva- 
tives are limits of fractions. the fractions are (ax/ay)(ay/ax) = 1 and we let ax +0. 

fig. 4.6  graphs of inverse functions: x =i y  is the mirror image of y = 3x. 

before going to new  functions, i want to draw graphs.  figure 4.6 shows y = f i  
and y = 3x.  what is s  ecial is that  the  same  graphs  also show  the  inverse functions. 
the inverse of  y = $is 
x.= y2. the pair x = 4, y = 2 is the same for both.  that is 
the  whole  point  of  inverse functions-if  2 =g(4)  then  4 =g - '(2).  notice  that  the 
graphs go steadily up. 

the only problem is, the graph  of  x =g-'(y)  is on its side. to change the slope 
from  3 to f ,  you  would  have  to  turn  the  figure. after  that  turn  there  is  another 
problem-the  axes don't point to the right and up. you also have to look in a mirror! 
(the typesetter refused to print the letters backward. he thinks it's crazy but it's not .) 
to keep the book in position, and the typesetter in position, we need a better idea. 
the graph of  x = i y  comes from turning the picture  across the 45" line. the y axis 
becomes horizontal and x goes upward. the point (2,6) on the line y = 3x goes into 
the  point  (6,2)  on  the  line  x = fy.  the  eyes  see  a  reflection  across  the  45"  line 
(figure 4.6~). the mathematics sees the same pairs x and y. the special properties of 
g  and g-'  allow  us  to know  two functions-and  draw  two  graphs-at 
the  same 
time.?  the graph of x = g-'(y)  is the mirror image of the graph of y = g(x). 

exponentials and logarithms 

i would  like to  add  two  more  examples of  inverse functions, because  they  are  so 
important. both examples involve the exponential  and the logarithm. one is made up 
of linear pieces that imitate 2"; it appeared in chapter 1. the other is the true function 
2",  which is not yet defined-and 
it' is not going to be defined here. the functions bx 
and  logby are so overwhelmingly important that  they deserve and will get  a whole 
chapter of  the book (at least). but you have to see the graphs. 
each piece. the slopes  1,2,4, .. . equal the heights 1, 2,4, .. . at those special points. 

the slopes in the linear model are powers of  2.  so are the heights y at the start of 

the inverse is a discrete model for the logarithm (to base 2). the logarithm of  1 is 
0,because 2'  = 1. the logarithm of 2 is 1, because 2'  = 2. the logarithm of 2j is the 
exponent j.  thus  the  model  gives  the  correct  x = log2y at  the  breakpoints  y = 
1,2,4, 8, .... the slopes are i,:,  $, 4,  ... because dxldy = l/(dy/dx). 

ti  have  seen graphs with  y=g(x)  and  also y=g-'(x).  for  me that  is  wrong:  it  has  to  be 
x =g-'(y).  if  y =sin x then x =sin-'y. 

4  derlwthres by the chain rule 

the model is good, but the real thing is better. the figure on the right shows the 
true exponential y = 2".  at  x = 0, 1,2, . . . the heights y are the same as before. but 
now the height at x =  is the number 2'12,  which is fi.the height at x = .10 is the 
tenth root  2'/1    = 1.07.... the slope at x = 0 is no  longer  1-it 
is closer to ay/ax = 
.07/. 10. the exact slope is a number c (near .7) that we are not yet prepared to reveal. 
the  special property  of  y = 2"  is  that  the  slope at all points  is  cy.  the  slope  is 

proportional to the function. the exponential solves dyldx = cy. 

now look at the inverse function-the 

logarithm. its graph is the mirror image: 

if  y = zx then x = log,y.  if  2'/1    1.07 then log,  1 .o7  1/10. 

vice versa. the logarithm of 
what the exponential does, the logarithm undoes-and 
2"  is the  exponent  x.  since the exponential starts with  slope c,  the logarithm must 
start with slope l/c. check that numerically. the logarithm of  1.07 is near  1/10. the 
slope is near .10/.07. the beautiful property is that dxldy = llcy.

i have to mention that calculus avoids logarithms to base 2. the reason lies in that

the  derivatives of  those  functions are sensational-they

the  inverse of a chain h(g(x)) 

the functions g(x) = x - 2 and  h(y) = 3y  were easy  to invert. for g-'  we  added 2, 
and for h-'  we divided by 3. now the question is: if  we create the composite function 
z = h(g(x)), or z = 3(x - 2), what is its inverse? 

4.3 

inverse functions and their derivatives 

virtually  all  known  functions  are  created  in  this  way,  from  chains  of  simpler 
functions.  the problem  is to invert a chain using the inverse of each piece.  the answer 
is one of  the fundamental rules  of  mathematics: 

40  the inverse of  z = h(g(x))is a chain of  inverses in the opposite order: 

h- ' is applied first because h was applied last: g - '(h- (h(g(x))))=x. 

x = g - l ( h - f ( z ) ) .  

(3) 

that last equation  looks like a mess, but  it  holds  the key.  in the middle  you  see 
h- ' and h. that part of the chain does nothing! the inverse functions cancel, to leave 
g-'(g(x)). but  that  is  x. the whole  chain  collapses,  when  g-'  and  h-'  are  in  the 
correct  order-which 

is opposite to the order of  h(g(x)). 

z =  h(g(x))= 3 ( x -   2) and x = g - ' ( h - ' ( z ) ) = i z +   2. 

example 7 
first  h- ' divides by  3. then g - ' adds 2. the inverse  of  h 0 g  is g - ' o h-'.  i t  can be 
found  directly by solving z = 3(x - 2). a chain of inverses is like writing in prose-we 
do it without  knowing it. 

example 8 

invert  z = j x   - 2  by  writing z2 = x  - 2 and then x  = z2 + 2. 

the inverse  adds 2  and  takes  the  square-but 
( z+ 2)2,which is wrong. the correct  order is z2 + 2. 

not  in  that  order.  that  would  give 

the  domains  and  ranges  are  explained  by  figure 4.8.  we  start  with  x 2 2. 
subtracting  2  gives  y 2 0.  taking  the  square  root  gives  z 3 0.  taking  the  square

inverse matrices (ab)-'  = b-'a-' 

(this id202 is optional). 

suppose  a  vector  x  is  multiplied  by  a  square  matrix  b:  y  = g(x)= bx.  the inverse 
function multiplies  by  the inverse matrix: x  = g -  ' ( y )  = b -  ' y .  it is like multiplication 
by  b = 3 and b - ' = 113, except  that x  and y  are vectors. 
now suppose a second function multiplies by another matrix a: z  = h(g(x))= abx. 
the problem  is to recover  x  from  z. the first step is to invert  a, because that came 
last:  bx = a - ' z .   then  the  second  step  multiplies  by  b-'  and  brings  back  x = 
b -  ' a -  ' z .  the product  b - 'a - ' inverts the product  ab. the rule for matrix inverses 
is like the rule for function inverses-in 

fact it is a special case. 

i  had  better  not  wander  too  far  from  calculus.  the  next  section  introduces  the 
inverses  of  the  sine and cosine  and tangent,  and finds  their  derivatives.  remember 
that the ultimate  source is the chain  rule.

inverses of  trigonometric functions 

mathematics is  built  on  basic  functions like the  sine, and  on  basic  ideas like the 
inverse. therefore it is totally natural  to invert the sine function.  the graph of  x = 
sin-'y  is a mirror image of  y = sin x. this is a case where we  pay close attention to 
the domains, since the sine goes up and down infinitely often. we only want one piece 
of  that curve, in figure 4.9. 
for the bold line the domain is restricted. the angle x lies between -7r/2and + n/2. 
on that interval the sine is increasing, so each y comesfvom exactly one angle x. if 
the whole sine curve is allowed, infinitely many angles would have sin x = 0. the sine

function could not have an inverse. by restricting to an interval where sin x is increas- 
ing, we  make the function invertible. 

the inverse function brings y back to x. it is x = sin-'y  (the inverse sine): 

x = sin- 'y  when y = sin x and 1x1 < 7112. 

(1) 
the inverse starts with  a  number  y between  - 1 and  1.  it  produces  an  angle x = 
sin - ly--the  angle whose sine is y.  the angle x  is  between  -s/2 and  7112,  with  the 
required  sine. historically x  was  called  the  "arc  sine"  of  y,  and  arcsin  is  used  in 
computing. the mathematical notation is sin-'.  this has nothing to do with  l/sin x. 
the figure shows the 30"angle x = 7116.  its sine is y = 4.the inverse sine of 4is 7116. 
again: the  symbol sin-'(1)  stands for  the  angle whose sine is  1 (this angle is  x = 
n/2). we are seeing g- '(g(x)) = x: 

sin-'(sin  x)= x for  - - d x  < -

sin(sin-'y)  =  for  - 1 < y < 1.

example 1  (important) if  sin x = y find a formula for cos x. 
solution  we are given the sine, we want the cosine. the key to this problem must 
be cos2x = 1 - sin2x. when the sine is y, the cosine is the square root of  1  - y2: 

cos x = cos(sin-'y) = j

this formula is crucial for computing derivatives. we use it immediately. 

the  derivative of the  inverse sine 

the  calculus  problem  is  to  find  the  slope  of  the  inverse  function f(y) = sin-'y. 
the  chain  rule  gives  (slope  of 
inverse function) = l/(slope  of  original  function). 
certainly the slope of  sin x is cos x. to switch from x to y,  use equation (2): 

y = sin x  gives  - = cos x  so that  - = -- ----

this derivative 11 jmgives a new v-f  pair that is extremely valuable in calculus: 

velocity  v(t)= 1/,/1  - t2 

'distance  f(t) = sin -'t. 

inverse functions will  soon produce two more pairs, from the derivatives of  tan-'y 
and sec- 'y.  the table at the end lists all the essential facts. 
example 2  the  slope  of  sin -'y  at  y = 1  is  infinite:  l / j w  = 110.  explain. 

at  y = 1 the graph  of  y = sin x is horizontal.  the slope is zero. so its mirror image 
is  vertical. the slope 110 is  an extreme case of  the chain rule. 
question  what is dldx (sin-'x)? 

answer  1/,/1  - x2.  i just  changed letters. 

the  inverse cosine and its  derivative 

whatever is done for the sine can be done for the cosine. but the domain and range 
have to be watched. the graph cannot be allowed to go up and down. each y from 
-1 to 1 should be the cosine of  only one angle x. that puts x between 0 and n.then 
the cosine is steadily decreasing and y = cos x has an inverse: 
cos - '(cos x) = x and cos(cos -'y) = y. 

(4) 

4.4

the cosine  of the angle  x = 0 is  the number  y =  1. the  inverse  cosine  of y =  1 is  the
angle  x = 0.  those  both  express  the same fact,  that cos 0 = 1.

for  the slope  of cos-  'y,  we  could copy  the calculation  that succeeded  for sin -y.

the  chain  rule  could  be  applied  as  in  (3).  but  there  is  a  faster  way,  because  of a
special  relation  between cos-  'y  and sin-  'y.  those angles always add to a right angle:

cos-  ly +  sin-  'y  = ~n/2.

figure 4.9c shows  the angles  and  figure 4. 10c  shows the graphs.  the sum is  nt/2  (the
dotted line),  and its derivative  is  zero.  so  the derivatives  of cos-  ly and  sin-'y must
add  to  zero.  those derivatives have  opposite sign. there  is  a  minus for  the  inverse
cosine,  and its  graph  goes  downward:

the  derivative  of  x =  cos-'y  is  dx/dy  = - 1/  1-y

question  how  can  two  functions  x = sin-ly  and  x =-  cos-  y  have  the  same
derivative?
answer 

sin -y  must  be  the  same  as  - cos-  ly + c.  equation  (5) gives  c = 7e/2.

the  inverse  tangent  and  its  derivative

the  tangent  is  sin x/cos x.  the  inverse  tangent  is  not  sin-'y/cos- 'y.  the  inverse
function  produces  the angle whose tangent is y.  figure 4.11  shows  that angle,  which
is  between  - 7t/2  and  7r/2.  the tangent  can  be  any  number,  but  the  inverse  tangent
is  in the open  interval - 7r/2  < x <  rn/2.  (the interval is  "open"  because  its  endpoints
are not  included.)  the tangents  of nr/2 and  - 7r/2  are  not  defined.

curve, dx/dy = 1/(1+ y2) =1. on the tangent curve, dy/dx = sec2x. at z/4 the secant 
squared equals 2. the slopes dx/dy =f and dy/dx = 2 multiply to give  1. 
zmportant  soon will come the following question. what function  has the derivative 
1/(1+ x2)? one reason for reading this section is to learn the answer. the function 
is in equation (8)-if  we  change letters. it  is f(x) = tan- 'x  that has sfope  1/(1+ x2).

note about the inverse secant  when y is negative there is a choice for x  = sec-ly. 
we  selected  the  angle  in  the  second  quadrant  (between 4 2  and  z).  its  cosine  is 
negative,  so  its  secant  is  negative.  this  choice makes  sec-'y  = cos-'(lly),  which 
matches sec x = l/cos x.  it also makes sec- 'y  an increasing function, where cos- 'y 
is a decreasing function. so we  needed the absolute value lyl  in the derivative. 

4.4 

inverses of trigonometric functions 

some mathematical tables make  a different choice. the angle x could be  in  the 

third quadrant (between  -n and  -n/2). then the slope omits the absolute value. 
summary  for the six inverse functions it is only necessary to learn three derivatives. 
the other three just have minus signs, as we saw for sin-'y  and cos-'y.  each inverse 
function and its "cofunction"  add to n/2, so their derivatives add to zero. here are 
the six functions for quick reference, with the three new derivatives. 

function f(y) 

inputs y

slope dxldy 

if  y = cos x or y = sin x then lyj < 1. for y = sec x and y = csc x the opposite is true; 
we  must have lyl> 1. the graph of  sec-ly  misses all the points  -1 < y < 1. 

also, that graph misses x = n/2-where 

the cosine is zero. the secant of n/2 would 
be 110 (impossible). similarly csc- ly misses x = 0, because y = csc 0 cannot be l/sin 0. 
the asterisks in the table are to remove those points x = n/2 and x = 0. 

the column of  derivatives is what we  need and use in calculus.

5.1  the  idea of  the  integral 

this chapter is about the idea of  integration,  and also about the technique of  integ- 
ration.  we explain  how  it  is  done  in  principle,  and  then  how  it  is done  in  practice. 
integration  is a problem of  adding up infinitely many things, each of  which is infini- 
tesimally small. doing the addition is not recommended. the whole point of calculus 
is to offer a  better way. 

the problem of integration is to find a limit of sums. the key is to work backward 
from  a  limit  of  differences (which  is  the derivative).  we  can integrate v(x) ifit  turns 
up as the derivative of  another function f(x). the integral of  v  = cos x is f = sin x. the 
integral  of  v  = x  is f = $x2. basically, f(x) is  an  "antiderivative".  the list  of j ' s   will 
grow much longer (section 5.4 is crucial). a selection is inside the cover of this book. 
if we don't find a suitable f(x), numerical integration can still give an excellent answer. 
i could go directly to the formulas for integrals, which allow you to compute areas 
under the most  amazing curves. (area is the clearest example of  adding up infinitely 
many  infinitely  thin  rectangles,  so it  always comes first. it  is  certainly  not  the  only 
problem that integral calculus can solve.) but i am really unwilling just  to write down 
formulas, and skip over all the ideas. newton and leibniz had an absolutely brilliant 
intuition, and there is no reason why we  can't  share it. 

they started with  something simple. we will do the same. 

sums a n d  differences 

integrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with sums 
and  differences. instead  of  functions, we  have  n  ordinary  numbers.  the key  idea  is 
nothing more than a basic fact of algebra. in the limit as n + co,it becomes the basic 
fact  of  calculus.  the step of  "going  to the  limit"  is  the essential difference between 
algebra  and  calculus!  it  has  to  be  taken,  in  order  to  add  up  infinitely  many 
infinitesimals-but  we  start out this side of  it. 

to see what happens before  the limiting step, we  need  two sets of  n  numbers.  the 
first  set  will  be  v,,  v,,  ..., v,,  where 
suggests velocity.  the  second  set  of  numbers 
will  be f,,f,,  . . . ,f,, where f recalls  the  idea  of  distance.  you  might  think  d  would 
be  a  better  symbol  for  distance,  but  that  is  needed  for  the  dx  and  dy  of  calculus. 

5 

integrals 

a first example has n = 4: 

01, 212,  v3,  v 4 =   l 2 ,  3,4 

f1,f2,f3,f4=  1, 3,  6,  10. 

the relation between the v's  and f's  is seen in that example. when you  are given 
1,  3,  6,  10, how  do you  produce  1, 2,  3,  4?  by  taking  drerences.  the  difference 
between  10 and 6 is 4.  subtracting 6 - 3 is 3. the difference f2  -fl = 3 - 1 is v2 = 2. 
each v  is the difference between two f 's: 

vj is the dierencefi 

. 

this is the discrete form of the derivative. i admit to a small difficulty at j = 1, from 
the fact that  there is no fo. the first v  should  be fl -fo, and  the natural  idea is  to 
agree that fo  is zero. this need for a  starting point  will come back  to haunt  us (or 
help us) in calculus. 

now look again at those same numbers-but 

start with v.  from v = 1,2,3,4 how 
do you produce f = 1,3,6, lo? by taking sums. the first two v's  add to 3, which is f2. 
the first three v's  add to f3  = 6. the sum of  all four v's  is  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. taking 
sums is the opposite of taking di$erences. 
that idea from algebra is the key to calculus. the sum& involves all the numbers 
v,  + v2 +  + vj.  the difference vj involves only the two numbers fi - f i   - . the fact 
that one reverses the other is the "fundamental theorem." calculus will change sums 
to integrals and differences to derivatives-but  why not let the key idea come through 
now? 

the differences of  the f's  add up to f,-fo . all f's  in  between are canceled, leaving 
only the last fn  and the starting foe  the sum "telescopes": 

01 + u2  + 03 + ... + vn = (fl -fo)  + (f2 -f1)  + (f3 -f2)  + ... + (fn -fn- 1)-

the  number fl is  canceled  by  -fl. similarly  -f2  cancels f2  and  -f,  cancels f3. 
eventuallyfn  and  -fo  are left. when fo  is zero, the sum is the finalf,. 

that completes the algebra.  we add the v's  by finding  the f 's. 

question  how do you add the odd numbers  1 + 3 + 5 + -..+ 99 (the v's)? 
answer  they are the differences between 0, 1,4,9, . . . . these f's  are squares. by  the 
fundamental theorem, the sum of  50 odd numbers is (50)2. 

the tricky part is to discover the right f's!  their differences must produce the v's. 
in calculus, the tricky part is to find the right f(x). its derivative must produce  v(x). 
it is remarkable how often f can be found-more  often for integrals than for sums. 
our next step is to understand  how the integral is a limit of sums. 

sums approach integrals 

suppose  you  start  a  successful  company.  the  rate  of  income is  increasing.  after 
x years, the income per year is & million dollars.  in the first four years you reach 
fi,$,  $,and $million dollars. those numbers are displayed in a bar graph 
(figure s.la, for investors). i realize that most start-up companies make losses, but 
your  company  is  an  exception. if  the example is  too good  to be  true, please keep 
reading. 

5.1  thm  idea of the integral 

fig. 5.1  total income = total area of  rectangles = 6.15. 

* year 

the graph shows four rectangles, of  heights ,,h, fi,fi,fi.since the base of 
each rectangle is one year, those numbers are also the areas of  the rectangles.  one 
investor, possibly weak in arithmetic, asks a simple question: what is the total income 
for  all four  years?  there are two ways to answer, and i will give both. 
the  first  answer  is f i + fi+ f i + $.  addition  gives  6.15  million  dollars. 
figure 5.lb shows this total-which 
is reached at year 4. this is exactly like velocities 
and distances, but now v is the incomeper year andf is the totalincome.algebraically,
fi is still vl +  + vj. 
the second answer comes from geometry.  the total income is the total area of the 
rectangles. we are emphasizing the correspondence between athiition and area. that 
point may seem obvious, but it becomes important when a second investor (smarter 
than the first) asks a harder question. 

here is the problem. the incomes as stated are false.  the company did not make 
a million dollars the first year. after three months, when x was 114, the rate of income 
was only & = 112. the bar graph showed f i = 1 for the whole year, but that was 
an overstatement. the income in three months was not more than 112 times 114, the 
. rate multiplied by the time. 

with 4 years divided into 16 quarters. it gives a new estimate for total income. 

again  there are two ways to find the total. we  add a+ 

all other quarters and years were also overstated. figure 5.2a is closer to reality, 
+  + ,/16/4,
remembering to multiply them  all by  114 (because each  rate  applies to  114 year). 
this is also the area of  the 16 rectangles. the area approach is better because the 114 
is automatic. each rectangle has base  114, so that factor enters each area. the total 
area is now 5.56 million dollars, closer to the truth. 
you see what is coming. the next step divides time into weeks. after one week the 
rate f i is only j1/52.  that is the height  of  the first rectangle-its 
base is ax = 
1/52. there is a rectangle for every week. then a hard-working investor divides time 
into  days,  and  the  base  of  each  rectangle is  ax = 11365.  at  that  point  there  are 
4 x 365 = 1460 rectangles, or  1461 because of  leap year, with a total area below  5)

income = sum of  areas (not heights) 

million  dollars. the calculation  is elementary but  depressing-adding 
up thousands 
of  square roots, each multiplied by  a x  from the base. there has to be  a better  way. 

the better  way,  in  fact  the  best  way,  is  calculus. the  whole  idea  is  to  allow  for 
continuous change.  the geometry  problem  is  to find  the  area  under  the  square  root 
curve. that question  cannot be  answered  by  arithmetic,  because  it  involves  a  limit.

5.2  antiderivatives 


the symbol  was invented by  leibniz to represent the integral. it is a stretched-out 
s ,  from the  latin  word for sum. this symbol is a powerful  reminder of  the whole 
construction:  sum  approaches  integral,  s  approaches  i,  and  rectangular  area 
approaches curved area: 

curved area = l v(x) dx = 5 f i  dx. 

(1) 
integral of &.the "dx"  indicates 
the rectangles of base ax lead to this limit-the 
that ax  approaches zero. the heights vj of  the rectangles are the heights v(x) of  the 
curve. the sum of vj times ax approaches "the integral of  v of  x dx."  you can imagine 
an infinitely thin rectangle above every point,  instead of  ordinary rectangles above 
special points. 

we now find the area under the square root curve. the "limits of integration"  are 
0 and 4. the lower limit is x = 0, where the area begins. (the start could be any point 
x = a.) the upper limit is x = 4,  since we  stop after four years. (the jinish could be 
any point  x = b.)  the area of  the rectangles is a  sum of  base ax  times heights &. 
the curved area is the limit of  this sum. that l i d  is the integral of &porn  0 to 4: 

the outstanding problem of integral calculus is still to be solved. what is this limiting 
area? we have a symbol for the answer, involving i and & and dx-but  we don't 
have a number. 

the  antiderivative 

i  wish  i  knew  who discovered the area under  the graph  of  &.it  may  have been 
newton. the answer was available earlier, but  the key  idea was shared by  newton 
and leibniz. they understood the parallels between sums and integrals, and between 
differences and derivatives. i can give the answer, by following that analogy. i can't 
give the proof (yet)-it 

is the fundamental  theorem of  calculus. 

in algebra the differencef;. -f;.-, is  vj.  when we add, the sum of  the v's  isf.  -fo. 
in calculus the  derivative of f(x) is  v(x). when  we  integrate, the  area under  the  v(x) 
curve is f(x) minus f(0). our problem  asks for the area out to x = 4: 

iir fix):
dx =f(4) -fo. 

rfdfldx  = fi then area =

integration)  laae integral of 4 x )  ib the wnence 
i 
(3) 1 
what is f(x)? instead of  the derivative of &,we  need  its "antiderivative." we have 
to find a function f(x) whose derivative is &.it is the opposite of chapters 2-4,  and 
requires us  to  work  backwards. the  derivative of  xn is  nxn-'-now  we  need  the 
antiderivative. the quick formula is f(x) = xn+'/(n+ 1)-we  aim to understand it. 
solution  since the derivative lowers the exponent, the antiderivative raises it.  we 
go from  x'i2  to x3i2. but  then  the  derivative is  (3/2)x1i2. it  contains  an  unwanted 
factor 312.  to cancel that factor, put  213  into the antiderivative: 

f(x) = 3x3i2has the required derivative v(x)= x 'i2  = &.

fig. 5.3  the integral of  v(x) = ,,&  is the exact  area 1613 under the curve. 

there you  see the key  to integrals: work backward from derivatives (and adjust). 

now comes a number-the 

exact area. at x = 4 we  find x3i2 = 8. multiply by 213 

to get  1613. then subtract f(0) = 0: 

the total income over four  years  is  1613= 53 million dollars. this is f(4) -f(0). the 
sum from thousands  of  rectangles was slowly approaching  this exact area 5f. 
= 3 million  dollars. 
other  areas  the  income in  the  first  year,  at  x = 1, is 
(the false  income was  1 million  dollars.) the  total  income after  x  years  is  3x3i2, 
which is the antiderivative f(x). the square root curve covers 213 of  the overall rectangle 
it sits in. the rectangle goes out to x and up to &, with area x3i2, and 213 of  that 
rectangle is below the curve. (113 is above.) 
other antiderivatives  the derivative of  x5 is 5x4. therefore the antiderivative of  x4 
is x5/5. divide by 5 (or n + 1) to cancel the 5 (or n + 1) from the derivative. and don't 
allow n + 1 = 0: 

the derivative v(x) = xn has the antiderivative f(x) = xn+' / ( n+ 1). 

example 1  the  antiderivative of  x2 is  ix3. this  is  the  area  under  the  parabola 
v(x) = x2. the area out to x = 1 is 
remark on & and x2  the 213  from & and the  113 from x2 add to 1. those are 
the areas below and above the & curve, in the corner of  figure 5.3. if  you turn the 
curve by 90  , it becomes the parabola. the functions y  = & and x = y2 are inverses! 
the areas for these inverse functions add to a square of  area  1.

area  under a  straight line 

you already know the area of  a triangle. the region is below the diagonal line v = x 
in figure 5.4. the base is 4, the height is 4, and the area is g4)(4) = 8. integration is

fig. 5.4  triangular  area 8 as the limit of  rectangular areas  10, 9,  83, .... 

not required! but if you allow calculus to repeat that answer, and build up the integral 
f(x) = +x2 as the  limiting  area  of  many  rectangles,  you  will  have  the  beginning  of 
something important. 
the four rectangles  have area  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. that is greater  than  8, because 
the  triangle  is  inside.  10 is  a  first  approximation  to  the  triangular  area  8,  and  to 
improve it we  need  more rectangles. 

the  next  rectangles  will  be  thinner,  of  width  ax = 112  instead  of  the  original 
ax = 1. there  will  be  eight  rectangles  instead  of  four.  they  extend  above  the  line, 
so the  answer is still  too high.  the new  heights  are  112, 1, 312, 2, 512, 3, 712, 4.  the 
total area in  figure 5.4b is the sum of  the base ax = 112 times those heights: 

area = $($ + 1 + $ + 2 +  + 4) = 9 (which is closer to 8). 

question  what is the area of  16 rectangles?  their heights are $, 3,  . . . ,4. 
answer  with  base a x = $  the area is $($+++ 

+ 4 ) = 8 $ .  

the effort of  doing the addition is increasing. a formula for the sums is needed, and 
will  be  established  soon. (the next  answer would  be  84.) but  more important  than 
the formula is the idea.  we are carrying out a iimiting process, one step at a time. the 
area  of  the  rectangles  is  approaching the  area of  the triangle,  as ax  decreases. the 
same limiting  process  will  apply  to other  areas,  in  which  the  region  is  much  more 
complicated. therefore we  pause to comment on what is important. 

area  under a curve 

what requirements are imposed on those thinner and thinner rectangles? it is not 
essential that they all have the same width. and it is not required  that they cover the 
triangle  completely.  the  rectangles  could  lie  below  the  curve.  the limiting  answer 
will  still  be  8,  even  if  the  widths  ax  are  unequal  and  the  rectangles  fit  inside  the 
triangle or across it. we only impose two rules: 

1. the largest  width  ax,,,  must  approach zero. 
2.  the top of each rectangle must  touch  or cross the curve. 

the area under  the graph is defined  to be the limit of  these rectangular areas, if  that 
limit  exists.  for  the  straight  line,  the  limit  does  exist  and  equals  8.  that  limit  is 
independent  of  the particular  widths and heights-as  we  absolutely  insist  it  should 
be. 

section 5.5 allows any continuous v(x). the question will  be  the same-does 

the 
limit exist? the answer will be the same-  yes. that limit  will be the integral of  v(x), 
and it will be the area under  the curve.  it will  be f(x). 

example 2  the  triangular  area  from  0  to  x  is  f(base)(height) =f(x)(x).  that  is 
f(x) =f x2. its derivative is v(x) = x.  but notice that fx2 + 1 has the same derivative. 
so does f =f x2 + c, for any constant  c. there is a "constant of integration" in f(x), 
which  is wiped  out in its derivative v(x). 

example 3  suppose the velocity is decreasing: v(x) = 4 - x. if  we  sample v  at x = 
1,2,3,4, the rectangles lie under the graph. because v  is decreasing, the right end of 
then the rectangular area 3 + 2 + 1+ 0 = 6 is less than the 
each interval gives v,,. 
exact area 8. the rectangles are inside the triangle, and eight rectangles with base 4 
come closer: 

rectangular area =f(3f + 3 +  +f + 0) = 7. 

sixteen rectangles would have area 7f. we repeat that the rectangles need not have 
the same widths ax,  but it makes these calculations easier. 

what is the area out to an arbitrary point (like x = 3 or x = l)? we could insert 
rectangles, but the fundamental theorem offers a faster way. any antiderivative of 
4 - x will give the area. we look for  a function  whose derivative is 4 - x. the derivative 
of  4x is 4, the derivative of  fx2 is x, so work  backward: 

to achieve dfldx  = 4 - x choose f(x) = 4x -fx2. 

calculus skips past  the  rectangles and  computes f(3) = 7f.  the area between x = 1 
and x = 3 is the dference 77:- 3f  = 4. in figure 5.5, this is the area of  the trapezoid. 
the f-curve flattens  out  when the v-curve touches zero. no new area is being added.

fig. 5.5  the area is af  = 74 - 34 = 4. since v(x) decreases,f(x) bends down. 

indefinite integrals and definite integrals 

we have to distinguish two different kinds of  integrals. they both use the antideriva- 
tive f(x). the definite one involves the limits 0 and 4, the indefinite one doesn't: 

the indefinite integral is a function f(x) = 4x - ix2. 
the definite integral from x = 0 to x = 4 is the number f(4) -f(0). 

the  definite  integral  is  definitely  8.  but  the  indefinite  integral  is  not  necessarily 
4x - $x2. we can change f(x) by a constant without changing its derivative (since the 

derivative of  a constant is zero). the following functions are also antiderivatives: 

the first  two  are particular examples.  the last is the general  case. the constant  c 
can be  anything (including zero), to give all functions with  the required  derivative. 
the theory  of  calculus will  show that there are no others. the indefinite integral is 
the most general antiderivative (with no limits): 

indefinite integral f(x) = j v(x) dx = 4x - $ x 2+ c. 

(5) 
by  contrast, the definite integral is a number. it contains no arbitrary constant c. 
more that that, it contains no variable x. the definite integral is determined by  the 
function v(x) and the limits of integration (also known as the endpoints).it is the area 
under the graph between  those endpoints. 
to see the relation of indefinite to definite, answer this question: what is the definite 
integral  between  x = 1  and  x = 3?  the  indefinite  integral  gives f(3) = 74 + c  and 
f(1) = 3f + c. to find the area between the limits, subtractf at one limit from f at the 
other limit: 

the constant cancels itself! the definite integral is the diflerence  between the values 
of  the indefinite integral.  c disappears in the subtraction. 

the difference f(3) -f(l) is like fn  -f,.  the sum of  v j  from  1 to n has become "the 
integral of  v(x) from  1 to  3."  section 5.3 computes  other areas from  sums, and  5.4 
computes many more from antiderivatives. then we come back to the definite integral 
and the fundamental  theorem:

5.3  summation versus integration - 

this  section  does  integration  the  hard  way.  we  find  explicit  formulas  for f, = 
u,  +  + u,  . from areas of rectangles, the limits produce the area f(x) under a curve. 
according  to the  fundamental  theorem, dfldx  should  return  us  to  v(x)-and  we 
verify in each case that it does. 

may  i recall that there is sometimes an easier way? if  we  can find an f(x) whose 
derivative is u(x), then the integral of  u is$  sums and limits are not required, when f 
is spotted directly. the next section, which explains how to look for f(x), will displace 
this  one.  (if we  can't  find  an antiderivative we  fall back  on  summation.) given  a 
successful f, adding  any  constant  produces  another f-since 
the  derivative of  the 
constant is zero. the right constant achieves f(0) = 0, with no extra effort.

integrals 

this section constructs f(x) from sums. the next section searches for antiderivatives. 

the  sigma  notation 

in  a  section  about  sums,  there  has  to be  a  decent  way  to express  them.  consider 
l 2  + 2'  + 32+ 42.the individual terms are vj =j2. their sum can be written in sum-
mation notation, using the capital greek  letter  c (pronounced sigma): 

1'  + 2'  + 32+ 42 is  written  x j2. 

4 

j=1 

spoken aloud, that becomes "the sum of j 2  from j  = 1  to 4."  it equals 30. the limits 
on j  (written below  and above c) indicate where to start and stop: 

the k  at the end of ( 1 )  makes an additional point. there is nothing special about the 
letter j.  that is a  "dummy  variable,"  no better  and  no worse  than k  (or i).  dummy 
variables  are only on one side (the side with  c),and they have no effect on the sum. 
the upper  limit  n is on both sides.  here are six sums: 

'f 7= i  + - + - + ... = 2  [infinite  series] 
1 
k = o   2 

1
2 

1
4 

the numbers  1  and n  or  1  and 4 (or 0 and  k )  are the lower limit  and upper limit. 
the dummy variable i or j  or k  is the index of  summation. i  hope it seems reasonable 
that the infinite series 1 + 3+ $ + 
adds to 2. we will come back to it in chapter  10.t 
a  sum  like  z:=,  6  looks  meaningless,  but  it  is  actually  6 + 6 + ... + 6 = 6n. 
it  follows  the  rules.  in  fact  c:=,  j 2   is  not  meaningless  either.  every  term  is j 2   and 
by  the  same  rules.  that  sum  is  4j2. however  the  i  was  probably  intended  to  be j. 
then the sum is  1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30. 
question  what  happens to these sums when  the  upper  limits are changed to n? 
answer  the  sum  depends  on  the  stopping  point  n.  a  formula  is  required  (when 
possible). integrals stop at .u,  sums stop at n, and we now look for special cases when 
.f(.u) or *f,can be  found. 

a special  summation formula 

how do you  add the first  100 whole numbers? the problem  is to compute 

tzeno the greek believed  it  was impossible  to get  anywhere, since he would  only  go halfway 
and then half  again  and half  again.  infinite  series would  have changed  his  whole  life. 

5.3  summation versus integration 

if  you were gauss, you would  see the answer at once. (he solved this problem  at a 
ridiculous age, which gave his friends the idea of  getting him into another class.) his 
solution was to combine 1 + 100, and 2 + 99, and 3 + 98, always adding to 101. there 
are fifty of  those combinations.  thus the sum is (50)(101) = 5050. 
the sum from  1 to n  uses the same idea. the first and last terms add to n + 1. the 
next terms n - 1 and 2 also add to n + 1. if  n is even (as 100 was) then  there are i n  
parts. therefore the sum is i n  times n + 1: 

the important  term is i n 2 ,  but  the exact  sum is i n 2  + i n .  
what happens if  n is an odd number  (like n = 99)? formula (2) remains true.  the 
combinations  1 + 99 and  2 + 98 still add to n + 1 = 100. there are 399) = 493 such 
pairs,  because  the  middle  term  (which  is  50) has  nothing  to  combine  with.  thus 
1 + 2 +  + 99 equals 493 times  100, or 4950. 
remark  that sum had to be 4950, because it is 5050 minus  100. the sum up to 99 
equals the sum up to  100 with the last term removed.  our key formula fn  -fn- = v, 
has turned up again! 
example  find the sum  101 + 102+ ... + 200 of  the second hundred numbers. 
first solution  this is the sum from  1 to 200 minus the sum from  1 to 100: 

the middle  sum is $(200)(201) and  the last is i(100)(101). their  difference is  15050. 
note! i left out '7 = "in  the limits. it is there, but not written. 
second solution  the answer  15050 is exactly the sum of  the first hundred numbers 
(which was  5050) plus  an additional  10000. believing that a number like  10000 can 
never  turn  up by  accident, we  look  for  a  reason.  it  is  found  through  changing the 
limits of summation: 

200 

j =  101 

j is the same sum as 

(k + 100). 

k = l  

this is important,  to be able to shift limits around. often the lower limit  is moved 
to zero or one, for convenience. both sums have 100 terms (that doesn't change). the 
dummy  variable j  is  replaced  by  another  dummy  variable  k.  they  are  related  by 
j = k + 100 or equivalently by  k =j - 100. 
the  variable must  change  everywhere-in 

the  lower  limit  and  the  upper  limit  as 
well  as inside the sum. if j starts at  101, then k =j - 100 starts at  1. if j ends at 200, 
k ends at  100. if j appears in the sum, it is replaced  by  k + 100 (and if j2 appeared it 
would become (k + 
from equation (4) you  see why  the answer is  15050. the sum  1 + 2 + ... + 100 is 

5050 as before.  100 is added to each of those  100 terms. that gives  10000.

why change n to n - 3? because the upper limit is i = n.  so j + 3 = n and j = n - 3. 
a final step is possible, and you will often see it. the new variable j  can be changed 
back  to i.  dummy  variables  have  no meaning  of  their  own,  but  at first the  result 
looks surprising: 

5 

c 2'  equals  2 2'-  ' equals  2 zi-  '. 

6 

i = 0 

j= 1 

i =  1 

with practice you might do that in one step, skipping the temporary letter j.  every 
i on the left becomes i - 1 on the right. then i = 0, . . . , 5  changes to i = 1, . . . ,6. (at 
first two steps are safer.) this may seem a minor point, but soon we will be changing 
the limits on integrals instead  of  sums. integration is parallel to summation, and it 
is better to see a "change of variable"  here first. 
note  about  1 + 2 + .-. + n.  the good  thing is that gauss found the  sum f n(n + 1). 
the bad thing is that his method looked too much like a trick. i would like to show 
how this fits the fundamental rule connecting sums and differences: 

gauss says thatf, is f n(n + 1). reducing n by  1, his formula for&-,  is f (n - 1)n. the 
dference f, - f,-, should be the last term n in the sum: 

this is the one term  v,  = n that is included inf, but not inf,-i . 

there is a deeper point  here. for any sum f,,  there are two things to check. the 
f's  must  begin  correctly  and  they  must  change correctly.  the  underlying  idea  is 
mathematical induction: assume the statement is true below  n.  prove it for  n. 
goat  to prove  that  1 + 2 + --. + n = f n(n + 1). this is the guess f,. 
proof by induction:  check fl (it equals 1). check f, -f, -  (it equals n). 
for  n = 1 the  answer  fn(n + 1) = f  1  2  is  correct.  for  n = 2  this  formula  f  2  3 
agrees with  1 + 2.  but  that  separate test  is  not  necessary! iffl  is  right, and  i f  the 
changef, -f,-,  is right for  every n,  thenf, must  be  right. equation  (6) was the key 
test, to show that the change in f's  agrees with v. 

that is the logic behind  mathematical induction, but  i am  not  happy with  most 
of the exercises that use it. there is absolutely no excitement. the answer is given by 
some higher power (like gauss), and it is proved correct  by  some lower power (like 
us). it is much better when we lower powers find the answer for ourse1ves.t therefore 
i will try to do that for the second problem,  which is the sum of squares. 

the  sum of j2 and the  integral of x2 

an important calculation comes next. it is the area in figure 5.6. one region is made 
up  of  rectangles,  so  its  area  is  a  sum  of  n pieces.  the  other  region lies  under  the 
parabola  v = x2. it cannot be divided into rectangles, and calculus is needed. 
the first problem  is to find f, = 1'  + 22 + 32 +  + n2. this is a  sum of  squares, 
with fl = 1 and f2  = 5 and f, = 14. the goal is to find the pattern  in that  sequence. 
by  trying to guessf, we  are copying what will soon be done for integrals.

an integral).  algebra  looks for f,'s  whose  differences produce  v,.  here f, could  be 
called an antidiflerence (better to call it a sum). 

the  best  start  is  a  good  guess.  copying  directly  from  integrals,  we  might  try 

fn  =fn3. to test if  it is right, check whether f,-f n - i   produces on = n2: 

we see n2, but also  -n + f. the guess fn3 needs correction terms. to cancel f  in the 
difference,  i  subtract  f n   from  the  sum.  to  put  back  n  in  the  difference,  i  add 
1 + 2 + .-.+ n = qn(n + 1) to the sum. the new guess (which should be  right) is 

to check  this  answer, verify first that fl = 1. also f2  = 5 and f3  = 14. to be  certain, 
verify  that fn  -f,-,  = n2. for calculus the important term  is in3: 

the sum 

j2 of the first  n squares is - n3 plus  corrections - n2 and - n.

in practice fn3 is an excellent estimate. the sum of  the first  100 squares is approxi- 
mately f(100)3, or a  third  of  a  million.  if  we  need  the exact answer, equation (7) is 
available: the sum is  338,350. many applications (example: the  number  of  steps to 
solve  100 linear equations) can settle for in3. 

what is fascinating is the contrast with calculus. calculus has no correction terms! 
they get  washed  away in  the limit  of  thin rectangles. when the sum is replaced by 
the integral (the area), we  get an absolutely clean answer: 

the integral of v = x2from  x = 0 to x = n is exactly in3. 

the area under the parabola, out to the point x = 100, is precisely a third of a million. 
we have to explain why, with many rectangles. 

the idea is to approach an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. a hundred 
rectangles gave  an area  of  338,350. now  take  a  thousand rectangles. their  heights 
are  (&)2,  (&)2, ...  because  the  curve  is  v  = x2.  the  base  of  every  rectangle  is 
ax =&, and we  add heights times base: 
area of  rectangles = (;j($) 

(fj(k).
factor  out (&)3. what  you  have  left  is  l 2  + 22 +  + 10002, which  fits the  sum of 
squares formula. the exact area of  the thousand rectangles is 333,833.5. i could try 
to guess ten thousand rectangles but i won't. 
main point: the area is approaching 333,333.333. ... but the calculations are getting 
worse. it is time for algebra-which  means that we  keep "ax"  and avoid numbers.

the interval  of  length  100 is divided into n pieces of  length ax. (thus n = 100/ax.) 
the jth  rectangle  meets  the curve v = x2, so its height  is  ax)^.  its base is ax,  and 
we  add areas: 

area = (ax)~(ax)+ (2ax)'(ax) + ... + (nax)'(ax)  =

this equation shows what  is  happening.  the leading term  is  a  third  of  a million, 
as predicted.  the  other  terms  are  approaching  zero!  they  contain  ax,  and  as  the 
rectangles  get  thinner  they  disappear.  they  only  account  for  the  small  corners  of 
rectangles that lie above the curve. the vanishing  of  those corners will eventually be 
proved  for  any  continuous  functions-the 
area from  the  correction  terms  goes  to 
zero-but 

here  in equation (9) you  see it explicitly. 

the area under the curve came from the central idea of integration:  100/ax rectan- 
gles of width ax approach the limiting area = f 
the rectangular area is z vj ax. 
the  exact  area  is  j v(x)dx.  in  the  limit  z  becomes  j  and  vj  becomes  v(x) and  ax 
becomes dx. 

that completes the  calculation  for  a  parabola.  it  used  the  formula  for  a  sum  of 
squares, which  was special. but the underlying  idea is much more general. the limit 
of the sums agrees with the antiderivative: the antiderivative of v(x) = x2 isf(x) = i x 3 .  
according  to the  fundamental theorem, the area under  v(x) is f(x): 

that fundamental theorem is not yet proved! i mean it is not proved by us. whether 
leibniz  or newton  managed  to  prove  it,  i  am  not  quite  sure.  but  it  can  be  done. 
starting  from  sums  of  differences,  the  difficulty  is  that  we  have  too many  limits at 
once. the sums of cjax are approaching the integral. the differences af/ax  approach 
the derivative. a  real proof  has to separate those steps, and section 5.7 will do it. 

proved  or not, you  are seeing the  main  point.  what  was  true for  the  numbersf, 
and  cj is true in  the limit  for u(x) and.f(x). now  v(s) can vary continuously, but it is 
still the  slope of f'(s).the reverse of slope is area.

finally we review the area under  r;  = x. the sum of  1 + 2 +  + n  is i n 2  + i n .  this 
gives  the  area  of  n = 4/ax  rectangles,  going  out  to x = 4.  the  heights  are jax,  the 
bases are ax, and we  add areas: 

5.3  summation versus integration

with  a x  = 1 the  area is  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. with  eight rectangles and  ax = f, the 
area was 8 + 2ax = 9. sixteen rectangles of width i brought the correction 2ax down 
to f .  the exact area is 8. the error is proportional to ax. 
important note  there you see a question in applied mathematics. if there is an error, 
what size is it? how does it behave as ax + o?  the a x  term disappears in the limit, 
and    ax)^  disappears  faster.  but  to  get  an  error  of 
we  need  eight  million 
rectangles: 

2a x = 2  4/8,000,000 = 10 - 6. 

that is  horrifying! the numbers  10,9, 83, 8 i ,  . . . seem  to approach  the  area  8  in a 
satisfactory way, but the convergence is much too slow. it takes twice as much work 
to get one more binary digit in the answer-which 
is absolutely unacceptable. some- 
how  the a x  term must be  removed. if  the correction is   ax)^  instead of ax, then a 
thousand  rectangles will reach an accuracy of 

the problem  is that the rectangles are unbalanced. their right sides touch the graph 
of v, but their left sides are much too high. the best is to cross the graph in the middle 
is the midpoint rule. then the rectangle sits halfway across the 
of  the interval-this 
line v = x, and the error is zero. section 5.8 comes back to this rule-and 
to simpson's 
rule that fits parabolas and removes the s ax)^  term and is built into many calculators. 
finally we  try the quick way. the area under v = x  is f  = f  x2, because dfldx is v. 

the area out to x  = 4 is 3(4)2 = 8. done. 

fig. 5.7  endpoint rules: error - l/(work) - lln. midpoint  rule is better: error - l / ( ~ o r k ) ~ .  
optional: pth powers  our sums are following a pattern. first, 1 +  + n is f n2 plus 
i n .  the sum of  squares is i n 3  plus correction terms.  the sum of pth powers  is

calculus doesn't care if  the upper limit n is an integer, and it doesn't care if  the power 
p is an integer. we only need p + 1  > 0 to be sure np+  is genuinely the leading term. 
the antiderivative of v = xp is f  = xp+ ' / ( p  + 1). 
we  are close to interesting experiments. the correction  terms disappear  and  the 
sum approaches the integral. here are actual numbers for p = 1, when the sum and 
integral are easy: sn = 1 + --. + n and in =  x dx = i n 2 .  the difference is dn = f  n. the 
thing to watch is the relative error en = dn/in:

jind  a formula for  en.you  can guess enfrom the table, or you  can derive it  from 
knowing snand i,. the formula should show that engoes to zero. more important, 
it should show how quick (or slow) that convergence will be. 

one more number-a 

third  of  a  million-was  mentioned earlier. it  came from 

integrating x2 from 0 to 100, which compares to the sum sloe of  100 squares: 

these numbers suggest a new idea, to keep njixed and change p.  the computer can 
find sums without a formula! with its help we go to fourth powers and square roots:

in this and future tables we  don't  expect exact values. the last entries are rounded 
off, and the goal is to see the pattern. the errors en,,are sure to obey a systematic 
rule-they 
are proportional to  l/n and to an unknown number  c(p) that  depends 
on p.  i hope you can push  the experiments far enough to discover c(p). this is not

this section integrates the easy way,  by  looking for antiderivatives. we leave aside 
sums of  rectangular areas, and their limits as ax -+ 0.instead we  search for an f (x) 
with the required derivative u(x). in practice, this approach is more or less indepen- 
it  gives the  same answer. and  also,  the 
dent  of  the  approach  through  sums-but 

5 

integrals 

search for  an antiderivative may not succeed. we may not find f. in that case we  go 
back  to rectangles, or on to something better in section 5.8. 

a computer is ready to integrate v,  but not by discovering f. it integrates between 
specified  limits,  to obtain  a  number  (the definite integral).  here  we  hope  to find  a 
function  (the  indefinite  integral).  that  requires  a  symbolic  integration  code  like 
macsyma  or mathematica  or  maple,  or  a  reasonably  nice  v(x),  or  both.  an 
expression for f (x) can have tremendous advantages over a list of  numbers. 

thus our goal is to find antiderivatives and use them. the techniques will be further 
section is  short but  good.  first  we  write  down  what 

developed  in  chapter 7-this 
we  know.  on  each line, f (x) is an antiderivative of  v(x) because df  /dx = v(x).

you  recognize  that  each  integration  formula  came  directly  from  a  differentiation 
formula. the integral of  the cosine is  the sine, because the derivative  of  the  sine is 
the cosine. for emphasis we  list three derivatives above three integrals: 

d 
-(constant)= 0

d 
-(x)= 1
dx 

there are two ways to make this list longer. one is to find the derivative of a new 
f (x). then f goes in one column and v = df/dx  goes in the other co1umn.t the other 
possibility is to use rules for derivatives to find rules for integrals. that is the way to 
extend the list, enormously and easily. 

rules for integrals 

among the rules for derivatives, three were of supreme importance. they were linear-
ity, the product  rule, and the chain rule. everything  flowed from those three.  in the 

twe will  soon meet  ex, which goes in both columns. it is f ( x )  and also ~ ( x ) .

reverse direction (from v to f )this is still true. the three basic methods of differential 
calculus also dominate integral calculus: 

linearity of derivatives -,linearity  of integrals 

product  rule for  derivatives -+  integration by parts 

chain rule for  derivatives -+ integrals by substitution 

the  easiest  is  linearity,  which  comes  first.  integration  by  parts  will  be  left  for 
section 7.1. this section starts on substitutions,  reversing the chain rule to make an 
integral simpler. 

linearity of  integrals 

what is  the  integral  of  v(x) + w(x)? add  the  two  separate integrals.  the  graph  of 
t. + w  has  two  regions  below  it,  the  area  under  v  and  the  area  from  v  to  v + w. 
adding areas gives the sum rule.  suppose f  and g  are antiderivatives of  v and w: 

sum rule: 

constant  rule: 

linearity : 

f  + g 
cf 
af + bg 

is  an antiderivative of 

is an antiderivative of 
is an antiderivative of  av + bw 

v + w 
cv 

this is a case of  overkill. the first two rules are special cases of  the third, so logically 
the last rule is enough. however it is so important  to deal quickly with constants- 
just  "factor  them outv-that 
is stated  separately. the proofs come 
from  the  linearity  of  derivatives:  (af + bg)'  equals  af' + bg'  which  equals  av + bw. 
the rules can be  restated with  integral signs: 

the rule  cv-cf 

sum rule: 

constant  rule: 

j  [ ~ ( x )  

+ w ( x ) ]dx = j  v ( x )  dx + j  w ( x )  dx
j  c v ( x )  dx = c j  v ( x )  dx 

~ [ a v ( x ) + b w ( x ) ] d x = a ~ t . ( x ) d x + b ~ w ( x ) d x  

linearity: 
note  about  the constant  in f  ( x )  + c. all  antiderivatives allow the addition of  a con- 
stant.  for  a  combination like  av(x)+ bw(x), the  antiderivative  is  af ( x )  + bg(x)+ c. 
the constants for  each part  combine into a single constant. to give all possible antide- 
rivatives  of  a  function, just  remember  to  write  "+ c"  after  one  of  them.  the  real 
problem  is to find  that  one antiderivative. 
example 1  the antiderivative of  v  = x2 + x -

is f  = x3/3+ ( x - ')i(-1) + c. 

example 2  the antiderivative of  6 cos t + 7 sin t is  6 sin t - 7 cos t + c.

= sec2x  - sec x  tan x .  

the antiderivative is tan x  - sec x + c. that rewriting is done by a symbolic algebra 
code (or by you). differentiation is often simple, so most people check that df ldx = v(x).

integrals 

integrals by substitution 

we now present the most valuable technique in this section-substitution.  to see the 
idea, you have to remember the chain rule: 

f (g(x))  has derivative  f '(g(x))(dg/dx) 
sin x2  has derivative  (cos x2)(2x) 

(x3+ 1)'  has derivative  5(x3+ ll4(3x2) 

if the function on the right is given, the function on the left is its antiderivative! there 
are two points to emphasize right away: 

1. constants are no problem-they  can always be jixed.  divide by  2 or 15: 

notice the 2 from x2, the 5 from the fifth power, and the 3 from x3. 

2.  choosing the insid? function  g (or u) commits us to its derivative: 

the integral of  2x cos x2 is sin x2 + c  (g = x2, dgldx = 2x) 
the integral of  cos x2 is (failure) 

the integral of  x2 cos x2 is (failure) 

(no dgldx) 
(wrong dgldx) 

to substitute g for x2, we need its derivative. the trick is to spot an inside function 
whose derivative is present. we  can fix constants like 2 or  15, but  otherwise dgldx 
has to be there. very often  the inside function g is written u. we use that letter to state 
the substitution rule, when f is the integral of  v :  

example 4  1sin x cos x dx =&(sin x)'  + c 
+ c 
example 5  1sin2 x cos x dx = $(sin x ) ~  
example 6  j cos x sin x dx = - f (cos x ) ~+ c  u = cos x (compare example 4) 

u = sin x (compare example 6)

the next example has u = x2 - 1 and duldx = 2x. the key step is choosing u:

you  will soon be  able to do those in your sleep. officially the derivative of  (x + 2)4 
uses the chain rule. but the inside function u = x + 2 has duldx = 1. the "1"  is there 
automatically, and the graph shifts over-as

required  factor  2  is  missing  in  j cos 2x dx,  but  we  put  it  there  by  multiplying  and

check the derivative at the end. the exponent  5 cancels 5  in the denominator,  6x from

(4)

this  really  shows  how  substitution  works.  we  switch from x  to u, and we  also switch
from dx to du. the  most common  mistake is  to confuse  dx with  du.  the factor  du/dx
from the chain  rule is absolutely needed, to  reach du. the change  of variables (dummy
variables  anyway!)  leaves  an easy  integral,  and then  u turns back  into 3x2 +  1. here
are  the four  steps  to  substitute  u  for x:

1. choose  u(x)  and compute  du/dx
2.  locate  v(u)  times  du/dx times dx,  or  v(u) times du
3.  integrate  j v(u)  du to find  f(u) + c
4.  substitute  u(x)  back into  this antiderivative  f.

the  choice  of u  must  be  right,  to  change  everything  from  x  to  u.  with  ingenuity,
some remarkable  integrals are possible.  but most  will remain impossible  forever. the
functions cos x 2 and  1/  4 - sin 2 x have no  "elementary"  antiderivative. those integ-

the most frequent case when a suitable f (x) is not directly known. 

the integral of  v(x) is an antiderivative f(x) plus a  constant c.  this section takes 
two steps. first, we  choose c. second, we  construct f (x). the object is to define the 
integral-in 
the indefinite integral contains "+ c."  the constant is not settled because f (x) + c 
has the same slope for every  c.  when we  care only about the derivative, c makes 
no difference. when the goal is a number-a  definite integral-c  can be assigned a 
definite value at the starting point. 

for  mileage  traveled, we  subtract the reading at the start. this section  does the 
same  for  area.  distance  is  f(t)  and  area  is  f(x)-while 
the  definite  integral  is 
f (b) -f (a). don't pay attention to t or x, pay attention to the great formula of integral 
calculus: 

lab dt = iabv(x)d~ =f (b) -f (a). 

~ ( t )

viewpoint 1:  when f is known, the equation gives the area from a to b. 
viewpoint 2:  when f is not known, the equation defines f from the area. 

for a typical v(x), we  can't find f (x) by guessing or substitution. but still v(x) has an 
"area"  under its graph-and 

this yields the desired integral f (x). 

most  of  this section is theoretical, leading to the definition of  the integral.  you 
may think we  should have defined integrals before computing them-which 
is logi- 
cally true. but the idea of  area (and the use of  rectangles) was already pretty clear in 
our first examples. now  we  go much further. every continuous function  v(x) has an 
integral (also some discontinuous functions). then the fundamental theorem com- 
pletes  the  circle: the integral leads back  to  dfldx = u(x).  the area  up  to x  is  the 
antiderivative that we  couldn't  otherwise discover. 

the  constant of integration 

our goal is to turn f (x) + c into a definite integral- 
first requirement is to have area = zero at the start: 

the area between a and b.  the 

(2) 
for the area up to x (moving endpoint, indefinite integral), use t as the dummy variable: 

f (a) + c = starting area = 0  so  c = -f (a).

example i  the area under the graph of  5(x + 1)4 from a to b has f (x) = (x + 1)': 

find f (x), then substitute b and a. after 
the calculation has two separate steps-first 
the first step, check that df  /dx is v.  the upper limit in the second step gives plus f (b), 
the lower limit gives minus f(a). notice the brackets (or the vertical bar): 

f(x)]:  =f(b)-  f(a) 

x31:  = 8 - 1 

[cos  xi:'=cos 2t - 1. 

changing the example to f (x) = (x +  - 1 gives an equally good antiderivative- 

and now f (0)= 0. but f  (b)-f  (a)stays the same, because the  -1 disappears: 
[ ( x  + 1)'  - 11: = ((b+ 1)'  - 1)- ((a+ 1)'  - 1)= (b+ 1)'  - (a+ 1)'. 

example 2  when v = 2x sin x2 we  recognize f  = -cos x2. m e  area from 0 to 3 is 

the upper  limit copies the minus sign. the lower limit  gives  -(- cos 0), which  is 
+cos 0. that example shows the right form for  solving exercises on dejkite integrals. 

example 2 jumped  directly to f (x)= - cos x2. but  most  problems involving the 

chain rule go more slowly-by 

substitution. set u =x2, with duldx = 2x:

io3 

lo3  du

dx 

2x sin x2 dx = 

sin u -dx = 

sin u  du.

we need new limits when u replaces x2. those limits on u are a'  and b2.(in this case 
a'  = o2  and b2= 32= 9.) zfx goes from  a to b, then u goesfrom  ~ ( a )to u(b). 

1' = 

5.+ 

o2 + 5 and  u(1)

that  is  why  the  u-integral  goes from 

in this case u = x2 + 5. therefore duldx = 2x (or du = 2x dx for differentials). we have 
to  account  for  the  missing  2.  the  integral  is  qu4. the  limits  on  u =x2 + 5  are 
the
u(0)= 
alternative is to find f( x )= q(x2+ 5)4in one jump (and check  it). 
example 4  1:  sin x2 dx = ?? (no elementary function  gives  this integral). 
if we try cos x2,the chain rule produces an extra 2x-no  adjustment will work. does 
sin x2 still have an antiderivative? yes! every continuous v(x)has an f  (x).whether 
f  (x) has  an  algebraic formula  or  not,  we  can  write  it  as j v(x) dx.  to  define  that 
integral, we now take the limit of  rectangular areas.

integrals as  limits of  "riemann sums" 

we have come to the definition of the integral. the chapter started with the integrals 
of x and x2,from formulas for 1 + ..-+ n and l 2+ ..-+ n2.we will not go back to 
those formulas. but for other functions, too irregular to find exact sums, the rectangu- 
lar areas also approach a limit. 

that limit is the integral. this definition is a major step in the theory of  calculus. 
it can be studied in detail, or understood in principle. the truth is that the definition 
is not so painful-you  virtually know it already. 

problem  integrate the continuous function  v(x)over the interval [a, b]. 
step 1  split [a, b] into n subintervals [a, x,], [x,, x 2 ] ,  ..., [xn- b]. 

the "meshpoints"  x,,  x2, . .. divide up the interval from a to b. the endpoints are 
xo = a  and  x, = b.  the length  of  subinterval k is  ax, = xk - xk- l .  in  that  smaller 
interval, the minimum of  v(x)is mk.the maximum is m,. 

5.5  the  definite  integral 

203

now construct  rectangles. the  "lower rectangle" over interval k  has height mk.  the
"upper rectangle" reaches to mk.  since v is continuous,  there are points  xmin and  xmax
where  v = mk  and  v = mk  (extreme  value  theorem).  the graph of v(x) is in between.

important:  the  area under  v(x)  contains  the area "s"  of the lower  rectangles:

fb  v(x)  dx > m  ax1  + m2ax 2 + 

+ m, 

nx, = s. 

(5)

the  area  under  v(x) is  contained  in the area  "s"  of the upper  rectangles:

f bv(x) dx  max  + m2 ax 2 +  + maxn= s. 

(6)
the lower sum s and the upper sum s  were  computed  earlier  in  special  cases-when
v was  x  or  x 2 and the  spacings ax  were  equal.  figure  5.9a shows  why  s < area < s.

notice  an  important  fact.  when  a  new  dividing  point  x'  is  added,  the lower sum
increases. the  minimum  in  one  piece  can  be  greater  (see  second  figure)  than  the
original  mk.  similarly  the  upper sum  decreases. the  maximum  in  one  piece  can  be
below  the overall  maximum.  as  new  points are added, s goes  up  and s comes  down.
so  the  sums come  closer  together:

s  <  s'

is' <  s.

i  have  left  space  in between  for  the curved  area-the  integral  of v(x).

now  add  more  and  more  meshpoints  in  such  a  way  that  axmax  -+ 0.  the  lower
sums  increase  and  the  upper  sums  decrease.  they  never  pass  each  other.  if v(x)  is
continuous,  those  sums  close  in  on  a single number a. that  number  is  the  definite
integral-the area  under  the graph.
definition  the  area  a is  the  common  limit  of the lower  and upper  sums:

this limit  a exists for all continuous  v(x),  and also  for some discontinuous  functions.
when  it exists,  a  is the  "riemann integral" of v(x) from  a to b.

remarks  on  the  integral

as  for  derivatives,  so  for integrals:  the definition  involves  a limit.  calculus  is  built
on limits,  and we  always  add "if  the  limit exists."  that  is  the delicate  point. i  hope
the  next  five  remarks  (increasingly  technical)  will  help  to  distinguish functions  that
are riemann integrable from functions  that  are not.

remark 1  the  sums  s  and  s  may  fail  to  approach  the  same  limit.  a  standard
example  has  v(x)  = 1 at all fractions  x = p/q,  and  v(x)  = 0 at all  other points.  every

204 

5 

integrals

interval  contains  rational points (fractions) and irrational  points (nonrepeating deci-
mals).  therefore mk  = 0  and mk  =  1. the  lower  sum  is  always  s = 0.  the  upper  sum
is always s =  b - a (the sum of 1's times ax's).  the gap in equation (7)  stays open. this
function  v(x)  is  not  riemann  integrable.  the  area  under  its graph  is  not  defined  (at
least by  riemann-see  remark  5).

remark 2  the  step function  u(x)  is  discontinuous  but  still  integrable.  on  every
interval the minimum  mk  equals the maximum mk-except  on  the interval containing
the jump.  that jump interval has  mk =  0 and  mk =  1. but  when we  multiply  by axk,
and  require  axmax  -+ 0,  the  difference  between  s  and  s  goes  to  zero.  the  area  under
a step  function is  clear-the  rectangles  fit  exactly.

, 

remark 3  with  patience  another  key  step  could  be  proved:  if  s -+ a  and s -+  a for
one  sequence  of meshpoints,  then  this limit  a  is  approached by  every  choice  of mesh-
0.  the integral  is  the lower  bound  of all upper  sums  s, and it  is
points  with  axmax 
the  upper bound  of all  possible  s-provided  those  bounds are  equal.  the gap  must
close,  to define  the integral.

the  same limit a  is  approached  by  "in-between  rectangles."  the height  v(x*)  can
be  computed  at  any  point x*  in subinterval  k. see  figures  5.9c  and  5.10.  then  the
total  rectangular  area is  a  "riemann sum"  between  s and s:

s= v(x  )ax 1  + v(x*)ax 2 +  ...  + v(x*)ax. 

(9)
we  cannot  tell whether  the  true  area is  above  or below  s*.  very  often a  is  closer  to
s*  than to  s or s. the midpoint rule takes x * in the middle of its interval (figure 5.10),
and  section  5.8 will  establish  its  extra  accuracy.  the  extreme  sums  s and s  are used
in  the definition  while  s* is  used  in computation.

remark 4  every continuous function is riemann integrable. the proof is optional (in
my  class),  but  it belongs  here  for reference.  it starts  with  continuity  at  x*:  "for any
e there is a 6  .... " when  the rectangles  sit between  x* - 6  and  x* +  6, the bounds mk
and  mk  differ  by  less  than  2e.  multiplying  by  the  base  axk,  the  areas  differ  by  less
than  2e(axk).  combining  all  rectangles,  the  upper and lower  sums  differ  by less  than
2e(ax 1 + ax 2 +  ...  + ax,)= 2e(b - a).

as  e -+ 0  we  conclude  that  s  comes  arbitrarily  close  to  s. they  squeeze  in  on  a
single  number a.  the riemann  sums approach the riemann integral, ifv  is continuous.
two problems  are hidden  by that  reasoning. one is  at the end, where  s and  s come
together.  we  have  to  know  that  the  line of  real  numbers  has  no  "holes,"  so there  is
a  number  a  to  which  these  sequences  converge.  that is  true.

any  increasing sequence, if  it is bounded  above,  approaches a  limit.

the  decreasing  sequence  s,  bounded  below, converges  to  the same limit. so  a  exists.
the  other  problem  is  about  continuity.  we  assumed  without  saying  so  that  the

5.5  the definite integral 

width 26 is the same around every point x*. we did not allow for the possibility that 
6 might  approach  zero  where  v(x) is  rapidly  changing-in  which  case  an  infinite 
number of  rectangles could be  needed. our reasoning requires that 

v(x) is unifomly continuous: 6 depends on  e  but not  on the position  of x*. 

for each e  there is a 6 that works at all points in the interval. a  continuous function 
on  a  closed  interval  is  uniformly  continuous.  this  fact  (proof  omitted)  makes  the 
reasoning correct, and v(x) is integrable. 
on an infinite interval, even v = x2 is not uniformly continuous. it changes across 
a subinterval by (x* + ~ 5 ) ~- (x* - 6)2= 4x*6. as x* gets larger, 6 must get smaller- 
to keep 4x*6 below  e.  no single 6 succeeds at all x*. but on a finite interval [o,  b], 
the choice 6 =~ / 4 bworks everywhere-so 

v = x2 is uniformly continuous. 

remark 5 
if  those  four  remarks  were  fairly  optional,  this  one  is  totally  at  your 
discretion. modern mathematics needs to integrate the zero-one function v(x) in the 
first remark.  somehow  v has more 0's  than  1's.  the fractions (where v(x) = 1) can 
be put in a list, but the irrational numbers (where v(x) = 0) are "uncountable."  the 
integral ought to be zero, but riemann's  upper sums all involve m ,  = 1. 

lebesgue discovered a major improvement. he allowed infinitely many subintervals 
(smaller and smaller). then all fractions can be covered with intervals of total width 
e.  (amazing, when the fractions are packed so densely.) the idea is to cover 1/q, 2/q, 
. . . ,q/q by narrow intervals of total width ~ 1 2 ~ .  combining all q = 1,2, 3, .. . ,the total 
width  to  cover  all  fractions  is  no  more  than  e(& +$ +$ + --.)= e.  since  v(x) = 0 
everywhere else, the upper sum s is only e.  and since e  was arbitrary, the "lebesgue 
integral"  is zero as desired. 

that completes a fair amount of  theory, possibly more than you want or need- 

but it is satisfying to get things straight.  the definition of  the integral is still being 
studied  by  experts  (and  so  is  the  derivative,  again  to  allow  more  functions). by 
contrast,  the  properties  of  the  integral  are used  by  everybody. therefore the  next 
section turns  from definition to  properties,  collecting the  rules  that  are needed  in 
applications. they are very straightforward.

15.6  properties of  the integral and average value  m 


the previous section reached the definition of 1:: v(x) dx. but the subject cannot stop 
there. the integral was defined in order to be used. its properties are important, and 
its  applications are  even  more  important.  the  definition  was  chosen  so  that  the 
integral has properties that make the applications possible. 

one direct application is to the average value of  v(x). the average of  n numbers is 
clear, and the integral extends that idea-it  produces the average of a whole contin- 
uum of  numbers v(x). this develops from the last rule in the following list (property 
7). we now collect toget her seven basic properties of defirrite integrals. 
[v(x) + w(x)] dx  will  not  be  repeated-even 

though  this 
property of  linearity is the most fundamental. we  start instead with a different kind 
of  addition. there is only one function v(x), but now there are two intervals. 

the  addition rule  for 

the integral from  a to b is added to its neighbor from  b to c. their sum is the integral 

from  a to c. that is the first (not surprising) property in the list. 

5.6  properties  of the  integral  and average  value

207

property  1  areas  over  neighboring  intervals  add  to  the  area  over  the  combined
interval:

j  v(x)  dx + i'  v(x)  dx = j  v(x)  dx. 

(1)
this  sum of areas  is graphically  obvious (figure 5.1 la). it also comes  from the formal
definition  of the integral.  rectangular  areas  obey  (1)-with  a meshpoint  at x = b  to
make  sure.  when  axmax  approaches  zero,  their  limits  also  obey  (1).  all  the  normal
rules for rectangular areas are obeyed in the limit by  integrals.

property  1 is  worth  pursuing.  it indicates  how  to  define  the  integral  when  a =  b.
the  integral "from b  to b"  is the  area  over a point, which  we  expect  to be  zero.  it is.

fb  v(x) dx =  0.

property 2 
that  comes  from  property  1 when  c = b.  equation (1) has two  identical  integrals,  so
the  one from  b  to b must be zero.  next  we  see  what happens  if c = a-which  makes
the  second  integral  go  from  b  to a.

what happens when an integralgoes backward? the  "lower  limit"  is now the larger

number  b. the  "upper  limit"  a is  smaller. going  backward  reverses  the sign:

fa v(x)  dx =  - f~  v(x)  dx =f(a) -f(b).

property  3 
proof  when  c = a the  right  side  of (1) is  zero.  then  the  integrals  on  the  left  side
must cancel,  which  is  property 3.  in going from b to a the steps ax  are negative. that
justifies  a  minus  sign  on  the  rectangular  areas,  and  a  minus  sign  on  the  integral
(figure 5.1 1b).  conclusion: property  1 holds  for any  ordering  of a, b, c.

property 4  for  odd  functions  ja,  v(x)  dx = o0. "odd"  means  that  v(-  x) =  - v(x).
(cid:127)-a  v(x)  dx = 2  fo  v(x)  dx.  "even"  means  that v(-  x) =  +  v(x).
for even functions 
the functions  x, x3 , x 5, ... are  odd.  if x  changes sign,  these powers  change  sign.  the
functions  sin x  and tan x are  also  odd, together  with their  inverses.  this is  an impor-
tant family of functions,  and  the integral of an odd function from  - a to a equals zero.
areas  cancel:

j(cid:127)a 

6x  d= x]', 

a6  -(-  a)6 = 0.

if  v(x)  is  odd  then f(x) is  even!  all  powers  1, x 2, x4 ,...  are  even  functions.  curious
fact: odd function times even  function is  odd, but odd number times even  number  is
even.

for even functions,  areas  add:  j"a cos x dx = sin  a - sin(-  a) =  2 sin  a.

integrals

the  next  properties involve  inequalities.  if v(x) is  positive, the area under its graph
is positive  (not surprising).  now  we have  a  proof:  the  lower sums  s are  positive  and
they  increase  toward  the area  integral.  so  the integral  is  positive:

if v(x) > 0 for a < x < b  then  j  v(x)  dx > 0.

property  5 
a  positive  velocity  means  a  positive  distance.  a  positive  v lies  above a positive area.
a more  general  statement  is  true.  suppose  v(x)  stays  between  a  lower  function  1(x)
and an upper  function u(x).  then  the  rectangles  for v stay  between  the rectangles  for  1
and u.  in  the limit,  the  area  under  v (figure 5.12)  is between  the  areas  under  i and  u:

to  prove  sin  h < h  < tan  h. examples  1-2 seem  to  give  new and shorter proofs.  but  i
think the reasoning  is doubtful.  the inequalities  were needed  to compute  the deriva-
tives  (therefore  the  integrals)  in  the first  place.

(4)

with f'  = v, (3) and (4) are  the  same  equation.  but honesty  makes  me admit  to a  flaw
in  the  logic.  we  need  the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus  to  guarantee  that
f(x) = f  v(t)  dt really  gives  f'= v.

a direct  proof of (3) places  one rectangle  across  the interval  trom a to  b. now  raise
the top of that rectangle,  starting at vmin  (the bottom of the curve) and moving  up  to
vmax  (the top  of the curve).  at  some  height  the  area  will  be just  right-equal  to  the
area  under  the  curve.  then  the  rectangular  area,  which  is  (b - a) times  v(c),  equals
the curved  area  jf  v(x)  dx.  this  is  equation (3).

and  v,,,.  at  some  point  (at  two  points  in 

takes  on  every  height  between  v,,, 
figure 5.12~) the function  v(x) equals its own average value. 

figure 5.13 shows equal areas above and below the average height  v(c) = vave. 

example 4  the average value of  an odd function  is zero (between  -1 and  1): 

for once we know c. it is the center point x = 0, where v(c) = vav,  = 0. 

example 5  the average value of  x2 is f  (between 1 and  -1): 

(note ,,--7 

where does this function x2 equal its average value f? that happens when c2 = f ,  so 
c can be either of  the points i/&  and  -1/j? 
in figure 5.13b. those are the gauss 
points,  which are terrific for numerical integration as section 5.8 will show. 

example 6  the average value of  sin2 x over a period (zero to n) is i :

the point  c is n/4 or 344, where sin2 c = $.  the graph of sin2 x oscillates  around its 
average value f .  see the figure or the formula: 

sin2 x = f - f cos 2x. 

(5) 
the steady term is f ,  the oscillation is  -4 cos 2x. the integral is f (x) = i x  - sin 2x, 
which is the same as fx -i sin x cos x. this integral of  sin2 x will be seen again. please 
verify that df  /dx = sin2 x. 

the  average value and expected value 

the  "average  value"  from a  to b is the integral  divided by  the length  b - a. this 
was  computed for x and x2 and sin2 x, but  not  explained.  it is a major  application 
of  the integral,  and it is guided by  the ordinary average of  n numbers: 

vave  = -

comes from 

uave = - (vl + v2 + .. . + v,).

(note  b-o -1 )

in ordinary language: "the average value of the numbers between 0 and 1 is 4."  since 
a whole continuum of  numbers lies between 0 and  1, that statement is meaningless 
until we  have integration. 
the average value of  the squares of  those numbers is (x2),,,  =  x2 dx/(b - a) = 4. 
ifyou pick  a number randomly between 0 and 1, its expected value is 5 and its expected 
square is 3. 
to me that sentence is a puzzle. first, we  don't  expect the number to be exactly 
&so  we need to define "expected  value."  second, if  the expected value is 9, why is 
the expected square equal to 3 instead of i?the ideas come from id203 theory, 
and calculus is leading us to continuous id203. we introduce it briefly here, and 
come back to it in chapter 8. 

predlclable averages  from  random events 

suppose you  throw a pair of  dice. the outcome is not predictable. otherwise why 
throw them? but  the  average over  more  and more  throws is totally predictable. we 
don't  know what will happen, but we  know its id203. 

for dice, we are adding two numbers between 1 and 6. the outcome is between 2 
and 12. the id203 of  2 is the chance of  two ones: (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36. beside each 
outcome we  can write its id203: 

to repeat, one roll is unpredictable. only the probabilities are known, and they add 
to  1. (those fractions add to 36/36; all possibilities are covered.) the total from a 
million rolls is even more unpredictable-it 
can be anywhere between 2,000,000 and 
12,000,000. nevertheless the average of those million outcomes is almost completely 
predictable. this expected value is found by  adding the products in that line above: 
expected value: multiply (outcome)times (id203 of  outcome) and add: 

if  you throw the dice 1000 times, and the average is not between 6.9 and 7.1,  you  get 
an a.  use the random number generator on a computer and round off  to integers. 

now  comes continuous id203.  suppose all numbers  between  2 and  12 are 
equally probable. this means all numbers-not 
just integers. what is the id203 
of  hitting the particular number x = n? it is zero! by  any reasonable measure, n has 

5.6  properties of the integral and average value 

no  chance to occur.  in  the  continuous case,  every  x  has  id203  zero.  but  an 
interval of  x's  has a nonzero id203: 

the id203  of  an outcome between 2 and 3 is  1/10 
the id203  of  an outcome between x and x + ax  is ax110 

to  find  the  average, add  up  each  outcome times  the  id203  of  that  outcome. 
first  divide  2 to  12 into intervals of  length  ax = 1 and id203  p = 1/10. if  we 
round off  x, the average is 63: 

here all outcomes are integers (as with dice). it is more accurate to use 20 intervals 
of  length  112 and id203  1/20. the average is  6$,  and you see what is coming. 
these are rectangular  areas (riemann sums). as  ax  -+  0 they  approach an integral. 
the id203 of  an outcome between x and x + dx is p(x) dx, and this problem has 
p(x) = 1/10. the average outcome in the continuous case is not a sum but  an integral: 

expected  value e(x) = 

xp(x) dx = s212 x 10= 20]2 

dx 

x2  l 2

= 7. 

that is a big jump.  from the point of view of  integration, it is a limit of  sums. from 
the point of view of id203, the chance of each outcome is zero but the id203 
density  at  x  is  p(x) = 1/10. the  integral  of  p(x)  is  1,  because  some  outcome  must 
happen.  the  integral  of  xp(x) is  x,,,  = 7,  the  expected  value.  each  choice  of  x  is 
random, but the average is predictable. 

this completes a first step in id203 theory. the second step comes after more 
calculus.  decaying  probabilities  use  e-"  and e-"'-then 
the chance  of  a  large  x  is 
very  small.  here  we  end  with  the  expected  values  of  xn and  i/&  and  l/x, for  a 
random choice between 0 and  1 (so p(x) = 1): 

a confusion about  "expected"  class  size 

a college can advertise  an average  class size of  29, while most  students are in large 
classes most of  the time. i will  show quickly how that happens. 
suppose there are 95 classes of  20 students and 5 classes of 200 students. the total 
enrollment  in  100 classes is  1900 + 1000 = 2900.  a random  professor  has  expected 
class size 29.  but a  random  student sees it  differently. the id203  is  1900/2900 
of  being  in  a  small class and  1000/2900 of  being in  a  large class.  adding  class size 
times id203  gives the expected class size for  the student: 

(20)(e)+ (200)(iwo)  = 82 students in the class.

similarly, the average waiting  time at a  restaurant  seems like 40 minutes (to the 
customer). to the hostess, who averages over the whole day, it is  10 minutes. if  you 
came at a random time it  would be  10, but  if  you are a  random customer it is 40. 

traffic problems could be eliminated by  raising the average number  of  people per 
car  to  2.5,  or  even  2.  but  that  is  virtually  impossible.  part  of  the  problem  is  the

5.7  the  fundamental theorem and its applications 

when the endpoints are fixed at a and b, we  have a definite integral. when the upper 
limit is a variable point x, we  have an indefinite integral. more generally: when the 
endpoints depend in any way  on x, the integral is a function  of x. therefore we  can 
find its derivative. this requires the fundamental theorem of  calculus. 

the essence of the theorem is: derivative of integral of v equals v.  we also compute 

the derivative when the integral goes from a(x) to b(x)-both 
part 2 of  the fundamental theorem reverses the order: integral ofderivative o f f  
equals f + c .  that will follow quickly from part 1, with help from the mean  value 
theorem. it is part 2 that we  use  most, since integrals are harder than derivatives. 
after  the proofs we  go to new applications, beyond the standard problem of  area 
just rectangles. 

under a curve. integrals can add up rings and triangles and shells-not 
the answer can be a volume or a id203-not 

limits variable. 

just  an area. 

the  fundamental  theorem,  part  1 

start with  a continuous  function v. integrate  it  from a fixed  point  a to a  variable 
point  x.  for each x, this integral f(x) is a number.  we  do not  require or expect a 
formula for f (x)-it 
is the area out to the point x. it is a function of x! the fundamen- 
tal theorem says that this area function has a derivative (another limiting process). 
the derivative df  ldx equals the original v(x). 

5 

integrals 

the dummy variable is written  as t, so we  can concentrate on the limits. the val 
of  the integral depends on the limits a and x, not on t. 

to find df  ldx, start with af  =f (x + ax) -f (x) = diflerence  of  areas: 

~f= i."+ax  dt -1;  v(t) dt = 

~ ( t )

(1) 
officially, this is property 1.the area out to x + ax minus the area out to x equals 
the small part from x to x + ax.  now divide by  ax: 

v(t) dt. 

1 
af  -
- - -  

ax  ax i 

x+ax

v(t) dt = average value = v(c).

this is property 7, the mean value theorem for integrals. the average value on this 
short  interval equals v(c).  this point  c is somewhere between  x  and x + ax  (exact 
position not known), and we let ax approach zero. that squeezes c toward x, so v(c) 
that  v  is  continuous.  the limit  of  equation (2) is  the 
approaches u(x)-remember 
fundamental theorem: 

af-+ d f  
ax 
dx 

and  v(c) + u(x)  so  - = v(x).

df
dx 

if  ax  is  negative  the  reasoning  still  holds.  why  assume  that  v(x)  is  continuous? 
because if  v  is a step function,  then f (x) has a corner where dfldx  is not v(x). 

we could skip the mean value theorem and simply bound  v above and below: 

for t between x and x + ax: 
integrate over that interval: 

umin 6  ~ ( t )g vmax 

vminaxq  af  g vmaxax 

(4) 

as ax -,0,  umin and vmax approach v(x). in the limit dfldx  again equals v(x).

graphical meaning  the f-graph  gives the area under the v-graph. the thin strip in 
figure 5.14, has  area af.  that area is approximately  v(x) times ax.  dividing  by  its 
base, aflax  is close to the height v(x). when ax  -* 0 and the strip becomes infinitely 
thin, the expression "close to"  converges to "equals."  then df  ldx is the height at v(x). 

derivatives with variable  endpoints 


when  the upper  limit is  x,  the  derivative  is  v(x).  suppose the  lower  limit is x.  the 
integral goes from x to 6,instead of  a to x. when x moves, the lower limit moves. 

5.7  the  fundamental theorem and its applications 

the change in area is on the left side of figure 5.15. as x goesforward, area is removed. 
so there is a minus sign in the derivative of  area: 

the derivative of  g(x) = 

v(t) dt 

is  - = - v(x).

dg
dx 

the quickest proof is to reverse b and x, which reverses the sign (property 3):

1' 

g(x) = -

v(t) dt  so by  part i  -= - v(x).

dg
dx 

fig. 5.15  area from x  to b has dgldx = - u(x). area  v(b)db is added, area v(a)da is lost 

the general case is messier but not much  harder (it is quite useful). suppose both 
limits are changing.  the upper  limit  b(x) is  not necessarily  x,  but  it  depends on x. 
the lower limit a(x) can also depend on x (figure 5.15b). the area a  between  those 
limits changes as x changes, and we want daldx: 

v(t) dt 

da
then  - = v(b(x)) - - v(a(x))-.
dx 

da

db

the figure shows two thin strips, one added to the area and one subtracted. 

first check the two cases we know. when a = 0 and b = x, we have daldx = 0 and 
dbldx = 1. the derivative according to (6) is v(x) times 1 -the  fundamental theorem. 
the other case has a = x and b = constant. then the lower limit in (6) produces -v(x). 
when the integral goes from a = 2x to b = x3, its derivative is new: 

example  1 

a = 5;:  cos t dt = sin x3 - sin 2x 
dajdx = (cos x3)(3x2) - (cos 2x)(2). 

that fits with (6), because dbldx is 3x2 and daldx is 2 (with minus sign). it also looks 
like the chain rule-which 

it is! to prove (6) we  use the letters v  and f: 

a = 

~ ( t )dt =j(h(x)) -f (a(x)) 

(by part 2 below) 

(by the chain rule) 

since f '  = v,  equation  (6) is  proved.  in  the  next  example  the  area  turns  out  to  be 
constant, although it seems to depend on x. note that v(t) = l/t so v(3x) = 1/3x.

the  fundamental theorem, part  2 


we have used  a  hundred times the theorem  that is now  to be  proved.  it is  the key 
to integration. "the integral  of  dfldx  is f (x) + c."  the application  starts with  v(x). 
we search for an f (x) with  this derivative.  if  dfldx  = v(x), the theorem  says that 

we can't  rely on knowing formulas for v  and f-only 

the definitions of  and dldx. 
the proof rests on one extremely special case: dfldx  is the zero function.  we easily 
find f (x)= constant.  the problem  is to prove that there are no other possibilities:  f '  
must be constant. when the slope is zero, the graph must be flat.  everybody  knows 
this is true, but intuition is not the same as proof. 

assume that df  ldx = 0 in an interval. iff (x) is not constant, there are points where 

f (a) #f (b). by  the mean value theorem, there is a point c where 

f '(c) =  (b) -f 
b - a  

(this is not zero  because f (a)#f (b)).

but f '(c) # 0 directly contradicts df  ldx = 0. therefore f (x) must  be  constant. 

note  the crucial role  of  the  mean  value  theorem. a  local hypothesis (dfldx = 0 
at each  point) yields  a  global  conclusion  (f = constant  in  the  whole  interval). the 
derivative narrows the field of view, the integral widens it. the mean value theorem 
connects instantaneous to average, local  to global, points  to intervals.  this  special 
case (the zero function) applies when  a(x) and f(x) have the same derivative: 

ifdaldx  = dfldx  on an interval, then  a(x) =f(x) + c. 

(7) 

reason: the derivative  of  a(x) -f (x) is zero. so a(x) -f (x) must  be  constant. 

now  comes  the  big  theorem.  it  assumes that  v(x) is  continuous,  and  integrates 

using f (x): 

5d 

(fu~tdamental theorem, part 2) if  u(x) = 

dx 

u(x) dx =f (b) -f (a).

proof  the antiderivative is f (x). but part 1gave another antiderivative for the same 
v(x). it was  the  integral-constructed 

from  rectangles and now called  a(x): 

v ( t ) d t   alsohas  ---=v(x).

da 
dx 

since  a' = v  and f '  = v,  the  special  case  in  equation (7) states that  a(x) =f (x)+ c. 
that is the essential point:  the integral from  rectangles equals f (x)+ c. 
at  the lower  limit  the  area integral  is  a = 0.  so f (a)+ c = 0.  at  the  upper  limit 
j'(b) + c = a(b). subtract to find  a(b), the definite  integral: 

calculus  is  beautiful-its 

fundamental  theorem  is also its most  useful  theorem. 

5.7  the  fundamental  theorem  and  its applications

217

another  proof of part 2  starts with  f'  = v and  looks  at subintervals:

f(xi) - f(a) = v(x*)(xi  - a)

f(x 2)  -f(x 1)=  v(x2)(x2  - xi)

(by  the  mean  value  theorem)
(by the  mean  value  theorem)

f(b) - f(x  -,)  =  v(x,*)(b - x, _)

(by the  mean  value  theorem).

the left  sides  add to  f(b) -f(a).  the  sum  on  the  right,  as  ax  -- 0,  is j  v(x)  dx.

applications  of  integration

up  to  now  the  integral  has  been  the  area  under  a  curve.  there  are  many  other
applications,  quite different  from areas.  whenever addition becomes "continuous,"  we
have integrals instead of sums. chapter 8 has space  to develop  more  applications,  but
four examples  can  be  given  immediately--which  will make  the  point.

we stay with geometric problems, rather than launching into physics or engineering
or  biology  or  economics.  all  those  will  come.  the  goal  here  is  to  take  a  first  step
away  from rectangles.

example  3  (for circles)  the  area a and circumference  c  are related by  da/dr  = c.
the  question  is  why.  the  area  is  7r2. its  derivative  27nr is  the  circumference.  by  the
fundamental  theorem,  the  integral  of  c  is  a.  what  is  missing  is  the  geometrical
reason.  certainly  rr2 is  the integral  of 2nrr,  but what  is  the real explanation  for  a  =
j c(r) dr?
my  point  is  that  the pieces are not rectangles. we  could  squeeze  rectangles  under
a  circular  curve,  but  their  heights  would  have  nothing  to  do  with  c.  our intuition
has to  take  a  completely  different  direction,  and  add  up the  thin rings in  figure  5.16.

shell volume = 4ntr 2ar

fig.  5.16  area  of circle  = integral  over  rings.  volume  of  sphere = integral  over  shells.

suppose  the ring thickness  is  ar.  then  the ring area  is close  to  c  times ar. this  is
precisely the kind of approximation we need,  because its error is of higher order  (ar)2.
the integral adds ring areas just  as  it  added  rectangular  areas:

a = 

c  dr = 

2nr dr =  ir 2 .

that  is  our first  step toward  freedom,  away  from  rectangles  to  rings.

218 

5  integrals

the  ring area  aa  can  be  checked  exactly-it  is  the difference  of circles:

aa  = ir(r + ar)2 -

trr2 =  2rr ar +  7r(ar)2 .

this  is  car plus  a  correction.  dividing  both  sides  by  ar - 0  leaves  da/dr =  c.

finally  there is  a geometrical  reason. the  ring  unwinds  into a thin strip.  its width
is  ar and its length is close  to  c.  the inside  and outside  circles  have different  perime-
ters,  so  this is  not  a true  rectangle-but  the area  is  near  car.

example  4  for a  sphere,  surface  area  and  volume  satisfy  a  = dv/dr.
what  worked  for  circles  will  work  for  spheres.  the thin  rings  become  thin shells. a
shell  goes  from  radius r to  radius  r + ar, so  its  thickness  is  ar. we  want  the  volume
of the shell,  but  we  don't  need  it  exactly.  the  surface  area  is  47rr2 , so  the  volume  is
about  47rr 2 ar.  that  is close  enough!

again  we are  correct  except  for (ar)2. infinitesimally  speaking dv= a  dr:

v = 

a  dr = 

4rr2 dr =  rr3 .

this  is the  volume  of a  sphere.  the  derivative  of  v is  a,  and  the  shells  explain  why.
main  point:  integration is not restricted to  rectangles.

example  5  the distance around a square  is 4s. why does the area  have dalds = 2s?
the side  is s  and the area  is  s2.  its  derivative 2s  goes only  half way  around the square.
i tried to  understand  that by drawing a figure. normally  this works,  but in the figure
dalds  looks  like  4s.  something  is  wrong.  the  bell  is  ringing  so  i leave  this  as  an
exercise.

example6  find the  area  under  v(x)= cos-  x from  x= 0  to  x= 1.
that is a conventional  problem,  but we  have no  antiderivative  for cos-  x. we  could
look harder,  and  find  one.  however  there is  another  solution-unconventional  but
correct.  the  region can  be filled with  horizontal rectangles (not  vertical  rectangles).
figure  5.17b  shows  a typical  strip of length  x = cos v (the curve  has v = cos'- x).  as
the thickness  av  approaches  zero,  the total  area becomes j x dv.  we  are  integrating
upward,  so  the limits are on v not on x:

area =  o2  cos  v dv =  sin v]-' 2 =  1.

the  exercises  ask you  to set  up  other  integrals-not  always  with  rectangles.  archi-
medes  used  triangles  instead  of rings  to  find  the area  of a circle.

5.8  numerical integration 

this section concentrates on definite integrals. the inputs are y(x)and two endpoints 
a  and  b.  the  output  is  the  integral  i.  our  goal  is  to  find  that  number
1;  y(x) d x  = i, accurately  and in  a  short time.  normally  this goal is achievable-as 
soon as we have a good method for computing integrals. 

our  two  approaches  so  far  have  weaknesses.  the  search  for  an  antiderivative 
succeeds in important cases,  and chapter 7 extends that range-but 
generally  f ( x )  
is not available. the other approach (by rectangles) is in the right direction but too 
crude. the height is set  by  y(x) at the right  and left end of each small interval.  the 
right and left rectangle rules add the areas ( a x  times y): 

r,=(ax)(y,+y,+ 

-.. +y,)  and  l n = ( a x ) ( y o + y l +   .--+y,-,). 

the value of  y(x) at the end of interval j is yj. the extreme left value yo = y(a) enters 
l, . with  n  equal  intervals  of  length  a x  = ( b- a)/n, the extreme  right  value  is y,  = 
y(b). it  enters  r,.  otherwise  the  sums  are the  same-simple 
to  compute,  easy  to 
visualize, but very inaccurate. 

this  section  goes from  slow  methods  (rectangles) to better  methods  (trapezoidal 
and  midpoint) to good methods (simpson and  gauss). each  improvement  cuts down 
the error. you  could discover the formulas without  the book,  by  integrating x  and

x 2 and  x 4. the  rule  r,  would  come  out  on  one  side  of the answer,  and  l,  would be
on  the other  side.  you  would figure  out what  to  do  next, to  come  closer to  the exact
integral.  the book  can  emphasize  one key  point:

the  quality  of a formula depends  on how  many  integrals
f  1 dx, f  x  dx, f x 2 dx,  ..., it computes  exactly.  if f xp dx
is the first to be  wrong, the  order of accuracy  is  p.

by  testing  the  integrals  of  1, x,  x 2, ..., we  decide  how  accurate  the formulas  are.

figure  5.18  shows  the  rectangle  rules  r,  and  l,.  they  are already wrong  when
y =  x.  these  methods  are first-order: p =  1. the  errors  involve  the  first  power  of
ax-where  we  would  much  prefer  a  higher  power.  a  larger  p  in  (ax)p  means  a
smaller error.

when the  graph of y(x) is a straight line, the  integral i is known. the error triangles
e  and  e  have  base  ax.  their  heights  are  the  differences  yj+ 1 - yj.  the  areas  are
'(base)(height),  and  the  only  difference  is  a  minus  sign.  (l is  too  low,  so  the  error
l - i  is  negative.) the  total  error  in r.  is  the  sum  of the  e's:

r,  - i =   ax(y  - yo)  +  -.-  +   ax(y  - yn-_1)=  ax(y.  - yo). 

all  y's between  yo  and  y,  cancel.  similarly  for  the  sum  of the e's:
-   ax(yn - yo) =  - ax[y(b  - y(a)].

the  greater the  slope  of y(x),  the  greater the  error-since  rectangles  have  zero  slope.
formulas  (1) and  (2)  are  nice-but those errors are large. to  integrate  y = x  from
a = 0 to b =  1, the error  is   ax(1 - 0).  it takes  500,000 rectangles  to  reduce  this error
to  1/1,000,000.  this  accuracy is reasonable,  but that many rectangles  is unacceptable.
the  beauty  of the error  formulas  is  that  they  are  "asymptotically correct" for  all
functions.  when  the graph  is  curved,  the errors  don't  fit  exactly  into triangles.  but
the  ratio  of predicted  error  to  actual  error  approaches  1. as  ax  -+ 0,  the  graph  is
almost  straight  in  each  interval-this  is  linear  approximation.

the  error  prediction    ax[y(b) - y(a)] is  so  simple  that  we  test  it on  y(x) =  x:

i =  o

the  error  decreases  along  each  row.  so  does  ax =  .1, .01,  .001,  .0001.  multiplying  n
by  10  divides  ax  by  10.  the error  is  also  divided  by  10  (almost).  the  error is nearly
proportional to  ax-typical  of first-order  methods.

the predicted  error  is    ax, since  here y(1)  =  1 and  y(o) = 0.  the computed  errors
in  the table  come closer  and  closer  to   ax = .5, .05, .005,  .0005. the prediction  is the
"leading  term"  in  the  actual error.

222

integrals

the  table  also  shows  a  curious  fact.  subtracting  the  last  row  from the  row above
gives  exact  numbers  1, .1, .01,  and  .001.  this is  (r,  - i) - (l, - i), which  is r,  - l,.
it comes  from an  extra rectangle  at the right,  included  in r.  but not  l,.  its height is
1 and its area  is  1, .1, .01,  .001.

the  errors in r.  and l. almost cancel.  the average  t, =   (r, + l,)  has less error-

it  is  the  "trapezoidal  rule."  first we  give  the rectangle  prediction  two  final tests:

errors 
j (x2 - x)  dx: 
j dx/(l0 + cos  2nx):  errors 

n = l 
1.7  10- '

2 . 10-'4 

"0" 

1.7*10 - 7

"0"

n = 100  n= 1000

those  errors  are falling  faster than  ax.  for  y =  x 2 - x  the  prediction  explains  why:
y(o)  equals  y(l).  the leading  term,  with  y(b) minus  y(a),  is  zero. the  exact  errors are
'(ax) 2, dropping from  10-1 to  10- 3  to  10- 5  to  10- 7 . in these examples l,  is identical
to  r.  (and  also  to  t,),  because  the  end  rectangles  are  the  same.  we  will  see  these
((ax) 2  errors  in  the trapezoidal  rule.

the  last  row  in  the  table  is  more  unusual.  it shows  practically  no  error.  why  do

the  rectangle  rules  suddenly  achieve  such  an  outstanding  success?

the  reason is  that y(x) = 1/(10 + cos 2nrx) is periodic. the leading  term in the error
is zero, because y(o)  = y(l). also the next term will be zero, because y'(0) = y'(1). every
power  of ax  is multiplied  by zero,  when we  integrate  over a  complete  period.  so  the
errors  go  to zero  exponentially  fast.
i  tried  to  integrate  1/(10 + cos  27rx)  by  hand  and  failed.  then  i was
personal note 
embarrassed  to discover  the answer in my book on  applied mathematics.  the method
was  a  special  trick  using  complex  numbers,  which  applies  over  an  exact  period.
finally i found  the antiderivative  (quite complicated) in a handbook  of integrals,  and
verified  the area  1/-99.

the  trapezoidal  and  midpoint  rules

we  move  to  integration  formulas  that  are  exact  when  y =  x.  they  have  second-
order accuracy. the  ax  error  term  disappears.  the  formulas  give  the  correct  area
under straight lines.  the predicted  error is  a multiple  of (ax) 2. that multiple  is found
by  testing  y = x2-for  which  the answers  are  not exact.

the  first  formula  combines  r.  and  l,.  to  cancel  as  much  error  as  possible,  take
trapezoidal rule,  which  approximates

the  average  !(r,  + l,).  this  yields  the 
sy(x) dx by  tn:

another way to find  t.is from the area  of the "trapezoid"  below  y = x in figure  5.19a.

the base is ax  and  the  sides have  heights  yj-l  and  yj.  adding  those areas gives 
+(l,+ r,)  in formula (3)-the  coefficients of  yj combine into f + f = 1. only the first 
and  last  intervals  are  missing  a  neighbor,  so  the rule  has  fyo and  fy,.  because 
trapezoids (unlike rectangles) fit under a sloping line,  t,, is exact when y = x. 

what is the difference from rectangles? the trapezoidal rule gives weight fax  to 
yo and y,.  the rectangle  rule  r,  gives full weight  ax  to y,  (and no  weight  to yo). 
r,  - t,is exactly the leading error fy,  -+yo. the change to t,,knocks out that error. 
another important formula is exact for y(x) = x. a rectangle has the same area as 
a trapezoid, if the height of the rectangle is halfway between yj - and yj . on a straight 
line graph that is achieved at the midpoint of  the interval. by  evaluating y(x) at the 
halfway points fax,  ax,  ax,  ..., we  get much better rectangles. this leads to the 
midpoint rule m n: 

1; 

for 

x dx,  trapezoids  give 

= 8.  the midpoint rule  gives 
4 + 4+ 3 + 3= 8, again correct. the rules become different when y = x2, because y,,, 
is no longer the average of  yo and y,.  try both second-order rules on x2:

-1/120000 

the errors fall by  100 when n is multiplied by  10. the midpoint rule is twice as good 
(- 1/12 vs.  116). since all smooth functions are close to parabolas (quadratic approxi- 
mation in each interval), the leading errors come from figure 5.19.  the trapezoidal 
error is exactly 

when y(x) is x2 (the 12 in the formula divides the 2 in y'): 

for  exact error  formulas, change yt(b) - yt(a) to (b - a)ym(c).the location of  c  is 
unknown (as in the mean value theorem). in practice these formulas are not much 
used-they 
involve the pth  derivative at an  unknown location c.  the main  point 
about the error is the factor  ax)^. 

one crucial fact is easy to overlook in our tests. each value of  y(x) can be extremely 
hard to compute. every time a formula asks for yj, a computer calls a subroutine. the 
goal of  numerical integration is to get below  the error tolerance, while calling for a 
minimum number of  values of  y.  second-order rules need about a thousand values for 
a typical tolerance of 

the next methods are better. 

fourth-order rule:  simpson 

the  trapezoidal  error  is  nearly  twice  the  midpoint  error  (116  vs.  -1/12). so  a 
good combination will have twice as much of  m,  as t,. that is simpson's rule: 

multiply the midpoint  values by  213 = 416.  the endpoint values  are multiplied by 

224 

5 

integrals

2/6,  except  at  the  far  ends  a and  b  (with  heights  yo  and  y,). this  1-4-2-4-2-4-1
pattern  has  become  famous.

simpson's  rule  goes  deeper  than  a  combination  of  t  and  m.  it  comes  from  a
parabolic approximation  to y(x) in  each interval.  when  a parabola  goes  through yo,
yl/2, yl, the area  under  it is  !ax(yo  +  4 yl/2+  yi). this is  s over  the first interval.  all
our rules are constructed this way:  integrate correctly as many powers 1, x, x 2,  ...  as
possible. parabolas  are  better  than  straight  lines,  which  are  better  than  flat  pieces.
s  beats  m,  which  beats  r.  check  simpson's  rule  on  powers  of x,  with  ax =  1/n:

error if y = x 2  
error if y = x3  
error if y = x4

exact  answers for x 2 are  no  surprise.  s,  was  selected  to  get  parabolas  right. but the
zero errors  for x3  were  not expected.  the  accuracy  has jumped  to fourth order, with
errors  proportional  to (ax)4. that explains  the  popularity  of simpson's  rule.

to  understand  why  x3  is integrated  exactly,  look at the interval  [-1, 1].  the  odd

function  x3  has zero  integral,  and  simpson  agrees  by symmetry:

the  gauss  rule  (optional)

we  need  a  competitor  for  simpson,  and  gauss  can  compete  with  anybody.  he
calculated  integrals  in  astronomy,  and  discovered  that  two  points  are enough for a
fourth-order method. from  -1  to  1 (a single  interval) his rule  is

i_ y(x)  dx ?% y(-  1//3) + y(1/-,3).  

(9)
those  "gauss points" x = - 1/,3  and  x =  1/,3 can  be  found  directly.  by  placing
them  symmetrically,  all  odd  powers  x, x 3, ... are  correctly  integrated.  the  key  is  in
y =  x2 , whose integral  is 2/3.  the gauss  points  - x,  and  +  xg  get  this integral right:

to  ax.  the  gauss  points  are
(1    1/  (cid:127))  ax/2.  they  are  not  as  convenient  as  simpson's  (which  hand  calculators
prefer).  gauss  is  good  for  thousands  of integrations  over  one  interval.  simpson  is

good when intervals go back  to back-then  simpson also uses two y's  per interval.

definite  integrals on a calculator 

it is fascinating to know how numerical integration  is actually done. the points  are 
not  equally  spaced!  for  an integral from 0  to  1, hewlett-packard machines  might 
internally  replace  x  by  3u2 - 2u3 (the limits  on  u  are  also  0  and  1). the  machine 
remembers  to change dx. for example, 

1:  5 becomes 

algebraically that looks  worse-but 
the infinite value  of  l/&  at x = 0 disappears 
at u = 0. the differential 6(u - u2) du  was  chosen  to  vanish  at u = 0 and u = 1. we 
infinity is most common. in the u variable 
don't  need  y(x) at the endpoints-where 
the integration  points  are equally  spaced-therefore 

in x  they are not. 

when  a difficult point is inside [a, b],  break  the interval in two pieces. and  chop 
off  integrals  that  go  out  to  infinity.  the  integral  of  epx2 should  be  stopped  by 
x = 10, since the tail is so thin. (it is bad to go too far.) rapid oscillations  are among 
the toughest- 
the answer depends on cancellation of highs and lows, and the calcula- 
tor requires many integration  points. 

the  change from  x  to u  affects  periodic  functions.  i  thought  equal  spacing was 
good, since  1/(10 + cos 2nx) was integrated  above to enormous accuracy. but there 
is  a danger  called aliasing. if  sin 8nx is  sampled with  ax = 118, it  is always zero. a 
high frequency 8 is confused with  a low frequency 0 (its "alias"  which  agrees at the 
sample points). with unequal spacing the problem disappears.  notice how any integ- 
ration  method can be  deceived: 

ask  for  the integral of y = 0 and specify the accuracy. the calculator 
samples y at x,, . . . , x,.  (with a pause key, the x's may be displayed.) 
then  integrate  y(x) = (x - x , ) ~  (x - x , ) ~ .  that  also  returns  the 
answer zero (now wrong), because the calculator follows the same steps. 

on  the  hp-28s  you  enter  the  function,  the  endpoints,  and  the  accuracy.  the 
variable x can be named  or not (see the margin). the outputs 4.67077 and 4.7e-5 are 
the requested  integral 
ex dx and the estimated error bound. your input accuracy 
.00001 guarantees 

3 :   ' e x p ( x 1 '

3 :   ( ( e x p i )  
2 :       1   2 3  
1 : . 0 0 0 0 1  

the  machine  estimates  accuracy  based  on  its  experience  in  sampling  y(x). if  you 
guarantee ex within .00000000001, it thinks you want high accuracy and takes longer. 
in consulting for hp, william kahan chose formulas using  1, 3, 7,  15, . . . sample 
points.  each  new  formula  uses the  samples in  the previous  formula. the calculator 
stops when  answers are close. the last paragraphs are based  on kahan's  work.

exponentials and logarithms 

this chapter is devoted to exponentials like 2" and  10" and above all ex. the goal is 
to understand  them, differentiate them, integrate them,  solve equations with  them, 
and invert them (to reach the logarithm). the overwhelming importance of  ex makes 
this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics. 

in the traditional  order of calculus books, ex waits until other applications of  the 
integral are complete. i would like to explain why  it is placed earlier here. i believe 
that  the equation  dyldx = y has to be emphasized above techniques of  integration. 
the laws of nature are expressed by  drflerential equations, and at the center is ex. its 
applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering 
(and more-wherever  change is influenced by the present state). the model produces 
a differential equation and i want to show what calculus can do. 

the key is always bm+"= (bm)(b3. section 6.1 applies that rule in three ways: 
1.  to understand the logarithm as the exponent; 
2.  to draw graphs  on ordinary and semilog and log-log paper; 
3.  to find derivatives. the slope of b"  will use bx+*" =(bx)(bh"). 

. 

h6.1  an  overview 

there  is  a  good  chance  you  have  met  logarithms.  they  turn  multiplication into 
addition, which is a lot simpler. they are the basis for slide rules (not so important) 
and  for  graphs  on  log  paper  (very  important).  logarithms  are  mirror  images  of 
exponentials-and 

those i know you have met. 

start with exponentials. the numbers 10 and lo2and  lo3 are basic to the decimal 
system. for completeness i also include lo0, which is  "ten  to the zeroth power"  or 
1. the logarithms of those numbers are the exponents. the logarithms of  1 and  10 and 
100 and 1000 are 0 and  1 and 2 and  3. these are logarithms "to  base  10,"because 
the powers are powers of  10. 
question  when the base changes from  10 to b,  what is the logarithm of  l ?  
answer 

since b0 = 1, logj  is always zero. to base b,  the logarithm of bn is n. 

6.1  an  overview

229

negative  powers  are  also  needed.  the number  10x is  positive, but its  exponent  x  can
be  negative.  the  first examples  are  1/10 and  1/100,  which  are  the  same as  10-'  and
10- 2. the logarithms are the exponents  -1  and  -2:

1000 = 103  
1/1000  =  10- 3

and

and

log  1000 =  3

log  1/1000 =  - 3.

multiplying  1000  times  1/1000  gives  1 =  100.  adding  logarithms  gives  3 + (-  3) = 0.
always  10m times  10"  equals  10" +".in particular  103 times  102  produces  five  tens:

(10)(10)(10)  times  (10)(10)  equals  (10)(10)(10)(10)(10)  =  105.

the  law  for  b"  times  b" extends  to  all  exponents,  as  in  104.6  times  10'.  furthermore
the  law  applies  to  all  bases  (we  restrict  the  base  to  b  > 0  and  b  - 1).  in  every  case
multiplication of numbers is addition of exponents.

6a  bm times b" equals b'", so  logarithms  (exponents)  add

b'  divided  by  b"  equals b", 

so  logarithms  (exponents) subtract

logb(yz)  = logby  + logbz 

and 

logb(y/z)  = logby  - logbz.

historical note 

in  the  days  of slide  rules,  1.2  and  1.3  were  multiplied  by  sliding
one  edge  across  to  1.2  and  reading  the  answer  under  1.3.  a  slide  rule  made  in
germany  would  give  the  third  digit  in  1.56.  its photograph shows  the  numbers  on  a
log  scale.  the  distance  from  1 to  2  equals  the  distance  from  2  to  4  and  from  4 to  8.
by sliding  the  edges,  you  add  distances  and  multiply  numbers.

division goes the  other way. notice how  1000/10 =  100 matches 3 - 1 = 2.  to divide

1.56  by  1.3,  look  back  along line  d for  the  answer  1.2.

the second  figure,  though  smaller,  is the  important  one.  when  x increases by  1, 2 x
is  multiplied  by  2.  adding to  x  multiplies y.  this  rule  easily  gives  y  =  1, 2,  4,  8, but
look  ahead  to  calculus-which  doesn't  stay  with  whole  numbers.

calculus  will  add  ax.  then  y  is  multiplied  by  2ax.  this  number  is  near  1. if
ax = a  then  2"ax   1.07-the  tenth  root  of  2.  to find the slope, we  have to  consider
(2 ax  - 1)/ax.  the limit  is  near (1.07  - 1)/-  = .7, but  the exact number will take time.

6  exponentials and logarithms 

base change  bases other than 10 and exponents other than 1,2,3, . . . are needed 
for applications. the population of the world x years from now is predicted  to grow 
by a factor close to 1.02".  certainly x does not need to be a whole number  of  years. 
and certainly the base 1.02 should not be 10 (or we are in real trouble). this prediction 
will be refined as we  study the differential equations for growth. it can be  rewritten 
to base  10 if  that is preferred  (but look  at the exponent): 

1.02" 

is the same as  10('og .02)". 

when the base changes from  1.02 to 10, the exponent is multiplied-as  we now see. 
for practice,  start with base b and change to base a. the logarithm to base a will 

be written "log."  everything comes from the rule that logarithm = exponent: 

base change for  numbers:  b = dogb. 

now raise both  sides to the power  x. you  see the change in the exponent: 

base change for  exponentials:  bx = a('0g ,ix. 

finally set y = bx. its logarithm to base b is x. its logarithm to base a is the exponent 
on the right hand side: logay = (log,b)x.  now replace x by  logby: 

base change for  logarithms: 

log, y  = (log, b) (log, y ). 

we absolutely need this ability  to change the base.  an  example with a = 2 is 

b = 8 = z3 

g2 = (z3), = 26 

log,  64 = 3  2 = (log28)(log864). 

the rule  behind base changes is (am)" = am". when  the mth  power  is raised  to the 

xth power,  the exponents multiply. the square of the cube is the sixth power: 

(a)(a)(a) times (a)(a)(a) equals (a)(a)(a)(a)(a)(a):  (a3),=a6. 

another  base  will  soon  be  more  important  than  10-here 
changes: 

are  the  rules  for  base 

the first is  the definition.  the second  is the xth power  of  the first. the third  is the 
logarithm  of  the second (remember y is bx). an important case is y = a: 

log, a = (log, b)(logb a) = 1 so log, b = 1 /log, a. 

(3) 

example  8 = 23 means 8li3 = 2. then (10g28)(l0g82) = (3)(1/3) = 1. 

this  completes  the  algebra  of  logarithms.  the  addition  rules  6a  came  from 
(bm)(b") = bm +". the  multiplication  rule  68 came from  (am)" = am". we  still  need  to 
dejine b"  and  ax for  all real  numbers x.  when  x  is a  fraction,  the definition  is easy. 
the square root of  a8 is a4 (m = 8 times x = 112). when x is not a fraction, as in 2", 
the graph suggests one way  to fill in the hole. 

we could defne 2" as the limit of 23, 231110, 23141100, . . . . as the fractions r approach 
7t, the powers 2'  approach 2".  this makes y = 2" into a continuous function, with the 
desired properties (2")(2") = 2"'"  and (2")"  = 2""-whether  m and n and x  are inte- 
gers  or not.  but  the  e's  and 6's  of  continuity  are not  attractive,  and  we  eventually 
choose (in section 6.4) a  smoother approach based  on integrals. 

graphs of  b" and  logby 

it is time to draw graphs. in principle one graph should do the job for both functions, 
because y =bx means the same as x =logby. these are inverse functions.  what one 
function does, its inverse undoes. the logarithm of g(x) = bx is x: 

in the opposite direction, the exponential of  the logarithm of  y is y: 

g(g -

(9 
this holds for every base  b,  and it is valuable to see b = 2 and b = 4 on the  same 
graph. figure 6.2a shows y = 2"  and y = 4".  their mirror images in the 45" line give 
the logarithms to base 2 and base 4, which are in the right graph. 

= b('08b~)= y. 

when x is negative, y = bx is still positive.  if  the first graph is extended to the left, 
it stays above the x axis. sketch it in with your pencil. also extend the second graph 
down, to be the mirror image. don't  cross the vertical axis. 

fig. 6.2  exponentials and mirror images (logarithms). different scales for x and y. 

there are interesting relations within  the  left  figure. all  exponentials start  at  1, 
because b0 is always 1. at the height y = 16, one graph is above x = 2 (because 4'  = 
16). the other graph is above x = 4 (because 24 = 16). why does 4" in one graph equal 
2,"  in the other? this is the base change for powers, since 4 = 2,. 

the figure on  the right  shows the  mirror  image-the 

logarithm.  all  logarithms 
start from zero at y = 1. the graphs go down to  - co at y = 0.  (roughly speaking 
2-"  is zero.) again x in one graph corresponds to 2x in the other (base change for 
logarithms). both logarithms climb slowly, since the exponentials climb so fast. 

the number log, 10 is between 3 and 4, because 10 is between 23 and 24. the slope 
never happened for xn. but there are two practical 

of 2"  is proportional to 2"-which 
difficulties with those graphs: 

1.  2"  and  4"  increase too fast. the curves turn virtually straight up. 
2.  the most important fact about ab"  is the value of 6-and 
the base 

doesn't stand out in the graph. 

there is also another point.  in many  problems we  don't  know  the function y = 
f(x). we are looking for it! all  we  have are measured values of  y (with errors mixed 
in). when the values are plotted on a graph, we  want to discover f(x). 

fortunately  there is a solution. scale  the  y  axis dfferently. on ordinary graphs, 
each unit upward adds a fixed amount to y.  on a log scale each unit multiplies y by 

6  exponentials and logarithms 

ajixed amount. the step from y = 1 to y = 2 is the same length as the step from 3 to 
6 or 10 to 20. 

on a log scale, y = 11 is not halfway between  10 and  12. and y = 0 is not there at 
all. each step down divides by  a fixed amount-we  never  reach zero. this is com- 
pletely satisfactory for abx, which also never reaches zero. 

figure 6.3 is on semilog paper  (also known as log-linear), with an ordinary x axis. 
the graph of y  = abx is a straight line. to see why, take logarithms of  that equation: 

log y = log a + x log b. 

(6) 
the relation between x and log y is linear. it is really log y that is plotted, so the graph 
is  straight. the markings on the y  axis allow you to enter y without looking up its 
logarithm-you  get an ordinary graph of  log y against x. 

figure 6.3 shows two examples. one graph is an exact plot of  y = 2  lox. it goes 
upward with slope 1, because a unit across has the same length as multiplication by 
10 going  up. lox has  slope  1 and  10("gb)" (which  is  bx) will  have  slope  log b. the 
crucial number log b can be measured directly as the slope. 

fig. 6.3  2 =  10" and 4 10-"i2 on semilog paper.  fig. 6.4  graphs of  ax^  on log-log paper. 

the second graph in figure 6.3 is more typical of  actual practice, in which we start 

with measurements and look for f(x). here are the data points: 

we don't  know in advance whether these values fit the model y = abx. the graph is 
strong  evidence that  they  do. the  points  lie close  to  a  line with  negative slope- 
indicating log b < 0 and b < 1. the slope down is half of  the earlier slope up, so the 

6.1  an overview 

model is consistent with 

y =  ado-x12  or 

log y = l o g  a - f x .  

(7) 

when x reaches  2, y drops by  a factor  of  10. at  x = 0 we  see a z 4. 

another model-a  power  y = axk instead of an exponential-also 

stands out with 
logarithmic  scaling.  this  time  we  use  log-log  paper,  with  both  axes  scaled.  the 
logarithm of  y = axk gives a linear relation  between log y and log x: 

log y = log a + k log x. 

(8) 
the exponent k becomes  the slope on log-log  paper.  the base b makes no difference. 
we just  measure the slope, and a straight line is a lot more attractive than a power 
curve. 
the graphs  in  figure 6.4 have  slopes  3 and 4 and  -1. they  represent  ax3 and 
and alx. to find the a's,  look at one point on the line. at  x = 4 the height is 
and 32/x. 

a& 
8, so adjust the a's to make this happen: the functions are x3/8 and 4& 
on semilog paper those graphs would  not be straight! 

you  can buy  log paper or create it with  computer graphics. 

the  derivatives of  y = bxand x=  log,y 

this is  a  calculus  book.  we  have  to  ask  about  slopes. the  algebra of  exponents is 
done, the rules are set, and on log paper the graphs are straight. now come limits. 
the central  question is the derivative.  what is dyldx  when y = bx? what is dxldy 
when  x  is  the  logarithm  logby? thpse questions are closely related,  because  bx and 
logby are  inverse  functions.  if  one  slope  can  be  found,  the  other  is  known  from 
dxldy = l/(dy/dx). the problem  is  to find  one  of  them,  and  the  exponential comes 
first. 

you  will  now see that those questions have quick (and beautiful) answers, except 
for  a  mysterious constant. there is  a multiplying factor  c which  needs  more time.  i 
think  it is worth  separating out the part  that can be done immediately, leaving c in 
dyldx and llc in dxldy. then section 6.2 discovers c by studying the special number 
called e (but c # e). 

i 

6c  the  derivative  of  bx is  a  multiple  ebx. the  number  c  depends  on  the 
base b.

i 


the product and power  and chain rules do not yield  this derivative. we are pushed 
all the way back  to the original definition, the limit  of  aylax: 

key idea: split bx+h into bx times bh. then the crucial quantity  bx factors out. more 
than that, bx comes outside the limit because it does not depend on h.  the remaining 
limit, inside the brackets,  is the number c that we  don't  yet know: 

this equation is central to the whole chapter: dyldx equals cbx which equals cy.  the 
rate of  change of  y is proportional  to y. the slope increases  in the same way that bx 
increases  (except  for  the  factor  c).  a  typical  example  is  money  in  a  bank,  where 

6  exponentials and logarithms 

interest is proportional to the principal. the rich get richer, and the poor get slightly 
richer. we will come back  to compound interest, and identify b and c. 

the inverse function is x = logby. now  the unknown factor is  l/c: 

i 6d  the slope of logby is llcy with the same e (depending on b). 

i 

proof 

if  dy/dx = cbx then dxldy = l/cbx = llcy. 

(1 1) 
that proof  was like a  russian toast, powerful but too quick! we go more carefully: 

f(bx) = x 
f '(bx)(cbx) = 1 

(logarithm  of  exponential) 

(x derivative by  chain rule) 

f '(bx) = l/cbx  (divide by  cbx) 

f '(y) = l/cy 

(identify bx as y) 

the logarithm gives another way  to find c. from its slope we can discover  l/c. this 
is the way  that finally works (next section).

fig. 6.5  the slope of  2"  is about .7  2".  the slope of  log2y is about  11.7~. 

final  remark 
it  is  extremely  satisfying to  meet  an f(y)  whose  derivative  is  llcy. 
at  last the  " - 1 power"  has  an antiderivative. remember that j'xndx = xn+'/(n + 1) 
is  a  failure when  n = - 1. the derivative  of  x0 (a constant) does not  produce  x-'. 
we had no integral for  x - ' , and the logarithm fills  that gap. if  y is replaced by  x or t 
(all dummy variables) then

and

the base b can be  chosen so that c = 1. then the derivative is  llx. this final touch 
comes from the magic choice b = e-the 

highlight of  section 6.2.

6  exponentials and logarithms 

6.2  the  exponential ex 

could be 2 or 6 
the last section discussed bx and logby. the base b was arbitrary-it 
or 9.3 or any positive number  except  1. but in  practice,  only a  few  bases are used. 
i have  never  met  a  logarithm  to base  6 or 9.3. realistically there  are  two  leading 
candidates for b,  and 10 is one of them. this section is about the other one, which is 
an extremely remarkable number.  this number is not seen in arithmetic or algebra 
or geometry, where it looks totally clumsy and out of place. in calculus it comes into 
its own. 

the number is e. that symbol was chosen by euler (initially in a fit of  selfishness, 
but  he  was  a  wonderful  mathematician).  it  is  the  base  of  the  natural  logarithm. 
it  also  controls  the  exponential  ex,  which  is  much  more  important  than  in x. 
euler also chose 7c to stand for perimeter-anyway,  our first goal is to find e. 

remember  that  the derivatives of  bx and logby include a constant c that  depends 

on b.  equations (10) and (1 1) in the previous  section were 

d - b"  = cb" 
dx 

1 
and  - logby = -. 
cy

d~ 

(1) 

at  x = 0, the  graph  of  bx starts from  b0 = 1. the slope is  c. at  y = 1, the graph  of 
logby starts from logbl = 0. the logarithm has slope  llc.  with the right choice of the 
base b those slopes will equal  1 (because c will equal  1). 

for y = 2" the slope c is near .7. we already tried ax = .1 and found ay  z -07. the 

base has to be larger than 2, for a starting slope of  c = 1. 

we begin with a direct computation of  the slope of  logby at y = 1: 

1 
- = slope at  1 = lim - [logb(l + h) - logbl] = lim logb[(l  + h)'lh]. 
c 

1 
h + o   h 

h - 0  

always logbl = 0. the fraction in the middle is logb(l + h) times the number  l/h. this 
number can go up into the exponent, and it did. 
the quantity (1 + h)'ih  is unusual, to put  it mildly. as  h + 0, the number  1 + h is 
approaching  1. at  the  same  time,  l/h is  approaching  infinity. in  the  limit  we  have 
1".  but  that  expression  is  meaningless  (like  010).  everything  depends  on  the 
balance bet.ween "nearly  1" and "nearly  go."  this balance produces the extraordinary 
number e: 

definition  the number e is equal to lim (1 +'h)'lh.  equivalently e = lim 
n+  co 

h + o  

before computing  e,  look  again  at the  slope  llc. at  the  end  of  equation  (2) is  the 
logarithm of e: 

when the base is b = e, the slope is logee = 1. that base e has c = 1 as desired 

the derivative of ex is  1  ex and the derivative of log,y  is - 

1 

1 my' 

(4) 

this is why the base e is all-important  in calculus. it makes c = 1. 

to compute the actual number e from (1 + h)'lh, choose h = 1, 1/10, 1/100, . . . . then 
the exponents l/h are n = 1, 10, 100, . . . . (all limits and derivatives will become official 
in  section 6.4.) the table shows (1 + h)lih approaching e as h -, 0 and n -, oo: 

6.2  the exponential ex 

the  last  column  is  converging  to  e  (not  quickly).  there  is  an  infinite  series  that 
converges much faster. we know  125,000 digits of  e (and a billion digits of  n). there 
are no definite patterns, although you might think  so from the first sixteen digits: 

e = 2.7  1828 1828 45  90 45 .-.  (and  lle z .37). 

the powers of  e produce y = ex. at  x = 2.3 and 5, we  are close to y = 10 and  150. 

the logarithm is the inverse function.  the logarithms of  150 and 10, to the base e, 
are close to x = 5 and x = 2.3. there is a special name for this logarithm--the  natural 
logarithm. there is also a special notation  "ln"  to show that the base is e: 

in  y means the same  as log,y.  the natural logarithm is the exponent in ex = y. 

the notation in y (or in x-it 
is the function that matters, not the variable) is standard 
in calculus courses.  after calculus, the base is generally assumed  to be e. in most of 
science and engineering,  the natural  logarithm  is  the automatic choice. the symbol 
"exp (x)"  means ex, and the  truth  is that  the symbol "log x"  generally  means in x. 
base  e is  understood  even without  the  letters in.  but  in  any case  of  doubt-on 
a 
calculator key for example-the 

symbol "ln  x"  emphasizes that the base is e. 

the  derivatives of  ex and  in x 

come back  to derivatives  and slopes. the derivative  of  bx is cbx, and the derivative 
of  log, y  is  llcy.  if  b = e  then  c = 1 .   for  all  bases,  equation  (3)  is  llc = logbe. 
this gives c-the 

slope of  bx at x = 0: 

c = in b  is  the  mysterious  constant  that  was  not  available  earlier. the  slope  of  2"  is 
in 2 times 2".  the slope of  ex is  in e times ex (but in e = 1). we have  the derivatives 
on which this chapter depends:

6  exponentials and logarithms 

remark  on slopes at  x = 0:  it would  be satisfying to see directly that the slope of  2" 
is  below  1, and  the  slope  of  4"  is  above  1.  quick  proof:  e  is  between  2  and  4. 
but the idea is to see the slopes graphically.  this is a small puzzle, which  is fun to 
solve but can be  skipped. 

2"  rises  from  1 at x = 0 to 2  at x = 1. on that interval  its average slope is  1. its 
slope at the beginning is smaller than average, so it must  be less than  1-as  desired. 
on the other hand 4"  rises from :at x = - to 1 at x = 0. again the average slope 
, , 
is l/l = 1. since x = 0 comes at the  end  of  this  new  interval, the  slope of  4"  at that 
point exceeds 1. somewhere between 2"  and 4"  is ex, which starts out with  slope  1. 

this is  the  graphical  approach  to e.  there is  also  the  infinite series, and  a  fifth 

definition through integrals which is written  here for the record: 

1.  e is the number  such that ex has slope  1 at x = 0 
2.  e is the base for which in y = log,y  has slope  1 at y = 1 

3.  e is the limit of ( 1 + - as n -, co

:r 


5.  the area 5;  x - l   dx equals  1. 

the connections between 1, 2, and 3 have been made. the slopes are 1 when e is the 
limit of (1 + lln)". multiplying this out wlll lead to 4, the infinite series in section 6.6. 
the official definition of  in x  comes from 1 dxlx, and then 5 says that  in e = 1. this 
approach to e (section 6.4) seems less intuitive  than the others. 

figure 6.6b shows the graph of  e-".  it is the mirror image of  ex across the vertical 
axis.  their  product  is  exe-"= 1.  where  ex  grows  exponentially,  e-"  decays 
it grows as x  approaches  - co. their growth and decay are faster 
exponentially-or 
than any power  of x. exponential growth is more rapid  than polynomial  growth, so 
that e"/xngoes to infinity (problem 59). it is the fact that ex has slope ex which keeps 
the function climbing so fast. 

fig. 6.6  ex grows between 2"  and 4".  decay  of e-",  faster decay of e-"'i2. 

the other curve is y = e-"'i2. this is the famous "bell-shaped curve"  of  id203 
theory.  after dividing by f i ,it  gives  the  normal distribution, which  applies to so 
many  averages  and  so  many  experiments.  the  gallup  poll  will  be  an example  in 
section 8.4. the curve is symmetric around its mean value x = 0, since changing x  to 
-x  has no effect on x2. 

about two thirds of  the area under this curve is between x = - 1 and x = 1. if  you 
pick  points  at  random  below  the  graph,  213  of  all  samples  are  expected  in  that 
interval. the points x = - 2 and x = 2 are "two standard deviations"  from the center,

enclosing  95%  of the area.  there is  only a  5% chance  of landing beyond.  the decay
is  even  faster  than an  ordinary  exponential,  because -ix2 has  replaced  x.

the  derivatives  of  ex  and  eu x)

the  slope  of ex  is  ex.  this  opens up  a whole  world of functions  that calculus can  deal
with.  the  chain  rule  gives  the  slope  of e3 x  and esinx  and every  e"(x):

example  1 the  derivative  of  e3 x is  3e3 x  (here  c = 3).  the  derivative  of  esinx  is
esin x cos x  (here  u = sin x).  the  derivative  of  f(u(x))  is  df/du  times  du/dx.  here
f= e" so  df/du =  e". the chain rule demands that second factor du/dx.

e(in 2 2)x  is  the  same  as  2x.  its  derivative  is in 2 times  2x.  the  chain  rule
example  2 
rediscovers  our constant  c =  in 2. in  the slope  of bx  it rediscovers  the factor  c = in b.
generally  ecx  is  preferred  to  the  original  bx.  the  derivative  just  brings  down  the
constant  c.  it is  better to agree on e  as the base, and  put all  complications  (like c =
in b)  up  in the exponent.  the second  derivative  of ecx  is  c2ecx.

example  3  the  derivative  of e-x2/2 is  - xe -

x

2/ 2 (here u =  - x 2/2 so  du/dx= - x).

example  4  the second  derivative  off= e - x2/2,  by the chain rule  and product  rule,
is

f" = (-1)  e-x 2/2 +  (  x) 2 e-x 2/ 2  =  ( 2  -

(10)
notice  how  the exponential survives. with  every  derivative  it is  multiplied  by  more
factors,  but  it  is  still  there  to  dominate  growth  or  decay.  the  points of inflection,
where  the  bell-shaped  curve  hasf" =  0 in equation  (10),  are  x  =  1 and  x =  - 1.

(u  = n in x).  since  en" n  is  x" in disguise,  its slope  must  be  nx - 1:

slope =  e""nx 

(n in  x)=  x(n) = nx 

(11)

this slope is correct for all n,  integer or not. chapter  2 produced  3x2  and  4x 3  from
the binomial  theorem.  now  nx"-  1 comes  from  in and  exp  and  the chain  rule.

example  6  an  extreme  case  is xx  = (einx)x.  here  u = x in x  and we  need  du/dx:

d (x)  = exnxin x+ x-  = xx(ln  x + 1).

integrals  of  e" and  e" du/dx

the integral  of ex  is  ex.  the integral of ecx  is not ecx.  the derivative  multiplies  by c so
the integral  divides  by  c. the integral of ecx  is ecx/c  (plus a constant).

the first one has  c = 2. the second has  c = in b-remember 
the integral divides by in b.  in the third one, e3("+')is e3" times the number e3 and 
that number is carried along. or more likely we see e3'"+'i  as eu.the missing du/dx = 
3  is  fixed  by  dividing by  3.  the  last  example fails because  duldx  is  not  there.  we 
cannot integrate without duldx: 

again that  bx = e('nb)x. 

here are three examples with du/dx and one without it: 

the first is a pure eudu. so is  the second. the third has u = 
so only the factor 2 had  to be  fixed. the fourth  example does not  belong with  the 
others. it is the integral of  du/u2, not the integral of  eudu. i don't  know any way  to 
that the complicated  part  is  1 + ex and  it 
tell you  which  substitution is best-except 
is natural to substitute  u. if  it works, good. 
looks bad. but u = 1 + ex 

without an extra ex for duldx, the integral 5 dx/(l + 

and du/dx = l/2&, 

is still worth trying. it has du = exdx = (u- 1)dx: 

that last step is "partial fractions.''  the integral splits into simpler pieces (explained 
in section 7.4) and we  integrate each piece. here are three other integrals: 

the first can change to  -5 eudu/u2,which is not much better. (it is just  as impossible.) 
the  second  is  actually  judu, but  i  prefer  a  split:  54ex and  5e2"  are  safer  to  do 
separately. the third is 5 (4e-" + l)dx, which also separates. the exercises offer prac- 
tice in reaching eudu/dx - ready to be integrated. 

warning about  dejinite  integrals  when  the  lower limit  is  x  = 0, there is  a  natural 
tendency to expect f(0) = 0-in  which case the lower limit contributes nothing.  for 
a power f = x3 that is true. for an exponential f = e3" it is definitely not true, because 
f(0) = 1:

6.3  growth and decay in science and economics 

the derivative of  y = e"  has taken  time  and  effort.  the result  was  y'  = cecx, which 
means that y'  = cy. that computation brought others with it, virtually for free-the 
derivatives of  bx and xx and eu(x). but i want to stay with y'  = cy-which 
important differential equatibn in applied mathematics. 
compare y'  = x  with y'  = y. the first only asks for an antiderivative of x. we quickly 
find y = i x 2  + c. the second has dyldx equal to y itself-which  we rewrite as dy/y = 
dx. the integral is in y = x + c. then y itself is exec. notice that the first solution is 
$x2 plus a constant, and the second solution is ex times  a constant.

there is a way to graph slope x  versus slope y. figure 6.7 shows "tangent  arrows," 
which  give the slope at each x  and y. for parabolas, the arrows grow steeper as x

grows-because  y' = slope  = x.  for  exponentials,  the  arrows  grow  steeper  as  y
grows-the  equation  is  y'= slope  = y.  now  the  arrows  are  connected  by  y =  aex.
a differential equation gives afield of arrows (slopes).  its solution is a curve that stays
tangent to  the arrows -

then  the curve  has  the right  slope.

a  field  of  arrows  can  show  many  solutions  at  once  (this  comes  in  a  differential
equations  course).  usually  a  single  yo  is  not sacred.  to  understand  the equation  we
start from  many  yo-on the  left  the parabolas  stay  parallel,  on  the right the  heights
stay  proportional.  for y' =  - y  all  solution curves  go  to zero.

from  y' = y  it  is  a short  step  to y' =  cy.  to make  c appear  in  the derivative,  put c
into the exponent. the derivative of y =  ecx is cecx,  which  is c times y. we have reached
the key  equation,  which  comes  with  an  initial condition-a starting  value  yo:

dy/dt = cy  with  y = yo  at  t = 0. 

(1)
a small change:  x has switched to t. in most applications  time is  the natural  variable,
rather  than space.  the factor  c becomes  the "growth  rate"  or "decay  rate"-and  ecx
converts  to  ect.

the  last  step  is  to  match  the  initial  condition.  the  problem  requires  y = yo  at
t = 0.  our  ec'  starts  from  eco  =  1.  the  constant of integration is  needed  now-the
solutions are y  = ae".  by choosing  a = yo,  we match  the initial  condition  and solve
equation  (1).  the formula to remember is yoec'.

61  the  exponential law  y = yoec'  solves  y' =  cy  starting  from yo.

the  rate  of  growth  or  decay  is  c.  may  i  call  your  attention  to  a  basic  fact?  the
formula yoec'  contains three  quantities yo,  c, t.  if  two  of  them  are  given,  plus  one
additional  piece  of information,  the third is  determined.  many  applications have  one
of these  three forms: find t, find c, find yo.

1.  find the  doubling  time  t  if c =  1/10.  at  that time  yoect equals  2yo:

e t  = 2  yields  ct= in 2  so  that  t= i

the question asks for an exponent  t  the answer  involves logarithms.  if a cell  grows
at a  continuous  rate  of  c =  10%  per  day,  it  takes  about  .7/.1  = 7 days  to  double in
size. (note that .7 is close to  in 2.)  if a savings  account earns  10%  continuous interest,
it  doubles  in  7 years.

in this  problem  we  knew  c. in  the  next  problem  we  know  t

after the  half-life  t= 5568,  the factor  ect equals 4. now  c is negative  (in  =  - in 2).
question  1 was  about  growth.  question  2  was  about  decay.  both  answers  found
ect  as  the  ratio  y(t)/y(o).  then  ct  is  its  logarithm.  note  how  c  sticks  to  t.
t has  the units  of time,  c  has the  units of  "1/time."

(in 5)/5568. 

main point: the  doubling  time  is (in 2)/c,  because  ct= in 2. the  time  to  multiply
by  e  is  1/c.  the  time  to  multiply  by  10  is  (in  10)/c.  the  time  to  divide  by  e is  - 1/c,
when  a negative  c  brings  decay.

3.  find the  initial  value  yo  if c = 2 and  y(l) =  5:
y(t) = yoec'  yields  yo  = y(t)e -

example 1  population growth from  birth rate b and death rate d (both constant): 

dyldt = by - dy = cy 

(the net rate is c = b - d). 

the population  in this model is yoect = yoebte-dt. it grows when b > d (which makes 
c > 0). one estimate of  the growth rate is c = 0.02/year: 

the earth's population doubles in about  t= -x - = 35 years.

first comment: we  predict  the future based on c.  we  count  the past  population 

to find c. changes in c are a serious problem for this model. 

second comment: yoect is not a whole number. you may prefer to think of bacteria 
instead of people. (this section begins a major application of mathematics to economics 
and the life sciences.) malthus based his theory of human population on this equation 
y'  = cy-and  with large numbers a fraction of  a person doesn't  matter so much. to 
use calculus we  go from discrete to continuous. the theory must fail when  t is very 
large, since populations cannot grow exponentially forever. section 6.5 introduces the 
logistic equation y'  = cy - by2, with a competition term  -by2 to slow the growth. 

third comment: the dimensions of b, c, d are "l/time."  the dictionary gives birth 

rate = number  of  births  per  person  in  a  unit  of  time.  it  is  a  relative rate-people 
divided by people and time. the product ct is dimensionless and ect makes sense (also 
dimensionless). some texts replace c by  1- (lambda). then  1/a  is the growth  time or 
decay time or drug elimination  time or diffusion time. 

example 2  radioactive dating  a  gram  of  charcoal  from  the  cave  paintings  in 
france gives 0.97 disintegrations per minute. a gram of living wood gives 6.68 disin- 
tegrations per minute. find the age of  those lascaux paintings. 

the  charcoal  stopped  adding  radiocarbon  when  it  was  burned  (at  t = 0). the 
amount has decayed to yoect. in living wood this amount is still yo, because cosmic

example 3  calculus in economics: price inflation and the value of  money 
we  begin  with two inflation rates  - a continuous rate and an annual rate.  for the 
price change ay  over a year, use the annual rate: 

ay  = (annual rate) times (y) times (at). 

calculus applies the continuous rate to each instant dt. the price change is dy:

k 

dy = (continuous rate) times (y) times (dt). 

dividing by  dt, this is a differential equation for the price: 

(5) 

(6) 

dyldt = (continuous rate) times (y) = .05y. 

the solution is yoe.05'.set t = 1. then emo5= 1.0513 and the annual rate is 5.13%. 
when you ask a bank what interest they pay, they give both rates: 8% and 8.33%. 
the higher one they call the "effective rate."  it comes from compounding (and depends 
how often they do it). if  the compounding is continuous, every dt brings an increase 
of  dy-and 
section 6.6 returns  to compound interest. the interval drops from a month  to a 
day to a second. that leads to (1 + lln)", and in the limit to e. here we  compute the 
effect  of  5% continuous interest: 

eeo8is near  1.0833. 

future value  a dollar now has the same value as esostdollars in  t years. 
present value  a dollar in  t years has the same value as e--ostdollars now. 
doubling time  prices double (emost= 2) in  t= in 21.05 x 14 years. 

with  no compounding,  the  doubling  time  is  20  years.  simple interest  adds  on 20 
times 5% = 100%. with continuous compounding the time is reduced by  the factor 
in 2 z -7, regardless of  the interest rate. 

example 4  in  1626 the indians sold manhattan for $24. our calculations indicate 
that they knew what they were doing. assuming 8% compound interest, the original 
$24 is multiplied by  e.08'. after t = 365 years the multiplier is e29.2and the $24 has 
grown to  115 trillion dollars. with that much money they could buy back the land 
and pay off  the national debt. 

this seems farfetched. possibly  there  is  a  big  flaw  in  the  model.  it is  absolutely 
true that ben franklin left money to boston and philadelphia, to be invested for 200 
years. in  1990 it yielded millions (not trillions, that takes longer). our next step is a 
new model. 

6 exponentlals and logarithms 

question  how can you estimate e2'm2  with a $24 calculator (log but not in)? 
answer  multiply 29.2 by loglo e = .434 to get 12.7. this is the exponent to base 10. 
after that base change, we  have 

or more than a trillion. 

growth or decay wlth a  source term 

the equation y'  = y will be  given a new  term.  up to now, all growth or decay has 
started from yo. no deposit or withdrawal was made later. the investment grew by 
pure exponential.  the new  term  s  allows you  to add or  subtract from  the 
itself-a 
account. it  is  a  "source"-or 
a  "sink"  if  s is negative.  the source s = 5 adds 5dt, 
proportional to dt but not to y: 

constant source:  dyldt = y + 5 starting from y = yo. 

notice y on both sides! my first guess y = et+' failed completely. its derivative is et+' 
again, which  is not y + 5.  the class suggested y = et + 5t. but its derivative et + 5 is 
still not y + 5.  we  tried  other ways  to produce  5 in  dyldt. this idea is doomed to 
failure. finally we  thought of  y = aet - 5. that has y'  = aet = y + 5 as required. 

important: a is not yo. set t = 0 to find yo = a - 5. the source contributes 5et - 5: 

the solution is (yo+ 5)e' - 5.  that is the same as yoef+ 5(et- 1). 

s = 5 multiplies the growth term ef - 1 that starts at zero. yoef grows as before. 
example 5  dyldt = - y + 5 has y = (yo- 5)e-' + 5. this is y0e-' + 5(1 - e-'). 
that final term from the soul-ce is still positive. the other term yoe-' decays to zero. 
the limit as t + 

is y,  = 5. a negative c leads to a steady state y,. 

based  on these examples with c = 1 and c = -- 1, we  can find y for any c and s. 

equation wlth source  2 = cy + s starts from y = yo at t = 0. 

dt 

(7)

the source could be  a deposit of  s = $1000/year, after an initial investment of  yo = 
$8000. or we can withdraw funds at s = -$200/year. the units are "dollars per year" 
to match dyldt. the equation feeds in $1000 or removes $200 continuously-not  all 
1 
at once. 
note again that y = e(c+s)tis not a solution. its derivative is (c + sly. the combina-  rgmdm9 
tion y = ect+ s is also not a solution (but closer). the analysis of y'  = cy + s will be 
our main achievement for  dzrerential equations (in this section). the equation is not 
restricted to finance-far 

that produces excellent examples. 

from it-but

i propose to find y in four ways. you may feel that one way is enough.? the first 
three lines-but  please give the others a chance. there is no 

way is the fastest-only 
point in preparing for real problems if  we  don't  solve them. 
solution by method 1  (fast way) substitute the combination y = aec' + b.  the solu- 
tion has this form-exponential  plus  constant. from two facts we  find a  and b: 

the equation y'  = cy + s gives caect = c(aect+ b) + s 
the initial value at t = 0 gives a + b = yo. 

tmy class says one way  is more  than enough. they just  want the answer. sometimes i cave 
in and write down the formula: y is y,ect  plus s(e" - l)/c from the source term.

the first line has caect on both  sides. subtraction leaves cb + s = 0,or b = - sic. 
then the second line becomes a = yo - b = yo + (slc): 

key  formula  y = 

or 

y = yoect+ -(ect - 1). 

s

c 

with  s = 0 this  is  the  old  solution yoect (no source). the example  with  c = 1 and 
s = 5 produced (yo+ 5)ef  - 5. separating the source term gives yo& + 5(et - 1). 
solution by method 2  (slow way) the input yo  produces the output yo@. after t 
years any deposit is multiplied by  ea.  that also  applies  to deposits  made  after  the 
account  is  opened.  if  the deposit enters at  time  'is  the growing time  is  only  t - t 
therefore the multiplying factor is only ec(t- this growth factor applies to the small 
deposit (amount s dt) made between time tand t+ dt. 
now  add up all outputs at time t. the output from yo  is yoea. the small deposit 

s dtnear time t grows to ec('-t)s dt. the total is an integral: 

this principle  of  duhamel  would  still apply  when  the  source s  varies  with  time. 
here s is constant, and the integral divides by c: 

that agrees with  the source term from method 1, at the end of  equation (8). there 
we  looked for "exponential plus constant," here we  added up outputs. 

method  1 was  easier.  it  succeeded  because  we  knew  the  form  a&'+  b-with 

"undetermined  coefficients."  method 2 is more complete. the form for y  is part  of 
the output, not the input. the source s is  a continuous supply of  new  deposits, all 
growing separately. section 6.5 starts from scratch, by directly integrating y'  = cy + s. 
remark  method 2 is often described in  terms of  an integrating factor.  first write 
the equation as y'  - cy = s. then multiply by  a magic factor that makes integration 
possible: 

( y r- cy)e-ct  = se-c'

multiply by  the factor e-" 

integrate both sides 

substitute 0 and t 

isolate y  to reach formula (8) 

the integrating factor produced a perfect derivative in line 1. i prefer duhamel's idea, 
that all inputs yo and s grow the same way.  either method gives formula (8) for y. 

the  mathematics of finance (at  a continuous rate) 

the question from finance is this:  what inputs give  what  outputs? the inputs can 
come at the start by yo, or continuously by  s. the output can be paid at the end or 
continuously. there are six basic questions, two of which are already answered. 

the future value is yoect from a deposit of  yo. to produce y  in the future, deposit 
the present value ye-".  questions 3-6  involve the source term s. we fix the continuous 

6  exponentlab and logarithms 

rate at 5% per year (c = .05), and start the account from yo = 0. the answers come 
fast from equation (8). 
question 3  with deposits of  s = $1000/year, how large is y after 20 years? 

one big deposit yields 20,000e z $54,000. the same 20,000 via s yields $34,400. 

notice a  small by-product  (for mathematicians). when  the interest rate is c = 0, 
our  formula  s(ec'- l)/c  turns  into  010.  we  are  absolutely  sure  that  depositing 
$1000/year with no interest produces $20,000 after 20 years. but this is not obvious 
from 010.  by  l'h6pital's  rule we  take c-derivatives in the fraction: 

lim -=  lim - =  st. this is (1000)(20)= 20,000.

question 4  what continuous deposit of s per year yields $20,000 after 20 years?

deposits  of  $582 over  20  years  total  $11,640. a single  deposit of  yo = 20,00o/e = 
$7,360 produces the same $20,000 at the end. better to be rich at t = 0. 

questions 1and 2 had s = 0 (no source). questions 3 and 4 had yo = 0 (no initial 
deposit). now  we  come to y = 0.  in 5, everything is paid  out  by  an annuity. in  6, 
everything is paid up on a loan. 
question 5  what deposit yo provides $1000/year for 20 years? end with y = 0. 

y = yoec'+ -s (ec'- 1)= 0 requires yo = -(1 - e-").

substituting s = - 1000, c = .05,  t = 20  gives  yo x  12,640. if  you  win  $20,000 in  a 
lottery, and it is paid over 20 years, the lottery only has to put in $12,640. even less 
if  the interest rate is above 5%. 
question 6  what payments s will clear a loan of  yo = $20,000 in 20 years? 
unfortunately, s exceeds $1000 per year. the bank gives up more than the $20,000 
to buy your car (and pay tuition). it also gives up the interest on that money. you pay 
that back too, but you don't  have to stay even at every moment. instead you repay 
at a constant rate for 20 years. your payments mostly cover interest at the start and 
principal at the end. after  t = 20 years you are even and your debt is y = 0. 
this is like question 5 (also y = o),  but now we  know yo and we  want s: 

y = yoec'+ -

s (ec' - 1)= 0 requires s = - cyoec'/(ec'- 1).
c 

the loan is yo = $20,000, the rate is c = .05/year, the time is t = 20 years. substituting 
in the formula for s, your payments are $1582 per year. 
puzzle  how is s = $1582 for loan payments related to s = $582 for deposits? 
0 -+  $582 per year +$20,000  and  $20,000 + - $1582 per year +0.

why?  here  is  the  real  reason.  instead  of repaying  1582  we  can  pay  only  1000  (to
keep  even  with  the interest  on  20,000).  the  other  582  goes  into  a separate  account.
after  20  years  the  continuous  582  has  built  up  to  20,000  (including  interest  as  in
question 4).  from  that  account  we pay  back  the loan.

transients  vs.  steady  state

suppose  there  is  decay  instead  of growth.  the  constant  c is  negative  and  yoec" dies
out.  that  is  the  "transient"  term,  which  disappears  as  t -+  co.  what  is  left  is  the
"steady state." we  denote  that limit by  y.

without  a  source,  y,  is  zero  (total decay).  when  s is present,  y,  =  - s/c:

6j  the  solution  y =  yo  +  - e"  - -

approaches  y,  =- 

- when  ec  -*0.

at  this  steady  state,  the  source  s  exactly  balances  the  decay  cy.  in  other  words
cy + s = 0.  from the left  side  of the differential  equation,  this means  dy/dt = 0.  there
is no change. that is  why  y, 

is  steady.

notice  that y.  depends  on  the source  and  on  c-but not  on yo.

example  6  suppose  bermuda  has a  birth  rate  b =  .02 and  death  rate  d =  .03.  the
net decay  rate is c =  - .01.  there is  also  immigration from  outside,  of s = 1200/year.
the  initial  population  might  be  yo  = 5 thousand  or yo  = 5 million,  but that  number
has no  effect  on  yo.  the steady state is independent of yo.

in  this  case  y.  =  - s/c =  1200/.01  =  120,000.  the  population  grows  to  120,000  if

yo  is  smaller.  it  decays  to  120,000 if yo  is larger.

example  7  newton's  law  of cooling: 
(12)
this  is  back  to  physics.  the temperature  of  a  body  is y.  the  temperature  around  it
is  y..  then  y  starts  at  yo  and  approaches  y,,  following  newton's  rule:  the rate is
proportional to y - y.  the  bigger the  difference,  the faster  heat  flows.

dy/dt = c(y - y.). 

the equation  has  - cy.  where  before  we  had s.  that fits with  y.  =  - s/c.  for the

solution,  replace  s by  - cy. 

in formula  (8).  or use  this  new  method:

solution by method 3  the new idea is to look at the dzrerence y - y,  . its derivative 
is dy/dt, since y, 
this is our equation. the differ- 
ence starts from yo - y,,  and grows or decays as a pure exponential: 

is constant. but dy/dt is c(y - y,)-

this solves the law of  cooling. we repeat method 3 using the letters s and c: 

(y  + :)  = c(y  + :)  has  the solution 

(y  + f) = (yo + :)ect. 

(14) 

moving s/c to the right side recovers formula (8). there is a constant  term and an 
exponential term. in a differential equations course, those are the "particular solution" 
and the "homogeneous solution."  in a calculus course, it's time to stop. 

example 8  in a 70"  room, newton's  corpse is found with a temperature of  90".  a 
day later the body registers 80". when did he stop integrating (at 98.6")? 
solution  here y,  = 70 and yo = 90. newton's  equation (13) is y = 20ec' + 70. then 
y = 80 at t = 1 gives 206 = 10. the rate of  cooling is c = in ). death occurred when 
2 0 8  + 70 = 98.6 or ect= 1.43. the time was t = in  1.43/ln )= half a day earlier.

6.4  logarithms 

we  have  given first  place to ex and a  lower place  to in x. in applications that  is 
absolutely  correct.  but  logarithms  have  one important  theoretical  advantage (plus 
many  applications  of  their  own). the advantage is  that  the derivative  of  in x is  l/x, 
whereas  the  derivative  of  ex  is  ex.  we  can't  define  ex as its  own  integral,  without 
circular  reasoning.  but  we  can  and  do  define in x  (the natural logarithm)  as  the 
integral of  the  " - 1 power"  which is  llx: 

note the dummy variables, first x then u. note also the live variables,  first x then y. 
especially  note the lower limit of  integration, which  is  1 and not 0.  the logarithm is 
the area measured from  1. therefore in  1 = 0 at that starting point-as 

required.

earlier  chapters  integrated  all  powers  except  this  "-1 power."  the  logarithm  is
that  missing integral.  the curve  in figure  6.11  has height y =  1/x-it is  a hyperbola.
at  x = 0  the  height  goes  to  infinity  and  the  area  becomes  infinite:  log  0 =  - 00.
the  minus  sign  is  because  the  integral  goes  backward  from  1 to  0.  the  integral
does not  extend  past zero  to  negative  x. we  are  defining  in x  only for  x > o.t

with  this  new  approach,  in x has  a direct  definition.  it is an integral (or an  area).
its  two  key  properties  must  follow  from  this  definition.  that  step  is  a  beautiful
application  of  the theory  behind  integrals.
property 1: 
a  single  area  (1 to  ab in the  middle  figure):
a  1 

in ab = in  a + in b. the areas  from  1 to  a and from a to ab combine  into

(2)

the  right  side  is in ab,  from  definition  (1).  the  first  term  on  the  left  is in a.  the
problem  is to  show  that the  second  integral  (a to  ab) is in b:

- d x  

du  =  in  b. 

(3)

we  need  u =  1 when x  = a (the  lower  limit) and  u  = b  when  x =  ab (the upper  limit).
the  choice  u = x/a  satisfies  these  requirements.  substituting  x =  au  and  dx =  a du
yields  dx/x =  du/u. equation  (3) gives  in  b,  and  equation  (2)  is  in a + in  b =  in ab.

property 2: 

in  b" =  n in  b.  these are  the  left  and  right  sides  of

{b" 1  dx 

(?)  n 

-jdu. 

(4)

this  comes  from  the  substitution  x =  u".  the lower  limit x =  1 corresponds  to  u =  1,
and  x = b"  corresponds  to  u =  b.  the  differential  dx  is  nu"-ldu. dividing  by  x =  u"
leaves  dx/x = n du/u. then  equation  (4)  becomes  in  b" =  n in  b.

remark  while  working  on  the theory  this  is  a  chance  to  straighten  out  old  debts.
the  book  has discussed  and computed  (and even  differentiated)  the  functions  ex  and
bx and  x", without  defining them properly.  when the exponent  is an irrational number
like  rt, how  do  we  multiply  e by  itself i  times?  one  approach  (not taken) is  to  come
closer  and closer  to it  by rational exponents  like 22/7.  another  approach (taken now)
is  to  determine  the  number  e'  =  23.1  ... by its  logarithm.t  start  with  e itself:

e is  (by definition)  the  number  whose  logarithm  is  1
e" is  (by definition)  the  number  whose  logarithm  is  7r.

when  the  area in figure 6.12 reaches  1, the  basepoint  is  e.  when  the  area  reaches  7e,
the  basepoint  is  e'.  we  are  constructing  the inverse  function  (which  is  ex).  but how
do  we  know  that  the  area  reaches  7t  or  1000  or  -1000  at  exactly  one  point?  (the
area  is  1000 far  out  at e1000 . the  area is  -1000  very  near  zero  at  e-100ooo0.)  to define
e we  have  to  know  that somewhere  the area  equals  1!

for  a  proof in  two  steps,  go  back  to  figure  6.11c.  the  area  from  1 to 2  is  more
than 1 (because  1/x  is more than - on that interval of length one).  the combined area
from  1  to  4  is  more  than  1.  we  come  to  area =  1 before  reaching  4.  (actually  at
e =  2.718....)  since  1/x  is positive,  the area  is  increasing  and  never  comes  back to  1.
to  double the area we  have to  square the distance. the  logarithm  creeps  upwards:

in x -+  oo  but 

in x

x

--* 0. 

(5)

the  logarithm  grows  slowly  because  ex  grows  so  fast  (and  vice  versa-they  are
inverses).  remember  that  ex  goes  past  every  power  x".  therefore  in x  is  passed  by
every  root x'l". problems  60 and  61  give  two  proofs  that (in x)/xl"i  approaches  zero.
we  might  compare  in x  with  x/. at x =  10  they  are  close  (2.3  versus 3.2).  but  out

at  x =  e'o the  comparison  is  10  against  e5, and in x loses  to  x.

for in u(x) the derivative  comes  from  the chain  rule.  the  inside  function  is  u,  the

outside function  is  in.  (keep  u > 0  to define  in u.) the  chain  rule gives

those  are  worth  another  look,  especially  the  first.  any  reasonable  person  would
expect  the  slope  of in 3x  to  be  3/x.  not  so.  the  3 cancels,  and  in 3x  has  the  same
slope  as in x. (the real  reason  is  that in 3x = in 3 + in x.)  the antiderivative  of 3/x  is
not in 3x  but  3 in x,  which  is  in x 3.

6  exponentials and logarithms 

before moving to integrals, here is a new method for derivatives: logarithmic dzreren- 
tiation or ld. it  applies to products  and powers. the product  and power  rules  are 
always available, but  sometimes there is an easier way. 

main idea:  the logarithm  of  a  product  p(x) is  a  sum  of  logarithms.  switching  to 
in p, the sum rule just  adds up the derivatives. but there is a catch at the end, as you 
see in the example. 
example 4  find dpldx if  p(x) = xxjx  - 1. here ln p(x) = x in x + f ln(x - 1).

now multiply by  p(x): 

the catch  is  that  last  step. multiplying  by  p complicates  the answer.  this can't  be 
differentiation contains no magic. the derivative of p =fg is the 
helped-logarithmic 
same as from the product  rule: in p = lnf + in g gives 

for p = xex sin x, with  three factors,  the sum has three terms: 

in  p = l n  x + x + l n  sin x and p l = p  

l 

we multiply  p times pl/p (the derivative of  in p). do  the same for  powers: 

integrals  based  on logarithms 

now  comes  an  important  step.  many  integrals  produce  logarithms.  the foremost 
example is  llx, whose integral is in x. in a certain way that is the only example, but 
its  range  is enormously extended  by  the chain  rule. the derivative of  in u(x) is  uf/u, 
so the integral goes from  ul/u back  to in u: 

dx = ln  u(x)  or equivalently 

= in  u. 

try to choose u(x) so that  the integral contains duldx  divided by  u. 

examples 

6.4  logarithms 

final remark  when u is negative, in u cannot be the integral of  llu. the logarithm 
is not defined when u < 0. but the integral can go forward by  switching to  -u: 

jdu? 

i-du/dx

dx= 

-dx =in(-  u). 

- u  

thus in(-  u) succeeds when in u fails.?  the forbidden  case is u =0. the integrals in u 
and in(-  u),  on the  plus  and  minus  sides of  zero,  can  be  combined as lnlul.  every 
integral that gives a logarithm allows u < 0 by  changing to the absolute value lul: 

the areas are  -1  and  -in  3. the graphs of  llx and  l/(x - 5) are below the x axis. 
we  do not have logarithms of  negative numbers, and we  will not integrate  l/(x - 5) 
from 2 to 6. that crosses the forbidden point x = 5, with infinite area on both sides. 
the ratio dulu leads to important integrals. when  u =cos x  or u = sin x, we  are 
integrating the  tangent  and  cotangent. when  there is  a possibility that  u < 0, write 
the integral as in lul. 

now  we  report  on  the  secant  and  cosecant. the integrals of  llcos x  and  llsin x 

also surrender to an attack  by  logarithms - based on a crazy trick: 

sec x + tan x 

tan x)  dx =in  isec x + tan  xi. 

(9) 

1sec  dx = 1  gec 
1csc  x dx = j csc x  (csc  -

+

csc x -cot x 

x)  dx =ln  csc x - cot xi. 

(10) 
here u = sec x + tan x is in the denominator; duldx = sec x tan x + sec2 x is above it. 
the integral is in lul. similarly (10) contains duldx over u =csc x - cot x. 
in closing we  integrate in x itself. the derivative of  x in x is in x + 1. to remove 
the extra  1, subtract x from the integral: iln x dx = x in x -x. 

in contrast, the area under  l/(ln x) has no elementary formula. nevertheless it is 
the key  to the greatest approximation  in mathematics-the  prime  number theorem. 
the area j:  dxlln x is approximately the number of  primes between a and b. near eloo0, 
about  1/1000 of  the integers are prime.

6.5  separable equations including the  logistic equation 

this section begins with  the integrals that solve two basic differential  equations: 

dy -
- - cy 
dt 

dy -- cy + s. 
and  -
dt 

we  already know  the solutions. what we  don't  know is how  to discover those solu-
tions,  when  a  suggestion "try  ec"'  has not been  made.  many important  equations, 
including these, separate into a y-integral and a t-integral. the answer comes directly 
from the two separate integrations. when a differential equation is reduced that far-
to integrals that we  know or can look up-it 

is solved. 

one  particular  equation  will  be  emphasized.  the logistic  equation  describes  the 
speedup and  slowdown  of  growth.  its  solution is  an s-curve, which  starts  slowly, 
rises  quickly,  and  levels  off.  (the  1990's  are  near  the  middle  of  the  s,  if  the 
prediction  is  correct  for  the  world  population.) s-curves  are  solutions to nonlinear 
equations, and we  will  be  solving  our first  nonlinear  model.  it is  highly  important 
in biology  and all life sciences. 

6  exponeniials and logarithms 

separable equnions 

the equations  dyldt = cy and dyldt = cy + s (with constant  source s) can be  solved 
by  a direct method.  the idea is to separate y from  t: 

9= c dt 
y 

and  -dy  -- c  dt. 

y + (sld 

all y's  are on the left side. all  t's  are on the right side (and c can be on either side). 
this separation would not be possible for dyldt = y + t. 

equation  (2) contains differentials. they suggest integrals. the t-integrals give ct 

and the y-integrals give logarithms: 

in y = ct + constant 

and 

in 

(3) 

the constant is determined by the initial condition. at t = 0we require y = yo, and the 
right constant will make that happen: 

then the final step isolates y. the goal is a formula for y itself, not its logarithm, so 
take the exponential  of  both sides (elny is y): 

l n y = c t + l n y o  

and 

y = yoec' 

and 

in  y + -  3= c t + l n y o + - .
(  3 
( 
y +:

= (yo  + :)ec'. 

it is wise to substitute y back  into the differential equation, as a check. 
this is our fourth method for y' = cy + s. method  1 assumed from the start that 
y = aect+ b. method 2 multiplied all inputs by their growth factors ec(' - ')  and added 
up outputs. method 3 solved for y - y,.  method 4 is separation of variables (and all 
methods give the same answer). this separation method is so useful that we  repeat 
its main idea, and then explain it by  using it. 

to solve dyldt = u(y)v(t), separate dy/u(y)from  v(t)dt and integrate both sides: 

then substitute the initial condition to determine c, and solve for  y(t). 

example i  dyldt = y2 separates into  dyly2 = dt.  integrate  to  reach  -l/y = t + c. 
substitute t = 0 and y = yo to find c = - l/yo. now  solve for y: 

- - =  1 

y 

t - -

yo 

and 

y=-.

1 - tyo 

this solution blows up (figure 6.15a) when  t reaches lly,.  if  the bank  pays interest 
on your deposit  squared (y' = y2), you soon have all the money in the world. 
example 2  dyldt = ty separates into dy/y = t dt. then by integration in y =ft2 + c. 
substitute  t = 0 and  y = yo to  find  c = in yo. the exponential  of  *t2 + in yo gives 
y = yoe'2'2. when the interest rate is c = t, the exponent is t2/2. 
example 3  dyldt = y + t  is  not  separable.  method  1  survives  by  assuming  y =

an extra coefficient d in problem 23. method 2 also succeeds- 

ae' + b + dt-with 
but not the separation method. 
example 4  separate dyldt = nylt into dyly = n dtlt. by integration in y = n in t + c. 
substituting  t = 0 produces in 0 and disaster. this equation cannot start from time 
zero (it divides by t). however y can start from y,  at t = 1, which gives c = in y, . the 
solution is a power function  y = y, t ". 
this was the first differential equation in the book  (section 2.2). the ratio of  dyly 
to  dtlt  is  the  "elasticity"  in  economics.  these  relative  changes  have  units  like 
dollars/dollars-they 

are dimensionless, and y = tn has constant elasticity n. 

on log-log  paper the graph of  in y = n in t + c is a straight line with slope n. 

the  logistic equation 

the simplest model of population growth is dyldt = cy. the growth rate c is the birth 
rate minus the death rate. if  c is constant the growth  goes on forever-beyond 
the 
point where the model is reasonable. a population can't  grow all the way to infinity! 
eventually there is competition  for food and space, and y = ect must slow down. 

the true rate c depends on the population size y. it is a function c(y) not a constant. 

the choice of  the model is at least half the problem: 

problem in biology or ecology: 
problem in mathematics: 

discover c(y). 

solve dyldt = c(y)y. 

every model looks linear over a small range of y's-but 
not forever. when the rate 
drops off, two models are of the greatest importance. the michaelis-menten  equation 
has c(y) = c/(y + k). the logistic equation has c(y) = c - by.  it comes first. 

the nonlinear effect is from "interaction."  for two populations of size y and z, the 
number of interactions is proportional to y times z.  the law of mass action produces 
a quadratic term byz. it is the basic model for interactions and competition. here we 
have one population competing within itself, so z is the same as y. this competition 
slows down the growth, because  -by2 goes into the equation. 

the basic model of growth versus competition is known as the logistic equation: 

normally  b is very  small compared  to c. the growth  begins as usual  (close to ect). 
the competition  term by2 is much smaller than cy, until y itselfgets large. then by2 

6  exponentlals and logarithms 

(with its minus sign) slows the growth down. the solution follows an s-curve that 
we can compute exactly. 

what  are  the  numbers  b and  c for  human  population?  ecologists estimate the 
natural growth rate as c = .029/year. that is not the actual rate, because of b.  about 
1930, the world population  was  3 billion. the cy  term predicts a yearly increase of 
(.029)(3 billion) = 87 million. the actual growth was more like dyldt = 60 millionlyear. 
that difference of  27 millionlyear was by2: 

27 millionlyear = b(3 b i l l i ~ n ) ~  

leads to b = 3  10- 12/year. 

certainly b is a small number (three trillionths) but its effect is not small. it reduces 
87 to 60. what is fascinating is to calculate the steady state, when the new term by2 
equals the old term cy. when these terms cancel each other, dyldt = cy - by2 is zero. 
the loss from competition balances the gain from new growth: cy = by2 and y = c/b. 
the growth stops at this equilibrium point-the 

top of  the s-curve: 

c 
y,=t;= 

.029 
- 1012 = 10 billion people. 
3 

according to  verhulst's  logistic equation,  the  world  population  is converging  to  10 
billion. that is from the model. from present indications we are growing much faster. 
we will very probably go beyond 10 billion. the united nations report in section 3.3 
predicts 11 billion to  14 billion. 

notice a special point  halfway to y,  = clb. (in the model this point is at 5  billion.) 
it is the inflection point where the s-curve begins to bend down. the second derivative 
d2y/dt2 is zero. the slope dyldt is a maximum. it is easier to find this point from the 
differential equation (which gives dyldt) than from y. take one more derivative: 

y" = (cy - by2)' = cy' - 2byy' = (c - 2by)y'. 

(8) 

the factor c - 2by is zero at the inflection point y = c/2b, halfway up the s-curve. 

the  s-curve 

the logistic equation is solved by separating variables y and t: 

dyldt = cy - by2 becomes j dy/(cy - by2) = ) dt. 

the first question is  whether we  recognize this y-integral.  no.  the second question 
is whether it is listed in the cover of the book. no. the nearest is idx/(a2 - x2), which 
can be  reached  with  considerable manipulation  (problem 21). the third  question is 
whether a general method is available. yes.  "partial  fractions" is perfectly suited to 
l/(cy - by2), and section 7.4 gives the following integral of  equation (9): 

y 

in-=ct+c 

c - by 

andthen 

yo 
in-=c. 

c -  yo 

(10) 

that constant  c makes the solution correct at t = 0. the logistic equation is  integ- 
rated, but the solution can be improved. take exponentials of  both sides to remove 
the logarithms:

is  not  y  that  increases  so  fast.  according  to  (ll), it  is 

the growth stops at y = clb. that is the final population of  the world (10 billion?). 
we still need a formula for y.  the perfect  s-curve  is the graph of y = 1/(1 + e-').  it 
equals  1 when  t = oo,it  equals 4 when  t = 0, it  equals 0  when  t = - co. it  satisfies 
y'  = y - y2, with  c = b = 1. the  general formula  cannot  be  so  beautiful,  because  it 
allows  any  c, b,  and yo. to find  the  s-curve,  multiply  equation  (11) by  c - by  and 
solve for y: 

when  t  approaches infinity,  e-"  approaches zero. the complicated part  of  the for- 
mula disappears. then y approaches its steady state clb, the asymptote in figure 6.16. 
the s-shape comes from the inflection point halfway up.

state c/b is below 200 million, which the us has already passed. certainly their model

for constant immigration s we could still solve y' = cy - by2 + s by partial fractions-

remark  for good science the y2 term should be explained and justified.  it gave a 
nonlinear  model  that  could  be  completely  solved,  but  simplicity  is  not  necessarily 
truth. the basic justification is this: in a population of size y, the number of encounters 
is  proportional  to  y2.  if  those  encounters  are  fights,  the  term  is  -by2. if  those 
encounters increase the population,  as some like to think, the sign is changed. there 
is a cooperation term  + by2, and the population  increases  very fast. 
example 5  y'  = cy + by2:  y goes  to infinity  in afinite time. 
example6  y'  = - dy + by2:  y  dies to zero  if yo < dlb. 
in  example  6  death wins.  a  small population  dies  out  before  the  cooperation  by2 
can save it. a population  below  dlb is an endangered species. 

the logistic equation can't  predict  oscillations-those 

go beyond  dyldt =f(y). 

the y  line  here is a way to understand every nonlinear equation  y'  =f(y). draw a 
" y  line."  add arrows to show the sign of f(y). when y'  =f(y) is positive, y is increasing 
(it follows  the arrow to the right). whenf  is negative, y goes to the left. when f  is zero, 
the equation is y'  = 0 and y  is stationary: 

y'  = cy - by2 (this is f(y)) 

y'  = - dy + by2 (this is f(y)) 

the arrows take you left or right, to the steady state or to infinity. arrows go toward 
stable steady states. the arrows go away, when the stationary point is unstable.  the 
y line shows which  way y  moves and where it stops.

example 7  kinetics of  a chemical  reaction  ma + nb -+  pc. 

the  reaction  combines  m  molecules  of  a  with  n  molecules  of  b  to  produce  p 
molecules  of  c.  the numbers  m, n, p  are  1, 1,2 for  hydrogen  chloride:  h,  + c1,  = 
2 hcl.  the law  of mass  action  says that  the  reaction  rate  is  proportional  to the 
product  of  the concentrations  [ a ]  and [b].then  [ a ]  decays as [c] grows: 

d[a]/dt= - r[a] [b] 

(15) 
chemistry  measures  r and k.  mathematics solves for  [ a ]  and  [ c ] .write  y  for the 
concentration  [ c ] ,  the  number  of  molecules  in  a  unit  volume.  forming  those  y 
molecules  drops the concentration  [ a ]  from  a,  to a,  - (m/p)y.similarly  [b] drops 
from b,  to b, - (n/p)y.the mass action law (15)contains y2:

this fits our nonlinear model (problem 33-34).  we now find this same mass action 
in biology. you  recognize it whenever there is a product of  two concentrations. 

the  mm equation wdt=- cy/(y+  k) 

biochemical reactions are the keys to life. they take place continually in every living 
organism. their mathematical description is not  easy!  engineering and  physics  go 
far with  linear models, while  biology is quickly nonlinear. it is true that y'  = cy  is 
extremely effective in first-order kinetics (section 6.3), but nature builds in a nonlinear 
regulator. 

it is enzymes that speed up a reaction. without them, your life would be in slow 
motion. blood would take years to clot. steaks would take decades to digest. calculus 
would take centuries to learn. the whole system is awesomely beautiful-dna 
tells 
amino acids how to combine into useful proteins, and we get enzymes and elephants 
and isaac newton. 

briefly, the enzyme enters the reaction and comes out again. it is the catalyst. its 
combination with the substrate is an unstable intermediate, which breaks up into a 
new product and the enzyme (which is ready to start over). 
here are examples of  catalysts, some good and some bad. 

the platinum in a catalytic converter reacts with pollutants from the car engine. 
(but platinum  also reacts with  lead-ten 
gallons of  leaded gasoline and  you 
can forget the platinum.) 
spray propellants (cfc's) catalyze the change from ozone (03) into ordinary 
oxygen (0j.  this wipes out the ozone layer-our 
milk becomes yoghurt and grape juice  becomes wine. 
blood clotting needs a  whole cascade of  enzymes, amplifying the  reaction  at 
every step. in hemophilia-the  "czar's  diseasew-the  enzyme called factor viii 
is missing. a small accident is disaster; the bleeding won't  stop. 
adolph's  meat  tenderizer is a protein from papayas.  it predigests the steak. 
the same enzyme (chymopapain) is injected to soften herniated disks. 
yeast makes bread rise. enzymes put the sour in sourdough. 

shield in the atmosphere. 

of course, it takes enzymes to make enzymes. the maternal egg contains the material 
for a cell, and also half of  the dna. the fertilized egg contains the full instructions. 
we now look at the michaelis-menten  (mm) equation, to describe these reactions. 
it  is based  on the  law  of  mass action.  an  enzyme in  concentration z converts a 
substrate in concentration y by  dyldt = - byz. the rate constant is 6, and you  see 
the product of  "enzyme  times substrate."  a similar law governs the other reactions 
(some go  backwards). the  equations are  nonlinear, with  no  exact  solution. it  is 
typical of  applied mathematics (and nature) that a pattern can still be found. 
what happens is that the enzyme concentration z(t) quickly drops to z, k/(y + k). 
the  michaelis  constant  k  depends  on  the  rates  (like 6) in  the  mass  action  laws. 
later the enzyme reappears (z,  = 2,).  but by  then the first reaction is over. its law 
of  mass action is effectively 

with c =.bz,k.  this is the michaelis-menten  equation-basic 

to biochemistry. 
the rate dyldt is all-important in biology. look at the function cy/(y + k): 

when y is large, dyldt x  - c 

when  y is small, dyldt x  - cylk. 

6  exponentials and logarithms 

the start and the finish operate at different rates, depending whether y dominates k 
or k  dominates y. the fastest rate is c. 

a  biochemist  solves the mm equation by  separating variables: 

s y d y =  -sc dt  gives  y +  k  in y =  - ct + c. 

set t = 0 as usual.  then c = yo + k  in yo. the exponentials of  the two sides are 

we  don't  have a  simple formula  for y.  we are lucky  to get  this close. a  computer 
can quickly  graph y(t)-and  we  see the dynamics of  enzymes. 

problems 27-32  follow up the michaelis-menten  theory. in science, concentrations 
and rate constants come with  units. in mathematics,  variables can be made dimen- 
sionless and constants become  1. we solve d v d t  = y/(y+ 1) and then $witch back 
to y, t, c, k. this idea applies to other equations too. 

essential  point:  most  applications of calculus come  through dzrerential equations. 
that is the language of mathematics-with 
populations and chemicals and epidemics 
obeying the same equation. running parallel to dyldt = cy are the difference equations 
that come next.

6.6  powers lnstead of  exponentials 

you may remember our first look at e. it is the special base for which ex has slope 1 
at  x = 0.that  led  to  the  great equation of  exponential  growth:  the derivative  of 
ex equals  ex. but  our  look  at  the  actual  number  e = 2.71828 ... was  very  short. 

6  exponentlals and logarithms 

it  appeared  as the limit of  (1 + lln)". this seems an unnatural  way  to write  down 
such an important number. 
i  want  to  show  how  (1 + lln)" and  (1 + xln)"  arise naturally.  they  give  discrete 
applications to compound interest. loans and life insur- 
growth infinite steps-with 
ance and money market funds use the discrete form of  yf = cy + s. (we include extra 
information about bank rates, hoping this may be useful some day.) the applications 
in science and engineering are equally important. scientific computing, like account- 
ing, has diflerence equations in parallel with differential equations. 

knowing that this section will be full of formulas, i would like to jump ahead and 
tell you the best one. it is an infinite series for ex. what makes the series beautiful is 
that its derivative is itself: 
start with  y  = 1 + x. this has  y  = 1 and yt = 1 at x = 0.  but y"  is zero, not  one. 
such a simple function doesn't stand a chance! no polynomial can be its own deriva- 
tive, because the highest power xn drops down to nxn-l. the only way is to have no 
highest power.  we  are forced to consider infinitely many terms-a  power series-to 
achieve "derivative equals function.'' 
to produce  the derivative  1 + x, we  need  1 + x + ix2. then ix2 is the derivative 
of  ax3, which is the derivative of  &x4. the best  way  is to write the whole series at 
once: 

infinite series  ex = 1 + x + ix2 + 4x3 + &x4 +  -. 

(1) 

this must be the greatest power series ever discovered. its derivative is itself: 

the derivative of each term is the term before it. the integral of each term is the one 
after it  (so j exdx = ex + c). the  approximation  ex = 1 + x  appears in  the  first  two 
terms. other properties like (ex)(ex) = ezx are not  so obvious. (multiplying series is 
hard  but  interesting.)  it  is  not  even  clear  why  the  sum  is  2.718 ...  when  x =  1. 
somehow  1 + 1 + f + & + 
x4 is divided by  1  2 - 3  4 = 4! = 24, and xs is divided by  5! = 120. the derivative of 
x5/120 is x4/24, because 5 from the derivative cancels 5 from the factorial. in general 
xn/n! has derivative xn - '/(n - l)! surprisingly o!  is  1. 

notice that xn is divided by  the product  1  2  3 * - . -   n.  this is "n factorial."  thus 

equals e. that is where (1 + lln)" will come in. 

chapter 10 emphasizes that  xn/n! becomes extremely small as n increases. the 
is  ex. we  turn  now  to  discrete 

infinite series  adds  up  to  a  finite  number-which 
growth, which produces the same series in the limit.

213  years  after  loan,  uncle  sam  is  dunned 

san  antonio,  may  26-more 
than  200  years  ago,  a  wealthy  pennsylvania 
merchant named jacob dehaven lent $450,000 to the continental congress to 
rescue the troops at valley forge. that loan was apparently never  repaid. 

so mr. dehaven's  descendants are taking the united states government to 
court to collect what  they believe they  are owed. the total: $141 billion  if  the 
interest is  compounded  daily at 6 percent,  the going rate at the  time. if  com- 
pounded  yearly, the bill is only $98 billion. 

the thousands of  family members scattered around the country  say they are 
not  being  greedy. "it's  not  the  money-it's 
the  principle  of  the  thing,"  said 
carolyn cokerham, a dehaven on her father's  side who lives in  san antonio. 

. 

6.6  powen instead of  exponentlals 

"you  have to wonder whether there would even be a united states if  this man 
had not made the sacrifice that he did. he gave everything he had." 

the descendants say that they are willing to be flexible about the amount of 

settlement. but they also note that interest is accumulating at $190 a second. 

"none  of  these people have any intention of  bankrupting  the government," 
said jo beth kloecker, a lawyer from stafford, texas. fresh out of  law school, 
ms.  kloecker  accepted  the  case  for  less  than  the  customary  30  percent 
contingency. 

it is unclear  how many  descendants there are.  ms.  kloecker estimates that 
based on 10 generations with four children in each generation, there could be as 
many as half a million. 

the initial suit was dismissed on the ground that the statute of  limitations is 
six years for a suit against the federal government. the family's appeal asserts 
that this violates article 6 of the constitution, which declares as valid all debts 
owed by  the government before the constitution was adopted. 

mr. dehaven died penniless in  1812. he had no children. 

c o m p o u n d  interest 

the idea of compound interest can be applied right away. suppose you invest $1000 
at a rate of  100% (hard to do). if  this is the annual rate, the interest after a year is 
another $1000. you receive $2000 in all. but if  the interest is compounded you receive 
more: 

after six months: interest of  $500 is reinvested to give $1500 

end of  year: new interest of  $750 (50% of  1500) gives $2250 total. 

the bank  multiplied  twice  by  1.5 (1000 to  1500 to  2250). compounding  quarterly 
multiplies four  times by  1.25 (1 for principal, .25 for interest): 

after one quarter the total is  1000 + (.25)(1000) = 1250 
after two quarters the total is 1250 + (.25)(1250)= 1562.50 
after nine months the total is  1562.50 + (.25)(1562.50)= 1953.12 
after a full year the total is  1953.12 + (.25)(@53. 12) = 2441.41 

each step multiplies by  1 + (l/n), to add one nth of  a year's interest-still  at 100%: 

quarterly conversion: (1 + 1/4)4x  low  = 2441.41 
monthly conversion: (1 + 1/12)"  x  1 q h= 2613.04 
daily conversion: (1 + 1/365)36% 1000  = 2714.57. 

many banks use  360 days in a year, although computers have made that  obsolete. 
very  few  banks  use  minutes (525,600 per  year). nobody  compounds every  second 
(n = 31,536,000). but  some banks offer continuous compounding. this is the limiting 
case (n -+  go)  that produces e: 

x  1000 approaches e x  1000 = 2718.28.

this  approximation  gets  better.  the  limit  is  1.  conclusion: 
the number whose logarithm is  1. sections 6.2 and 6.4 define 

as  l/n  gets  smaller, 
(1 + l/n)" approaches 
the same number (which is e). 
2.  slow method for  (1 + l/n)": multiply out all the terms.  then let n + a. 
this is a brutal use of the binomial theorem. it involves nothing smart like logarithms, 
but the result is a fantastic new formula for e. 

practice for n = 3: 

binomial theorem for  any positive integer n: 

each term in equation (4) approaches a limit as n + a. typical terms are 

next comes  111  2  3  4. the sum of  all those limits in (4) is our new formula for e: 

in summation notation this is z,"=,  l/k! = e. the factorials give fast convergence: 

those nine terms give an accuracy that was not reached by  n = 365 compoundings. 
a limit is still involved (to add up the whole series). you never see e without a limit! 
it  can  be  defined by  derivatives or  integrals  or powers (1 + l/n)" or by  an infinite 
series. something goes to zero or infinity, and care is required. 
all  terms in equation (4) are below (or equal to) the corresponding terms in (5). 
the power (1 + l/n)" approaches e from below. there is a steady increase with n. faster 
compounding yields more  interest.  continuous  compounding at  100% yields e,  as 
each term in (4) moves up to its limit in (5). 
remark  change (1 + lln)" to (1 + xln)".  now  the  binomial  theorem  produces  ex: 

please recognize ex on the right  side! it is the infinite power  series in equation  (1). 
the next term is x3/6 (x can be positive or negative). this is a final formula for ex: 

the logarithm of  that power is n in(1 + x/n) x n(x/n) = x. the power approaches ex. 
to summarize: the quick  method  proves (1 + lln)" + e by  logarithms. the  slow 
method (multiplying out every term) led to the infinite series. together they show the 
agreement of  all our definitions of  e. 

difference equations vs.  differential equations 


we  have the chance to see an important part  of  applied mathematics. this is not a 
course on differential equations, and it cannot become  a course on difference equ- 
ations. but  it is a course with  a purpose-we 
aim  to use  what  we  know.  our main 
application of  e was to solve y'  = cy and y'  = cy + s. now we solve the corresponding 
difference equations. 

above  all,  the  goal is  to see  the connections.  the  purpose  of  mathematics  is  to 
understand and explain patterns. the path from "discrete to continuous" is beautifully 
illustrated  by  these  equations. not  every  class will  pursue  them  to the end, but  i 
cannot fail to show the pattern in a difference equation: 

each step multiplies by  the same number a. the starting value yo is followed by  ay,, 
a2yo, and a3y0. the solution at discrete times t = 0, 1,2, .. . is y(t) = atyo. 

this formula  atyo replaces the continuous solution ectyo of  the differential equation.

a source or sink (birth or death, deposit or withdrawal) is like y'  = cy + s: 

y(t + 1)= ay(t) + s. 

each step multiplies by  a and adds s. the first outputs are 

we  saw this pattern for differential equations-every 
input s becomes a new  starting 
point. it is multiplied by powers of  a. since s enters later than yo, the powers stop at 
t - 1. algebra turns the sum into a clean formula by  adding the geometric series: 

y(t)= atyo + s[at-'  +at-'  +  + a +  1]=  atyo + s(at-  l)/(a-  1).

example 1  interest at 8% from annual ira deposits of  s = $2000 (here yo = 0). 
the first deposit is at year t = 1. in a year it is multiplied by a = 1.08, because 8% is 
added. at  the same time a new  s = 2000 goes in. at  t = 3 the first deposit has been 
multiplied by (1.08)2, the second by  1.08, and there is another s = 2000. after year t, 

(10) 
with  t = 1 this is  2000.  with  t = 2 it is 2000 (1.08 + 1)-two  deposits. notice how 
a - 1 (the interest rate .08) appears in the denominator. 

y(t) = 2000(1.08' - 1)/(1 .08 - 1). 

example 2  approach to steady state when  la1 < 1. compare with c <0. 
with  a > 1,  everything  has  been  increasing.  that  corresponds  to  c > 0  in  the 
differential equation (which is growth). but things die, and money is spent, so a can 
be smaller than one. in that case atyo approaches zero-the 
starting balance disap- 
pears.  what happens if  there is also a source? every year  half  of  the balance y(t) is

spent and a new  $2000 is deposited. now  a = +: 

y(t + 1) = $y(t) + 2000  yields  y(t) = (f)ty, + 2000[((+)'  - i)/(+- i)]. 

the limit as t -,co is an equilibrium point. as  (fy goes to zero, y(t) stabilizes to 

y,  = 200qo - i)/($- 1)= 4000 = steady state. 

(1 1) 
why is 4000 steady? because half  is lost  and the new  2000 makes it up again.  the 
iteration is y,,,  ,= fy,, + 2000. ztsfied point  is where y,  =fy,  + 2000. 
in  general  the  steady  equation  is  y,  = ay,  + s.  solving for  y,  gives  s/(l - a). 
compare with the steady differential equation y'  = cy + s = 0:

example 3  demand equals supply when the price is right. 
difference equations  are basic to economics. decisions are made every  year  (by a 
farmer) or every day (by a  bank) or every minute  (by the stock market). there are 
three assumptions: 

1.  supply next time depends on price this time: s(t + 1)= cp(t). 
2.  demand  next time depends on price next time: d(t + 1) = - dp(t + 1)+ b. 
3.  demand next time equals supply next time: d(t + 1)= s(t + 1). 

comment on 3: the price sets itself to make demand = supply. the demand slope  -d 
is negative. the  supply  slope c is  positive. those lines intersect  at the competitive 
price, where supply equals demand. to find the difference equation, substitute 1 and 
2 into 3: 

difference  equation:  -dp(t + 1)+ b = cp(t) 
steady  state price: 

-dp,  + b = cp,.  thus p,  = b/(c + d). 

the  difference equation  brings  it  down.  if  below, the 

if  the  price  starts above  p,, 
price  goes up.  when  the  price  is  p,, 
theory depends on approach to a steady state. but convergence only occurs if  c < d. 
if  supply is less sensitive than demand, the economy is stable. 
blow-up example: c = 2, b = d = 1. the difference equation is -p(t + 1)+ 1 = 2p(t). 
from p(0) = 1 the price oscillates as it grows: p = - 1, 3,  -5,  11, .... 

it  stays  there.  this  is  not  news-economic 

stable example: c = 112, b = d = 1. the price moves from p(0) = 1 to p(m) = 213:

increasing  d  gives  greater  stability.  that  is  the  effect  of  price  supports.  for  d = 0 
(fixed demand regardless of  price) the economy is out of  control. 

the  mathematics of finance 

it  would  be  a  pleasure  to  make  this  supply-demand  model  more  realistic-with 
curves, not  straight  lines. stability depends  on  the  slope-calculus 
enters.  but  we 
also have to be  realistic about class time. i believe the most practical  application  is 
to solve the fundamentalproblems offinance. section 6.3 answered six questions about 
continuous interest.  we now answer the same six questions when the annual rate is 
x = .05 = 5% and interest is compounded n times a year. 

6.6  powers instead of  exponentials 

first we compute eflective  rates, higher than .05 because of  compounding: 

compounded quarterly ( 1 + - = 1.0509  [effective  rate .0509 = 5.09%]

.:t 

compounded continuously 

eno5= 1 .o5 13  [effective  rate 5.13%] 

now  come  the  six  questions.  next  to  the  new  answer (discrete) we  write  the  old 
answer (continuous). one is algebra, the other is calculus. the time period is 20 years, 
so simple interest on yo would produce (.05)(20)(yo). that equals yo -money doubles 
in 20 years at 5% simple interest. 

questions 1and 2 ask for the future  value y and present  value yo with  compound 

interest n times a year: 

1.  y growing from yo: 

y = (1 + yonyo 

y = e(~os,(20)yo

yo = e-(-05)(20)y 

yo = (1  + :f20ny 

2.  deposit yo to reach y: 
each step multiplies by  a = (1 + .05/n). there are 20n  steps in  20 years. time goes 
backward in question 2. we divide by the growth factor instead of multiplying. the 
future value is greater than the present value (unless the interest rate is negative!). as 
n + go  the discrete y on the left approaches the continuous y on the right. 
deposited, it starts growing. then y = s + as + a2s+ --. 
(1 + .05/n)20n- i] 

questions 3 and 4 connect y to s (with yo = 0 at the  start). as  soon as each s is 

y = s  [e(.05)(20) - i] 

3.  y growing from deposits s: 

y = s[ 

.05/n 

.05 

4.  deposits s to reach y: 

questions 5 and 6 connect yo to s. this time y is zero-there 
is nothing left  at the 
end.  everything is paid. the deposit yo is just  enough to allow payments of  s. this 
is an annuity, where the bank earns interest on your yo while it pays you s (n times 
a year for 20 years). so your deposit in question 5 is less than 20ns. 

question 6 is the opposite-a 

loan. at  the start you borrow yo (instead of  giving 
the bank yo). you can earn interest on it as you pay it back. therefore your payments 
have to total more than yo. this is the calculation for car loans and mortgages. 
5.  annuity:  deposit yo to receive 20n payments of  s: 

6.  loan:. repay yo with 20n payments of  s: 

questions 2,4,6 are the inverses of  1,3,5. notice the pattern: there are three num- 
bers y, yo, and s. one of  them-is zero each time.  if  all three are present, go back  to 
equation (9). 

the algebra for these lines is in the exercises. it is not calculus because at  is not dt. 
1are listed in tables, and the banks keep copies. it might 

all factors in brackets [ 

6  exponenlials and logartthms 

also be  helpful to know their symbols. if  a bank has interest rate i per  period over 
n periods, then in our notation a = 1 + i = 1 + .05/n and t = n = 20n: 

future value of  yo = $1 (line 1):y(n) = (1 + i)n 
present value of  y = $1 (line 2): yo = (1 + i)-n 
future value of  s = $1 (line 3): y(n) = s~~= [(i + i)n- l]/i 
present value of  s = $1 (line 5): yo = a~~= [l- (1 + i)-']/i 

to  tell  the truth, i  never  knew  the last two  formulas until  writing  this book. the 
mortgage  on  my  home  has  n = (12)(25) monthly  payments with  interest  rate  i = 
.07/12. in 1972 the present value was $42,000 = amount borrowed. i am now going 
to see if  the bank is honest.? 
remark 
in  many  loans,  the  bank  computes  interest  on  the  amount  paid  back 
instead  of  the amount  received. this is  called discounting. a  loan of  $1000 at 5% 
for  one year costs $50 interest. normally  you  receive  $1000 and pay  back  $1050. 
with  discounting  you  receive  $950  (called the  proceeds)  and  you  pay  back  $1000. 
the true interest  rate is  higher  than  5%-because 
the  $50 interest is paid  on the 
smaller amount $950. in this case the "discount  rate"  is 501950 = 5.26%. 

scientific computing: differential equations by difference equations 

in biology and business, most events are discrete. in engineering and physics, time 
and space are continuous. maybe at some quantum level it's  all the same, but the 
equations of  physics (starting with newton's law f = ma) are differential equations. 
the great contribution of  calculus is to model the rates of  change we  see in nature. 
but to solve that model with  a computer, it needs to be made digital and discrete. 

these paragraphs work with dyldt = cy. it is the test equation that all analysts use, 
as soon as a new computing method is proposed. its solution is y = ect, starting from 
yo = 1. here we  test  euler's  method (nearly ancient, and not well  thought of). he 
replaced dyldt by  aylat: 

the left side is dyldt, in the limit at +0. we  stop earlier, when at > 0. 

the problem is to solve (13). multiplying by  at, the equation is 

(with y(0) = 1). 
each step multiplies by  a = 1 + cat, so n steps multiply by  an: 

y(t + at) = (1 + cat)y(t) 

y = an= (1 + cat)" at time nat. 

(14) 
this is growth or decay, depending on a. the correct ectis growth or decay, depending 
on  c.  the question is whether an and eczstay close. can one of  them grow while  the 
other decays? we  expect the difference equation to copy  y'  = cy, but  we  might  be 
wrong. 

a good example is y'  = - y.  then c = - 1 and y = e-'-the 

true solution decays. 

?it's not. s is too big. i knew it. 

the calculator gives the following answers anfor n = 2, 10,20: 

the big  step at = 3 shows total instability (top row). the numbers blow  up when 
they should decay. the row with at = 1 is equally useless (all zeros). in practice the 
magnitude of  cat must come down to .10 or .05. for accurate calculations it would 
have to be even smaller, unless we change to a better difference equation. that is the 
right thing to do. 
notice the two reasonable numbers. they are .35 and .36, approaching e- ' = .37. 
they come from n = 10 (with at = 1/10) and n = 20 (with at = 1/20). those have the 
same clock time nat = 1: 

the main diagonal of  the table is executing (1 + xln)" -, e" in the case x = - 1. 

final question: how quickly are .35 and .36 converging to e-'  = .37? with at = .10 
the error is  .02. with at = .05 the error is .01. cutting the time step in half cuts the 
error in half. we are not keeping enough digits to be sure, but the error seems close 
to *at. to test  that, apply the "quick  method"  and estimate an= (1 - atr from its 
logarithm: 

ln(1-  atr = n ln(1-  at) z n[- at - + ( ~ t ) ~ ]- 1-fat. 

=

the clock time is nat = 1. now take exponentials of  the far left and right: 

the difference between anand e- ' is the last term *ate- '. everything comes down 
to one question: is that error the same as *at?  the answer is yes, because e-'12  is 
115. if  we  keep only one digit, the prediction is perfect! 
that took an hour to work out, and i hope it takes longer than at  to read. i wanted 
you to see in use the properties of  in x and e". the exact property in an= n in a came 
first. in the middle of  (15) was the key approximation ln(1 + x) z x -fx2, with x = 
- at.  that x2 term uses the second derivative (section 6.4). at  the very  end came 
e " x l + x .  
a linear approximation shows convergence: (1 + x/n)" -,ex. a quadratic shows the 
error: proportional to at = l/n. it is like using rectangles for areas, with error propor- 
tional to ax. this minimal accuracy was enough to define the integral, and here it is 
enough to define e. it is completely unacceptable for scientific computing. 

the trapezoidal rule, for integrals or for y'  = cy, has errors of order (ax)2 and (at)2. 
all good software goes further than that. euler's first-order method could not predict 
the weather before it happens.

6.7  hyperbolic functions

this  section  combines  ex  with  e - x.  up  to  now  those  functions  have  gone  separate
ways-one  increasing,  the  other  decreasing.  but two  particular  combinations  have
earned  names  of their  own  (cosh x  and  sinh x):

hyperbolic  cosine  cosh  x- =

ex + e - x

hyperbolic  sine  sinh  x = -

ex -

e-x

the  first name  rhymes  with  "gosh".  the second  is  usually  pronounced  "cinch".

the  graphs  in figure  6.18  show  that cosh x > sinh x.  for large  x  both hyperbolic
functions  come  extremely  close  to   ex. when  x  is  large  and  negative, it  is  e- x  that
dominates.  cosh  x  still  goes  up  to  +  00  while  sinh x  goes  down  to  - co  (because
sinh x  has  a minus  sign  in  front  of e-x).

the  following  facts  come  directly  from  ((ex + e - x) and    (ex - e-x):

cosh(-  x) =  cosh  x  and  cosh  0 =  1  (cosh is  even like  the  cosine)

sinh(-  x) =  - sinh  x and  sinh 0 = 0 

(sinh  is  odd like  the sine)

the  graph  of cosh x  corresponds  to  a  hanging  cable  (hanging  under  its  weight).
turned  upside  down,  it has the  shape  of the  gateway  arch  in  st. louis.  that  must
be  the  largest  upside-down  cosh  function  ever  built.  a  cable  is  easier  to  construct
than  an arch,  because  gravity does  the work.  with  the right axes  in  problem 55,  the
height  of the cable  is  a  stretched-out  cosh function  called  a catenary:
(cable tension/cable  density  = a).

y = a cosh  (x/a) 

busch  stadium  in  st. louis  has  96  catenary  curves,  to match  the arch.

the properties  of the hyperbolic functions  come directly from the definitions.  there
are  too many properties  to  memorize-and  no  reason  to do  it! one  rule is  the most
important.  every fact about sines and cosines is reflected in a corresponding fact about
sinh x and cosh x. often  the only difference  is  a minus  sign.  here are four properties:

1. (cosh  x)2 - (sinh  x)2 =  1

fig.  6.20  the  unit  circle  cos 2t + sin2t = 1 and  the  unit  hyperbola  cosh 2t - sinh 2t =  1.

property  1 is  the connection  to  hyperbolas.  it is  responsible  for the  "h"  in cosh and
sinh.  remember  that  (cos x)2 + (sin x)2 =  1 puts  the  point  (cos x,  sin  x)  onto  a  unit
circle. as  x varies,  the point goes around  the circle.  the  ordinary sine and cosine  are
"circular  functions."  now look at (cosh x, sinh x). property  1 is (cosh x)2 - (sinh x) 2 =
1, so this  point  travels  on the  unit hyperbola in  figure 6.20.

properties come directly from cosh2x- sinh2x= 1. divide by  cosh2x and sinh2x:

inverse  hyperbolic  functions 

you  remember  the  angles  sin-'x  and  tan-'x  and  sec-'x. 
in  section 4.4  we 
differentiated those inverse functions by the chain rule. the main application was to 
integrals.  if  we  happen  to  meet  jdx/(l+ x2), it  is  tan-'x  + c.  the  situation  for 
sinh- 'x  and tanh- 'x  and sech- 'x  is the same except for sign changes - which are 
expected for hyperbolic functions. we write down the three new derivatives: 

1 

y = sinh-'x  (meaning x = sinh y)  has 9= 

dx  j 2 t i  
y = tanh-'x  (meaning x = tanh y)  has 9= -
1 - x2

y = sech -'x  (meaning x = sech y)  has d y  =

problems 44-46  compute dyldx from  l/(dx/dy). the alternative is to use logarithms. 
since in x is the inverse of  ex, we  can express sinh-'x  and tanh-'x  and sech-'x  as 
logarithms. here is y = tanh- 'x: 

the  last  step is  an  ordinary  derivative of  4 ln(1 + x) - ln(1 - x).  nothing  is  new 
except the answer. but where did the logarithms come from? in  the  middle of  the 
following identity, multiply above and below by  cosh y: 
cosh y + sinh y 
cosh y - sinh y 

1 + x - 1 + tanh y 
-- 
1- tanh y 
1 - x 

ey

e-y 

- e2y.

then 2y is the logarithm of  the left side. this is the first equation in (4), and it is the 
third formula in the following list: 

remark 1  those are listed onlyfor reference. if  possible do not memorize them. the 
derivatives in equations (i), (2), (3) offer a choice of  antiderivatives - either inverse 
functions or logarithms (most tables prefer logarithms). the inside cover of the book 
has 

1%  = f l n [ e ]   + c  (in place of  tanh- 'x + c). 

remark 2  logarithms were not seen for sin- 'x  and tan- 'x  and sec- 'x.  you might 

6  exponentials and logarithms 

wonder why. how does it happen that tanh-'x  is expressed by logarithms, when the 
parallel formula  for tan-lx  was missing? answer:  there must  be  a parallel formula. 
to display it i have to reveal a secret that has been hidden throughout  this section. 
the secret is one of  the great equations of  mathematics.  what formulas for  cos x 
and  sin x  correspond  to  &ex+ e-x)  and  &ex- e-x)?  with  so  many  analogies 
(circular vs.  hyperbolic) you would expect to find something. the formulas do exist, 
but  they  involve imaginary numbers. fortunately  they  are very  simple  and  there  is 
no reason  to withhold  the truth any longer: 

c o s x = - ( e i x + e i x )  

1 
2 

and 

s i n ~ = - ( e ' ~ - - e - ' ~ ) .  

.

2i 

(5)

it is the imaginary exponents that kept those identities hidden.  multiplying sin x by 
i and adding to cos x gives euler's  unbelievably  beautiful  equation 

cos x + i  sin x = eix. 

(6) 

that is parallel to the non-beautiful hyperbolic equation cosh x + sinh x = ex. 

i have  to say  that  (6) is  infinitely more important  than  anything hyperbolic will 
ever be.  the sine and cosine are far more useful than the sinh and cosh. so we end 
our record of  the main  properties, with exercises to bring  out their applications.

techniques of  integration 


chapter 5  introduced  the integral  as a limit of  sums. the calculation  of  areas was 
started-by  hand or computer. chapter 6 opened a different door. its new functions 
ex and in x led to differential equations.  you  might say that all along we  have been 
solving the special differential equation dfldx  = v(x). the solution is f = 1 v(x)dx. but 
the step to dyldx = cy was a breakthrough. 

the truth is that we are able to do remarkable things. mathematics has a language, 

and you  are  learning  to speak  it. a  short  time ago  the  symbols dyldx and  j'v(x)dx 
were a mystery. (my own class was not too sure about v(x) itself-the 
symbol for a 
function.) it is easy to forget how far we have come, in looking ahead to what is next. 

i do want to look ahead. for integrals there are two steps to take-more 

functions 
and  more  applications.  by  using mathematics we  make it live. the applications are 
most complete when we know the integral. this short chapter will widen (very much) 
the range of functions we can integrate. a computer with symbolic algebra widens it 
more. 

up to now,  integration  depended on recognizing derivatives. if  v(x) = sec2x then 

f(x) = tan x. to integrate tan x we use a substitution:, 

i!&dx.=-1"-- - in u = - in  cos x. 

u 

what  we  need  now ,are techniques for  other integrals, to change them  around  until 
we can attack them. two examples are j x cos x dx and 5 ,/-
dx, which are not 
immediately recognizable. with  integration  by  parts,  and  a new  substitution,  they 
become simple. 

those examples indicate where this chapter starts and stops. with reasonable effort 
(and  the  help of  tables,  which  is  fair) you  can  integrate  important  functions. with 
intense effort  you  could  integrate  even  more  functions.  in  older  books  that  extra 
tended  to  dominate  the  course.  they  had  integrals  like 
exertion  was  made-it 
+j(x 
which  we  could  work  on  if  we  had  to.  our  time  is  too 
valuable for  that! like long division, the ideas are for us and their intricate elaboration 
is for the computer.

integration by  parts comes first. then we  do new  substitutions.  partial fractions 
is  a  useful  idea  (already applied  to  the  logistic equation y' = cy - by2). in  the  last 
section x  goes to infinity  or y(x) goes  to  infinity-but 
the  area  stays finite.  these 
improper integrals are quite common. chapter 8 brings the applications.

integration  by parts

there  are  two  major  ways  to  manipulate  integrals  (with  the  hope  of making  them
easier).  substitutions  are  based  on  the  chain  rule,  and  more  are  ahead.  here  we
present  the other method,  based  on the product rule. the reverse  of the product rule,
to  find  integrals  not derivatives,  is integration by parts.

we  have  mentioned  j cos2x dx  and  j in x dx.  now  is  the  right  time  to compute
them  (plus  more  examples).  you  will  see  how  j in x dx  is  exchanged  for  j 1 dx-a
definite  improvement.  also  j xex dx is  exchanged  for  j ex dx. the  difference  between
the  harder  integral  and the  easier  integral  is  a known  term-that is  the  point.

one  note  before  starting:  integration  by parts  is not just a trick with  no meaning.
on  the  contrary,  it expresses  basic  physical  laws  of equilibrium  and  force  balance.
it  is  a foundation  for  the theory  of differential  equations  (and even  delta  functions).
the  final  paragraphs,  which  are completely  optional,  illustrate those  points  too.

we  begin  with  the  product  rule for  the derivative  of u(x)  times  v(x):

u(x) 

dv 
dx 

+ v(x)d  - d (u(x)v(x)). 

du 
d
dx  dx

(1)

integrate both  sides.  on  the  right,  integration  brings  back  u(x)v(x).  on  the  left  are
two  integrals,  and one  of them  moves  to  the  other  side  (with a minus  sign):

u(x) 

dx = u(x)v(x)  -

v(x) 

dx. 

(2)

that  is  the  key  to  this  section-not  too  impressive  at  first,  but  very  powerful.  it is
integration by parts (u  and  v are  the parts).  in practice  we write  it  without  x's:

7a  the  integration  by parts  formula  is  j u  dv = uv - jv du. 

(3)

the  problem  of  integrating  u dv/dx  is changed  into  the  problem  of  integrating
v du/dx. there is a minus  sign to remember,  and there is the "integrated  term"  u(x)v(x).
in the  definite integral, that product  u(x)v(x)  is  evaluated  at  the endpoints  a and  b:

lb 
dv 
u  dx 
a  dx 

-

u(b)v(b) - u(a)v(a) -

(4)
the  key  is in choosing u  and v. the  goal  of that  choice  is  to  make 5 v du easier  than
j  u dv.  this  is best  seen  by  examples.
example  1  for f in x dx choose  u = in x and  dv = dx (so  v= x):

v dx. 
dx

du

in xdx  =  uv  -

v du =  x ln  x -

x  dx.

i used the basic formula (3).  instead  of working with in x (searching for an antideriva-
tive),  we  now  work  with  the  right  hand side.  there  x  times  l/x  is  1. the  integral  of
1 is  x. including the  minus sign  and  the integrated  term  uv =  x in x  and  the constant
c,  the  answer  is

(5)
for  safety,  take the derivative. the product rule  gives in x + x(1/x) - 1, which  is  in x.
the  area  under y  = in x  from  2  to  3 is  3 in 3 - 3 - 2 in 2 + 2.

j in x dx = x in x - x + c. 

7  techniques of integration 

to repeat: we exchanged the integral of  in x for the integral of  1. 

example 2  for 5 x cos x dx choose u = x and dv  = cos x dx (so v(x) = sin x): 

again the right side has a simple integral, which completes the solution: 

(7) 
note  the new integral is not always simpler. we could have chosen u = cos x and 
dv = x dx. then v = fx2. integration using those parts give the true but useless result 

j'xcos x d x = x  sin x+cos x +  c. 

the  last  integral  is  harder  instead  of  easier  (x2 is  worse  than  x).  in  the  forward 
direction this is no help. but in the opposite direction it simplifies sf x2 sin x dx. the 
idea in choosing u and v  is this: try to give  u a nice derivative and du  a nice integral. 

example 3  for j (cos x ) ~dx choose u = cos x and dv  = cos x dx (so v = sin x): 

~ ( c o s   = uv  - j v  du = cos x sin x + 1(sin x ) ~  
dx.

x ) ~ ~ x  

the integral of  (sin x)'  is no better and no worse than the integral of (cos x ) ~ .  but we 
never see (sin x ) ~  without thinking of  1 - (cos x ) ~ .  so substitute for (sin x ) ~ :  

j'(cos x ) ~dx = cos x sin x + j' 1 dx - j (cos x)2 dx. 

the last integral on the right joins its twin  on the left, and j'  1 dx = x: 

2 j (cos x ) ~  dx = cos x sin x + x. 

dividing by  2 gives the answer, which  is definitely not gcos x ) ~ .  add any c: 

{(cos x)'  dx = f (cos x sin x + x) + c. 

(8) 

question  integrate (cos x)'  from 0 to 2n. why should the area be n? 
answer  the definite integral is gcos x sin x + x)]:".  this does give n. that area can 
+ (sin x ) ~  1. the area under 
also be found by  common sense, starting from (cos x ) ~  
1 is 2n. the areas under (cos x ) ~  

are the same. so each one is n. 

and (sin x ) ~  

=

example 4  evaluate j tan-'x  dx by  choosing u = tan-'x  and v = x: 

stan-'x  dx= uv- sv  d u = x  tan-'x- 

the last integral has w = 1 + x2 below and almost has dw  = 2x dx above: 

substituting back into (9) gives j tan- 'x  dx as x tan- 'x  - f ln(1 + x2). all the familiar 
inverse functions can be  integrated by  parts (take v = x, and add "+ c"  at the end). 
our final example shows how two integrations by parts  may be needed, when  the 

first one only simplifies the problem half  way. 

example 5  for j x2exdx choose u = x2 and dv = exdx  (so v = ex): 

j x2exdx= uv  - v du = x2ex- ex(2x dx). 

7.1 

integration  by parts

285

the last integral  involves  xex.  this  is  better  than  x 2ex,  but  it still  needs  work:

f xexdx  = uv - fv  du = xex -

(11)
finally  ex  is  alone.  after two  integrations  by  parts,  we  reach i exdx.  in equation (11),
the integral of xex is xex  - ex.  substituting  back  into (10),

(now u = x). 

exdx 

f x 2exdx = x2ex  - 2[xex  - ex]  + c.

these five  examples are in  the list of prime candidates for integration by parts:
xnex,  x"sin x,  x"cos  x,  x"ln x,  exsin  x,  excos  x,  sin-'x,  tan-x, ....

fig.  7.1  the geometry  of integration  by  parts.  delta  function  (area 1) multiplies  v(x)  at  x = 0.

in the movie  stand and deliver, the los  angeles teacher jaime  escalante computed
j x2sin  x dx with  two  integrations  by parts.  his success  was  through  exercises-plus
insight  in  choosing  u  and  v. (notice  the  difference  from  f x sin  x 2 dx.  that  falls  the
other  way-to a substitution.)  the class  did  extremely  well  on  the  advanced  place-
ment  exam.  if you  saw  the  movie,  you  remember  that  the  examiner  didn't  believe
it  was  possible.  i spoke  to  him long  after,  and he  confirms  that practice  was  the key.

the  delta  function

from  the  most familiar  functions  we  move  to  the  least  familiar.  the  delta function is
the derivative of a step function. the  step  function  u(x) jumps  from 0  to  1 at x = 0.
we  write  6(x) = du/dx, recognizing  as  we do  it  that  there  is no  genuine  derivative  at
the  jump.  the  delta  function  is  the  limit  of higher  and  higher  spikes-from  the
"burst  of speed"  in  section  1.2.  they  approach  an  infinite  spike  concentrated  at  a
single  point  (where  u jumps).  this  "non-function"  may  be  unconventional--it  is
certainly optional-but it is  important  enough  to  come  back  to.

the  slope  du/dx  is  zero  except  at  x = 0,  where  the  step  function  jumps.  thus
6(x) = 0 except  at  that one  point,  where  the delta function  has a  "spike."  we cannot
give  a value for 6 at x =  0, but  we know its integral across the jump. on every  interval
from  - a  to  a, the integral  of du/dx brings  back  u:

-a  6(x)  dx= -

dx d= u(x)]  a = 1. 

(13)

"the  area  under  the  infinitely  tall  and  infinitely  thin  spike  6(x) equals  1."

so  far so good.  the integral  of 6(x) is  u(x).  we  now  integrate  by parts for a crucial
purpose-tofind the area under v(x)6(x).  this  is an ordinary  function  times  the delta
function.  in  some  sense  v(x)  times  6(x)  equals  v(o)  times  6(x)-because  away  from
x = 0  the  product  is  always  zero.  thus  ex6(x)  equals  6(x),  and  sin x 6(x) = 0.

7  techniques of integration

the  area under  v(x)6(x)  is  v(0)-which  integration  by  parts will  prove:

7b  the integral  of v(x) times  6(x) is  fa_  v(x)6(x)dx  = v(0).

the  area  is  v(0)  because  the  spike  is  multiplied  by  v(o)-the  value  of the  smooth
function  v(x)  at the spike. but multiplying  infinity is dangerous,  to  say the least. (two
times  infinity  is  infinity).  we  cannot  deal  directly  with  the  delta  function.  it is only
known  by its integrals! as  long  as  the applications  produce  integrals  (as they do),  we
can  avoid  the fact  that  6 is  not  a true function.

the integral  of v(x)6(x)=  v(x)du/dx  is  computed  "by  parts:"

a  nightmare  question  occurs  to  me.  what is the derivative of the  delta function?

integration  by  parts  in engineering

physics  and  engineering  and  economics  frequently  involve  products. work  is  force
times distance.  power is  voltage times  current. income is  price times  quantity. when
there  are  several  forces  or  currents  or  sales,  we  add  the  products.  when  there  are
infinitely  many,  we integrate  (probably by  parts).

i  start with  differential  equations  for the  displacement  u at point  x  in  a bar:

dv 
dx 

s=  f(x) with  v(x) =  k 

du
dx

(16)

this describes  a hanging  bar pulled down by a forcef(x).  each point x moves through
a  distance  u(x).  the  top  of  the bar  is  fixed,  so  u(0)= 0.  the  stretching  in  the  bar is
du/dx.  the internal  force  created  by  stretching  is  v = k  du/dx. (this is  hooke's  law.)
equation  (16)  is  a balance of forces on  the  small  piece  of the bar  in figure  7.2.

v ( x )  = - fx + c

the constants c and d  are settled at the endpoints (as usual for integrals). at  x = 0 
we  are given u = o  so d=o.  at  x =  1  we  are given v =   w so c =  w + f. then v(x) 
and u(x)give force and displacement in the bar. 

and 

ku(x)= -f fx'  + cx + d.

7.2  trigonometric integrals 

the next section will put old integrals into new forms.  for example  x2,/-' 
dx 
will become jsin20 cos20 db. that looks simpler because the square root is gone. but 
still sin20 cos28 has to be integrated.  this brief section integrates any product  of shes 
and cosines and secants and tangents. 

there are two methods to choose from. one uses integration  by  parts, the other 
is based on trigonometric identities.  both methods try to make the integral easy (but 
that may  take time). we follow convention  by  changing the letter 8 back  to x. 

7.2  trigonometric integrals 

notice  that  sin4x cos x dx  is  easy  to  integrate.  it  is  u4du.  this  is  the  goal  in 

example l-to 

separate out cos x dx. it becomes du, and sin x is u. 

example i j sin2x cos3x dx  (the exponent 3 is odd) 
solution  keep cos x dx as du.  convert the other cos2x to 1 - sin2x: 

example 2  5 sin5x dx 
solution  keep  sin x dx  and  convert everything else to  cosines.  the conversion is 
always based on sin2x+ cos2x= 1: 

(the exponent 5 is odd) 

j(l - c o ~ ~ x ) ~ s i nx dx = !(i- 2 cos2x + cos4x) sin x dx. 

now cos x is u and  -sin x dx is du. we have !(- 1 + 2u2 - u4)du. 
general method for 5 sinmx cosnx dx, when m or n is odd 
if  n is odd, separate out  a  single cos x dx. that leaves an even number  of  cosines. 

convert them to sines. then cos x dx is du and the sines are u's. 

if  m is odd, separate out a single sin x dx as du.  convert the rest to cosines. 
if  m and n  are both  odd, use either method. 
if  m and n are both even, a new method is needed. here are two examples. 
example 3  5 cos2x dx 
there are two good ways to integrate cos2x, but substitution is not one of  them. if 
u equals cos x, then du is not here. the successful methods are integration by  parts 
and  double-angle formulas. both  answers  are  in  equation  (2) below-i 
don't  see 
either one as the obvious winner. 

(m = 0,n = 2, both even) 

integrating cos2x by  parts was example 3 of  section 7.1. the other approach, by 

double angles, is based on these formulas from trigonometry: 

cos2x= f(1 + cos 2x) 

(1) 
the integral of  cos 2x is 5 sin 2x. so these formulas can be integrated directly. they 
give the only integrals you should memorize-either 
the integration by  parts  form, 
or the result from these double angles: 

sin2x= f(1- cos 2x) 

cos2x dx equals  )(x + sin x cos x) 
1sin2x dx equals  $(x - sin x cos x) 

or 
or 

)x + 4sin 2x 
f x -& sin 2x 

(plus c). 
(plus c). 

(2) 
(3) 

(m = 0,n = 4, both are even) 

example 4  1cos4x dx 
changing cos2x to  1 - sin2x gets us  nowhere. all exponents stay even. substituting 
u = sin x won't  simplify sin4x dx, without du. integrate by  parts or switch to 2x. 
first solution  integrate by parts.  take u = cos3x and dv  = cos x dx: 

1(cos3x)(cos x dx) = uv - j v du = cos3x sin x - j (sin x)(-  3 cos2x sin x dx). 

the  last  integral  has  even  powers  sin2x and  cos2x. this  looks  like  no  progress. 
replacing sin2x by  1 - cos2x produces cos4x on the right-hand side also: 

j cos4x dx = cos3x sin x + 3 5 cos2x(l - cos2x)dx. 

7  techniques of integration 

always even powers in the integrals. but now move  3  cos4x dx to the left side: 

reduction 

4 5 cos4x dx = cos3x sin x + 3  cos2x dx. 

(4) 

partial success-the 
but a lower power. the integral of  cos2x is already known. use it in equation (4): 

problem is reduced  from cos4x to cos2x. still an even power, 

i cos4x dx = $ cos3x sin x + 3  f (x + sin x cos x) + c. 

second solution  substitute the double-angle formula  cos2x = 3 + 3 cos 2x: 
cos4x dx = 5 (f + f  cos 2x)'dx  =  i (1 + 2 cos 2x + cos2 2x)dx. 

(5) 

certainly i dx = x. also 2 i cos 2x dx = sin 2x. that leaves the cosine squared: 

i cos22x = i f (1 + cos 4x)dx = f x  +  sin 4x + c. 

the integral of  cos4x using double angles is 

$[x + sin 2x + f x  + $sin 4x1 + c. 

that solution looks different from equation (s), but it can't be. there all angles were 
x,  here we  have  2x  and 4x.  we  went  from  cos4x to cos22x to cos 4x,  which  was 
integrated immediately. the powers were cut in half as the angle was doubled. 

double-angle method for  i sinmx cosnx dx, when m and n are even. 

replace sin2x by  f (1 - cos 2x) and  cos2x by  & i +  cos 2x). the exponents drop to 
m/2 and n/2. if  those are even, repeat the idea (2x goes to 4x). if  m/2 or n/2 is odd, 
switch to the "general method"  using substitution. with an odd power, we  have du. 
example 5  (double angle)  i sin2x cos2x dx = i i ( l  - cos 2x)(1 + cos 2x)dx. 
this leaves  1 - cos2 2x in the last integral. that is familiar but not necessarily easy. 
we can look it up (safest) or remember it (quickest) or use double angles again: 

(1-cos22x)dx=-

) 

conclusion  every  sinmx cosnx can be integrated. this includes negative m and n- 
see  tangents  and  secants below.  symbolic codes like  macsyma or  mathematica 
give the answer directly. do they use double angles or integration by  parts? 

you  may  prefer the answer from integration by  parts (i usually do). it avoids 2x 
and 4x. but it makes no sense to go through every step every time. either a computer 
does the algebra, or we  use a "reduction formula"  from n to n - 2: 

n j cosnx dx = cosn-'x  sin x + (n - 1)  cos"-~x dx. 

reduction 
(7) 
for n = 2 this is i cos2x dx-the 
integral to learn. for n = 4 the reduction produces 
cos2x. the integral of  cos6x goes to cos4x. there are similar reduction formulas for 
sinmx and also for sinmx cosnx. i don't  see a good reason to memorize them. 

integrals with angles px  and qx 

instead  of  sin8x times cos6x, suppose you  have  sin 8x times  cos 6x.  how  do you 
integrate? separately a sine and cosine are easy. the new question is  the integral of 
the product: 

7.2  trigonometric intagrals 

example 6  find i:"  sin 8x cos 6x dx.  more generallyfind i:"  sin px cos qx dx. 
this is not for the  sake of  making up new  problems.  i believe these  are the most 
important definite integrals in this chapter (p and q are 0, 1,2, . . .). they may be the 
most  important in  all of  mathematics, especially  because  the  question has  such a 
beautiful  answer.  the integrals  are  zero. on  that  fact  rests  the  success  of  fourier 
series, and the whole industry of  signal processing. 

one approach (the slow way) is to replace sin 8x and cos 6x by powers of  cosines. 
that involves cos14x. the integration is not fun. a better approach, which applies to 
all angles px  and qx, is to use the identity 

sin px  cos qx =f sin(p + q)x +f sin(p - q)x. 

(8) 
thus  sin 8x cos 6x =f sin 14x +f sin 2x.  separated  like  that,  sines  are  easy  to 
integrate:

since cos 14x is periodic, it has the same value at 0 and 2n.  subtraction gives zero. 
the same is  true for cos 2x. the integral of  sine times cosine is always zero over a 
complete period (like 0 to 2n). 

what about sin px sin qx and cos px cos qx? their integrals are also zero, provided 
p is dinerent from  q. when p = q we  have a perfect square. there is no negative area 
to cancel the positive area. the integral of  cos2px or sin2px is n. 

i:"  sin 8x sin 7x dx = 0  and  i:"  sin2 8x dx = n. 

example 7 
with  two  sines  or  two  cosines (instead  of  sine  times  cosine), we  go  back  to  the 
addition formulas of  section 1.5. problem 24 derives these formulas: 

sin px sin qx = -4 cos(p + q)x +  cos(p - q)x 
cos px cos qx =  + cos(p + q)x +9 cos(p - q)x. 

(9) 
(10) 
with p = 8 and q = 7, we get cos 15x and cos x. their definite integrals are zero. with 
p = 8 and q = 8, we  get cos 16x and cos ox  (which is  1). formulas (9) and (10) also 
give a factor f .  the integral of f  is n: 

1:"  sin 8x sin 7x dx = - f1:"  cos 15x dx + $i:"  cos  x dx = 0 + 0 
cocl6x dx + fi:"  cos ox  dx = 0 + n 
1:" 

sin 8x sin 8x dx = - )i:" 

the answer zero is memorable. the answer n appears constantly in  fourier  series. 
no  ordinary  numbers  are  seen  in  these  integrals. the  case  p = q = 1 brings  back 
cos2x dx =f + t sin 2x. 

secants and tangents 

when  we  allow negative powers m and  n,  the main  fact remains  true.  all  integrals 
i sinmx cosnx dx can be expressed by known functions. the novelty for negative pow- 
ers is that logarithms appear. that happens right at the start, for sin x/cos x and for 
ljcos x (tangent and secant): 

i tan x dx = -i duju = - lnlcos x j  
i sec x dx = 

duju = 

(here u = cos x) 

lnlsec x + tan xl  (here u = sec x + tan x). 

7  techniques of  integration 

for higher  powers there  is  one  key  identity:  1 + tan2x = sec2x. that  is  the  old 
identity cos2x + sin2x= 1 in disguise (just divide by  cos2x). we  switch tangents to 
secants just  as  we  switched  sines  to  cosines.  since  (tan x)' = sec2x and  (sec x)' = 
sec x tan x, nothing else comes in. 
example 8  [ tan2x dx = [(sec2x - 1)dx= tan x - x + c .  
example 9  [ tan3x dx = [ tan x(sec2x - 1)dx. 
the  first  integral  on  the  right  is  [u du = iu2, with  u = tan x.  the  last  integral  is 
-[ tan x dx. the complete answer is f(tan x ) ~+ lnlcos x i + c. by  taking absolute 
values, a negative cosine is also allowed. avoid cos x = 0.

example ii [sec3x dx = uv  -[ v  du = sec x tan x  - [tan2x sec x dx 
this was  integration  by  parts,  with  u = sec x  and  v = tan x.  in  the  integral on  the 
right, replace tan2x by  sec2x - 1 (this identity is basic): 

[ sec3x dx = sec x tan x - [ sec3x dx + [ sec x dx. 

bring i sec3x dx to the left side. that reduces the problem from sec3x to sec x. 
i believe those examples make the point-trigonometric 

integrals are computable. 
every product  tanmx secnx can be  reduced to one of  these examples. if  n  is even we 
substitute  u = tan x.  if  m is  odd  we  set  u = sec x. if  m is  even  and  n is  odd, use  a 
reduction formula (and always use  tan2x = sec2x- 1). 

i mention very briefly a completely different substitution u = tan i x .  this seems to 

all students and instructors (quite correctly) to come out of  the blue: 

sin x = - and 

2u 
1 + u2 

cos x =  - and 

1 - u2 
1+ u2 

dx = - (1 1) 

2du
1 + u2' 

the x-integral can involve sums as well  as products-not 
only sinmx cosnx but also 
1/(5+ sin x - tan x). (no square roots.) the u-integral is a ratio of  ordinary polynomi- 
als. it is done by  partial fractions. 

application of  j sec x dx to distance on  a map (mercator projection) 

the strange integral ln(sec x + tan x) has  an  everyday application.  it  measures the 
distance from the equator to latitude x, on a mercator map of  the world. 

all  mapmakers face the impossibility of  putting part of  a sphere onto a flat page. 
you  can't  preserve distances, when  an  orange peel  is  flattened. but  angles can  be 
preserved,  and  mercator  found a  way  to do it.  his map came before newton and 
leibniz. amazingly, and accidentally, somebody matched distances on the map with 
a table of  logarithms-and  discovered  sec x dx before  calculus. you  would not be 
surprised to meet sin x, but  who  would  recognize ln(sec x + tan x)? 

the map starts with  strips at all latitudes x. the heights are dx,  the  lengths are 
proportional  to  cos x.  we  stretch the strips by  l/cos x-then  figure 7 . 3 ~  lines  up 
small 
evenly on the page. when dx is also divided by cos x, angles are preserved-a

trigonometric substitutions 

the most  powerful tool we  have, for integrating with pencil and paper and brain, is 
the method of  substitution. to make it work, we have to think of good substitutions- 
which make the integral simpler. this section concentrates on the single most  valu- 
able collection  of  substitutions.  they  are the  only  ones you  should memorize,  and 
two examples are given immediately. 

7.3  trigonometric substitutions

the  expression  j1  - x2 is  awkward  as  a  function  of  x.  it  becomes  graceful  as  a 
function  of  8. we  are practically  invited  to use  the  equation  1 - (sin 0)2 = (cos 
then the square root is simply cos 9-provided 

this cosine is positive. 

notice  the  change  in  dx.  when x  is  sin 8,  dx  is  cos 0 do.  figure 7.4a  shows the 
original  area  with  new  letters.  figure 7.4b  shows  an  equal  area,  after  rewriting 
j (cos b)(cos o do) as 5 (cos2e) do. changing from x to 8 gives a new height and a new 
base.  there is no change in area-that 
to put it bluntly: if we go from ,,/-

to cos 0, and forget the difference between

we still need the integral of cos20. this was example 3 of integration by parts, and 
also equation 7.2.6. it is worth memorizing. the example shows this 0 integral, and 
returns to x:

we changed sin 0 back to x and cos o to ,,/-. 
notice that 0 is sin-'x.  the answer 
is trickier than you might expect for the area under a circular  arc. figure 7.5 shows 
how the two pieces of the integral are the areas of a pie-shaped wedge and a triangle.

7  techniques of  integration 

with a memory from chapter 4,  the substitution  x = sin 8 makes the solution auto- 
matic. from 5 d8 = 8 we  go back to sin-'x. 

the rest  of  this section is about other substitutions.  they are more complicated 
than x = sin 8 (but closely related). a table will display the three main choices-sin  8, 
tan 8, sec 8-and 

their uses. 

trigonometric  substitutions 

after working with ,/-, 
the change x = sin 8 simplified 
the first, but it does nothing for the second: 4 - sin28 is not familiar. nevertheless a 
factor of  2 makes everything work. instead of  x = sin 8, the idea is to substitute x = 
2 sin 8: 

the next step is ,/-.


jf?= jggg = 2 cos 8 

and 

dx = 2 cos 8 do. 

notice  both  2's.  the integral is 4 1 cos28 db = 2 sin 8 cos 8 + 28. but  watch  closely. 
this is not 4 times the previous 1 cos28 do!  since x is 2 sin 8, 8 is now  sin- '(~12). 
example 3  1 ,/-
based  on ,/-
x = a sin 8. then the a's  separate out: 

here  is  the general  rule for  ,/-.

and 

 d x = a c o s 8 d 8 .

that is the automatic substitution to try, whenever  the square root appears. 

here a2 = 16. then a = 4 and x = 4 sin 8. the integral has 4 cos 8 above and below, 
so it  is 1 db.  the antiderivative is just  8. for the definite integral notice that  x = 4 
means sin 8 = 1, and this means 8 = 7112. 
there is no mention of 1 d8 = 8. but  what  if  16 - x2 changes to x2 - 16? 

a  table of  integrals would hide that substitution.  the table only gives sin-'(~14). 

example 5 

8 

1x=4, / f x  

dx 

= ?

notice the two changes-the 
sign in the square root and the limits on x. example 4 
stayed inside the interval  1x1 < 4,  where  16 - x2 has a  square root.  example 5 stays 
outside, where x2 - 16 has a  square root. the new  problem cannot use x = 4 sin 8, 
because we don't  want the square root of  -cos28. 

the new substitution is x = 4 sec 8. this turns the square root into 4 tan 8: 

x = 4  sec 8  gives  d x = 4  sec 8 tan  8 d8  and  x2 - 16= 16sec28-  16= 16 tan2@. 

this substitution solves the example, when the limits are changed to 8: 

4 sec 8 tan do --jy3s e c 8 d 8 = l n ( ~ e c 8 + t a n 8 ) ] ~ ~ = l n ( 2 + f i ) .  

!:i3 

4 tan 8 

i  want  to  emphasize  the  three  steps.  first  came  the  substitution  x = 4 sec 8.  an 
unrecognizable integral became  sec 6db.  second came the new  limits (8 = 0 when 
x = 4, 8 = 7113  when x = 8). then i integrated sec 8.

example  6 has the  same  x 2  - 16.  so  the  substitution  is  again  x = 4 sec 8:

solution 

warning  with lower limit 0 = 0 (or x = 4) this integral would be a disaster. it divides
by sin  0,  which  is zero.  this  area is infinite.
(warning)2   example  5 also  blew  up at x = 4,  but the area was  not infinite.  to make
the point  directly,  compare  x-- 1/2  to  x- 3/ 2. both  blow  up at  x = 0,  but  the first  one
has finite  area:

dx=2 

o  2

section  7.5  separates  finite  areas  (slow  growth  of  1/  x) from  infinite  areas  (fast
growth  of x-3/2).
last substitution  together  with  16 - x 2  and  x 2 - 16  comes  the  possibility  16 + x 2.
- x2, but  for  obvious  reasons  we  don't  take  its  square
(you  might  ask  about  -16 
root.)  this  third  form  16  + x 2  requires  a  third  substitution  x = 4 tan  0.  then
16 + x 2 =  16  + 16  tan20 = 16  sec 20.  here is  an example:

note  there  is a subtle  difference  between  changing  x  to sin 0  and  changing  sin 0  to u:

in  example  1, dx  was  replaced  by  cos  0 do (new method)
in  example  6, cos  0  do was  already  there  and became  du  (old method).
the combination  cos 0  do was  put  into the first  and  pulled out  of the  second.

my  point  is  that  chapter  5  needed  du/dx  inside  the  integral.  then  (du/dx)dx
became du.  now it is not necessary to see so far ahead. we  can  try any  substitution.
if it  works,  we win.  in this  section,  x =  sin 0  or  sec 0 or tan  0  is  bound to  succeed.

7  techniques of  integration 

we mention the hyperbolic substitutions tanh 8, sinh 8, and cosh 8. the table below 
shows their use. they give new forms for the same integrals. if  you are familiar with 
hyperbolic  functions the new form might  look simpler-as 

it does in example 8. 

x = a tanh8  replaces  a2 - x2  by  a2 sech28  and  dx  by  a sech28 db 
x = a sinh8  replaces  a2 + x2  by  a2 cosh28  and  dx  by  a cosh 8 d8 
x = a cosh 8  replaces  x2 - a2  by  a2 sinh28  and  dx  by  a  sinh  8 d8 

example 8 

i,/&=sinh 0  = 8 + c = cosh-'x  + c. 

sinh 8 d8 

db  is simple.  the bad  part is cosh- 'x  at the end. compare with  x = sec 8: 

sj&=j' 

sec 8 tan 8 d8 

= ln(sec 8 + tan 8) + c = ln(x + d m )+ c.

t a n 0  

this way looks harder, but most tables prefer  that final logarithm. it is clearer than 
cosh-'x,  even if  it takes more space. all answers agree if  problem 35 is correct. 

completing the  square 

we have not said what to do for jm,/-.or 
those square roots 
contain a linear term-a  multiple of x. the device for removing linear terms is worth 
knowing.  it is called completing the square, and two examples will begin to explain it: 

x 2 - 2 x + 2 = ( x -

1 = u 2 +  1 

the idea  has  three steps.  first,  get  the  x2 and  x  terms  into one  square. here  that 
square was (x - 1)2= x2 - 2x + 1. second, fix up the constant term. here we  recover 
the original functions by adding  1. third, set u = x - 1 to leave no linear term. then 
the integral goes forward based  on the substitutions of  this section: 

the same idea applies to any quadratic that contains a linear  term  2bx: 
(x + b)2+ c ,  with  c = c - b2 
rewrite 
rewrite  - x2 + 2bx + c  as  - (x - b)2+ c ,  with  c = c + b2 

x2 + 2bx + c  as 

to match the quadratic with  the square, we fix  up the constant: 

x2 + lox + 16= 
(x + 5)2+ c leads to c =  16 - 25 = -9 
- x 2 +   l o x +  16= - ( x -   5)*+ c leads to c =  1 6 + 2 5 = 4 1 .  

example 9 
here  u = x + 5 and du = dx. now  comes a  choice-struggle 
look  for  du/(u2- a')  inside the front cover. then set a = 3: 

on with  u = 3 sec 0 or 

i 

-

note 

if  the quadratic starts with  5x2 or  -5x2,  factor out the 5 first: 
5x2- lox + 25 = 5(x2-2x + 5) = (complete the square) = 5[(x  - + 41. 
now  u = x - 1 produces 5[u2 + 41.  this is ready for table lookup or u = 2 tan 8: 

i 

dx 

du 

- 1 2  sec28d"

5x2- lox + 25 - 5[u2 + 41 - 5[4  sec28]  10 

example 10 
this answer is 8/10 + c. now go backwards: 8/10 = (tan- ' f u)/lo = (tan- ' f(x - -))/lo. 
nobody could see that from the start. a double substitution takes practice, from x 
to u to 8. then go backwards from 8 to u to x. 
final remark  for u2 + az we  substitute u = a tan 8. for u2 - a2 we  substitute u = 
a sec 8. this big dividing line depends on whether the constant c (after completing 
the  square) is  positive  or negative.  we  either  have  c = a* or  c = -a2. the same 
dividing line in the original x2 + 2bx + c is between  c > b2 and c < b2. in between, 
c = b2 yields the perfect square (x + b)'-
and no trigonometric substitution at all.

partial fractions

this section is about rational functions p(x)/q(x).sometimes their  integrals are also 
rational functions (ratios of polynomials). more often they are not. it is very common 
for the integral of  piq  to involve logarithms. we meet logarithms immediately in the 

7.4  pattial fractions 

simple case  l/(x - 2), whose integral is lnlx - 21  + c. we meet them again in a sum 
of  simple cases: 

our plan  is to split  piq into a sum like this-and 

integrate each piece. 

which rational function produced that particular  sum? it was 

this is piq. it is a ratio of  polynomials, degree 1 over degree 3. the pieces of p are 
collected into  -4x + 16. the common denominator (x - 2)(x + 2)(x)= x3 - 4x is q. 
but i kept these factors separate, for the following reason. when we  start with piq, 
and break it into a sum of pieces, thefirst things we need  are the factors  of q. 

in the standard problem piq is given. to integrate it, we break it up. the goal of 
partial fractions is to find the pieces-to  prepare for  integration. that is the technique 
to learn in this section, and we  start right away with examples. 

example 1  suppose piq has the same q but  a different numerator  p: 

notice the form of  those pieces! they are the  "partial fractions"  that  add  to piq. 
each one is a constant divided by a factor of  q. we know the factors x - 2 and x + 2 
and x. we don't  know the constants a, b, c. in the previous case they were 1,3, -4. 
in this and other examples, there are two ways to find them. 
method 1(slow)  put the right side of  (1) over the common denominator  q: 

why is a multiplied by (x + 2)(x)? because canceling those factors will leave a/(x - 2) 
as in equation (1). similarly we  have b/(x + 2) and clx. choose the numbers a,  b,  c 
so that the numerators match. as  soon as they agree, the splitting is correct. 
method 2 (quicker)  multiply equation (1) by  x - 2. that leaves a space: 

now set x = 2 and immediately you have a.  the last two terms of (3) are zero, because 
x - 2 is zero when x = 2. on the left side, x = 2 gives 

notice how multiplying by  x - 2 produced a hole on the left  side. method 2 is the 
"cover-up method."  cover  up  x - 2  and  then  substitute  x = 2.  the  result  is  3 = 
a + 0 + 0, just  what we wanted. 
in method 1, the numerators of equation (2) must agree. the factors that multiply 
the cover-up method 

b and c are again zero at x = 2. that leads to the same a-but 
avoids the unnecessary step of  writing down equation (2). 

302 

7  techniques of integration 

calculation ofb  multiply equation (1) by  x + 2, which covers up the (x + 2): 

now set x = - 2, so a  and c are multiplied by zero: 

this is almost full speed, but (4) was not  needed. just cover up  in  q and give x  the 
right value (which makes the covered factor zero). 

calculation of  c (quickest)  in equation (i), cover up the factor (x) and set x = 0: 

to repeat: the same result a = 3, b = - 1, c = 1 comes from method  1. 

example 2 
first cover up (x - 1) on the left and set x = 1. next cover up (x + 3) and set x = - 3: 

the integral is tlnlx - 11+ ilnlx + 31 + c. 

example 3  this was needed for the logistic equation in section 6.5: 

1 

a

- +- b 

~ ( ~ - b y ) - ;   c - by' 

first  multiply by  y.  that covers up y in  the  first  two  terms and  changes b  to  by. 
then set y = 0. the equation becomes  l/c = a. 

to find b, multiply by  c - by.  that covers up c - by  in the outside terms. in the 
middle, a  times  c - by  will  be  zero at y = clb. that leaves b  on  the  right equal to 
l/y = blc  on  the  left.  then  a = llc  and  b = blc  give  the  integral  announced  in 
equation 6.5.9: 

it is time to admit that the general method of  partial fractions can be  very awkward. 
first  of  all,  it  requires  the  factors  of  the  denominator  q.  when  q  is  a  quadratic 
ax2+ bx + c, we can find its roots and its factors. in theory a cubic or a quartic can 
example x4 - 1  is 
also  be  factored,  but  in  practice  only  a  few  are  possible-for 
(x2- 1)(x2+ 1).  even for this good example, two of  the roots are imaginary. we can 
split x2 - 1 into (x + l)(x - 1). we cannot split x2 + 1 without introducing i. 

the method  of  partial fractions can work  directly with  x2 + 1, as we  now see. 

example 4 

dx 

(a quadratic over a quadratic). 

this  has  another  difficulty. the  degree of  p equals  the  degree  of  q  (= 2). partial 

7.4  partial fractions 

303 

jiactions  cannot start until p  has lower degree. therefore i  divide the leading term x2 
into the leading term  3x2. that gives 3, which is separated off by itself: 

note how 3 really used 3x2 + 3 from the original numerator. that left 2x + 4. partial 
fractions  will accept  a linear factor  2x + 4 (or ax + b, not just  a) above a quadratic. 
this  example  contains  2x/(x2 + i),  which  integrates  to  ln(x2 + 1).  the  final 
4/(x2 + 1) integrates to 4 tan-'x.  when  the denominator is x2 + x + 1 we  complete 
the  square before integrating.  the point  of  sections  7.2  and 7.3 was  to make  that 
integration  possible. this section gets the fraction ready-in 

parts. 

the  essential  point  is  that  we  never  have  to  go  higher  than  quadratics.  every 
denominator q can be split into linear factors  and quadratic factors. there is no magic 
way  to find  those  factors, and most  examples  begin  by  giving them.  they  go  into 
their  own fractions, and they  have their  own numerators-which 
are the  a and b 
and 2x + 4 we have been computing. 

the one remaining  question is what to do if a factor  is repeated. this happens in 

example 5. 

example 5 

the key is the new term b/(x -
that is the right form to expect. with (x - l)(x - 2) 
this term would have been b/(x - 2). but when (x - 1) is repeated, something new is 
needed. to find b, multiply  through by  (x -

and set x = 1: 

2 x + 3 =  a(x-  1)+ b  becomes  5 =  b  when  x =  1. 

this  cover-up  method  gives  b.  then  a =  2  is  easy,  and 
integral 
2 lnlx - 11 - 5/(x - 1). the fraction 5/(x - 1)2 has an integral without  logarithms. 

the 

is 

example 6 

this  final  example  has  almost  everything!  it  is  more  of  a  game  than  a  calculus 
problem. in fact calculus doesn't  enter until we  integrate (and nothing is new  there). 
before computing a, b, c, d, e, we write down the overall rules for partial fractions: 

the degree of p must be less than the degree of q. otherwise divide their leading 
terms as in equation (8) to lower the degree of  p. here 3 < 5. 
expect  the  fractions illustrated  by  example 6.  the linear  factors  x  and  x + 1 
(and the repeated x2) are underneath  constants. the quadratic x2 + 4 is under a 
linear term. a  repeated (x2 + 4)2 would  be under  a new  fx + g. 
find the numbers a,  b,  c,  .. . by  any means, including  cover-up. 
integrate each term separately and add. 

we could prove  that this method  always works.  it makes better  sense to show that 
it works once, in example 6. 

to  find  e,  cover  up  (x - 1)  on  the  left  and  substitute  x = 1.  then  e = 3. 
to  find  b,  cover  up  x2 on  the  left  and  set  x = 0.  then  b = 4/(0 + 4)(0 - 1)= -1. 
the cover-up method  has done its job,  and there are several ways  to find a,  c, d. 

7  techniques of  integration 

compare the numerators, after multiplying through by the common denominator q: 

the known terms on the right, from b = - 1 and e = 3, can move to the left: 

we can divide through  by  x and x - 1, which checks that b and e were correct: 

-3x2 - 4 = a(x2+ 4) + (cx + d)x. 

finally  x = 0  yields  a = - 1. this  leaves  -2x2 = (cx + d)x.  then  c = - 2  and 
d=o. 

you should  never  have  to  do  such  a problem!  i  never  intend  to do another  one. 
it  completely depends on expecting  the  right  form  and  matching  the  numerators. 
they could also be matched by comparing coefficients of x4, x3, x2, x, 1-to  give five 
equations  for  a, b, c, d, e. that is  an invitation  to human  error. cover-up is the 
way  to  start, and  usually  the  way  to  finish. with  repeated  factors  and  quadratic 
factors, match numerators at the end.

l 
"zmp~oper"means that some part of jt y(x)dx becomes infinite. it might be b or a or 
the function y. the region under the graph reaches infinitely far-to 
the right or left 
or up  or down. (those come from b = oo  and a = - oo  and y  + oo  and y  -, - oo.) 
nevertheless the integral may "converge."  just because the region is infinite, it is not 
automatic that the area is infinite. that is the point of  this section-to  decide when 
improper integrals have proper answers. 

the first examples show finite area when b = oo, then a = - m ,  then y  = i/&  at 

x = 0.the areas in figure 7.6 are 1, 1,2: 

fig. 7.6  the shaded areas are finite but the regions go to infinity.

7  techniques  of  integration

in practice  we  substitute  the  dangerous limits  and watch  what  happens.  when  the
substituting  b =  oo  gives  "-  1/oo  = 0."  when  the  integral  is  ex,
oo  gives  "e-"  = 0."  i  think that is fair,  and i know it is successful.

integral  is  -1/x, 
substituting  a =  -
but  it is  not completely  precise.

the  strict  rules  involve  a  limit.  calculus  sneaks  up  on  1/oo  and  e-"  just  as  it
sneaks  up  on  0/0.  instead  of  swallowing  an  infinite  region  all  at  once,  the  formal
definitions  push  out to the limit:

definition 

00b 

y(x)dx  =  lim 

a 

b 

f 

y(x)dx 

b 

f  - 0 

y(x)dx  = 

lim 
-

a 

b

y(x)dx.

the conclusion  is  the  same.  the  first examples  converged  to  1, 1, 2.  now  come  two
more  examples  going  out  to b = oo:

the  area  under  1/x  is  infinite:  d= in x  = co 

the  area  under  1/xp  is finite if p > 1:

(2)

the  area  under  1/x  is  like  1 + i + - +  + 
-, which  is  also  infinite.  in  fact  the  sum
approximates  the integral-the curved area is  close to  the rectangular  area.  they go
together (slowly to  infinity).

a  larger  p  brings  the graph  more  quickly to  zero.  figure 7.7a  shows  a  finite area
1/(p - 1) = 100.  the region  is  still infinite,  but we  can  cover  it  with  strips  cut  out  of
a square!  the borderline  for  finite  area  is  p =  1. i  call  it  the borderline,  but  p =  1 is
strictly  on  the side  of divergence.

the borderline is  also p =  1 when  the function climbs  the y  axis. at x = 0,  the graph
of y =  1/xp goes to  infinity.  for p =  1, the area under  1/x  is again  infinite. but at x =
0  it is  a small p (meaning p <  1) that  produces  finite  area:

ifp<l. 

(3)

loosely speaking  "-in 0 = oo."  strictly  speaking we  integrate from  the point  x = a
near zero,  to  get f,  dx/x =- 
in a. as  a  approaches  zero,  the  area  shows  itself  as
infinite.  for y  = 1/x2, which  blows  up  faster,  the area  - 1/x]o is  again  infinite.
for y  =  1/  x,  the area from 0 to  1 is 2. in that case p =   . for p =  99/100 the area
is  1/(1  - p) = 100.  approaching  p = 1 the  borderline  in  figure  7.7  seems  clear.  but
that cutoff is not as sharp as it looks.

narrower  borderline  under  the graph of  llx, the area is infinite. when we  divide 
by in x or (ln x ) ~ ,  the borderline is somewhere in between. one has infinite area (going 
out to x = a ) ,  the other area is finite: 

the first is  dulu  with  u = in x.  the logarithm  of  in x  does eventually make it  to 
infinity. at  x = 10l0, the logarithm is near  23 and  ln(1n x) is near  3. that  is  slow! 
even slower is ln(ln(1n x)) in problem 11. no function is exactly on the borderline. 
the second integral in equation (4) is convergent (to 1). it is 1du/u2 with u = in x. 
at  first i wrote it with x going from zero to infinity. that gave an answer i couldn't 
believe: 

there must  be  a mistake, because we  are integrating a positive function. the area 
can't  be zero. it is true that  l/ln b goes to zero as b + oo. it is also true that  l/ln a 
goes to zero as a -,0. but  there is another infinity in  this integral. the trouble is at 
x = 1, where in x is zero and the area is infinite. 

example 1  the factor e-"  overrides any power xp (but only as x -,a ) .  

jr~ ' o e - ~ d x  

= 50!  but  jr~ - ' e - ~ d x  oo.

the first integral is  (50)(49)(48)--.(i). it comes from fifty integrations by  parts (not 
recommended). changing  50  to 3,  the  integral defines  "ifactorial."  the  product 
*(- i)(-$).--  has  no  way  to  stop,  but  somehow  i!is  *&.see  problem 28. 
the integral ic xoe-"dx= 1 is the reason behind "zero factorial"  = 1. that seems the 
most surprising of  all. 

the area under e-"/x  is (-i)!  = oo.  the factor e-"  is absolutely no help at x = 0. 

that is an example (the first of  many) in which we  do not know an antiderivative- 
but still we get a decision. to integrate e -"/x we need a computer. but to decide that 
an improper integral is infinite (in this case) or finite (in other cases), we  rely on the 
following comparison test:

is smaller than the area under hx): 
j'u(x)dx<ooif~u(x)dx<m

comparison can decide if  the area is finite. we don't  get the exact area, but we learn 
about one function from the other. the trick  is  to construct a simple function (like 
l/xp) which is on one side of  the given function-and 

stays close to it:

applications of  the  integral 


we  are experts in  one application  of  the integral-to 
find  the area  under  a  curve. 
the curve is the  graph  of  y = v(x), extending from  x = a  at the left  to x = b at the 
right. the area between the curve and the x axis is the definite integral. 

i think  of  that integral in the following way. the region is made up of  thin strips. 
their width is dx  and their  height is v(x). the area  of  a  strip is v(x) times dx. the 
area  of  all  the  strips  is  1:  v(x) dx.  strictly  speaking,  the  area  of  one  strip  is 
meaningless-genuine 
rectangles have width ax. my point is that the picture of thin 
strips gives the correct approach. 

we know what function to integrate (from the picture). we also know how (from 
this course or a calculator). the new applications to volume and length and surface 
area  cut  up  the  region  in  new  ways.  again  the  small pieces  tell  the  story.  in  this 
chapter, what to integrate is more important than how. 

8.1  areas and volumes by slices 

this section starts with areas between curves. then it moves to volumes,  where the 
strips become slices. we  are weighing a loaf  of  bread by  adding the weights  of  the 
slices. the discussion is dominated by examples and figures-the 
theory is minimal. 
the real problem is to set up the right integral. at the end we look at a different way 
of  cutting up volumes, into thin  shells. all formulas  are collected into a j n a l  table. 

figure 8.1  shows the  area  between  two  curves.  the  upper  curve  is  the  graph  of 
y = v(x). the lower curve is the graph of y = w(x). the strip height is v(x) - w(x), from 
one curve down to the other. the width is dx (speaking informally again). the total 
area is the integral of  "top  minus bottom": 

area between two curves = 

[v(x) - w (x)] dx. 

(1) 

example 1  the  upper  curve is  y = 6x  (straight  line). the lower  curve  is  y = 3x2 
(parabola). the area lies between the points where those curves intersect. 
to find  the intersection points,  solve  u(x) = w(x) or  6x = 3x2.

fig. 8.1  area between curves = integral of  v - w.  area in example  2 starts with x 2 0. 

one crossing is at x  = 0, the other is at x  = 2. the area is an integral from 0 to 2: 

area = jz  (v - w) d x  = ji  (6x - 3 x 2 )  d x  = 3x2 - x 3 ] ;  = 4. 

example 2  find the area between the circle v = jmand the 45"  line w = x. 
first  question:  which  area  and  what  limits?  start  with  the  pie-shaped  wedge  in 
figure 8.1 b.  the area begins at the y  axis and  ends where the circle meets the line. 
at  the intersection point  we  have  u(x)= w(x): 

from 

= x  squaring gives  1  - x2 = x 2  and  then 2x2 = 1. 

thus x2 = f .  the endpoint is at x  = 1/j2.  now  integrate the strip height  v - w: 

the  area  is  n/8  (one  eighth  of  the  circle). to  integrate jpdx  we  apply  the 
cos20 d0 = f(0 + sin 0 cos o), 
techniques  of  chapter 7:  set  x  = sin 0,  convert  to 
convert back  using 0 = sin-'  x .  it is harder than expected, for a familiar shape. 

remark  suppose the problem  is to find  the  whole  area  between the circle and  the 
line. the figure shows  v = w  at two  points,  which  are x  = 1/$ 
(already used) and 
instead of starting at x  = 0, which gave $ of a circle, we now include 
also x  = - i/$. 
the area to the left. 

main point:  integrating from  x  = -i/$ 

to x  = 1 / f i   will give  the wrong  answer. 
it misses the part  of  the circle that bulges out over itself, at the far left. in that  part, 
the  strips have  height  2v  instead  of  v - w. the figure is  essential,  to get the correct 
area of  this half-circle. 

horizontal strips  instead of vertical  strips 

there is more than one way to slice a region.  vertical slices give x integrals. horizontal 
slices give  y  integrals. we have a free choice, and sometimes the  y  integral is better.

fig. 8.2  vertical slices (x integrals) vs. horizontal slices (y integrals). 

figure 8.2 shows a unit parallelogram, with base 1 and height 1. to find its area from 
vertical slices, three separate integrals are necessary. you should see why! with hori- 
zontal slices of  length  1 and thickness dy, the area is just ji dy = 1. 

example 3  find the area under y = in x (or beyond x = ey) out to x = e. 
the x integral from vertical slices is in figure 8.2~. the y integral is in 8.2d. the area 
is a choice between two equal integrals (i personally would choose y): 

jz=,  in x dx = [x  in x -xi',= 1 

or  i:=,ey)dy= [ey  - ey];  = 1.

volumes by slices 

for  the  first  time  in  this  book,  we  now  look  at  volumes.  the  regions  are  three- 
dimensional solids. there are three coordinates x, y, z-and  many ways to cut  up a 
solid. 

figure 8.3 shows one basic way-using 

slices. the slices have  thickness dx, like 
strips in the plane. instead  of  the height  y of  a  strip, we  now  have the area a of a 
cross-section. this area is different for different slices: a  depends on x. the volume 
of  the slice is its area times its thickness: dv = a(x) dx. the volume of  the whole solid 
is the integral: 

volume = integral of area times thickness = 1 a(x) dx. 

(2) 
note  an  actual slice does not have the same area on both sides! its thickness is ax 
(not  dx).  its  volume  is  approximately  a(x) ax  (but  not  exactly).  in  the  limit,  the 
thickness approaches zero and the sum of  volumes approaches the integral. 

for a cylinder all slices are the same. figure 8.3b shows a cylinder-not 

circular. 
the area is a fixed number a,  so integration is trivial. the volume is a times h.  the 

fig. 8.3  cross-sections have area a(x). volumes are  a(x) dx. 

8  applications of the integral 

letter h, which stands for height, reminds us that the cylinder  often stands on its end. 
then the slices are horizontal and the y integral  or z integral  goes from 0 to h. 

when  the cross-section is a circle, the cylinder  has volume  nr2 h. 

example 4  the  triangular  wedge  in  figure 8.3b  has  constant  cross-sections with 
area a = f(3)(4)= 6. the volume is 6h. 

example 5  for the  triangular  pyramid in figure 8.3c, the area  a(x) drops from  6 
to 0. it is a general rule for pyramids or cones that their volume has an extra factor 
f (compared to cylinders). the volume is now 2h  instead of  6h. for a cone with base 
area  nr2, the volume is f nu2 h.  tapering  the area  to zero  leaves only f  of  the  volume. 
why the f ?  triangles sliced from the pyramid  have shorter sides. starting from  3 
and  4,  the  side lengths  3(1 - x/h) and  4(1 - x/h) drop to zero  at x = h.  the area  is 
a = 6(1 - ~ / h ) ~ .notice:  the side lengths go down linearly, the area drops quadrati- 
cally. the factor f really  comes from integrating r2to get i x 3 :  

example 6  a half-sphere of radius r has known volume $($nr3). its cross-sections 
are semicircles. the key relation  is x2 + r2 = r ~ ,for the right triangle in  figure 8.4a. 
the area of  the semicircle is a = fnr2 = $n(r2 - x 2 ) .so we  integrate a(u): 

example 7  find  the  volume  of  the  same  half-sphere  using  horizontal  slices 
(figure 8.4b). the sphere still has radius r. the new right triangle gives y2 + r2 = r ~ .
since we  have full  circles the  area  is  nr2 = n(r2- y2). notice  that  this  is  a(y) not 
a(x). but  the y integral  starts at zero: 

 

volume =  a(y) dy = n(r2 y - f y3)];  = s ~ r - '(as before).

solids of  revolution 

cones and spheres and circular cylinders are "solids  of revolution."  rotating a hori- 
zontal line around the x  axis gives  a cylinder. rotating  a  sloping line gives a  cone. 
rotating a semicircle gives a sphere. if a circle is moved away from the axis, rotation 
produces a  torus (a doughnut). the rotation  of  any curve y =f (x) produces  a solid 
of revolution. 

8.1  areas and volumes  by slices

315

the  volume  of that  solid  is  made  easier because  every  cross-section  is a circle.  all
slices  are  pancakes  (or pizzas).  rotating  the  curve  y  =f(x) around  the  x  axis  gives
disks  of radius  y,  so  the area is  a =  cry 2 =  r[f(x)] 2. we  add the  slices:

volume  of solid of revolution =  ry2 dx = j 

f (x) 2 dx.

example  8  rotating y =  / with a = ar(ix)2  produces a "headlight"  (figure 8.5a):

volume  of headlight = j2 a  dx = f2  x dx =  i"x2 
(cid:127) 

= 2tr.

if the same curve  is rotated  around the y axis,  it makes  a champagne  glass.  the slices
are horizontal. the  area  of a  slice  is  trx2 not  try2.when  y =  x this  area  is  ry4 .
integrating  from y = 0 to 

gives  the champagne  volume  i(x2/)5/5.

revolution around the y  axis:  volume = 

x 2  dy.

example  9  the  headlight  has  a hole  down  the center  (figure 8.5b).  volume = ?
the  hole  has  radius  1. all  of  the  ./x solid  is  removed,  up  to  the  point  where \/&
reaches  1. after  that,  from  x =  1 to  x = 2,  each  cross-section  is  a disk  with  a  hole.
the  disk  has radius  f= ./ and the hole  has radius g =  1. the slice is a flat ring or
a "washer."  its  area  is the full  disk  minus  the area of the hole:
area  of washer  =  cf 2  - icg2 =  7r(/x)2 - 7r(1) 2 = 

rx - 7.

2 

this  is  the area a(x)  in  the method of washers. its integral  is  the volume:

j(cid:127)  a  dx = (cid:127)2  (x - r) dx = [  x2 - rx]= -17r.

please  notice:  the  washer area is not ir(f-  g)2 . it is  a  = 7rf2 -

(doughnut sliced into washers)  rotate  a circle  of radius a around  the
x  axis.  the  center  of the circle  stays  out at  a  distance  b > a. show  that  the volume
of the  doughnut (or torus) is  27e2 a2 b.

8  applications of the integral 

the outside half of  the circle rotates to give the outside of  the doughnut. the inside 
half gives the hole. the biggest slice (through the center plane) has outer radius b + a 
and inner radius b - a. 
shifting  over  by  x,  the  outer  radius  is  f = b + jnand  the  inner  radius  is 
g = b - j-. 

figure 8 . 5 ~  shows a  slice (a washer) with  area nf  - ng2. 

area a = n(b + 

- n(b -

= 4 n b j 2 7 .  

now integrate over the washers to find  the  volume of  the doughnut: 

that integral $nu2 is  the  area  of  a  semicircle.  when  we  set  x = a sin 8 the  area  is 
5 a2 cos2 8do. not for the last time do we  meet  cos2 8. 

the hardest part is visualizing the washers, because a doughnut usually breaks the 

other way.  a  better description is a bagel, sliced the long way to be  buttered. 

volumes  by  cylindrical shells 

finally  we  look  at a  different  way  of  cutting up a  solid of  revolution.  so far it  was 
cut into slices. the slices were perpendicular to the axis of  revolution. now the cuts 
are  parallel  to  the  axis,  and each  piece  is  a  thin  cylindrical shell. the new  formula 
gives the same volume,  but the integral  to be computed  might  be easier. 
outer radius is x + dx.  the shell is an outer cylinder minus an  inner cylinder: 
h - nx2 h = nx2 h +2nx(ds)h + ~ ( d x ) ~nx2h. 

figure 8.6a  shows a  solid  cone. a  shell is  inside it. the inner radius  is  x  and the 

shell volume  n(x + d ~ ) ~  

h -

(3) 

the term  that  matters is  2nx(dx)h. the shell  volume is essentially  2nx (the distance 
around) times  dx (the thickness) times  h (the height). the volume of  the solid comes 
from putting together the thin  shells: 

solid  volume = integral of shell  volumes = 

(4) 

this is the central formula of  the shell method. the rest  is examples. 

it is completely typical of integration that ( d ~ ) ~  

remark on this volume formula 
and 
ax)^  disappear. the reason is this.  the number of  shells grows like  l/ax. terms of 
order  ax)^  add  up  to  a  volume  of  order  ax  (approaching zero).  the  linear  term 
involving ax  or  dx is the  one  to get  right. its limit  gives the integral  2nxh dx. the 
key is to build the solid out of  shells-and 
to find the area or volume of each piece. 

example i i  find the volume of  a cone (base area nr2, height  b) cut into shells. 

a tall shell at the center has h near b.  a short shell at the outside has h near zero. in 
between  the  shell  height  h decreases  linearly,  reaching  zero  at x = r. the  height  in 
figure 8.6a is  h = b - bxlr.  integrating  over  all  shells  gives the  volume  of  the  cone 
(with the expected i):

8  applications of the integral 

which to use, slices or shells? start with a vertical line going up to y = cos x. rotating 
the  line around  the  x  axis  produces  a  slice (a  circular  disk). the  radius  is  cos x. 
rotating the line around the y axis produces a shell (the outside of  a cylinder). the 
height is cos x. see figure 8.7 for the slice and the shell. for volumes we just integrate 
7r cos2x dx (the slice volume) or 27rx cos x dx (the shell volume). 

this is the normal choice-slices 

through the x  axis and shells around  the  y axis. 
then y =f (x) gives the disk radius and the shell height. the slice is a washer instead 
of  a  disk  if  there  is  also  an  inner  radius  g(x). no  problem-just 
integrate  small 
volumes. 
what if  you use slices for rotation around the y axis? the disks are in figure 8.7b, 
and their radius is x. this is x = cos- 'y in the example. it is x =f - '(y)  in general. 
you  have to solve y =f (x) to find x in terms of  y.  similarly for shells around the x 
axis:  the length of  the shell is x =f -'(y). integrating may be difficult or impossible. 
when y = cos x is rotated around the x axis, here are the choices for volume: 

(bad by shells) 5  2ny cos -' y dy. 

(good by slices) j n cos2x dx

length of  a  plane curve 

the graph of  y = x3i2is a curve in the  x-y plane.  how  long is that curve? a  definite 
integral needs endpoints, and we specify x = 0 and x = 4. the first problem is to know 
what "length  function"  to integrate. 

the distance along a curve is  the  arc  length. to set up an integral, we  break  the 

8.2  length of  a plane curue 

problem into small pieces. roughly speaking, smallpieces of a smooth curve are nearly 
straight. we know the exact length as  of  a straight piece, and figure 8.8 shows how 
it comes close to a curved piece. 

(ds)'  = (dx)'  + (2j(dx)'

dx 

fig. 8.8  length as  of short straight segment. length ds of very short curved segment. 

here is the unofficial reasoning that gives the length of  the curve. a straight piece 
has  (as)2 = (ax)' + (ay)~.within  that  right  triangle,  the  height  ay  is  the  slope 
(aylax) times ax.  this secant  slope is  close  to the  slope of  the curve. thus ay  is 
approximately (dyldx) ax. 

as z j(ax)~+ (dy/dx)'(ax)'  = ,/i+(dyldx)2  ax. 

(1) 

now add these pieces and make them smaller. the infinitesimal triangle has (ds)'  = 
(dx)'  + (dy)'.  think of  ds as jl+(dyldx)i  dx and integrate: 

length of curve = j  ds = j d

w dx. 

example 1  keep y = x3i2 and dyldx = #x112. watch out for 3 and $: 

length =  ,/-

dx = ($)($)(i + $x)~/']:  = &(lo3i2- l3i2). 

this  answer is just  above  9. a  straight line from (0,o) to (4, 8) has exact length 
f i .note 4'  + 8'  = 80. since f i is just below 9, the curve is surprisingly straight. 
you  may not  approve of  those numbers (or the reasoning  behind them). we can 
fix the reasoning, but nothing can be done about the numbers. this example y = x3/' 
had to be chosen carefully to make the integration possible at all. the length integral 
is difficult because of  the square root. in most cases we integrate numerically. 

example 2  the straight line y = 2x from x = 0 to x = 4 has dyldx = 2: 

length = 5;  ,/=dx = 4 f i   = 

as before 

(just checking). 

we return briefly to the reasoning. the curve is the graph of  y =f (x). each piece 
contains at least  one point  where  secant  slope equals  tangent  slope: aylax =ft(c). 
the  mean  value  theorem  applies when  the  slope is continuous-this 
is required 
for a  smooth curve. the straight length  as is exactly j(ax)'  + (ft(c)ax)'.  adding

so  is is 

that  integral  can't  be  done  in  closed  form.  the  length  of  an  ellipse  can  only  be 
computed numerically. the denominator is zero at x = 1, so a blind application of the 
trapezoidal  rule or simpson's  rule would give length = co. the midpoint  rule gives 
length = 1.9 1 with thousands of intervals.

length of a curve from parametric equations:  x(t) and y(t) 

we have met  the unit circle in two forms. one is x2 + y2 = 1. the other is x = cos t, 
y = sin t. since cos2 t + sin2t = 1,this point goes around the correct circle. one advan- 
tells where the point is and 
tage of the "parameter"  t is to give extra information-it

also  when. in  chapter  1, the  parameter  was  the  time  and  also  the  angle-because
we moved  around  the  circle  with speed  1.

using  t is a natural  way to  give the  position  of a particle  or  a spacecraft.  we  can
recover the  velocity  if we know  x  and y at  every time  t. an equation  y =f(x)  tells the
shape  of the  path,  not  the  speed  along  it.

chapter  12 deals  with  parametric  equations  for  curves.  here  we  concentrate  on
the path  length-which 
allows you  to see the  idea of a parameter  t without  too  much
detail.  we  give  x  as  a  function  of  t  and  y  as  a  function  of  t.  the  curve  is  still
approximated  by straight  pieces, and each piece has (as)2 =  (ax)2 + (ay)2. but instead
of using  ay - (dy/dx) ax,  we approximate  ax and  ay separately:

ax x  (dx/dt) at, 

ay  - (dy/dt) at, 

as ; 

/(dx/dt) 2 + (dy/dt)2 at.

/1-x 2,  and  there  is one  new  advantage.  we  can
the  integral  is  simpler  than  1/ 
integrate around a whole circle with  no trouble. parametric  equations  allow a path  to
close  up  or  even cross  itself. the  time  t  keeps  going  and  the  point  (x(t), y(t))  keeps
moving.  in  contrast,  curves  y =f(x)  are  limited  to  one y for  each  x.

example6  find  the  length  of  the  quarter-ellipse:  x =  cos t  and  y =  /2  sin  t:
is  2 sin2 t + 2 cos2 t = 2  (same  ellipse).  the  non-parametric

on  this  path  y2 + 2x 2
equation  y =  /2  - 2x 2 comes from  eliminating  t.  we keep  t:

this  integral  (7) must  equal  (5). if one  cannot  be done,  neither  can  the  other.  they
are  related  by  x = cos t,  but  (7) does  not  blow  up  at  the  endpoints.  the trapezoidal
rule gives  1.9101 with  less than  100 intervals.  section  5.8 mentioned  that  calculators
automatically  do  a substitution  that  makes  (5) more  like (7).

example7  the path  x=  t2, y =  t3 goes from  (0, 0) to  (4, 8). stop  at  t =  2.

to find  this path  without  the  parameter  t, first  solve  for  t = x1 / 2. then  substitute
into  the  equation  for y:  y =  t3 =  x 3 /2. the non-parametricform  (with  t eliminated)  is
the same curve y = x3/ 2 as in example  1.

the  length  from  the  t-integral  equals  the  length  from  the  x-integral.  this  is

problem  22.

example8  special choice of parameter:  t is x.  the curve  becomes  x =  t, y =  t3/ 2 .

if x =  t then  dx/dt  = 1. the  square  root  in  (6) is the  same  as  the  square  root  in  (4).
thus  the  non-parametric  form y =f(x)  is a special case of the  parametric  form-just
take  t =  x.

compare  x = t, y = t3/ 2 with x =  t 2 ,  y  =  t3. same curve, same length, different  speed.

8.3  area of  a surface of  revolution 

this section starts by  constructing  surfaces. a  curve y =f  (x) is revolved around an 
axis. that produces a "surface  of  revolution,"  which is symmetric around the axis. if 
we  revolve a sloping line, the result is a cone. when the line is parallel to the axis we 
get  a cylinder (a pipe). by  revolving a curve we  might get a lamp or a lamp shade 
(or even the light bulb). 

secti.on 8.1 computed  the  volume  inside that  surface.  this  section  computes  the 
surface area. previously we  cut the solid into slices or shells. now we  need a good 
way to cut up the surface. 

the key idea is to revolve short straight line segments. their slope is ay/ax. they 
can be the same pieces of  length as that were used to find length-now  we  compute 
area. when revolved, a straight piece produces a "thin ban&' (figure 8.10). the curved 
surface, from revolving y =f (x), is close to the bands. the first step is to compute the 
surface area of a band. 

a  small comment: curved surfaces can also be  cut into tiny patches. each patch 
is nearly flat, like a little square. the sum of  those patches leads to a double integral 
(with dx dy). here the  integral  stays one-dimensional (dx or dy  or dt). surfaces of 
revolution are special-we 
approximatz them by bands that go all the way around. 
a  band is just  a belt  with a slope, and its slope has an effect on its area.

8  applications of  the integral 

revolve a  small  straight  piece  (length  as  not  ax).  the  center  of  the  piece  goes 
around a  circle of  radius  r.  the band  is a  slice  of a  cone.  when  we  flatten  it  out 
(problems 11- 13) we discover its area. the area is the side length as times the middle 
circumference 2nr : 

the surface area of a band is 2nras = 2nrdl+( a ~ / a x ) ~ax. 

for revolution  around the y axis, the radius is r = x.  for revolution around the x 
axis, the radius is the height: r = y = f (x). figure 8.10 shows both bands-the  problem 
tells us which to use. the sum of band areas 2nr as is close to the area s of the curved 
surface. in the limit we integrate 2nr ds:

this answer must agree with the formula 2nr as (which it came from). the line from 
(0,o) to (l,2) has length as = fi.its midpoint is (t,1). around the x axis, the middle 
radius is r = 1 and the area is 2 n d .

watermelons and basketballs and light bulbs are in the exercises. rather than stretch-

the formula applies when there is a parameter  t. instead of  (x, f (x)) the points on 
the curve  are (x(t), y(t)). as  t  varies, we  move along the curve. the length  formula

8.4  id203 and calculus 

discrete id203 usually involves careful counting. not many samples are taken 
and  not  many  experiments  are  made.  there  is  a  list  of  possible  outcomes,  and  a 
known id203 for each outcome. but probabilities  go far beyond  red  cards and 
black  cards. the real questions are much more practical: 

1.  how often will too many passengers arrive for a flight? 
2.  how many random errors do you make on a quiz? 
3.  what is the chance of exactly  one winner  in a big lottery? 

those are important questions and we will  set up models to answer them. 

there is  another point.  discrete  models do not  involve  calculus. the number  of 
errors or bumped  passengers  or lottery winners  is  a  small whole  number.  calculus 
enters for  continuous id203.  instead  of  results  that  exactly  equal  1 or  2  or  3, 
calculus deals  with  results  that  fall in  a  range  of  numbers.  continuous id203 
comes up in at least  two  ways: 

(a)  an experiment is repeated  many times  and we  take averages. 
(b)  the outcome lies anywhere in an interval  of  numbers. 

in the continuous case, the id203  p,  of  hitting a particular value x = n becomes 
zero. instead we have a id203  density p(x)-which 
is a key idea. the chance that 
a  random x  falls  between a and  b  is found  by integrating  the density p(x): 

roughly  speaking,  p(x) d x  is  the  chance  of  falling between  x  and x + dx. certainly 
p(x) 2 0. if a and b are the extreme limits  - co and a,including all possible outcomes, 
the id203 is necessarily one: 

this  is  a  case  where  infinite  limits  of  integration  are  natural  and  unavoidable.  in 
studying id203 they  create no difficulty-areas  out to infinity are often easier. 

here are typical  questions involving  continuous id203 and calculus: 

4.  how conclusive  is a  53%-47%  poll  of  2500 voters? 
5.  are  16 random football players safe on an elevator with capacity 3600 pounds? 
6.  how long before  your car is in an accident? 

it is not so traditional for a calculus course to study these questions. they need extra 
thought,  beyond  computing  integrals  (so this  section  is  harder  than  average). but 
id203 is more important than some traditional topics, and also more interesting. 

8.4  plobabllhy and calculus 

drug  testing and  gene  identification and  market  research  are major  applications. 
comparing questions 1-3 with 4-6  brings out the relation of discrete to continuous-
the differences between them, and the parallels. 

it would be impossible to give here a full treatment of  id203 theory. i believe 
you will see the point (and the use of  calculus) from our examples. frank  morgan's 
lectures have been a valuable guide. 

discrete random variables 

a discrete random variable x has a list of possible values. for two dice the outcomes 
are x = 2,3, ...,12. for coin tosses (see below), the list is infinite: x = 1,2,3, ... . 

a continuous variable lies in an interval a <x d b. 

example 1  toss a fair coin until heads come up. the outcome x is the number of 
tosses. the value of  x is 1 or 2 or 3 or ...,and the id203 is i that x = 1 (heads 
on the first toss). the id203 of  tails then heads is p2 = a. the id203 that 
is the chance of  n - 1 tails followed by  heads.  the sum of all 

x = n is p,, = (&"-this 
probabilities  is necessarily 1: 

example 2  suppose a student (not you) makes an average of 2 unforced errors per 
hour exam. the number of  actual errors on the next exam is x = 0 or 1 or 2 or .. . . 
a  reasonable model  for  the  id203  of  n  errors-when 
they  are  random  and 
the poisson model (pronounced pwason): 
independent-is 

p,, =id203 of n errors = 7 e- '. 

2" 
n. 


the probabilities of  no errors, one error, and two errors are po, pl, and p,: 

the id203 of  more than two errors is 1 - .i35 - .27 - .27 = .325. 

this poisson model can be derived theoretically or tested experimentally. the total 

id203 is again 1, from the infinite series (section 6.6) for e2: 

example 3  suppose on  average  3 out  of  100 passengers  with  reservations don't 
show up  for a flight.  if  the plane holds  98 passengers,  what is the id203  that 
someone will be bumped! 
if  the passengers come independently to the airport, use  the poisson model with 2 
changed to 3. x is the number of  no-shows, and x = n happens with id203 pn : 

there are 98 seats and  100 reservations. someone is bumped if  x = 0 or x = 1: 

chance of  bumping = po + p1 = e - + 3e- x 4/20. 

we will soon define the average or expected value or mean of x-this  model has p = 3. 

8  applications of  the integral 

continuous random variables 

if  x is the lifetime of  a vcr, all numbers x 2 0 are possible. if  x is a score on the 
sat, then  200 <x < 800.  if  x  is  the fraction of  computer  owners in a poll  of  600 
people, x is between 0 and  1. you may object that the sat score is a whole number 
and  the fraction of  computer  owners must  be  0 or  11600 or 21600  or  . . . . but  it is 
completely impractical to work  with  601 discrete possibilities. instead we  take x to 
be a continuous random variable, falling anywhere in the range x 2 0 or [200,800]  or 
0 < x < 1. of  course the various values of  x are not equally probable. 

example 4  the average lifetime of a vcr is 4 years. a reasonable model for break- 
down time is an exponential random variable. its id203 density is 

for  0 <x < go. 
the id203 that the vcr  will eventually break is  1: 

p(x)= ae-"i4 

the id203 of  breakdown within  12 years (x from 0 to  12) is .95: 

an  exponential  distribution  has  p(x) = ae-"".  its  integral  from  0  to  x  is  f(x) = 
1 - e - a x   . figure 8.1 1 is the graph for a = 1. it shows the area up to x = 1. 
to repeat:  the id203  that a < x < b is the integral of p(x) from  a to b. 

fig. 8.11  probabilities add to c p,,  = 1.  continuous density integrates to  p(x) dx = 1. 

example 5  we  now  define  the  most  important  density  function.  suppose  the 
average sat score is 500, and the standard  deviation (defined below-it  measures the 
spread around the average) is  200. then the normal distribution of  grades has 

this is the normal (or gaussian) distribution with mean 500 and standard deviation 
200. the graph of  p(x) is the famous bell-shaped curve in figure 8.12. 

a new  objection is possible. the actual scores are between 200 and 800, while the 
density  p(x) extends all the  way  from  - a0 to  m. i  think  the  educational  testing 
service counts all scores over 800 as 800. the fraction of such scores is pretty small- 
in fact the normal distribution gives 

8.4  probabilily and calculus 

fig. 8.12  the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) and its cumulative density f(x). 

regrettably, e-"'  has no elementary antiderivative. we need numerical integration. 
but there is nothing the matter with that! the integral is called the "error function," 
and  special tables give its value to great accuracy. the integral of  e-x212 from  - co 
to co  is exactly f i .then division by f i keeps j p(x) dx = 1. 
notice that  the normal distribution involves two  parameters. they are the mean 
value (in this case p = 500) and the standard deviation (in this case a = 200). those 
numbers mu  and sigma are often given the "normalized"  values p = 0 and a = 1: 

p(x)  = - -(x -,421202  becomes  p(x) = -l e-"'i2.

a& 

the bell-shaped graph of  p is symmetric around the middle point x = p. the width 
of  the graph is governed by the second parameter a-which 
stretches the x axis and 
shrinks the y  axis (leaving total  area equal to  1). the axes are labeled to show the 
standard case p = 0, a = 1 and also the graph for any other p and a. 

we now give a name to the integral of  p(x). the limits will be  - co  and x, so the 

integral f(x) measures the id203  that a random sample is below x: 

prob {x< x] = r-"_,  p(x) dx = cumulative density function  f(x). 

(7) 
f(x) accumulates the  probabilities given by  p(x), so df/dx = p(x). the total  prob- 
ability is f(co) = 1. this integral from  - co  to.. co  covers all outcomes. 

figure 8.12b shows the integral of the bell-shaped normal distribution. the middle 
point x = p has f = ). by  symmetry there is a 50-50 chance of an outcome below the 
mean. the cumulative density f(x) is near  .l6 at p - a and  near  .84 at p + a. the 
chance of  falling in  between  is  .84 - .16 = .68. thus 68%  of  the outcomes are less 
than one deviation a away from the center p. 
moving  out  to  p - 20  and  p + 20,  95%  of  the  area  is  in  between.  with 95% 
confidence  x  is  less  than  two  deviations from  the  mean.  only  one  sample in  20  is 
further out (less than  one in 40 on each side). 

note that a = 200 is not the precise value for the sat! 

mean, variance, and standard deviation 

in example 1, x was the number of  coin tosses until the appearance of  heads. the 
probabilities were p1 =$,  p,  = a, p3 = q, . . . . what  is  the  average number  of  tosses? 
we now find the "mean"  p of any distribution p(x)-not  only the normal distribution, 
where symmetry guarantees that the built-in number p is the mean. 

to find  p, multiply outcomes by probabilities  and add: 

p = mean =  np,, = l(pl) + 2(p2)+ 3(p3)+ 

- - a .

8  applications of the integral 

the  average  number  of  tosses  is  l(f) + 2($) + 3(i)+ .-..this  series  adds  up  (in 
section 10.1) to p = 2.  please do the experiment  10 times.  i am almost certain  that 
the average will be near 2. 

when the average is a = 2 quiz errors or 3, = 3 no-shows, the poisson probabilities 

are pn = ane-vn! check that the formula p = x np,  does give 3, as the mean: 

for  continuous  id203,  the  sum  p = x np,  changes  to  p = j xp(x) dx.  we 
multiply outcome x by id203 p(x) and integrate. in the vcr model, integration 
by  parts gives a mean breakdown  time of  p = 4 years: 

together with the mean we  introduce the variance. it is always written 02, and in 
the normal distribution that measured the "width"  of the curve. when a2 was 2002, 
sat scores spread out pretty far. if the testing service changed to o2 = 12, the scores 
would be a disaster. 95% of  them would be within  + 2  of  the mean. when a teacher 
announces an average grade of  72, the variance should also be  announced-if 
it is 
big then those with 60 can relax. at  least they have company. 

8e  the mean  p is the expected value  of  x. the variance  02 is the expected 
value of (x - mean)2= (x - p ) ~ .  multiply outcome times id203 and add: 

a =c npn 
p =j"o,  xp(x) dx 

a2=c(n- p ) ~  
pn
o2=5" 

(x - ~ ) ~ p ( x )   (continuous) 

dx

(discrete) 

the standard deviation (written o) is the square root of  02. 

example 6  (yes-no poll, one person asked) the probabilities are p and  1 - p. 
a fraction p =f of  the population thinks yes, the remaining fraction  1 - p =3 thinks 
no. suppose we  only ask one person. if  x = 1 for yes and x = 0 for no, the expected 
value of  x is p = p = f. the variance is o2 = p(l - p) =6: 

a = o ( 3 ) + l ( f ) = '  

3 

and 

0 2 = ( o - f ~ ( ~ ) + ( 1 - f ) 2 ( f ) = $ .  

the standard  deviation is o = ,/2/9.  when  the fraction p is  near  one or near zero, 
the  spread  is  smaller-and 
one  person  is  more  likely  to  give  the  right  answer  for 
everybody. the maximum of  o2 = p(l - p) is at p = f ,  where o =4. 
the table shows p and o2 for important id203 distributions.

the  law of averages  and the  central  limit theorem 

we come to the center of  id203 theory (without intending to give proofs). the 
key  idea  is to repeat  an experiment many times-poll  many  voters, or toss many 
dice, or play considerable poker. each independent experiment produces an outcome 
x, and the average from n experiments is r. it is called "x  bar": 

8 =xi + x,  + ... + x ,  

n 


= average outcome. 

all  we  know  about  p(x) is  its  mean  p  and  variance a2. it  is  amazing how  much 
information that gives about the average 8: 

no matter what the probabilities for  x, the probabilities for  r move toward the normal 
bell-shaped curve. the standard deviation is close to a / f i   when  the experiment is 
repeated n times. in the law of  averages, "almost  sure"  means that the chance of 
r not approaching p is zero. it can happen, but it won't. 

remark 1  the boston globe doesn't understand the law of averages. i quote from 
september 1988: "what would happen if  a giant red sox slump arrived? what would 
happen if  the fabled law of  averages came into play, reversing all those can't  miss 
decisions during the winning streak?"  they think the law of averages evens every- 
thing up, favoring heads after a series of  tails. see problem 20. 

example 7  yes-no poll  of n  = 2500 voters. is  a 53%-47%  outcome conclusive? 
the fraction p of "yes"  voters in the whole population is not known. that is the reason 
for the poll. the deviation a = ,/=is also not known, but for one voter this is 

never more than * (when p = f). therefore a l p  for 2500 voters is no larger than 

+/,/%, 

which is  1%. 

the result of  the poll was r = 53%. with 95% confidence, this sample is  within 
two standard deviations (here 2%) of  its mean. therefore with  95% confidence, the 
unknown mean  p = p of the  whole population  is between 51% and  55%. this p~11 is 
conclusive. 

if  the true mean had been p = 50%, the poll would have had only a ,0013 chance 
of  reaching 53%. the error margin  on each side of  a poll is amazingly simple; it is 
always i/*. 

remark 2  the new  york  times has  better mathematicians than  the  globe. two 
days after bush defeated dukakis, their poll of  n = 11,645 voters was printed with 
the following explanation. "in  theory, in 19 cases out of 20 [there is 95%] the results 
should  differ  by  no  more  than  one  percentage  point  [there  is  1 / a ]  from  what 
would have been  obtained by  seeking out all voters in the united states." 

example 8  football players at caltech (if any) have average weight p = 210 pounds 
and standard deviation a = 30 pounds. are n = 16 players safe on an elevator with 
capacity 3600 pounds? 16 times 210 is 3360. 

8  applications of the integral 

the average weight 
is approximately a normal random variable with ji  = 210 and 
5 = 3 0 / p  = 3014.  there  is  only  a  2%  chance that  8 is  above  ji + 25 = 225  (see 
figure 8.12b-weights 
below  the  mean  are  no  problem  on  an  elevator). since  16 
times 225 is 3600, a statistician would have 98o/0  confidence that the elevator is safe. 
this is an example where 98% is not good enough-i  wouldn't  get on. 

example 9  (the famous  weldon  dice) weldon  threw  12 dice  26,306  times  and 
counted the 5's  and 6's.  they came up in 33.77% of the 315,672 separate rolls. thus 

= .3377 instead of  the expected fraction p = f- of  5's  and 6's.  were the dice fair? 

the  variance  in  each  roll  is  a2= p(1-  p) = 219.  the  standard  deviation  of  8 is 

6 = a j f i   = m/j315672  z -00084. for fair dice, there is a  95% chance that 8 

will differ from f- byless than 26. (for poisson probabilities that is false. here r is 
normal.) but .3377 differs from .3333 by more than 55. the chance of falling 5 standard 
deviations away from the mean is only about  1 in  10,000.t 

so the dice were unfair. the faces with  5 or 6 indentations were  lighter than  the 
others, and a little more likely to come up. modern dice are made to compensate for 
that, but weldon never tried again.

8  applications of the integral 

8.5  masses and moments 

this chapter  concludes  with  two  sections  related  to engineering  and physics.  each 
application  starts with  a  finite number  of  masses  or forces.  their  sum is  the  total 
mass or total force. then comes the "continuous  case,"  in which  the mass is spread 
out instead  of  lumped.  its distribution  is given  by  a  density function  p (greek rho), 
and the sum changes to an integral. 

the first  step (hardest step?) is  to get the physical quantities straight. the second 
step is to move from sums to integrals (discrete to continuous, lumped to distributed). 
by  now  we  hardly  stop to think  about it-although 
this  is  the key  idea  of  integral 
calculus. the third step is to evaluate the integrals. for that we can use substitution 
or integration by parts or tables or a computer. 

figure 8.13  shows  the  one-dimensional  case:  masses  along  the  x  axis.  the  total 
the mass or 

mass is the sum of  the masses. the new idea is that of  moments-when 
force is multiplied  by  a distance: 

moment of mass around the y  axis = mx = (mass) times (distance to axis). 

fig. 8.13  the center  of  mass is at 2 =(total moment)/(total mass) =average  distance. 

the figure  has masses  1, 3, 2. the total mass is 6. the "lever  arms"  or "moment 
arms"  are the distances x = 1, 3,7. the masses  have moments  1 and 9 and  14 (since 
mx  is  2  times 7). the total moment is  1 + 9 + 14 = 24. then  the  balance  point  is  at 
2 = m,/m  = 2416 = 4. 

the total mass is the sum of  the m's.  the total moment is the sum of  m,  times  x, 
(negative  on  the  other  side  of  x = 0). if  the  masses  are  children  on  a  seesaw,  the 
balance point is the center of  gravity  2-also 

called  the center of  mass: 

definition 

- 1m,u,  - total moment 
x=--
totalmass 

e m ,  

if  all  masses  are moved  to 2, the  total  moment  (6 times 4) is still  24.  the moment 
equals the mass  c m,  times 2. the masses act like a single mass at 2. 

also:  if  we  move the axis to 2, and leave  the  children  where they  are, the  seesaw 
balances.  the masses  on the left  of  2 = 4 will  offset  the mass  on the  right.  reason: 
the distances to the new axis are x,  - 2. the moments add to zero by equation (1): 

moment around new  axis = x m,(xn - 2)= 1m,xn -x m.2  = 0. 

turn  now  to  the  continuous  case,  when  mass  is  spread  out  along  the  line.  each 
piece  of  length  ax  has  an  average  density  p,  = (mass of  piece)/(length  of  piece) = 
amlax.  as  the  pieces get  shorter, this  approaches dmldx-the 
density  at the point. 
the limit of  (small mass)/(small length) is the density p(x). 

integrating that derivative p = dmldx, we  recover  the total mass: c p,ax  becomes 

(2) 
when the mass is spread evenly, p is constant. then m = pl = density times length. 

total mass  m = j p(x) dx. 

8.5  masses and moments 

the  moment  formula  is  similar.  for  each  piece,  the  moment  is  mass  p,ax 
multiplied by distance x-and  we  add. in the continuous limit, p(x) dx is multiplied 
by x and we  integrate: 

total moment around y axis = my= i xp(x) dx. 

(3) 
moment  is  mass  times  distance.  dividing  by  the  total  mass  m  gives  "average 
distance": 

center of mass 2 = -- --

moment - my- 5 xp(x) dx 
j p(x) dx  '

(4) 

remark 
if you studied section 8.4 on id203, you will notice how the formulas 
match  up.  the  mass i p(x) dx  is  like  the  total  id203  p(x) dx.  the  moment 
xp(x) dx is like the mean i xp(x) dx. the moment of  inertia  (x - ~ ) ~ p ( x )dx is the 
variance. mathematics keeps  hammering away  at the  same basic  ideas!  the  only 
difference is that the total id203 is always  1. the mean  really  corresponds to 
the center of mass 2, but in id203 we didn't notice the division by  p(x) dx = 1. 

example 1  with constant density p from 0 to l, the mass is m = pl. the moment 

the center of  mass is 2 = my/m= l/2. it is halfway along. 

example 2  with density e-"  the mass is  1, the moment is  1, and 2 is  1: 

i," e--" dx = [-e-"1,"  = 1 

and 

j,"  xe-"  dx = [-xe-"  - e-"1,"  = 1. 

masses and moments in two  dimensions 

instead of  placing masses along the x axis, suppose m,  is at the point (x,, y,) in the 
plane. similarly m,  is at (x,, y,).  now there are two moments to consider. around the 
y axis m,, = c mnxn and around the x axis m,  = c m,  yn. please notice that the x's go 
into the moment  my-because 
the x coordinate gives the distance from the y axis! 
around the x axis, the distance is y and the moment is  m,.  the center of mass is 

the point (2,j)at which everything balances: 

in  the  continuous case  these sums become  two-dimensional integrals. the total 
mass is jj p(x, y) dx dy, when  the  density is  p = mass per  unit  area. these "double 
integrals" are for the future (section 14.1). here we consider the most important case: 
p = constant.  think  of  a  thin  plate,  made  of  material  with  constant  density (say 
p = 1). to compute its mass and moments, the plate is cut into strips (figure 8.14): 

mass  m = area of  plate 

moment  my= j (distance x) (length of  vertical strip) dx 
moment m,  = 5  (height y) (length of  horizontal strip) dy.

applications of the integral 

fig. 8.14  plates cut into strips to compute masses and moments and centroids. 

the mass equals the area because p = 1. for moments, all points in a vertical strip 
are the same distance from the y axis. that distance is x. the moment is x times area, 
or x times length times dx-and 

the integral accounts for all strips. 

similarly the x-moment of  a horizontal strip is y times strip length times dy. 

example 3  a plate has sides x = 0 and y = 0 and y = 4 - 2x. find m, my, m,. 

mass  m = area = 1;  y dx = 5;  (4 - 2x) dx = [4x  - x2];  = 4. 

the vertical strips go up to y = 4 - 2x, and the horizontal strips go out to x = f (4 - y):

the "center  of  mass"  has 2 = m,/m  = 213 and j = m,/m  = 413. this is the centroid 
of  the triangle (and also the "center  of  gravity").  with p = 1 these terms all refer to 
the same balance point (2,j). the plate will not tip over, if  it rests on that point. 
example 4  find my and  m,  for the half-circle below x2 + y2 = r2. 
my= 0 because the region is symmetric-figure  8.14 balances on the y axis. in the 
x-moment we  integrate y times the length of  a horizontal strip (notice the factor 2): 

divide by  the mass (the area :nr2)  to find the height  of  the centroid: j = m,/m  = 
4r/3n. this is less than f r  because the bottom of the semicircle is wider than the top. 

moment of  inertia 

the  moment  of  inertia  comes from  multiplying  each  mass  by  the  square  of  its 

distance from the axis. around the y axis, the distance is x. around the origin, it is r: 

i y = e x i m n   and 

i,=eyim,,  and 

io=er;mn. 

notice that i, + i,  = i,  because xi + yi = r:. 

in the continuous case we  integrate. 

the moment of inertia around the y axis is i, = jjx2 p(x, y) dx dy. with a constant 
density p = 1, we  again keep together the points on a strip. on a vertical strip they 
share the same x. on a horizontal strip they share y: 
i,  = 1(x2) (vertical strip length) dx  and  i,  = j (y2) (horizontal strip length) dy. 

8.5  masses and moments 

in engineering  and physics, it is rotation that leads to the moment  of  inertia. look 
at the energy  of  a mass m going around a circle of  radius r.  it has i,  = mr2. 

kinetic energy = fmv2 = + m ( r ~ ) ~= fi, w2. 

(9) 

the angular velocity is w (radians per second). the speed is v  = rw (meters per second). 
an  ice skater reduces i,  by putting her arms up instead of out. she stays close to 
the axis of  rotation (r is small). since her  rotational energy i i o w 2  does not change, 
w increases as i,  decreases. then she spins faster. 

another example:  it takes force to turn a revolving door. more correctly, it takes 
torque. the force is multiplied by  distance from the turning axis:  t = fx, so a push 
further out is more effective. 

to see the physics, replace newton's  law f = ma = m dv/dt by its rotational form: 
t = i dwldt. where  f makes the mass move, the torque  t makes it turn.  where m 
measures unwillingness to change speed, i measures unwillingness to change rotation. 

example 5  find the moment of  inertia of a rod about (a) its end and (b) its center. 

the distance x from the end of the rod goes from 0 to l. the distance from the center 
goes from  -l/2 to l/2. around the center, turning is easier because i is smaller: 

i,,,  = 1;  x2 dx = i~~  i,,,,,,  = f!'i_'ti2x2 dx = & l ~ .

moment of  inertia experiment 

experiment:  roll a solid cylinder (a coin), a hollow cylinder (a ring), a solid ball (a 
marble), and a hollow ball (not a pingpong ball) down a slope. galileo dropped things 
from the leaning tower-this  experiment requires a leaning table. objects that fall 
together  from the tower don't  roll together  down the table.

question 2  does  size make a difference if  shape and density are the same? 
question 3  does density make a difference if  size and shape are the same? 
question 4  find formulas for the velocity v  and the finish time  t. 

to  compute  v,  the  key  is  that  potential  energy  plus  kinetic  energy  is  practically 
constant.  energy  loss  from  rolling  friction  is  very  small.  if  the  mass  is  m and  the 
vertical drop is h, the energy at the top (all potential) is mgh. the energy at the bottom 
(all  kinetic) has  two  parts:  $mv2 from  movement  along  the  plane  plus  +la2from 
turning.  important fact:  v = wr for a rolling  cylinder  or ball of  radius r. 

8  applications of the integral

the ratio i/mr2 is critical. call  it  j and  solve (11 )  for  v2: 

v2 = -(smaller j means  larger  velocity).

the order of  j's,  for  different shapes and sizes, should decide the  race.  apparently 
the density  doesn't  matter,  because  it  is a factor  in  both  i  and m-so 
it  cancels in 
j = i/mr2. a  hollow cylinder has j = 1, which is the largest  possible-all 
its mass is 
at the full distance r from the axis. so the hollow cylinder should theoretically  come 
in last. this experiment  was developed  by  daniel drucker. 

problems 35-37  find the other three j's. problem 40 finds the time t by integration. 

your experiment will  show how close this comes to the measured time.

8  applications of the integral 

8.6  force, work, and energy 

chapter 1 introduced derivatives df /dt and df /dx. the independent variable could be 
t  or x.  for  velocity  it  was  natural  to  use  the  letter  t .  this  section is  about  two 
important physical quantities-force 

and work-for  which x  is the right choice. 

the basic formula is  w = fx. work equals force  times distance moved (distance in 
the direction of  f ). with a force of  100 pounds on a car that moves 20 feet, the work 
is 2000 foot-pounds. if the car is rolling forward and you are pushing backward, the 
work  is  -2000  foot-pounds.  if  your  force is  only  80 pounds  and  the  car  doesn't 
move, the work is zero. in these examples the force is constant. 

w = fx is completely parallel to f  = vt. when  v  is constant, we  only need  multi- 
plication.  it is a changing  velocity that  requires calculus. the integral f v(t) dt adds 
up  small multiplications  over short times. for  a  changing force, we  add  up  small 
pieces of  work f dx over short distances: 

w = fx 

(constant force) 

w = j  f(x) dx 

(changing force). 

in the first case we  lift a suitcase weighing f = 30 pounds up x  = 20 feet of  stairs. 

the work is  w = 600 foot-pounds. the suitcase doesn't  get heavier as we  go up-it 
only seems that way. actually it gets lighter (we study gravity below). 

in  the  second case  we  stretch  a  spring,  which  needs  more  force as x  increases. 
hooke's  law says that f(x) = kx. the force is proportional to the stretching distance x .  
starting from x  = 0, the work increases with the square  of  x :  
w = j ; k x d x = : k x 2 .  

f = k x  

and 

(1) 

in metric units the force is measured in newtons and the distance in meters. the unit 
of  work is a newton-meter (a joule).  the 600 foot-pounds for an american suitcase 
would have been about 800 joules in france. 

example 1  suppose a force of  f = 20 pounds  stretches a spring  1 foot. 

(a) find  k.  the elastic constant is  k = flx = 20 pounds per foot. 
(b) find  w.  the work is i k x 2  = i  20  1'  = 10 foot-pounds. 
(c) find x when f  = - 10 pounds.  this is compression not stretching: x  = -  foot. 
compressing the same spring through the same distance requires  the same work. for 
compression x  and  f  are  negative. but  the  work  w = f kx2 is  still positive.  please 
note  that  w  does  not  equal  kx  times  x! that  is  the  whole  point  of  variable force 
(change fx to 5 f(x) dx). 

may i add another important quantity from physics? it comes from looking at the 
situation from  the  viewpoint  of  the  spring. in its natural  position,  the  spring rests 
comfortably.  it  feels  no  strain  and  has  no  energy.  tension  or  compression gives  it 
potential  energy.  more  stretching  or  more  compression  means  more  energy.  the 
change in energy equals the  work. the potential  energy of  the  suitcase increases by 
600 foot-pounds, when it is lifted  20 feet. 

write  v ( x )  for  the  potential  energy. here  x  is  the  height  of  the  suitcase or  the 
extension of  the spring. in moving from x  = a to x  = b,  work = increase in potential: 

this is absolutely beautiful. the work  w  is the definite integral. the potential  v is 
the indefinite  integral. if  we  carry the suitcase up the stairs and back down, our total 

8.6  force, heork, and energy 

work is zero. we may feel tired, but the trip down should have given back our energy. 
(it was in the suitcase.) starting with a spring that is compressed one foot, and ending 
with the spring extended one foot, again we have done no work.  v =fkx2 is the same 
for x = - 1 and x = 1. but an extension from x = 1 to x = 3 requires work: 

w = change in  v = 3k(3)2-3k(1)2. 

indefinite integrals like  v come with  a property  that we  know well.  they include 
an arbitrary constant  c. the correct potential  is not simply $kx2, it is ikx2 + c. to 
compute a change in potential,  we  don't  need  c. the constant cancels. but to deter- 
mine  v itself,  we  have  to  choose  c.  by  fixing  v =  0  at  one  point,  the  potential 
is  determined  at  all  other  points.  a common  choice  is  v= 0  at  x = 0.  sometimes 
v= 0 at x = oo (for gravity). electric fields can be "grounded"  at any point. 

there is another  connection between  the potential  v and the force f. according 
to (2), v is the indefinite integral of  f. therefore  f(x) is the derivative  of  v(x). the 
fundamental theorem  of  calculus is also fundamental to physics: 

force exerted  on spring: f =  dv/dx 
force exerted  by  spring: f = - dv/dx 

(3b) 
those lines say the same thing. one is our force pulling  on the spring, the other is 
the  "restoring  force"  pulling  back.  (3a) and  (3b) are  a  warning  that  the  sign  of  f 
depends on the point of view. electrical engineers and physicists use the minus sign. 
in  mechanics  the  plus  sign  is  more  common.  it  is  one  of  the  ironies  of  fate  that 
f = v',  while distance and velocity have those letters reversed: v =f '. note the change 
to capital letters and the change to x.

force to overcome gravity = gmm/x2 

force exerted  by  gravity = - gmm/x2 

an engine pushes a rocket forward. gravity pulls it back. the gravitational constant 
is g and the earth's  mass is  m. the mass of  the rocket or satellite  or suitcase is m, 
and the potential is the indefinite integral: 

usually  c = 0, which makes the potential zero at x = co. 

remark  when carrying the suitcase upstairs, x changed by 20 feet.  the weight was 
regarded  as constant-which 
it nearly is. but an exact calculation of  work  uses the 
integral of  f(x), not just  the multiplication 30 times 20. the serious difference comes 
when the suitcase is carried to x = co.with constant force that requires infinite work. 
with the correct (decreasing) force, the work equals v at infinity (which is zero) minus 
v at the pickup point  x,  . the change in  v is  w = gmmlx, . 

8  applications of the integral 

kinetic energy 

this optional paragraph carries the physics one step further. suppose you release the 
spring or drop the  suitcase. the external  force  changes  to  f = 0.  but  the  internal 
force  still acts on the  spring,  and gravity  still acts on the  suitcase. they  both  start 
moving.  the potential energy of  the suitcase is  converted  to kinetic energy, until  it 
hits the bottom of  the stairs. 

time enters the problem, either through newton's  law or einstein's: 

(newton) f  = ma = m - (einstein) f  = -(mu). 

(5)

here  we  stay with  newton,  and  pretend  the mass  is  constant.  exercise 21 follows 
einstein; the mass increases with velocity. there m = m,/ 
goes to infinity 
as  v  approaches  c,  the  speed  of  light.  that  correction  comes  from  the  theory  of 
relativity, and is not needed  for suitcases. 

what happens as the suitcase falls? from x = a at the top of the stairs to x = b at 
the bottom, potential energy is lost. but kinetic energy imv2 is gained, as we see from 
integrating newton's  law:

this same force f is given by  - dv/dx. so the work  is also the change in  v: 

since (6) = (7), the total energy +mu2 + v (kinetic plus potential) is constant: 

this is the law of  conservation of energy. the total energy is conserved. 

example 3  attach a mass m to the end of a stretched spring and let go. the spring's 
energy  v = ikx2 is  gradually converted  to kinetic energy  of  the mass.  at  x = 0 the 
change  to  kinetic  energy  is  complete:  the  original  ikx2 has  become  ;mu2.  beyond 
x = 0 the potential energy increases, the force reverses sign and pulls back, and kinetic 
energy is lost. eventually  all energy is  potential-when 
the mass  reaches  the other 
extreme.  it is  simple harmonic motion, exactly  as in  chapter 1 (where the mass  was 
the shadow of  a circling ball). the equation of  motion is the statement that the rate 
of change  of energy is zero (and we  cancel  v = dxldt): 

that is  f = ma  in  disguise.  for a spring,  the solution x = cos f i
  will  be found 
in  this  book.  for more  complicated  structures, engineers  spend  a  billion  dollars a 
year  computing the solution.

pressure  and  hydrostatic  force

345

our forces have been  concentrated  at a single points.  that is not the case for pressure.
a  fluid  exerts  a force  all  over  the  base  and  sides  of its  container.  suppose  a  water
tank or swimming  pool has constant depth h (in meters or feet). the water has weight-
density  w % 9800 n/m3  - 62 lb/ft3 . on  the base,  the pressure  is  w times  h.  the force
is  wh  times  the base  area  a:

f = wha  (pounds  or newtons) 

p = f/a = wh  (lb/ft2  or n/m 2 ). 

(10)

thus  pressure is force per unit area. here  p  and  f  are  computed  by  multiplication,
because  the depth  h is  constant.  pressure  is  proportional  to depth (as  divers  know).
down  the side  wall,  h varies  and  we  need  calculus.

the  pressure  on  the side  is  still wh-the same in all directions. we divide  the  side
into  horizontal  strips  of  thickness  ah.  geometry  gives  the  length  1(h)  at  depth  h
(figure 8.17).  the area  of a strip is  1(h) ah.  the pressure  wh is nearly  constant on the
strip-the  depth  only  changes  by  ah.  the force on  the strip  is  af = whlah.  adding
those  forces,  and narrowing the  strips  so  that ah -+ 0,  the total  force  approaches  an
integral:

the  side  length  is  1= 60  when  h = 0.  the  depth  h  increases  from  0 to  20.  the  main
problem  is  to  find  i at  an  in-between  depth  h.  with  straight  sides  the  relation  is
linear:  1= 60 + ch.  we  choose  c  to  give  1= 50  when  h =  20.  then  50 = 60 +  c(20)
yields  c= - 1.

-h)  dh =  [30wh2 - -wh3]  o =  12000w - t(8000w).

with  distance  in feet  and  w =  62  lb/ft3 , f is  in pounds.  with distance  in  meters  and
w =  9800 n/m3, the force  is  in newtons.

note  that  (weight-density  w) = (mass-density  p) times  (g) =  (1000)(9.8).  these  si

imagine  lifting  out  one  layer of water at a  time.  the  layer  weighs  wa(h) ah.  the
work  to  lift  it  to  the  top  is its  weight  times  the  distance  h,  or  wha(h) ah.  the  work
to  empty  the  whole  tank  is  the integral:

w = f  wha(h)  dh.

8  applications of the integral 

suppose the tank is the bottom half of  a sphere of  radius r. the cross-sectional area 
at depth h is a = n(r2 - h2). then the work is the integral (12) from 0 to r. it equals 
w = nwr4/4. 

units: w = for~e/(distance)~ 

times r~ = (distan~e)~ gives work  w = (force)(distance).

polar coordinates and complex 


numbers 


up to now, points have been located by  their x and y  coordinates. but if  you were 
a  flight  controller,  and  a  plane  appeared  on  the  screen,  you  would  not  give  its 
position that way. instead of  x and y, you would read off the direction of  the plane 
and  its distance. the direction is  given  by  an angle  6.  the distance is  given  by  a 
positive number r.  those are the polar  coordinates of  the point,  where x and y are 
the rectangular coordinates. 

the angle 6 is  measured from  the horizontal.  suppose the distance is  2 and  the 
direction is 30"or 4 6  (degrees preferred by flight controllers, radians by  mathemati- 
cians).  a  pilot  looking  along  the  x  axis  would  give  the  plane's  direction  as  "11 
o'clock."  this totally destroys our system of  units, by measuring direction in hours. 
but the angle and the distance locate the plane. 

how far to a landing strip at r = 1 and 8 = - n/2? for that question polar coordi- 
nates are not good. they are perfect  for distance from  the  origin (which equals r), 
but  for  most  other distances i  would  switch to x and  y.  it is extremely simple to 
determine x and y from r and 8, and we will do it constantly. the most used formulas 
in  this  chapter  come  from  figure 9.1-where 
the  right  triangle  has  angle  6  and 
hypotenuse r.  the sides of  that triangle are x and y: 

and 

x = r cos 8 

(1) 
the  point  at  r = 2,  8 = 4 6  has  x = 2 cos(n/6)  and  y = 2 sin(n/6).  the  cosine  of 
n/6  is  j 5 / 2   and  the  sine  is  f. so  x = $ and  y = 1.  polar  coordinates  convert 
easily to xy coordinates-now  we  go the other way. 
always  x2 + y2 = r2. in  this  example  (&)2  +  = (2)2. pythagoras  produces 
r from x and y. the direction 8 is also available, but the formula is not so beautiful: 

y = r sin 8. 

r = j w   and 

t a n g =  -
x 

y  and(a1most)  ~ = t a n - ' y .  

x 

(2)

our point has y/x = i/&.  one angle with this tangent is 8 = tan-'  ( 1 1 8 )  = n/6. 

9.1  polar coordinates 

fig. 9.1  polar coordinates r, 8 and rectangular coordinates x =r cos 9, y =r sin 8. 

example 1  point b in figure 9.lc is at a negative angle 8 = -4 4 .  the x coordinate 
r cos(-n/4) is  the  same  as  r cos 4 4  (the  cosine  is  even).  but  the  y  coordinate 
r sin(-n/4)  is  negative.  computing  r  and  8 from  x = 1 and  y = 1, the  distance  is 
r = ,/mand tan 8 is  -111. 
warning  to any angle 8 we  can add or subtract 2n-which 
goes a full 360" circle 
and keeps the same direction. thus  -n/4 or  -45" is the same angle as 7n/4 or 3 15". 
so is  15n/4 or 675". 
if  we  add or subtract 1 80  , the tangent doesn't change. the point (1,  -1) is on the 
-45"  line at r = fi.the point  (- 1, 1) is on the  135" line also with  r = fi.both 
have tan 8 = - 1. we had to write "almost"  in equation (2),because a point has many 
8's and two points have the same r and tan 8. 
even  worse,  we  could  say that  b = (1, -1)  is on  the  135" line but  at a  negative 
distance r = -&.a negative r carries the point backward along the 135" line, which 
is forward to b. in giving the position of b, i would always keep r > 0. but in drawing 
the graph of a polar equation, r < 0 is allowed. we move now to those graphs. 

the  circle  r=  cos 8 

the basis for chapters 1-8  was y =f(x). the key  to this chapter is r = f(8). that is 
a relation between the polar  coordinates, and the points  satisfying an equation like 
r = cos 8 produce a polar graph. 
it  is  not  obvious  why  r = cos 8  gives  a  circle.  the  equations  r = cos 28  and 
r = cos28 and r = 1 + cos 8 produce entirely different graphs-not 
circles. the direct 
approach is to take 8 = 0  , 30  , 60  , . . . and go out the distance r = cos 8 on each ray. 
the points are marked in figure 9.2a, and connected into a curve. it seems to be a 
circle of  radius i, with  its center  at  the  point  (i,0).  we  have  to  be  able  to  show 
mathematically that r = cos 8 represents a shifted circle. 

one point  must  be  mentioned.  the angles from  0 to n give  the  whole circle. the 
number r = cos 8 becomes negative after 7~12, and we  go backwards along each ray. 

fig. 9.2  the circle r = cos 9 and the switch to x and y. the circle r = sin 8. 

9  polar coordinates and complex numbers 

at  8 = .n (to the  left  of  the origin) the cosine is  -1. going  backwards  brings us to 
the same point  as 8 = 0 and r = + 1-which 

completes the circle. 

when 8 continues from 7c  to 2.n we go around again. the polar equation gives the 
circle twice. (or more times, when 8 continues past 2.n.) if you don't  like negative r's 
and multiple circles, restrict 8 to the range from  -7112  to 7~12. we  still have to see 
why  the graph of  r = cos 8 is a circle. 
method 1  multiply by r and convert to rectangular coordinates x and y: 

r = cos 8  *  r2 = r cos 8  *  x2 + y2 = x. 

(3) 
this is a circle because of x2 + y2. from rewriting as (x - f)2 + y2 = (f)2 we recognize 
its center and radius. center at x = 4 and y = 0; radius f .  done. 
method 2  write x and y separately as functions of  8. then 8 is a "parameter": 

and 

x = r cos 8 = cos28 

y = r sin 8 = sin 8 cos 8. 

(4) 
these are not polar equations but parametric equations. the parameter 0 is the angle, 
curve would be the same. chapter 12 studies parametric 
but it could be the time-the 
equations in detail-here  we  stay with the circle. 
to find the circle, square x and y and add. this produces x2 + y2 = x in problem 26. 
but here we do something new: start with the circle andfind equation (4).in case you 
don't  reach chapter 12, the idea is  this. add  the vectors oc to the center and  c p  
out the radius: 

the point p  in  figure 9.2  has (x, y) = oc + c p  = (f,0) + (f  cos t, f  sin t). 

the  parameter  t  is  the  angle  at  the  center  of  the  circle.  the  equations  are 
x = f + f cos t  and y =  sin t. a trigonometric person  sees a  double angle and  sets 
t = 28. the result is equation (4) for the circle: 

x = f + f  cos 28 = cos28 

(5) 
this step rediscovers a basic theorem of  geometry: the angle t at the center is twice 
the angle 0 at the circumference.  end of  quick introduction to parameters. 

y = f  sin 28 = sin 8 cos 8. 

and 

a second circle is r = sin 0, drawn in figure 9.2~. a third circle is r = cos 8 + sin 8, 
not drawn. problem 27 asks you to find its xy equation and its radius. all calculations 
go back to x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8-the  basic facts of  polar coordinates! the last 
exercise shows a parametric equation with beautiful graphs, because it may be pos- 
sible to draw them now. then the next  section concentrates on r = f(8)-and  goes 
far beyond circles.

the most important equation in polar coordinates, by far, is r = 1. the angle 8 does 
not even appear. the equation looks too easy, but that is the point! the graph is a 
circle around the origin (the unit circle). compare with the line x = 1. more important, 
compare the simplicity of  r = 1with the complexity of y  =  j-'. 
circles are so 
common in applications that they created the need for polar coordinates. 

9  polar coordinates and complex numbers 

this section studies polar curves r = f(8). the cardioid is a sentimental favorite- 
maybe parabolas  are more practical. the cardioid is r = 1+ cos 8, the parabola is 
r = 1/(1+ cos 8).  section 12.2 adds  cycloids and  astroids.  a  graphics package can 
draw them and so can we.

do in drawing graphs, the one-directional ray changes to a full line. important: the 
circles are perpendicular to the rays. we have "orthogonal coordinates"-more 
inter-
esting than the x - y  grid of  perpendicular lines. in principle x could be mixed with 
8 (non-orthogonal), but in practice that never happens. 
other curves are attractive in polar  coordinates-we 

look first  at five examples. 

sometimes we  switch back  to x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8, to recognize the graph. 

example  1  the graph of  r = l/cos 8 is the straight line x = 1 (because r cos 8 = 1). 

example 2  the graph of  r = cos 28 is the four-petalflower  in figure 9.3. 
the points at 8 = 30" and  -30" and 150" and  -150" are marked on the flower. they 
all  have  r = cos 28 = 9. there  are  three  important  symmetries-across 
the  x  axis, 
across the y  axis, and through the origin. this four-petal curve has them all. so does 
the vertical flower r = sin 28-but 

surprisingly, the tests it passes are different. 

(across the x axis: y  to  -y)  there are two ways to cross. first,  change 8 to  -8. 
the equation r = cos 28 stays the same. second, change 8 to n - 8 and also r to  -r. 
the equation r = sin 28 stays the same. both flowers have x axis symmetry. 

(across the y axis: x to  -x)  there are two ways to cross. first, change 8 to n - 8. 
the equation  r = cos 28 stays the same. second, change 8 to  -8 and r to  -r. now 
r = sin 28 stays the same (the sine is odd). both curves have y  axis symmetry. 
(through the  origin)  now  we  change r  to  -r or  8 to 8 + n. the flower equations 
pass  the  second  test  only:  cos 2(8 + n )  = cos 28  and  sin 2(8 + n)= sin 28.  every 
equation r2 = f(8) passes the first test, since (- r)2= r2. 

the  circle r = cos 8 has  x  axis  symmetry,  but  not  y  or  r.  the  spiral r = 8'  has 

y axis symmetry, because  -r = (- q3 is the same equation. 
question  what happens if  you change r to  -r  and also change 8 to 8 + n? 
answer  nothing-because 

(r, 8) and (- r, 8 + n) are always the same point. 

fig. 9.3  the four-petal flower r =cos 28 and the spiral r = 8 (r > 0 in red). 

9.2  polar equations and graphs 

example 3  the graph of  r = 8 is a spiral of  archimedes-or  maybe two spirals. 
the  spiral  adds  new  points  as  8  increases  past  271.  our  other  examples  are 
= 271 gives the same point as 8 = 0. a periodic curve repeats itself. the 
"periodic"--8 
spiral moves out by  271  each time it comes around. if  we  allow negative  angles and 
negative r = 8, a second spiral appears. 
example 4  the graph of  r = 1 + cos 8 is a cardioid. it is drawn in figure 9 . 4 ~ .  
the cardioid  has no simple xy  equation.  still the  curve is very  attractive. it  has a 
cusp at the origin and it is heart-shaped (hence its name). to draw it, plot r = 1 + cos 8 
at 30" intervals and connect the points. for this curve r is never negative, since cos 8 
never goes below  -1. 

it  is  a  curious  fact  that  the  electrical  vector  in  your  heart  almost  traces  out  a 
cardioid. see section 11.1 about electrocardiograms. if it is a perfect cardioid you are 
in a little trouble.

inner loop 

fig. 9.4  lima~onsr = 1 + b cos 0, including  a cardioid and mars seen from  earth. 
example 5  the graph of  r = 1 + b cos 8 is a limagon (a cardioid  when  b = 1). 
limaqon (soft c) is a french word for snail-not 
so well known as escargot but just 
as inedible.  (i am  only  referring  to  the  shell. excusez-moi!) figure 9.4  shows  how  a 
dimple appears as b increases. then an inner loop appears beyond  b = 1 (the cardioid 
at b = 1 is giving birth  to a loop). for large b the curve looks more like two circles. 
the  limiting  case is  a  double  circle, when  the  inner  loop is  the  same  as the  outer 
loop. remember  that  r = cos 8 goes around the circle twice. 
we  could  magnify  the  limaqon  by  a  factor  c,  changing  to r = c(l + b cos 8). we 
could rotate  180" to r = 1 - b cos 8. but the real interest is whether these figures arise 
in applications, and donald  saari showed me a nice example. 

mars seen from  earth  the earth goes around the sun and so does mars. roughly 
speaking mars is  14 times as far  out, and completes  its orbit in two  earth years. 

we take the orbits as circles: r = 2 for earth and r = 3 for mars. those equations 
tell where but not when. with time as a parameter, the coordinates of  earth and mars 
are given at every instant t: 

x, = 2 cos 2nt, ye = 2 sin 271t 

and 

x,  = 3 cos nt, y,  = 3 sin nt. 

9  polar coordinates and complex numbers 

at  t = 1 year, the earth completes a circle (angle = 2n) and mars is halfway. 
now the key  step. subtract to find the position of  mars relative to earth: 

xm-,=3cosnt-2cos2nt 

and 

~ ~ - ~ = 3 s i n n t - 2 s i n 2 ~ t .  

replacing cos 2nt by  2 cos2nt - 1 and sin 2nt by  2 sin nt cos nt, this is 

x,  -,= (3 - 4 cos nt)cos nt + 2 

and 

ym-,= (3 - 4 cos nt)sin nt. 

seen  from  the  earth,  mars  does  a  loop  in  the  sky! there  are  two  t's  for  which 
3 - 4 cos at = 0 (or cos nt = 3). at both times, mars is two units from earth (x,-,  = 
2 and ym-, = 0). when we move the origin to that point, the 2 is subtracted away- 
the m -e coordinates become x = r cos nt and y = r sin nt with r = 3 - 4 cos nt. that 
is a limacon with a loop, like figure 9.4d. 
note added in proof 
i didn't  realize that a 3-to-2 ratio is also responsible for heating 
up two spots on opposite sides of  mercury. from the newspaper of  june  13, 1990: 

"astronomers  today  reported  the  first  observations  showing that  mercury 
has two extremely hot spots. that is because mercury, the planet closest to the 
sun, turns on its axis once every 59.6 days, which is a day on mercury. it goes 
around the sun every 88 days, a mercurian year. with this 3-to-2 ratio between 
spin  and  revolution,  the  sun  appears  to stop  in  the  sky  and  move  backward, 
describing a loop over each of the hot spots." 

conic sections  in polar  coordinates 

the exercises include other polar curves, like lemniscates and 200-petal flowers. but 
get  serious. the most  important  curves are the ellipse and parabola  and hyperbola. 
in section 3.5 their equations involved 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2. with one focus at the origin, 
their polar equations are even better. 

9a  the graph of  r = a/(1+  e cos 0) is a conic section with  "eccentricity" e: 

example 6  (e = 1) the  graph  of  r = 1/(1+ cos 8) is  a  parabola.  this equation  is 
r + r cos 8 = 1 or r = 1 - x. squaring both sides gives x2 + y2 = 1 - 2x + x2. cancel- 
ing x2 leaves y2 = 1 - 2x, the parabola in figure 9.5b. 

the amplifying factor a blows up all curves, with no change in shape. 

(e = 2) the same steps lead from r(1 + 2 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 - 2x. squar- 
example 7 
ing  gives  x2 + y2 = 1 - 4x + 4x2 and  the  x2 terms  do not  cancel. instead  we  have 
y2 - 3x2= 1 - 4x. this is the hyperbola in figure 9sc, with a focus at (0,o). 

the hyperbola y2 - 3x2 = 1 (without the  -4x) has its center at (0,o). 

(e = 4) the same steps lead from r(1 + 4 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 - 4x. squar- 
example 8 
ing gives  the ellipse x2 + y2 = 1 - x + ax2. polar equations look at conics in  a new 
way, which  happens  to match  the sun and planets perfectly.  the sun at (0,o) is  not 
the center of  the system, but  a focus. 

finally e = 0 gives the circle r = 1. center of  circle = both foci = (0,o). 

9.2  polar equations and graphs 

fig. 9.5  r = 1/(1+ e cos 8) is an ellipse for e = 3, a parabola for e = 1, a hyperbola for e = 2. 

the divectrix  the figure shows the line d (the "directrix")  for each curve. all points 
p on the curve satisfy r = jpfi= ejpdl.the distance to the focus is e times the distance 
to the directrix. (eis still the eccentricity, nothing to do with exponentials.) a geometer 
would  start  from  this  property  r = elpdl  and  construct  the  curve.  we  derive  the 
property from the equation: 

the directrix is the line at x  = ale. that last equation is exactly lpfl  = elpdl. 

notice how two numbers determine these curves. here the numbers are a  and e. 
in section 3.5  they were a and b. (the ellipse was x2/a2+ y2/b2= 1.) using a  and e 
we  go  smoothly from ellipses through  parabolas  (at e = 1) and  on to  hyperbolas. 
with three more numbers we  can move the focus to any point  and rotate the curve 
through any angle. conics are determined by five  numbers.

9.3  slope, length, and area for  polar curves 

the previous sections introduced  polar  coordinates  and polar  equations and  polar 
graphs. there was no calculus! we now tackle the problems of area (integral calculus) 
and slope (id128), when the equation is r  = f(8). the use of  f instead 
off  is a reminder that the slope is not dfld8 and the area is not  f(8)db. 
start  with  area.  the  region  is  always divided  into  small  pieces-what 
is  their 
shape? look  between the  angles 8 and  8 + a8  in  figure 9.6a. inside the curve is  a 
a triangle, with a8 as its small angle. if  the radius is constant

the  wedge  is a  sector of a  circle.  it is a  piece  of pie  cut  at the  extremely  narrow  angle
ao.  the  area  of that piece  is a  fraction  (the angle  ao  divided  by  the  whole  angle  27r)
of the whole  area  7rr 2 of the circle:

we  admit  that  the  exact  shape  is  not  circular.  the  true  radius  f(o) varies  with  0-
but  in a  narrow  angle  that  variation  is  small.  when  we  add  up  the  wedges  and let
ao  approach  zero,  the area  becomes  an  integral.

that is  wrong! the  correct  area  of a  circle  of radius  - is  7/4.  the  mistake  is  that we
went  twice  around  the  circle  as  0  increased  to  27n.  integrating  from  0 to  nr  gives  7x/4.

example  2  find  the  area  between  the  circles  r = cos  0  and  r =   .
the  circles  cross  at the  points where  r =  cos 0 agrees with  r =  -. figure 9.6 shows these
points  at  + 60',  or 0 =  + 7r/3.  those  are  the limits  of integration,  where cos 0 =   . the

slope  of a polar  curve 

where is the highest point  on the cardioid r = 1 + cos 8?  what  is the slope at 8 = 
4 4 ?  those are not  the  most  important  questions in  calculus, but  still  we  should 
know  how  to  answer  them.  i  will  describe  the  method  quickly,  by  switching to 
rectangular coordinates: 

x = r cos 9 = (1 + cos 9)cos 8 

and 

y = r sin 9 = (1 + cos @sin 8. 

for the highest point, maximize y by setting its derivative to zero: 
dyld8 = (1+ cos o)(cos 8) + (- sin @(sin 8) = 0. 

thus cos 8 + cos 29 = 0, which happens at 60". the height is y = (1 + *)(,/5/2). 
for the slope, use the chain rule dyld0 = (dy/dx)(dx/do): 

dy - dy/d8 - (1 + cos 8)(cos 8) + (-sin  8)(sin 8) 
---- 
(1 + cos 8)(-  sin 8) + (- sin 8) cos 8' 
dx

(4) 

equations (3) and (4) avoid the awkward (or impossible) step of eliminating 8. instead 
of  trying to find y as a function  of  x,  we keep x and y as functions of  8. at  8 = n/4, 
the ratio in equation (4) yields dyldx = - 141 + fi). 
problem  18 finds a  general  formula  for the  slope,  using  dyldx = (dy/do)/(dx/do). 
problem 20 finds a more elegant formula, by looking at the question differently. 

length of a polar  curve 

the length  integral always starts with  ds = j ( ~ x ) ~+ (dy)2. a polar  curve  has  x = 
r cos 8 = f(8) cos 8 and y = f(9) sin 8. now take derivatives by the product rule: 
dy = (f'(8)sin 8 + f(8)cos 8)do. 

dx = (f'(9)cos  8 - f(8)sin 9)do 

and 

squaring and adding (note cos28 + sin2$) gives the element of length ds: 

the  figure shows ( d ~ ) ~   +

example  4  the circle r = cos 8 has ds = ,/idb.  so its length is n (not 2n!!-don't 
go around  twice).  revolved around the y axis the circle yields a doughnut  with  no

9.4  complex numbers 

real  numbers  are  sufficient for  most  of  calculus.  starting  from  x2 + 4, its integral 
3x3 + 4x + c  is  also  real.  if  we  are given  x3 - 1, its  derivative  3x2 is  real.  but  the 
roots (or zeros) of  those polynomials  are complex  numbers: 

x2 + 4 = 0  and 

.u3 - 1 = 0  have  complex  solutions. 

we expect two square roots of  - 4. there are three cube roots of  1. complex numbers 
are unavoidable, in order to find n  roots for each polynomial  of  degree  n. 

this  section  explains  how  to  work  with  complex  numbers.  you  will  see  their 
relation to polar coordinates. at  the end, we  use them to solve differential equations. 
start  with  the  imaginary  number  i.  everybody  knows  that  x2 = - 1 has  no  real 
solution. when  you  square a real  number, the result  is never negative. so the world 
has agreed on a solution called i. (except that electrical engineers call it j.) imaginary 
numbers follow the normal rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
with one difference:  whenever i2 appears it is replaced by  - 1 .  in particular  - i times 
- i gives  + i2 = - 1. in other words,  - i is also a square root of  - 1 .  there are two 
solutions (i and  - i )  to the equation  x2 + 1 = 0. 

finding cube roots of  1 will  stretch  us  further. we need  complex  numbers-real 

plus imaginary. 

9b  a complex  number (say  1 + 3i) is the sum of  a  real  number (1) and a  pure 
imaginary number (39. addition keeps those parts separate; multiplication  uses 
i2 = - 1: 

addition: 

multiplication: 

(1 + 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 1 + 1 + i(3 + 3) = 2 + 6i 
(1 + 3i)(1 + 3i) = 1 + 3i + 3i + 9i2 = - 8 + 6i.

9.4  complex numbers 

adding  1+ 3i to 5 - i is easy (6 + 2i). multiplying is longer, but you see the rules: 

the point is this: we don't  have to imagine any more new numbers. after accepting 
i,  the  rest  is  straightforward.  a  real  number  is just  a  complex  number  with  no 
imaginary part! when  1+ 3i combines with its "complex  conjugate"  1 - 3i-adding 
or multiplying-the 

(1 + 3i) + (1 - 3i) = 2  (real) 

(1) 

the complex conjugate offers a way to do division, by making the denominator real: 

1  -

------ 1  1-3i  - 1-3i 
x-iy 
1 + 3 i   1 + 3 i 1 - 3 i  
10 
x 2 +  y2' 
9c; the 6ompbex  number x + iy  has real  part  x  and imaginary  part  y.  its 
complex  conjugate is x - iy. the product (x + iy)(x- i ) equals, x2 + y2 = r2. 

------ 1  x - i y -
x + i y   x + i y x - i y  

and 

-

complex numbers correspond to points in a plane. the number  1 + 3i corresponds to 
the point (1, 3). similarly x + iy is paired with (x, y)-which 
is x units along the "real 
axis"  and y units up the "imaginary axis."  the ordinary plane turns into the complex 
plane. the absolute value r is the same as the polar coordinate r (figure 9.8~). 

the figure shows two more copies of the complex plane. the one in the middle is 
for addition and subtraction. it uses rectangular coordinates. the one on the right is 
for multiplication and division and squaring. it uses polar coordinates. in squaring 
a complex number, r is squared and 8 is doubled-as 
the right figure and equation 
(3) both show.

answer is real: j+.

fig. 9.8  the complex plane shows x, y, r, 8. add with x and y,  multiply with r and 8. 

adding complex numbers is like adding vectors (chapter 11). the real parts  give 
3-1 and  the imaginary parts  give  1 + 1. the vector  sum (2,2) corresponds to the 
complex sum 2 + 2i. the complex conjugate 3 - i is the mirror image across the real 
axis (i reversed to  -i). the connection to r and 8 is the same as before (you see it in 
the triangle): 

x = r cos 8  and  y = r sin 8  so that  x + iy = r(cos 8 + i sin 8). 

(2) 
in  the third  figure,  1 + i has r = fi and  8 = n/4. the polar  form  is ficos n/4 + 
f i i  sin n/4. when this number is squared, its 45" angle becomes 90". the square is 
(1 + i)2= 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i. its polar form is 2 cos 7c/2 + 2i sin n/2. 

9  polar coordinates and complex numbers 

b. 

9d  multiplication adds angles, division subtracts angles, and squaring doubles 
angles. the absolute values are multiplied, divided, and squared: 

(r cos 0 + ir sin q2  = r2 cos 20 + ir2 sin 20. 

(3) 

for nth powers we  reach  $ and no.  for square roots, r goes to fi and  8 goes to 
48. the number  -1 is at 180  , so its square root  i is at 90". 
to see why.0 is doubled in equation (3), factor out r2 and multiply as usual: 

(cos 0 + i sin 8)(cos 8 + i sin 8) = cos28- sin28+ 2i sin 8 cos 8. 

the  right  side  is  cos 28 + i sin 20.  the  double-angle  formulas  from  trigonometry 
match the squaring of complex numbers. the cube would be cos 38 + i sin 38 (because 
20 and 0 add to 30, and r is still 1). the nth power is in de moivre's formula: 

(cos 8 + i sin 8)"= cos n8 + i sin no. 

(4) 

with  n = - 1  we  get  cos(- 8) + i sin(- @-which 
conjugate: 

is  cos 8 - i sin 8,  the  complex

we are almost touching euler's formula,  the key to all numbers on the unit circle: 

cos 8 + i sin 8 = eie. 

euler's formula: 

(6) 
squaring both sides gives (ei3(eie)= e"'.  that is equation (3).the  -1 power is l/eie= 
e-".  that is equation (5). multiplying any eieby ei4produces ei(e+". the special case 
4 = 0 gives the square, and the special case c#i  = - 8 gives eibe-" = 1.

a highlight of  chapter 10 is to recognize two new series on the right. the real terms 
1 - #i2  + ..-add  up  to  cos 8.  the  imaginary  part  8 - &03+ +.*  adds  up  to  sin 8. 
therefore eie equals cos 8 + i sin 0.  it is fantastic that  the most  important  periodic 
functions in all of  mathematics come together in this graceful way. 

we learn from euler (pronounced oiler) that e2"' = 1. the cosine of 2n is 1, the sine 
is zero. if  you substitute x = 2ni into the infinite series, somehow everything cancels 
is almost a miracle. from the viewpoint of  angles, 8 = 2n carries 
except the  1-this 
us around a full circle and back to e2"' = 1. 

multiplying euler's formula by r, we have a third way to write a complex number: 

every complex number is 

x + iy = r cos 8 + ir sin 8 = reie. 

(7) 

example 1  2eietimes 3eibequals 6e2".  for 8 = 4 2 ,  2i times 3i is  -6. 

example 2  find  w b n d  w4 and w8 and w2'  when w = ei"i4. 
solution  ei"i4 is  1/j?  + i/j?.  note that r2 =  +  = 1. now watch angles: 

figure 9.9 shows the eight powers of  w.  they are the eighth roots of  1. 

9.4  complex numbers 

fig. 9.9  the eight powers of w  and the cube roots of  1. 

example 3  ( x 2+ 4 = 0 )  the square roots of  -4 are 2i and  -2i. instead  of (i)(i)= 
- 1 we have (2i)(2i)= - 4. if  euler insists, we write 2i and  -2i as 2einl2and 2ei3"i2. 

example 4  (the  cube  roots  of  1)  in  rectangular  coordinates  we  have  to  solve 
( x  + iy)" 
1, which is not easy. in polar coordinates this same equation is r3e3"=  1. 
immediately  r = 1. the angle  8 can be  27113  or 47113  or 67113-the  cube roots in  the 
figure  are evenly spaced 

(e2ni/3)3  = e2ni  = 1  (e4ni/3)3 = e4ni  = 1 

(e6ni/3)3 ,e6ni ,1. 

you see why the angle 87113  gives nothing new. it completes a full circle back to 27113. 

the nth roots of  1 are e2"'ln, e4"'/" , ..., 1 .   there are  n of them. 
they lie at angles 2 4 n ,  4i~/n,. . . ,2;n around the unit  circle. 

solution of differential equations 

the algebra of complex numbers is now applied to the calculus of complex functions. 
the  complex  number  is  c, the  complex  function  is  ec'. it  will  solve  the  equations 
y"  = - 4y and y"'  = y, by  connecting them  to c2 = - 4 and c3 = 1. chapter 16 does 
the  same for  all  linear  differential  equations  with  constant  coefficients-this 
is  an 
optional preview. 

please  memorize  the  one key  idea:  substitute  y = ect into  the dzyerential  equation 

and solve for  c. each derivative brings a factor c, so y'  = cectand y"  = c2ec': 

d2y/dt2= - 4y leads  to c2ect= - 4ect,which gives c2 = - 4. 

(8) 
for this differential equation, c must be a square root of  -4. we know the candidates 
(c= 2i and c = - 2i). the equation has two "pure  exponential solutions"  ec': 

and 
y  = e2it 
(9) 
+ ~ e - ~ "  
 give all solutions. in chapter 16 we will choose 
their combinations y = ~ e ~ "
the two numbers  a  and b  to match  two initial conditions at t = 0. 
the solution y = e2" = cos 2t + i sin 2t is complex. the differential equation is real. 

y = e-2i'. 

for real y's,  take the real and imaginary parts  of the complex solutions: 

yreal= cos 2t  and yimaginary= sin 2t. 

(10) 
these  are  the  "pure  oscillatory  solutions."  when  y = e2"  travels  around  the  unit 
circle, its imaginary part sin 2t moves up and down. (it is like the ball and its shadow 
in  section 1.4, but  twice as fast because  of  2t.) the real  part  cos 2t  goes backward 
and  forward.  by  the  chain  rule,  the  second  derivative  of  cos 2t  is  -4  cos 2t.  thus 
d  yldt  = - 4y and we  have real solutions. 

9  polar coordinates and complex numbers 

example 5  find three solutions and then three real  solutions to d3y/dt3= y. 
key  step: substitute y  = ect.the result is c3ect= ect.thus c3 = 1 and c is a cube root 
of  1. the candidate c = 1 gives y  = et (our first solution). the next c is complex: 

the real part  of the exponent  leads to the absolute  value  lyl=  e-'i2. it decreases as t 
gets larger, so y  moves toward zero. at  the same time, the factor eiati2goes around 
the  unit  circle.  therefore  y  spirals  in  to  zero  (figure 9.10).  so  does  its  complex 
conjugate,  which  is  the  third exponential. changing  i  to  - i in (11) gives  the  third 
cube root  of  1 and the third solution e-'i2e-

the first real solution is y  = et. the others are the two parts of the spiral: 

that is r cos 0 and r sin 0. it is the ultimate use (until chapter 16) of polar coordinates 
and complex numbers. we might have discovered cos 2t and sin 2t without help, for 
y"  = - 4y. i don't  think these solutions to y"'  = y would have been found. 

example 6  find four solutions to d4y/dt4= y  by  substituting y = ect. 

four derivatives lead to c4 = 1. therefore c is i or  -1 or  - i or 1. the solutions are 
y  = eit, e-l, e-", and et. if  we  want real solutions, eit and e-"  combine into cos t  and 
sin t. in all cases y""  = y. 

fig. 9.10  solutions move in the complex plane: y"  = -4 y  and y"'  = y  and y""  = y.

infinite series 


infinite series can be  a pleasure (sometimes). they throw  a  beautiful light on sin x 
and  cos x.  they  give  famous numbers  like n and  e.  usually they  produce  totally 
unknown  functions-which  might be good.  but on the painful side is the fact that 
an infinite series has infinitely many terms. 

it is not  easy to know  the sum of  those terms.  more than  that, it is not  certain 
that  there  is  a  sum. we  need  tests, to decide if  the series converges. we  also need 
ideas, to discover what  the series converges  to.  here  are examples of  convergence, 
divergence, and oscillation: 

the  first  series converges.  its next  term  is  118, after that  is  1116-and 
every  step 
brings us halfway to 2. the second series (the sum of 1's) obviously diverges to infinity. 
the oscillating example (with  1's and  -1's) also fails to converge. 

all  those and more are special cases of  one infinite series which is absolutely the 

most important of all: 

the geometric series is 1 + x + x2 + x3 + 

1 

= -
1 - x '  

this is a series of functions.  it is a "power  series."  when we  substitute numbers for 
x, the series on the left may converge to the sum on the right. we need to know when 
it doesn't.  choose x = 4and x = 1 and x = - 1: 

1 + 1 + 1 + 

1 
is divergent. its sum is --- -
- a-
0 

1 - 1  

1

1+ (- 1)+ (-

+ 

--   

1 
is the oscillating series. its sum should be --- -
2' 

1 - ( - 1  

1 

the last  sum bounces between  one and  zero,  so at least its average is 3. at  x = 2 
there is no way that  1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 

agrees with  1/(1 - 2). 

- a - 


this behavior is typical of  a power series-to 

converge in an interval of  x's  and 

10.1  the geometric series 

to  diverge  when  x  is  large.  the  geometric series is  safe for  x  between  -1  and  1. 
outside that range it diverges. 

the next  example shows a repeating decimal  1.1 1 1.. .: 

set x = - the geometric series is 1 + -+
10 

1
10' 

the  decimal  1.1 11 . . .  is  also  the  fraction  1/(1 - &),  which  is  1019.  every 
fvaction  leads to a repeating decimal. every  repeating decimal adds up (through  the 
geometric series) to a fraction. 

to get  3.333..., just  multiply by  3. this is  1013. to get  1.0101..., set x = 1/100. 

this is the fraction 1/(1- &),  which is  100/99. 

here is an unusual decimal (which eventually repeats). i don't really understand it: 

-- -.004 115226337448 ...

most numbers are not fractions (or repeating decimals). a  good example is a: 

this is 3.1415.. .,a series that certainly converges. we happen to know the first billion 
terms (the billionth is given below). nobody  knows the 2 billionth term.  compare 
that series with this one, which also equals a: 

that alternating  series is really remarkable.  it is typical of  this chapter, because its 
pattern is clear. we  know the  2 billionth  term  (it has  a minus  sign). this is not  a 
geometric series, but in section 10.1 it comes from a geometric series. 
question  does this series actually converge? what if  all signs are + ? 
answer  the  alternating  series  converges  to  a (section 10.3). the  positive  series 
diverges to infinity (section 10.2).the terms go to zero, but their sum is infinite. 

this example begins to show what the chapter is about. part of  the subject deals 
with special series, adding to 1019 or n: or ex. the other part is about series in general, 
adding  to  numbers  or functions that  nobody  has  heard  of.  the  situation was  the 
give  famous answers like in x  or  unknown  answers like 
same for  integrals-they 
1xx dx. the sum of  1 + 118 + 1/27 + 
is also unknown-although  a lot of mathema- 
ticians have tried. 
the chapter is not long, but it is full. the last half  studies power  series. we begin 
with  a  linear  approximation  like  1 + x.  next  is  a  quadratic  approximation  like 
1 + x + x2. in the end we match all the derivatives of f(x). this is the "taylor series," 
a new way to create functions-not  by formulas or integrals but by infinite series. 
no example can be  better than  1/(1 - x), which dominates section 10.1. then we 
define convergence and test for it. (most tests are really comparisons with a geometric 
series.) the  second  most  important  series in  mathematics  is  the  exponential  series 
ex = 1 + x + $x2 + &x3+ ---.it includes the series for sin x  and cos x, because of the 
formula  eix= cos x + i sin x.  finally  a  whole  range  of  new  and  old  functions  will 
come from taylor series. 
in the end, all the key functions of calculus appear as ''infinite polynomials"  (except 
the step function). this is the ultimate voyage from the linear function y  = mx + b.

the  geometric series

-

we begin by looking at both sides of  the geometric series: 

how does the series on the left produce the function on the right? how does 1/(1  - x) 
produce the series? add up two terms of  the series, then three terms, then n  terms: 

for the first, 1 + x times 1 - x equals 1- x 2  by ordinary algebra. the second begins 
to make the point:  1 + x + x 2  times  1 - x gives  1 - x + x - x 2  + x2 - x3. between 
1 at the start and  -x3 at the end, everything cancels. the same happens in all cases: 
1 + --.+ xn-'  times  1 - x  leaves  1 at the  start  and  -xn at  the  end.  this  proves 
equation (2)-the 

sum of  n terms of  the series. 

for the whole series we  will push n towards infinity. on a graph you can see what 

is happening. figure 10.1 shows n = 1 and n = 2 and n = 3 and n = a. 

fig. 10.1  two  terms, 
terms, then full series: 

then 

three 

the  infinite  sum  gives  a  jfnite 
answer,  provided  x  is  between 
- 1 and 1.  then  xn goes to zero: 

now  start with the function  1/(1  - x). how does it produce the series? one way is 
elementary  but  brutal,  to do  "long  division"  of  1 - x  into  1 (next to  the  figure). 
another way is to look up the binomial formula for (1 - x)-l. that is cheating-we 
want to discover the series, not just  memorize it. the successful approach uses cal- 

10.1  the geometric series 

culus. compute the derivatives o f f  (x) = 1/(1 - x): 

at x = 0 these derivatives are 1, 2, 6,24, .... notice how  - 1 from the chain rule keeps 
them  positive.  the nth derivative at x = 0 is n factorial: 

now comes the idea.  to match the series with 1/(1- x), match all those derivatives at 
x = 0. each power xn gets one derivative right. its derivatives at x = 0 are zero, except 
the nth  derivative,  which is n!  by  adding all powers  we  get every derivative right- 
so the geometric series matches the function: 

1 + x + x 2  + x 3  +  has the same derivatives  at x = 0 as  1/(1 - x). 

the linear approximation is  1 + x.  then comes 3f "(0)x2= x2. the third derivative 
is supposed to be 6, and x 3  is just  what we need.  through its derivatives, the function 
produces the series. 

with  that  example,  you  have  seen  a  part  of  this  subject.  the  geometric  series 
diverges  if  1x1 2 1.  otherwise  it  adds  up  to  the  function  it  comes  from  (when 
- 1 < x < 1). to get familiar with other series, we now apply algebra or calculus- 
to 
reach  the square of  1/(1 - x) or its derivative  or its  integral. the point is that these 
operations are applied to  the series. 

the best  i know is  to show  you  eight  operations that  produce  something useful. 

at  the end we  discover series for in 2 and n. 

1. multiply  the geometric  series by a or ax: 

the first series fits the decimal  3.333 . . . . in that case a = 3. the geometric series for 
x =& gave  1.11 1 . . . = 1019, and this series is just  three times larger. its sum is  1013. 
the second  series fits other decimals  that are fractions in disguise.  to get  12/99, 

choose a = 12 and x = 1/100: 

problem  13 asks about  ,8787 . . . and  .i23123 . . . . it  is  usual  in  precalculus  to write 
a + ar + ar2 +  = a/(l - r).  but  we  use  x  instead  of  r  to  emphasize  that  this  is  a 
function-which  we  can now differentiate. 
2. the derivative of the geometric  series  1 + x + x  + .-.is  1/(1- x ) ~ :  

at x =& the left side starts with  1.23456789. the right side is  1/(1 - &)2  = 1/(9/10)2, 
which is  10018 1. if  you have a calculator, divide  100 by  81. 

the answer should also be  near (1.11 11 11 1 i ) ~ ,  which is  1.2345678987654321. 

3. subtract  1 + x + x 2  + 

from  1 + 2x + 3x2 + 

as you  subtract functions: 

curiously, the same series comes from multiplying (5) by x. it answers a question left 
average number of coin tosses until the result is heads. this 
open in section 8.4-the 

is the sum  l(pl) + 2(p2) + --. from id203, with x = f :  

10  infinite series 

the id203  of  waiting until  the  nth  toss is p,, = (4)".  the expected value is  two 
tosses. i suggested experiments, but now this mean value is exact. 
4. multiply series: the geometric series times itselfis 1/(1 - x) squared: 

the series on the right is not new! in equation (5) it was the derivative of y = 1/(1-  x). 
now it is the square of  the same y.  the geometric series satisfies dyldx = y2, so the 
function does too. we have stumbled onto a differential equation. 

notice how the series was squared. a typical term in equation (8) is 3x2, coming 
from  1 times x 2  and x times x and x 2  times  1 on the left side. it is a lot quicker to 
square 1/(1 - x)-but  other series can be multiplied when we don't  know what func- 
tions they add up to. 
5. solve dyldx = y2 fvom  any starting value-a  new  application of series: 
suppose the  starting value is y = 1 at x = 0.  the equation y'  = y 2  gives  l2 for  the 
derivative. now  a  key  step:  the derivative of the  equation gives  y" = 2yy'.  at  x = 0 
that  is 2  1  1. continuing upwards, the derivative of  2yy1 is 2yy" + 2(y')2. at  x = 0 
that is y"'  = 4 + 2 = 6. 
all derivatives are factorials: 1,2,6,24, . . . . we are matching the derivatives of the 
geometric series  1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . . term by  term,  we  rediscover the solution to 
y'  = y2.  the solution starting from y(0) = 1 is y = 1/(1 - x). 

a different starting value is  - 1. then y' = (- 

= 1 as before. the chain rule gives 
y" = 2yy' = - 2 and then y"'  = 6. with alternating signs to match these derivatives, the 
solution starting from  - 1 is 

it is a  small challenge to recognize the function on the right from the series on the 
left. the series has  - x in place of  x; then multiply by  -1.  the sum y = - 1/(1 + x) 
also  satisfies y'  = y2. we  can  solve diferential  equations from  all starting  values  by 
injinite series.  essentially  we  substitute an  unknown  series into  the  equation,  and 
calculate one term at a time. 
6. the integrals of  1 + x + x2 + ..- and  1 - x +  x2 - -..  are logarithms: 

the derivative of  (10a) brings back the geometric series. for logarithms we  find  l/n 
not  l/n!  the first term  x  and  second term  i x 2  give linear  and  quadratic approxi- 
mations. now we  have the whole series. i cannot fail to substitute 1 and 4, to find 
ln(1 - 1) and ln(1 + 1) and ln(1 - )): 

10.1  the geometric series 

the first series diverges to infinity. this harmonic series 1 + 4 + 4+ 
came into the 
earliest discussion of limits (section 2.6). the second series has alternating signs and 
converges to in 2. the third has plus signs and also converges to in 2. these will be 
examples for a major topic in infinite series-tests 

for convergence. 

for the first time in this book  we  are able to compute a logarithm!  something 
remarkable is involved. the sums of  numbers in (11) and (12) were discoveredfrom  the 
sums offunctions  in (10). you might think it would be easier to deal only with numbers, 
to compute in 2. but then we would never have integrated the series for 1/(1- x) and 
detected (10). it is better  to work with x, and substitute special values like 4at the 
end. 

there are two practical problems with these series. for in 2 they converge slowly. 
for in e they blow up. the correct answer is in e = 1, but the series can't  find it. both 
problems are solved by adding (10a) to (lob), which cancels the even powers: 

at x = f,the right side is in 4 - in 4 = in 2. powers off-are much smaller than powers 
of  1 or f, so in 2 is quickly computed. all logarithms can be found from the improved 
series (13). 
7 .  change variables in the geometric  series (replace x by x 2  or  -x2): 

this produces new functions (always our goal). they involve even powers of  x. the 
second series will soon be used to calculate n. other changes are valuable: 

-in  place of  x:  1 + 
x 
2 

+ ... = ------- -
2 - x 

1  -- 2

1 -(x/2) 

equation (17) is a series of  negative powers x-".  it converges when 1x1 is greater than 
1. convergence in (17) is for large x. convergence in (16) is for 1x1 < 2. 
8. the integralof  1 - x 2  + x 4 - x 6  + -..yields  the inverse tangent of x: 

we  integrated  (15) and got  odd powers. the magical formula  for n (discovered by 
leibniz) comes when x = 1. the angle with  tangent  1 is n/4: 

the  first  three  terms  give  n z 3.47 (not very  close). the  5000th  term  is  still  of  size 
.0001, so the fourth decimal is still not settled. by  changing to x = l / d ,  the astrono-
mer  halley  and  his  assistant  found  71 correct  digits  of  n/6  (while waiting  for  the 
comet). that is one step in the long and amazing story of calculating n. the chudnov-
sky  brothers  recently  took  the latest  step  with  a  supercomputer-they 
have found 
more  than  one  billion decimal places  of  n  (see science,  june  1989). the  digits look 
completely random,  as everyone expected. but  so far we  have no proof  that all ten 
digits occur & of  the time. 

10  infinite series 

historical  note  archimedes  located  n  above  3.14  and  below  3+. variations  of  his 
method (polygons in circles) reached as far as 34 digits-but  not for 1800 years. then 
halley  found  71 digits  of  7116  with  equation (18). for faster  convergence  that  series 
was replaced  by  other inverse tangents,  using smaller values of  x: 

a prodigy named dase, who could multiply  100-digit numbers in his head in 8 hours, 
finally  passed  200  digits  of  n. the  climax  of hand  calculation  came  when  shanks 
published  607 digits. i  am  sorry  to  say  that  only  527 were  correct.  (with years  of 
calculation he went on to 707 digits, but still only 527 were correct.) the mistake was 
not noticed  until  1945! then ferguson  reached  808 digits with a desk calculator. 

now  comes the computer. three days on an eniac (1949) gave 2000 digits.  a 
hundred  minutes  on  an  ibm 704  (1958) gave  10,000 digits.  shanks  (no  relation) 
reached  100,000 digits.  finally a million  digits  were found in  a day in  1973, with  a 
cdc 7600. all  these calculations used  variations  of equation (20). 

the  record  after  that  went  between  cray  and  hitachi  and  now  ibm.  but  the 
method  changed.  the calculations  rely  on  an incredibly  accurate  algorithm, based 
on the "arithmetic-geometric  mean  iteration"  of  gauss. it is also incredibly  simple, 
all things considered: 

the number  of  correct  digits  more  than doubles  at every step.  by  n = 9 we  are far 
beyond  shanks (the hand calculator). no end is in sight. almost anyone can go past 
a billion digits, since with the chudnovsky method we don't  have to start over again. 

it is time to stop. you  may  think  (or hope) that nothing more could possibly be 
done  with  geometric  series.  we  have  gone  a  long  way  from  1/(1- x),  but  some 
functions can never be reached. one is ex (and its relatives sin x, cos x, sinh x, cosh x). 
another is jg(and its relatives i/,/-, 
sin- 'x,  sec- 'x,  . . .). the exponentials 
are in  10.4, with series that converge for all x. the square-roots are in  10.5, closer to 
geometric  series and  converging for  1x1 < 1. before  that  we  have  to  say  what  con- 
vergence means. 

the  series came  fast,  but  i  hope  you  see  what  can  be  done (subtract, multiply, 
differentiate,  integrate). addition  is  easy,  division  is harder, all  are legal.  some un- 
expected numbers  are the sums of  infinite series. 
added  in proof  by  e-mail  i just  learned  that  the  record  for  tc  is  back  in  japan: 
230 digits which is more than  1.07 billion. the elapsed time was  100 hours (75 hours 
of  cpu time  on an nec machine). the billionth  digit after  the decimal point  is 9.

10.2  convergence tests:  positive series 

this is the third time we  have stopped the calculations to deal with the definitions. 
chapter 2 said what a derivative is. chapter 5 said what an integral is. now we  say 
it exists. in all three cases a limit is involved. that is 
what the sum of  a series is-if 
the  formal,  careful, cautious part  of  mathematics,  which  decides if  the  active and 
progressive parts make sense. 
the series f + 4+  + 
converges to 1. the series 1+f + 4 +  diverges to infin- 
ity. the series 1 - + 4 - -..converges to in 2. when we speak about convergence or 
divergence of  a series, we  are really speaking about convergence or divergence of  its 
"partial sums." 
definition 1  the partial  sum  s,  of  the series a, +a2 + a, + .-.stops at a,: 

s,  = sum of the fist  n terms = al + a2 + -.-+ a,. 

thus sn is part  of  the total sum. the example f + 4+4+ -.-has partial sums 

those add up  larger  and larger parts  of  the  series-what 
is  the  sum of  the  whole 
series? the answer is:  the series f + 4+ .. . converges to 1 because its partial  sums s, 
converge to  1. the series a, + a2 + a, + ... converges to s when its partial  sums- 
going further and further out-approach 
definition 2  the sum of a series is the limit of its partial  sums  s,. 
we  repeat:  if  the limit exists. the numbers s,  may have no limit. when  the partial 
sums jump  around, the whole series has no sum. then the series does not converge. 
when the partial sums approach s, the distant terms a,  are approaching zero. more 
than that, the sum of distant terms is approaching zero. 

this limit s. add  the a's,  not  the s's. 

the new idea (2a,  = s) has been converted to the old idea (s, +s). 

example 1  the geometric series & + &+ &+ 
the partial sums sl ,s,,  s,,  s,  are .l, .11, . i l l ,  .1111. they are approaching s =4. 

converges to s = 4. 

10.2  convergence tests positive series 

note again the difference between the series of  a's  and the sequence of s's.  the series 
1 + 1 + 1 + ..-diverges because the sequence of s's is 1,2, 3, .. . . a sharper example is 
the harmonic series: 1+ i+ 4+  diverges because its partial sums 1, i f ,  ... eventu-
ally go past  every number  s. we  saw that in 2.6 and will see it again here. 

do not confuse a, -+ 0 with s, +s. you cannot be sure that a series converges, just 
on  the basis that a, +0. the harmonic series is the best example: a, = lln -+ 0 but 
still s,  -+ oo. this makes infinite series into a  delicate game, which mathematicians 
enjoy. the line between divergence and convergence is hard to find and easy to cross. 
a slight push  will  speed  up a, +0 and make  the s,  converge. even  though  a, +0 
does not  by  itself guarantee convergence, it is the first requirement: 

i 10a  if  a series converges (s, 4 s) then its terms must  approach zero (a, -+  0).  i 
proof  suppose  s,  approaches  s  (as  required  by  convergence).  then  also  s,-, 
approaches s, and the difference s, - s,  -,approaches zero. that difference is a,.  so 
a, -+  0. 
example  1  (continued) for the geometric series  1 + x + x2 + . a - ,  
the test an+0 is 
the same as xn -+ 0. the test  is failed if  1x1  2 1, because the powers of  x don't  go to 
zero. automatically the series diverges. the test is passed if  -1 < x < 1. but to prove 
convergence, we cannot  rely on a, -+ 0. it is the partial sums that must converge: 

s, = 1+ x + .., + x"-'  = - and 

1 - xn
1 - x  

1  . 
sn -+ -
1 - x  

this is s.

for  other  series,  first  check  that  a, -,0  (otherwise there  is  no  chance  of  con- 

vergence). the a, will not  have the special form xn-so  we  need sharper tests. 

the geometric series stays in our mind for this reason. many convergence tests are 

comparisons with that series. the right comparison gives enough information: 
if  la,/ < iand la2[< +and ..., then  a, + a 2  + ... converges faster than f + $ +  .... 
than 
more  generally, 
ax + ax2 + ax3 + + .   .. provided  x < 1, the  second  series  converges. then 
an also 
converges. we move now to convergence by comparison or divergence by comparison.

terms 

the 

throughout  the rest  of  this section, all numbers  a, are assumed positive. 

comparison test  and  integral test 

in practice it is rare to compute the partial sums s, = a ,  +  + a,.  usually a simple 
formula can't  be found. we may never know the exact limit s. but it is still possible 
to decide convergence-  whether there is a sum-  by comparison with another series 
that is known to converge. 

i 

100  (comparison test) suppose  that  0 <a, 4b.  and 1b,  converges.  then 
zanconverges. 
the smaller terms an add to a  smaller sum: 1an is  below 1bn and must  converge. 
cn= co.this comparison forces 1an= m. 
on the other hand suppose an 2 cn and 
a  series diverges if it is above another divergent series. 

note that a series of positive terms can only diverge "to infinity."  it cannot oscillate, 
because each term moves it forward. either the s, creep up on s, passing every number 
below it, or they pass all numbers and diverge. if an increasing sequence s,  is bounded 
above, it must converge. the line of  real numbers is complete, and has no holes.

infinite series 

the harmonic series  1 +3+4+  + .. . diverges to infinity. 

a  comparison  series  is  1 + 3+ $ + $ + $ + $ + $ + $ + .. . .  the  harmonic  series  is 
larger. but this comparison series is really  1 +3+3+3 + .. . , because i-= a =$. 

the comparison series diverges. the harmonic series, above it, must also diverge. 
to apply the comparison test, we need something to compare with. in example 2, 
we  thought of  another series. it was convenient because  of  those 3's.  but  a different 
series  will  need  a  different  comparison,  and  where  will  it  come  from? there  is  an 
automatic way to think  of a comparison series. it comes from the integral test. 

allow me to apply the integral test to the same example. to understand the integral 
test, look at the areas in figure 10.2. the test compares rectangles with curved areas. 

y (s)= -1 

y ( x )  = 1 

sum + oo so 

fig. 10.2 

integral test: sums and integrals both diverge (p = 1) and  both  converge (p > 1). 
(again) compare  1 +3+ 4+ . . . with the area under the curve y  = 1/x. 
example 2 
every  term  a,  = lln is the  area  of  a  rectangle.  we  are comparing  it  with  a  curved 
area  c,.  both  areas are between  x = n and x = n + 1, and the  rectangle is above the 
curve. so a,  > c,: 

rectangular area a,  = - exceeds curved  area c,  = 

1 
n 

here  is  the  point.  those  c,'s  look  complicated,  but  we  can  add  them  up.  the sum 
c, + ... + c,  is  the  whole  area,  from  1 to  n + 1. it  equals ln(n + 1)-we 
know  the 
integral  of  llx. we also know that the logarithm goes to infinity. 
the rectangular area  1 + 112 + ... + lln is above the curved area. by  comparison 

of  areas, the harmonic series diverges to infinity-a 
remark  the integral of  l/x has  another  advantage  over  the  series with  3's.  first, 
the integral test was automatic. from  l/n in the series, we  went to l/x in the integral. 
second, the comparison is closer. instead of adding only $ when the number of  terms 
is doubled, the true partial sums grow like in  n.  to prove that, put rectangles  under 
the curve. 

little faster than ln(n + 1). 

rectangles  below the curve give an area below  the integral.  figure  10.2b omits the 
first  rectangle,  to  get  under  the  curve.  then  we  have  the  opposite  to  the  first 
comparison-the 

sum is now  smaller than the integral: 

adding  1 to  both  sides,  s,  is  below  1 + in n.  from  the  previous  test,  s,  is  above 
ln(n + 1). that is a narrow space-we  have an excellent estimate of s,.  the sum of  lln

and  the  integral  of  1/x  diverge  together.  problem 43  will  show  that  the  difference
between  s,  and in n approaches  "euler's  constant,"  which  is  y =  .577  ....

main point: rectangular  area  is sn.  curved area  is  close. we  are using integrals  to

if a computer adds a million terms  every second  for a million years, how

help  with  sums  (it used to  be  the opposite).
question 
large  is  the partial  sum  of the  harmonic  series?
answer  the  number  of terms  is  n = 602 * 24 * 365 " 1012 < 3.2 - 1019.  therefore  in n
is  less  than  in 3.2 + 19 in  10 < 45.  by  the integral  test  s. <  1 + in n,  the  partial  sum
after a  million  years  has  not  reached  46.

for other  series,  1/x  changes  to  a different  function  y(x).  at  x = n  this function
must  equal an.  also  y(x)  must be  decreasing.  then  a  rectangle  of height  an  is  above
the  graph  to  the  right  of x =  n,  and  below  the  graph  to  the left  of  x = n.  the  series
and the  integral box  each  other in:  left  sum > integral > right sum.  the  reasoning  is
the  same  as  it was for a, =  1/n  and  y(x) =  llx:  there  is  finite  area  in  the  rectangles
when  there  is  finite area  under  the curve.

when  we  can't  add the a's, we  integrate  y(x)  and compare  areas:

10c 

(integral test)  if y(x) is  decreasing  and  y(n) agrees  with  an,  then

a, + a2 + a3 + ---  and 

y(x) dx  both  converge  or  both diverge.

example  3  the  "p-series"  -+  -+  + --+  converges  if  p >  1. integrate  y  -

in figure 10.2c, the area is finite if p >  1. the integral equals [x1 -p(1 - p)]] , which
is  1/(p - 1).  finite area means convergent  series.  if  1/1p is  the  first  term,  add  1 to  the

the  borderline  case  p = 1 is  the  harmonic  series  (divergent).  by  the  comparison
test, every p <  1 also  produces  divergence.  thus  11/ 
n diverges  by comparison with
sdxl/x  (and also  by  comparison  with  l1/n). section 7.5  on  improper  integrals  runs
parallel  to  this section  on  "improper  sums"  (infinite series).

comparing  z1/n3  with 
extra credit problem  the  sum  of the  p-series  leads  to  the most  important  problem
in pure  mathematics.  the  "zeta  function"  is  z(p) =  i1/n p, so z(2) = ir2/6  and z(3) is
unknown.  riemann  studied  the  complex  numbers  p  where  z(p) = 0  (there  are  infi-
nitely  many).  he conjectured  that  the real part of those p  is  always   . that  has been
tested  for the first  billion  zeros,  but never  proved.

comparison  with  the  geometric  series

we  can  compare  any  new  series  ai + a2 +  ...  with  1 + x +  --.  remember  that  the
first million  terms  have  nothing  to  do  with  convergence.  it is further  out, as  n -
oo,
that the comparison  stands  or falls.  we  still assume  that an > 0.

10e 

(ratio test)  if  a, + i/an approaches a limit l < 1,  the series converges. 
(root test)  if  the nth root 

approaches l c 1, the series converges. 

roughly  speaking, these  tests  make  a,  comparable  with  ln-therefore  convergent. 
the tests also establish divergence if  l > 1. they give no decision when l = 1. unfor- 
tunately l = 1 is the most important and the hardest case. 

on the other hand, you  will now see that the ratio test is fairly easy. 

example  4  the  geometric  series x + x 2  + -..has  ratio  exactly x.  the  nth  root  is 
also exactly x. so l = x. there is convergence if x < 1(known) and divergence if  x > 1 
(also  known).  the divergence of  1 + 1 + -..is too  delicate  (!)  for  the  ratio  test  and 
root test, because l = 1. 
example 5  the p-series has a,  = l/np and a,+ ,/a,  = np/(n+ 
the limit as n -+  co 
is l = 1, for every p. the ratio test does not feel the difference between p = 2 (conver-
gence) and p = 1 (divergence) or even p = - 1 (extreme divergence). neither does the 
root test.  so the integral test is sharper. 

example 6  a combination  of p-series and geometric series can now be decided:

(n + 

it is  1x1 < 1 that  decides convergence, not  p.  the powers xn are stronger  than any np. 
the factorials  n!  will now prove  stronger than any xn. 
example  7  the  exponential series ex = 1 + x + i x 2+ &x3+ ... converges for  all x. 
the terms of  this series are xn/n! the ratio between neighboring  terms is 
xn+l/(n+ l)! - x  which approaches l = 0 as n -+ cc

with x = 1, this ratio test gives convergence of zl/n! the sum is e. with x = 4,  the 

4"/n! also converges. we  know  this  sum too-it 

larger  series 
of  xnnp/n! converges for any x and p.  again  l = 0-the 
the factorials  take over, and give convergence. 
here is  the proof  of  convergence when  the  ratios approach l < 1. choose x  halfway 
from l to 1. then x < 1. eventually the ratios go below x and stay below:

ratio test is not even close.

multiply  the first two inequalities. then multiply all three: 

therefore  a,+ ,+ a,+,  + a,+,  + -.. is  less  than  a,(x  + x2 + x3 + ...).  since  x < 1, 
comparison with the geometric series gives convergence. 

example  8  the  series 

limit is l = 0. convergence is even faster  than  for e = zl/n! the root  test  is easily 

l/nn is  ideal  for  the  root  test.  the  nth  root  is  ljn.  its

the geometric series.

the  convergence  of geometric  series  and p-series  and exponential  series  is  settled.  i
will  put  these  an's  in  a  line,  going  from  most  divergent  to  most  convergent.  the

(ratio and root)

you  should  know  that  this crossover  is  not as  sharp  as  it  looks.  on  the convergent
side,  1/n(in  n)2  comes  before  all  those  p-series.  on  the  divergent  side,  1/n(ln n) and
1/n(ln n)(ln in n) belong  after  1/n.  for  any  divergent  (or convergent)  series,  there  is
another  that diverges  (or converges)  more  slowly.

thus  there is no  hope  of an ultimate  all-purpose  comparison  test. but comparison
is  the  best  method  available.  every  series  in  that  line  can  be  compared  with  its
neighbors,  and  other series  can  be  placed in between.  it is  a topic that is  understood
best by  examples.

the  indefinite integrals  are  - 1/in x and in(in  x). the first  goes  to zero  as  x -

slowly  but  it  gets  there.  so  the second  series  diverges.  these  examples  squeeze  new
series  into the line,  closer  to the crossover.

1/2n  is  1/2  times  e 1/n,  so  both  series  diverge.  two  series behave in  the  same
way  if  the  ratios an/b,  approach l > 0.  examples  11-12  have  n2/(n2  + 1) -+ 1 and
2n/(2n - 1) -> 1. that  leads  to  our final  test:

(limit  comparison  test) if the  ratio  an/bn  approaches  a  positive  limit  l,

1of 
then  e an  and  e bn  either  both  diverge  or  both  converge.

reason: an is  smaller than  2lb, and larger than   lbn , at least  when n  is large.  so  the
two  series  behave  in  the  same  way.  for  example  c sin (7/np)  converges  for  p >  1,
not  for  p < 1. it  behaves  like  1  1/np (here  l = 7).  the  tail  end  of  a  series  (large n)
controls  convergence.  the  front  end  (small n) controls  most of  the sum.

there  are  many  more  series  to be  investigated  by  comparison.

change all signs to +,the geometric series would still converge (to the larger sum 2). 
this is the first test, to bring back  a positive series by  taking  the absolute value la,[ 
of  every term.

infinite series

changing  a  negative  number  from  a,  to  ia,l  increases  the  sum.  main  point:  the
smaller  series  y a, is  sure to converge  if i  la,,l  converges.

if y  a,  converges  then  i a,,  converges  (absolutely).  but i  a,,  might  con-

4og 
verge,  as  in the  series  for 7, even  if i  fa,.  diverges  to infinity.

example  4  start  with  the positive  series  + 1  +  + 
. change any signs to minus.
then  the  new  series  converges  (absolutely).  the  right  choice  of  signs  will  make  it
converge  to  any  number between  -1  and  1.

example  2  start  with  the  alternating  series  1-  +- + 
+.  which  converges  to
in 2. change  to  plus  signs.  the  new  series  1 +  +  +  ...  diverges  to  infinity.  the
original  alternating  series  was  not  absolutely  convergent.  it  was  only  "conditionally
convergent."  a  series  can  converge  (conditionally) by a careful  choice  of signs-even
if ila,,l =  co.

if i  la,n,  converges  then i a,  converges.  here is  a quick  proof. the numbers  a, + la,i
are either zero (if a,  is negative) or 21a,l.  by  comparison with  i 21an,  which  converges,
y (a, + lan)  must converge.  now  subtract  the convergent  series  i ian,. the  difference
i a,  also converges,  completing  the proof. all  tests for  positive  series (integral, ratio,
comparison,  ...) apply  immediately  to absolute  convergence,  because  we  switch  to
la,n.

example  3  start  with  the  geometric  series

example  4 
(looking ahead) suppose  i a,x" converges  for  a particular  number  x.
then for every x nearer  to zero, it converges  absolutely.  this will be proved  and used
in section  10.6  on  power  series,  where it is  the most important  step in the  theory.

since  y 1/n2  converges,  so  does  i  (cos n)/n 2. that  second  series  has
example  5 
irregular  signs, but  it converges  absolutely  by comparison  with the  first  series  (since
i cos  ni  <  1).  probably  i  (tan n)/n 2  does  not  converge,  because  the  tangent  does  not
stay bounded  like the  cosine.

alternating  series

the series  1 - 1+- 4  + ... converges  to  in 2.  that  was  stated  without  proof.  this
is an  example  of an alternating series, in which  the  signs  alternate  between plus  and
, ... decrease
minus. there  is the additional property  that the absolute values  1, 1, 1, 
to  zero.  those  two  facts-decrease  to  zero  with  alternating  signs-guarantee
convergence.

ioh  an  alternating  series  a,  - a2   a3  - a4 .. converges  (at  least  condition-
ally,  maybe  not  absolutely) if every a,,, 1 < a.  and a,  -4 0.

the best proof is in figure 10.3.  look at a,  - a2 + a3. it is  below  a,, because  a3 (with
plus  sign) is  smaller than a2 (with minus  sign).  the sum  of five  terms  is less  than  the

sum of  three terms, because a,  is smaller than a4. these partial sums s,,  s3, s5, . . . 
with an odd number of  terms are decreasing. 

now look at two terms a, - a2, then four terms, then six terms. adding on a3 - a, 
increases the sum (because a3 2 a,).  similarly s,  is greater than s4 (because it includes 
a,  - a6 which is positive). so the sums s2, s4, s6, .. . are increasing. 
the difference between s, -,and s,  is the single number +a,.  it is required by  10h 
to approach zero. therefore the decreasing sequence s, ,s3, .. . approaches the same 
limit s as the increasing sequence s,,  s4, . . . . the series converges to s, which always 
lies between s, - and s,. 

this plus-minus pattern is special but important. the positive series xa,  may not 

converge.  the alternating series is x(-  lr+'a,. 
example  6  the  alternating series 4 -4 +4 -4 
is conditionally  convergent  (to 
n). the  absolute  values  decrease to zero.  is  this  series absolutely convergent? no. 
with plus signs, 4(1+  3 +  + 
example 7  the alternating series 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + .-.is not convergent at all. which 
requirement  in  10h  is  not  met?  the  partial  sums  s1 ,s3, s,,  . . . all  equal  1  and 
s2, s,,  s6, .. . all equal 0-but 

they don't  approach the same limit s. 

diverges like the harmonic series. 

multiplying and rearranging series 

in  section 10.1 we  added  and subtracted  and multiplied series. certainly  addition 
and subtraction are safe. if one series has partial sums s,  +s and the other has partial 
sums  t,  +t,  then  addition  gives  partial  sums s, + t,  -,s + t.  but  multiplication  is 
more dangerous, because the order of the multiplication can make a difference. more 
exactly, the order of terms is important when  the series are conditionally convergent. 
for absolutely convergent series, the order makes no difference. we can rearrange 
their  terms  and multiply them  in  any  order,  and  the  sum and  product  comes out 
right: 

rather than proving  101 and  10j, we  show what happens when there is only condi- 
tional  convergence.  our favorite is  1 -4+ f -4+ 
converging conditionally  to 

. . a ,  

10  infinite serles 

in 2.  by  rearranging, it will converge conditionally to anything! suppose the desired 
sum is  1000. take positive terms 1 +5 +  until they pass  1000. then add negative 
terms  -;-;-... until  the  subtotal drops  below  1000. then  new  positive  terms 
bring it above 1000, and so on. all terms are eventually used, since at least one new 
term is needed at each step. the limit is s = 1000. 

we also get strange products, when  series fail to converge absolutely: 

on the left the series converge (conditionally). the alternating terms go to zero. on 
the right the series diverges. its terms in parentheses don't  even approach zero, and 
the product is completely wrong. 

i  close  by  emphasizing that  it  is  absolute  convergence that  matters.  the most 
important series  are power  series  eanxn.like the  geometric  series (with all  a,  = 1) 
there is absolute convergence over an interval of  x's.  they give functions  of  x, which 
is what calculus needs and wants. 

we go next to the series for ex, which is absolutely convergent everywhere. from 
the viewpoint of  convergence tests it is too easy-the  danger is gone. but  from the 
viewpoint of  calculus and its applications, ex is unconditionally the best.

10.4  the  taylor  series for  ex,sin x, and cos x -

this section goes back  from numbers  to functions. instead of  xu,  = s it  deals with 
xanxn=f(x).  the sum is afunction of x. the geometric series has all a,  = 1 (including 
a,,  the constant term) and its sum is f(x) = 1/(1-  x). the derivatives of  1 + x + x2 + --. 
match  the  derivatives off.  now  we  choose  the  an differently, to match  a  different 
function. 

the new  function  is  ex.  all  its  derivatives are ex. at  x = 0,  this function  and its 
derivatives equal  1. to match  these  l's,  we  move factorials into the denominators. 

term by  term the series is 

10  infinite series 

xn/n!has the correct nth derivative (= 1). from the derivatives at x = 0, we have  built 
back the function! at x = 1 the right side is 1 + 1 + 4+ & + .-.and the left side is e = 
2.71828 .... at  x = - 1 the series gives 1- 1+ f -4+ -, which is e-'. 
the same term-by-term idea works for differential equations, as follows. 

example 1  solve dyldx = - y starting from y = 1 at x = 0. 
solution  the zeroth derivative at x = 0 is thefunction itseg y = 1. then the equation 
y'  = - y  gives  y'  = - 1  and  y" = - y'  = + 1.  the  alternating  derivatives 
1, -1, 1, -1, ... are matched by the alternating series for e-": 

y = 1 - x + t x 2  - i x 3  + ... -- e - x   (the correct solution to y'  = - y). 

example 2  solve d'y/dx2  = - y starting from y = 1 and y'  = 0 (the answer is cos x). 
solution  the equation gives y" = - 1(again at x = 0). the derivativeof the equation 
gives y'" = - y1= 0. then  = - y" = + 1. the even derivatives are alternately + 1 
and  -1, the odd derivatives are zero. this is matched by  a series of  even powers, 
which constructs cos x:

the first terms 1 - $x2 came earlier in the book. now we have the whole alternating 
series. it converges absolutely for all x,  by  comparison with  the  series for ex (odd 
powers are dropped). the partial sums in figure 10.4reach further and further before 
they lose touch with cos x.

the idea of matching derivatives by powers  is becoming central to this chapter. the 
derivatives are given at a basepoint (say x = 0). they are numbersf(o),f '(o), .... the

the  first terms  give  the linear and quadratic  approximations  that we know  well. the
x3  term was  mentioned earlier (but not used). now we have all the terms-an "infinite
approximation"  that is  intended to equalf(x).

two things  are needed.  first,  the series must converge.  second,  the function  must
do  what  the  series  predicts,  away  from  x = 0.  those  are  true  for  ex  and  cos x  and
sin x;  the series  equals  the  function.  we proceed  on  that  basis.

the taylor series  with  special  basepoint x =  0 is also called the "maclaurin series."

example 3  find the  taylor  series  for f(x) = sin x  around  x = 0.
solution  the  numbers f(")(0) are  the values  of f= sin x, f'  = cos x, f"  = - sin x,...
at  x = 0.  those  values are  0,  1, 0,  -1,  0,  1, .... all even  derivatives  are  zero.  to  find
the  coefficients  in  the taylor  series,  divide  by the  factorials:

second  derivative  is  5 . 4  .(1  + x)3 ,  so f "(0)= 5  4.  the  next  three  derivatives  are
5  . 4 * 3, 5 * 4 . 3 * 2,  5  . 4 . 3 * 2 * 1. after that all derivatives are zero. therefore  the taylor
series  stops after the xs term:

you  may recognize  1, 5, 10,  10,  5, 1. they  are  the binomial coefficients,  which  appear
in pascal's triangle  (section  2.2). by matching derivatives,  we see why 0!,  1!,  2!,  ... are
needed  in the denominators.
there  is  no  doubt  that  x = 0  is  the  nicest  basepoint.  but  taylor  series  can  be  con-
structed  around  other points  x = a. the  principle  is  the  same-match derivatives by
powers-but now  the powers  to  use are  (x - a)".  the  derivatives f("'(a) are computed
at  the  new  basepoint  x  = a.

the  taylor series begins with f(a) + f'(a)(x - a). this  is the  tangent  approximation
at  x =  a. the  whole  "infinite  approximation"  is  centered  at  a-at that  point  it  has
the  same  derivatives  as f(x).

example  5  find the  taylor  series  forf(x) = (1 + x)5  around  x = a = 1.
solution  at  x =  1,  the  function  is (1 + 1)'  =  32.  its  first  derivative  5(1  + x)4  is
5-16 =  80.  we compute  the nth derivative,  divide  by  n!,  and multiply  by  (x - 1)":

32 + 80(x - 1) + 80(x  - 1)2  + 40(x - 1)3 + 10(x - 1)4 + (x - 1)5.

that taylor series (which stops at n = 5) should agree with (1 + x)'.  it does. we could 
rewrite 1+ x as 2 + (x - i), and take its fifth power directly. then 32, 16, 8,4,2, 1 will 
multiply  the  usual  coefficients  1,.5,  10, 10, 5, 1  to  give  our  taylor  coefficients 
32, 80, 80,40, 10, 1. the series stops as it will stop for any polynomial-because 
the 
high derivatives are zero. 

example 6  find the taylor series for f(x) = ex around the basepoint  x = 1. 

solution  at  x = 1  the  function  and  all  its  derivatives  equal  e.  therefore  the 
taylor series has that constant factor (note the powers of  x - 1, not x): 

defining the  function by its  series 

usually, we  define sin x  and cos x  from the sides of  a  triangle.  but  we  could  start 
instead with the series. define sin x by  equation (2). the logic goes backward, but it 
is still correct: 

first, prove that the series converges. 
second, prove properties  like (sin x)' = cos x. 
third, connect the definitions by  series to the sides of  a triangle. 

we don't  plan  to do all this. the usual definition was good enough. but note first: 
there is no problem with convergence. the series for sin x and cos x and ex all have 
terms  fxn/n!. the factorials make the series converge for all x. the general rule for 
ex times  eycan  be  based  on  the  series.  equation  (6) is  typical:  e  is  multiplied  by 
powers  of  (x - 1). those powers add to ex-'.  so the  series proves  that  ex = eex-'. 
that is just  one example of  the multiplication  (ex)(ey) = ex+y: 

term by  term, multiplication  gives the series for ex+y. term by  term, differentiating 
the series for ex gives ex. term by  term, the derivative of  sin x is cos x: 

we don't  need the famous limit (sin x)/x -,1, by  which geometry gave us the deriva- 
tive. the identities of trigonometry become identities of infinite series. we could even 
define n as the first positive x at which x - i x 3  + .--equals zero. but it is certainly 
not obvious that this sine series returns to zero-much 
less that the point of  return 
is near 3.14. 
the function  that  will be  dejined by  injnite series is eie. this is the exponential  of 
the imaginary number i0 (a multiple of  i = fl).the result eib is a complex number, 
and our goal is to identify it. (we will be confirming section 9.4.) the technique is to 
treat  i0 like all other numbers, real or complex, and simply put it into the series: 
definition  eie is the sum of  1 + (i0)+ -(i0)2  + -(i0)3  + -.-. 
(9)
now  use  iz= - 1.  the  even  powers  are  i4= + 1,  i6 = - 1,  i8 = + 1, .... we  are 
just multiplying  - 1 by  - 1 to get  1. the odd powers are i3 = - i,  is = + i, .... there-

10.4  the taylor series for  d,sin x, and cos x 

fore eib splits into a real part (with no i's) and an imaginary part (multiplying i): 

you recognize those series. they are cos 8 and sin 8. therefore: 

euler's formula  is eie= cos 8 + i sin 8. note  that e2"' = 1. 

y = r sin 8 
eie= cos 0 + i sine  the real part is x = cos 8 and the imaginary part is y = sin 8. those coordinates pick 
out the point  eib in the "complex  plane."  its distance from the origin (0,o) is r = 1, 
because (cos 8)2 + (sin 8)2 = 1. its angle is  8, as shown in  figure 10.5. the number 
-1 is ei",  at the distance r = l  and the  angle n.  it is  on the real axis to the left  of 
zero. if eib is multiplied by  r = 2 or r =3 or any r 2 0, the result is a complex number 
at a distance r from the origin: 

complex numbers:  reib= r(cos 8 + i sin 8) = r cos 8 + ir sin 8 = x + iy. 

i  x=r'cose  1 -

with  eie, a  negative number  has  a  logarithm.  the  logarithm  of  - 1  
is  imaginary 
(it is in, since ei" = - 1). a  negative number  also has fractional powers. the fourth 
root  of  -1 is (- l)'i4 = eini4. more important  for  calculus: the derivative of  x5i4 is 
$x1i4. that sounds old and familiar, but at x = - 1 it was never allowed. 

complex numbers tie up the loose ends left by the limitations of real numbers. 
the formula eie = cos 8 + i sin 8 has been  called "one  of  the greatest mysteries of 
undergraduate mathematics."  writers have used desperate methods to avoid infinite 
series. that proof  in (10) may be  the clearest (i remember sending it  to a  prisoner 
studying calculus) but here is a way to start from d/dx(eix) = ieix. 
a diferent  proof  of  euler'sformula  any complex number is eix = r(cos 8 + i sin 8) 

for some r and 8. take the x derivative of  both sides, and substitute for ieix: 
(cos 8 + i sin b)dr/dx + r(-  sin 8 + i cos b)d8/dx = ir(cos 8 + i sin 9). 

comparing  the  real  parts  and  also  the  imaginary  parts,  we  need  drldx = 0  and 
d8/dx = 1. the starting values r = 1 and 8 =0 are known from eio = 1. therefore r is 
always 1 and 8 is x. substituting into the first sentence of  the proof, we  have euler's 
formula eie = l(cos 8 + i sin 8).

10.5  power series

10.5  power  series

this  section studies  the properties  of a power series.  when  the basepoint  is  zero,  the
anx". when  the  basepoint  is  x = a,  the  powers  are
powers  are  x".  the  series  is 
(x - a)".  we  want  to  know  when  and where  (and how  quickly)  the series  converges
to  the  underlying  function.  for  ex  and cos  x  and  sin x  there  is  convergence  for  all
x-but  that  is  certainly  not  true  for  1/(1  - x).  the  convergence  is  best  when  the
function  is  smooth.

first i emphasize  that power  series are  not  the only series.  for many  applications
they  are not  the best choice.  an  alternative is  a sum  of sines, f(x) =  b, sin nx. that
is a "fourier sine series", which  treats all x's equally instead  of picking on a basepoint.
a fourier  series  allows jumps and  corners  in the graph-it takes  the rough  with  the
smooth.  by contrast  a  power  series  is  terrific  near  its  basepoint,  and  gets  worse  as
you  move  away.  the  taylor  coefficients  an  are  totally  determined  at  the  base-
point-where all  derivatives are  computed.  remember  the rule  for taylor  series:

an =  (nth  derivative  at the  basepoint)/n! =f(")(a)/n! 

(1)

a  remarkable  fact is  the  convergence  in  a symmetric  interval around x = a.

40m  a power  series  zax" either  converges  for  all  x,  or it  converges  only  at
the basepoint  x =0,  or else it  has  a radius of convergence r:

ylax" converges absolutely if lxl < r and diverges if xi > r.

the  series  ix"/n! converges  for all  x  (the sum  is  ex).  the  series  in!x" converges  for
no  x  (except  x = 0).  the  geometric  series  ex" converges  absolutely  for  ixl <  1 and
diverges  for  ixl >  1. its  radius of convergence is  r =  1. note  that its  sum  1/(1  - x)  is
perfectly  good  for  ix >  1-the function  is  all  right  but  the  series  has  given  up.  if
something  goes  wrong  at  the distance  r, a  power  series  can't get  past  that point.

when  the  basepoint  is  x = a, the interval  of convergence  shifts  over  to  ix - al < r.
the  series  converges for  x between  a - r and  a + r (symmetric  around  a). we cannot
say  in advance  whether  the endpoints  a + r give  divergence  or convergence  (absolute
or  conditional).  inside the  interval,  an  easy  comparison  test  will  now  prove  con-
vergence.
proof of  10m  suppose  ya,x" converges  at a particular  point  x. the  proof will
show  that ia,x" converges  when  ixi is  less  than  the number  ixi.  thus  convergence
at x gives convergence  at all closer points x (i mean closer  to the basepoint  0).  proof:
since i  anx" converges,  its  terms  approach  zero.  eventually  lanx"i <  1 and  then

iaxnl  =  iax"i ix/lx  <  ix/xi".

our  series  i a,x" is  absolutely  convergent  by comparison  with  the  geometric  series
for  ix/xi,  which  converges  since  ix/xi <  1.

example  1  the  series  inx"/4" has radius  of convergence  r = 4.
the  ratio test  and root test  are best for power series.  the  ratios  between  terms
approach  x/4 (and so  does  the nth  root  of nx"/4"):

(n + 1)x"+'  inx"

the  ratio  test  gives  convergence  if l <  1, which  means  ixl < 4.

has  r = co  (it converges  everywhere).

the  ratio  of xn+ 2/(n  + 2)!  to  x"/n! is  x2/(n  + 2)(n  + 1).  this  approaches  l = 0.

example  3  the  series  i(x - 5)"/n 2  has  radius  r =  1 around its basepoint a =  5.
the  ratios  between  terms  approach  l = x - 5. (the  fractions  n2/(n  +  1)2  go  toward
1.)  there is absolute  convergence  if ix - 51  < 1. this is the interval  4 < x < 6, symmet-
ric  around  the  basepoint.  this  series  happens  to converge  at  the endpoints  4  and 6,
because  of the factor  1/n2. that factor decides  the delicate question-convergence  at
the  endpoints-but  all powers  of  n  give  the  same  interval of convergence  4 <  x < 6.

convergence  to  the  function:  remainder  term  and  radius  r

remember  that  a  taylor  series  starts  with  a  function f(x).  the  derivatives  at  the
basepoint  produce  the  series.  suppose  the  series  converges:  does  it  converge  to
the function? this  is  a  question  about  the  remainder r,(x) =f(x) - sn(x),  which  is  the
difference  between f  and  the  partial  sum  s,  = ao +  " + an(x - a)".  the  remainder rn
is the error if  we  stop  the  series, ending  with  the  nth derivative  term  a,(x - a)".

10n  suppose f has an (n + 1)st  derivative from the basepoint  a out to x. then
for some  point  c  in  between  (position not  known) the  remainder  at  x  equals

r,(x) = f(x) - s,(x) = f("+  1)(c)(x - a)" + '/(n +  1)! 

(2)

the error  in  stopping at  the  nth derivative  is  controlled  by  the  (n + 1)st  derivative.
you  will  guess,  correctly,  that  the  unknown  point  c comes  from  the  mean  value
theorem.  for  n =  1 the proof is  at  the end of section  3.8.  that was  the  error e(x)  in
linear approximation:

r1(x) = f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a) =  f  "(c)(x - a)2.

for  every  n,  the  proof  compares  rn  with  (x - a)" +1. their  (n +  1)st  derivatives  are
f(n+  ') and  (n  +  1)!  the  generalized  mean  value  theorem  says  that the  ratio  of r, to
(x - a)" +  equals  the  ratio  of those  derivatives,  at the  right  point c.  that  is equation
(2).  the  details  can  stay  in  section  3.8  and  problem  23,  because  the  main  point  is
what  we  want.  the  error is  exactly  like  the next term  a, +  (x - a)" +1, except  that the
(n +  1)st  derivative  is  at c  instead  of the  basepoint  a.

example  4  whenf is  ex,  the  (n  + 1)st  derivative  is  ex.  therefore  the  error  is

rn=ex  -  1  +x+  ...  + -

" 

= ec 

n!  =  (n + 1)!*

(3)

at  x = 1  and  n =  2,  the  error  is  e -
.218.  the  right  side  is  ec/6.  the
unknown  point is  c = in (.218 - 6) = .27.  thus c  lies  between  the  basepoint  a = 0 and
the  error  point  x  = 1, as  required.  the  series  converges  to  the  function,  because
r, - 0.

(1 +  1 +  ) 

in  practice,  n  is  the  number  of derivatives  to  be  calculated.  we  may  aim  for  an
error  irn, below  10- 6. unfortunately,  the  high  derivative  in  formula  (2)  is  awkward
to estimate (except for ex).  and high derivatives  in formula (1) are difficult to  compute.
most  real calculations  use  only afew terms of a  taylor  series.  for more  accuracy  we
move  the  basepoint  closer,  or  switch  to  another  series.

10.5  power serles 

there is a direct connection between  the function and the convergence radius r. 
a  hint  came for f(x) = 1/(1-  x). the function blows up  at x = 1-which 
also ends 
the convergence interval for the series. another hint comes for f = llx, if  we  expand 
around x = a = 1: 

this geometric series converges for  11 - xi< 1. convergence stops at the end point 
x = 0-exactly  where  llx blows up.  the failure  of the function  stops the convergence 
of the series. but note that  1/(1+ x2), which never seems to fail, also has convergence 
radius r = 1: 

1/(1+ x2) = 1 - x2 + x4 - x6 + 

converges only for 1x1 < 1. 

when you see the reason, you  will know why  r is a "radius."  there is a circle, and 
the function fails at the edge of  the circle. the circle contains complex numbers as 
well  as real numbers. the imaginary points  i and  - i are at the edge of  the circle. 
the function fails  at those points  because  l/(l + i2)= co. 
complex numbers are pulling the strings, out of  sight. the circle of  convergence 
reaches out to the nearest "singularity"  of f(x),  real or imaginary or complex. for 
1/(1+ x2), the singularities at i and  -i make r = 1. if  we  expand around a = 3, the 
if  we  change  to  in (1 + x),  which  blows  up  at 
distance  to  i  and  - i  is  r = ,/%. 
x =   - 1, the radius of  convergence of  x - $x2 + gx3- .-    is r = 1.

the  binomial series 

we close this chapter with one more series. it is the taylor series for (1 + x ) ~ ,around 
the basepoint x  = 0. a typical power is p =3, where we  want the terms in 

jk=1 + f x + a 2 x 2 +  e m - .  

the slow way  is to square both  sides, which  gives  1 + x + (2a2+ $)x2 on the right. 
since  1 + x is on the left, a2 = -& is  needed  to remove the x2 term.  eventually a, 
can be found. the fast way is to match the derivatives off =(1 + x)'i2: 

at  x = 0 those derivatives are 4,-i,8. dividing by  i!,  2!,  3! gives 

these are the binomial coeficients when  the power is p = 4. 
notice the difference from the binomials in chapter 2. for those, the power p was 
a positive integer. the series (1 + x ) ~= 1 + 2x + x2 stopped at x2. the coefficients for 
p = 2 were 1,2, 1,0,0,0, . . . . for fractional p or negative p those later coefficients are 
not zero, and we  find them from the derivatives of (1 + x ) ~ :  

dividing by  o!,  i!, 2!,  . . . , n!  at x = 0, the binomial coefficients are 

for p = n that last binomial coefficient is n!/n!  = 1. it gives the final xn at the end of 
(1 + x)". for other values of p, the binomial series never stops. it converges for  1x1< 1: 

when p = 1,2, 3, . .. the binomial coeflcient p!/n!(n - p)!  counts the number of ways 
to select a group  of n friends  out of a group  of p friends.  if  you have 20 friends, you 
can choose 2 of  them in (20)(19)/2 = 190 ways. 

suppose p is  not  a  positive integer. what  goes wrong with  (1 + x ) ~ ,to stop the 
convergence at 1x1 = l? the failure is at x = -1. if  p is negative, (1 + x ) ~  
blows up. 
if  p is positive,  as in ,/=, 
the  higher  derivatives blow  up.  only for  a  positive 
integer p = n does the convergence radius move out to r = go. in that case the series 
for (1 + x)" stops at xn, and f never fails. 

a power series is a function in a new form. it is not a simple form, but sometimes 
it is the only form. to compute f we  have to sum the series. to square f we  have to 
multiply series. but the operations of calculus-derivative  and integral-are  easier. 
that explains why  power series help to solve differential equations, which are a rich 
source of  new  functions. (numerically the series are not  always so good.) i should 
have said that the derivative and integral are easy for  each separate term anxn-and 
fortunately the convergence radius of  the whole series is not changed. 

iff (x) = xanxnhas convergence radius r, so do its derivative and its integral: 
df/dx  = c nanxn- '  and  if (x)dx= z anxn '/(n + 1) also converge for 1x1 < r. 

+

example 5  the  series for  1/(1 - x)  and  its  derivative  1/(1 - x ) ~and  its  integral 
- ln(1 - x) all have r = 1 (because they all have trouble at x = 1). the series are exn 
and enxn-'  and cxn+'/(n + 1). 
example 6  we can integrate ex' (previously impossible) by  integrating every term 
in its series: 

this always converges (r = a).the derivative of  ex'  was never a problem.

this chapter opens up a new part of  calculus. it is multidimensional calculus, because 
the  subject  moves  into  more  dimensions. in  the  first  ten  chapters,  all  functions 
depended on time  t or position x-but  not  both.  we  had f(t) or y(x). the graphs 
were curves in a plane. there was one independent variable (x or t) and one dependent 
variable (y or f). now we meet functions f(x, t) that depend on both x and t. their 
graphs are surfaces instead of curves. this brings us to the calculus of several variables. 
start with  the  surface that  represents the function f(x, t) or f(x, y)  or f(x, y,,t). i 

emphasize functions, because that is what calculus is about. 

example 1  f(x, t) = cos (x - t) is a traveling wave (cosine curve in motion). 
at  t = 0 the  curve  is f = cos x.  at  a  later  time,  the  curve  moves  to  the  right 
(figure 11.1). at  each t we  get  a cross-section of  the whole x-t surface. for a wave 
traveling along a string, the height depends on position as well as time. 

a similar function gives a wave going around a stadium. each person stands up 

and sits down. somehow the wave travels. 
example 2  f(x, y) = 3x + y + 1 is a sloping roof (fixed in time). 
the  surface  is  two-dimensional-you 
can  walk  around  on  it.  it  is  flat  because 
3x + y + 1 is  a linear  function. in  the y direction  the  surface goes  up  at 45".  if  y 
increases by  1, so does f. that slope is 1. in the x direction the roof is steeper (slope 3). 
there is a direction in between where the roof is steepest (slope fi). 
example 3  f(x, y, t) = cos(x - y - t) is an ocean surface with traveling waves. 
this  surface moves.  at  each  time  t  we  have  a  new  x-y  surface.  there  are  three 
variables, x and y for position and t for time. i can't  draw the function, it needs four 
dimensions! the base coordinates are x, y, t and the height is f. the alternative is a 
movie that shows the x-y surface changing with t. 

at  time t = 0 the ocean surface is given by  cos (x - y).  the waves  are in straight 
lines. the line x - y = 0 follows a crest because cos 0= 1. the top of  the next wave 
is on the parallel line x - y = 2n, because cos 2n = 1. figure 11.1 shows the ocean 
surface at a fixed time. 

the line x - y = t gives the crest at time t. the water goes up and down (like people 

in a stadium). the wave goes to shore, but  the water stays in the ocean.

fig. 11.1  moving  cosine  with  a  small  optical  illusion-the 

darker 

bands  seem  to  go from top to bottom as you  turn. 

fig. 11.2  linear functions give planes. 

of course multidimensional calculus is not only for waves. in business, demand is 
a function of  price and date. in engineering, the velocity and temperature depend on 
position  x  and  time  t .  biology deals with  many  variables  at once  (and statistics is 
always looking for linear relations like z = x + 2y). a serious job lies ahead, to carry 
derivatives  and integrals into more dimensions. 

in a  plane, every point  is described  by  two numbers.  we measure across by  x and 
up by  y.  starting from  the origin  we  reach  the point  with coordinates  (x, y). i want 
to describe this movement by a vector-the 
straight line that starts at (0,o) and ends 
at (x, y). this  vector  v  has a  direction,  which  goes from  (0,o) to  (x, y) and  not  the 
other way. 

in  a  picture,  the  vector  is  shown  by  an  arrow.  in  algebra,  v  is  given  by  its  two 

components. for a column vector, write x above y: 

v = [,i (x and y  are the components of  v). 

note  that  v  is  printed  in  boldface;  its  components  x  and  y  are  in  lightface.?  the 
vector  - v   in  the  opposite  direction  changes  signs. adding  v  to  - v   gives the  zero 
vector (different from  the zero number and also in  boldface): 

]=[:i


and 

v v = [  

x - x  

y - y  

- 0 .

notice how  vector  addition or subtraction is done separately on the x's  and y's: 

?another  way  to indicate a vector  is 2 you will  recognize vectors without  needing arrows. 

1 1 .i vectors and dot products 

fig. 11.3  parallelogram for v + w,  stretching for 2v,  signs reversed for  -v. 

the vector v has components v ,  = 3  and v, = 1. (i  write  v, for the first  component 
and v,  for the second component.  i  also  write  x  and y,  which  is fine for two com- 
ponents.) the vector w has w ,  = - 1 and w,  = 2. to add the vectors, add the com- 
ponents.  to draw this addition, place  the start of w at the end of v.  figure 11.3 shows 
how w starts where v ends. 

vectors without  coordinates 

in that head-to-tail addition of v + w, we did something new. the vector w was moved 
away from the origin.  its length and direction  were not changed! the new arrow is 
parallel to the old arrow-only 
the starting point is different.  the vector is the same 
as before. 

a vector can be defined without an origin and without x and y axes. the purpose 
separate distances x  and y.  those numbers 
of  axes is to give the components-the 
are necessary  for calculations.  but  x and y coordinates are not  necessary  for head- 
to-tail  addition  v + w,  or for  stretching to 2v,  or for  linear  combinations  2v + 3w. 
some applications depend on coordinates, others don't. 

generally speaking, physics works without axes-it 

is "coordinate-free."  a velocity 
has direction and magnitude, but it is not tied  to a point. a force  also has direction 
and magnitude, but it can act anywhere-not 
only at the origin. in contrast, a vector 
that  gives  the  prices  of  five  stocks is  not  floating in  space.  each  component  has  a 
meaning-there 
are five  axes,  and  we  know  when  prices  are zero.  after  examples 
from geometry and physics (no axes), we  return  to vectors with coordinates. 

example 1 
(geometry) take any four-sided  figure in space. connect the midpoints 
of the four straight sides. remarkable fact:  those four  midpoints lie in the same plane. 
more than that, they form  a parallelogram. 

frankly, this is amazing. figure 1 1.4a cannot do justice  to the problem, because it 
is printed  on a flat page. imagine the vectors a and d  coming upward. b and c go 
down at different angles. notice how easily we indicate the four sides as vectors, not 
caring about axes or origin. 

i will prove that v = w. that shows that the midpoints form a parallelogram. 
what is v? it starts halfway along a and ends halfway along b. the small triangle 
at the bottom  shows v = $a + 3b. this is vector  addition-the 
tail  of  3b is at the 
head of 4a. together they equal the shortcut v.  for the same reason w = 3c + 3d. 
the heart of  the proof  is to see these relationships. 
one step is left. why is +a + 3b equal to $c + i d ?  in other words,  why is a + b 
equal to c + d? (i multiplied  by  2.)  when  the  right  question  is  asked,  the  answer 
jumps  out. a head-to-tail  addition a + b brings us to the point r. also c + d brings 
us to r. the proof  comes down to one line: 

a + b =  p r = c + d .  then v=+a+$bequals  w = + c + + d .  

11  vectors and matrices 

fig. 11.4  four midpoints form a parallelogram (v = w). three medians meet  at p. 

example 2 
(also  geometry) in  any  triangle,  draw  lines  from  the  corners  to  the 
midpoints of the opposite sides. to prove by vectors: those three lines meet at a point. 
problem 38  finds the meeting  point  in  figure 11 . 4 ~ .problem 37 says that  the  three 
vectors add to zero. 

example 3 
(medicine) an electrocardiogram shows the sum of many small vectors, 
the  voltages  in  the wall  of  the heart.  what  happens  to  this  sum-the  heart  vector 
v-in 

two cases that a cardiologist is watching for? 
case 1 .   part of  the heart is dead (infarction). 
case 2.  part  of  the heart is abnormally  thick  (hypertrophy). 

a heart attack kills part of  the muscle. a defective valve, or hypertension, overworks 
it. in case 1the cells die from the cutoff of  blood (loss of  oxygen). in case 2 the heart 
wall can triple in size, from excess pressure. the causes can be chemical or mechanical. 
the effect we  see is electrical. 

the machine is adding small vectors and bbprojecting" them in twelve directions. the 
leads on the arms, left leg, and chest give twelve directions in the body.  each graph 
shows  the  component  of  v in  one  of  those  directions.  three  of  the  projections- 
two in the vertical plane, plus lead 2 for front-back-produce 
the "mean  qrs vector" 
in  figure  11.5. that  is  the  sum  v  when  the  ventricles  start  to  contract.  the  left 
ventricle is larger, so the heart  vector  normally points down and to the left. 

pace 
sa 

fig. 11.5  v  is  a  sum of  small voltage  vectors,  at the moment of  depolarization. 

1i.i  vectors and dot products 

fig. 11.6  changes in v  show dead muscle  and overworked muscle. 

we  come  soon to projections,  but  here  the  question  is about v  itself. how does 

the ecci  identify the problem? 

case 1: heart attack the dead cells make no contribution to the electri- 
cid  potential.  some  small  vectors  are  missing.  therefore  the  sum  v 
turns away from the infarcted  part. 
chse 2:  hypertrophy  the  overwork  increases  the  contribution  to the 
potential.  some  vectors  are  larger  than  normal.  therefore  v  turns 
toward the thickened  part. 

when v  points in an abnormal direction, the ecg graphs locate the problem.  the 
p,  q,  r, s,  t waves  on  separate  graphs  can  all  indicate  hypertrophy,  in  different 
regions of  the heart. infarctions generally occur in the left ventricle, which needs the 
greatest  blood  supply. when  the supply of  oxygen is cut back, that  ventricle feels it 
first. the result can be a heart attack (= myocardial infarction = coronary occlusion). 
section 11.2 shows how  the projections on the ecg point to the location. 

first come the basic facts about vectors-components, 

lengths, and dot products. 

coordinate vectors and  length 

to compute with  vectors  we  need  axes and  coordinates.  the picture  of  the heart  is 
"coordinate-free,"  but calculations require numbers. a vector is known by its compo- 
nents.  the unit  vectors along the axes are  i  and j in the plane  and i, j,  k  in space: 

notice h~ow easily we  moved into three dimensions! the only change is that  vectors 
have three components.  the combinations of  i  and j (or i, j, k) produce all vectors v 
in the plane  (and all vectors  v  in space):

s11  vectors  and  matrices

those vectors are also written v = (3, 1) andv = (1, 2,  - 2). the components of the vector
are also the coordinates  of a point. (the vector goes from the origin to the point.) this
relation  between  point  and vector  is  so close  that we  allow  them the  same notation:
p = (x, y, z) and v = (x, y,  z) = xi + yj  + zk.

the  sum v + v  is  totally meaningless.  those  vectors  live  in different  dimensions.
32 + 12  =  10.
from  the components  we find  the length. the length  of (3, 1) is 
this  comes  directly  from  a  right  triangle.  in  three  dimensions,  v has  a third  com-
x 2  + y2  + z2.
ponent  to  be  squared  and added.  the length  of v = (x, y,  z) is  ivi  = 
vertical bars indicate length, which  takes  the  place  of absolute  value.  the  length

of v =  3i + j is the distance  from  the point  (0, 0) to the point  (3, 1):

ivi = 

v+  v=  /10 

ivl  = 

12+  22 + (-2)2 = 3.

a unit vector  is  a vector  of length  one.  dividing v and  v by  their  lengths  produces
unit vectors  in the  same directions:

1/3
l-2/3

iva 
each  nonzero  vector  has a positive  length  vj.  the direction  of v is given

s 
by a  unit  vector  u = v/lvi.  then  length times  direction  equals  v.

a unit  vector in  the plane  is  determined  by  its  angle  0  with  the  x  axis:

u= 

sin ] = (cos 0)i + (sin 0)j  is  a unit vector:  lu12 = cos 20  + sin 20 =  1.

lsino]

in  3-space  the  components  of a unit  vector  are  its  "direction  cosines":

u = (cos a)i + (cos l)j + (cos  y)k:  o, fl,  y = angles  with  x, y,  z axes.

then  cos 2a + cos 2f  + cos 2 y =  1. we  are  doing  algebra  with  numbers  while  we  are
doing  geometry  with  vectors.  it was  the great  contribution  of descartes  to see  how
to  study algebra  and  geometry  at the  same  time.

the  dot  product  of  two  vectors

there  are  two  basic  operations  on  vectors.  first,  vectors  are  added  (v + w).  second,
a vector is multiplied  by  a scalar (7v  or  - 2w).  that leaves  a  natural  question-how
do  you  multiply  two  vectors?  the  main  part  of the  answer is-you  don't. but  there

is  an  extremely  important  operation  that  begins  with  two  vectors  and  produces  a
number.  it is usually indicated  by a dot between  the vectors,  as in v - w, so it is  called
the  dot product.

definition  i  the  dot product multiplies the lengths ivl  times  iwl  times a cosine:

v * w = iv iwli  cos  0,  0 = angle  between  v and  w.

example  i0has length  3,  2ihas length  /8,  the angle  is  45.

the  dot  product  is  ivl  |wl  cos  0 = (3)( 
), which  simplifies  to  6.  the  square
roots in the lengths are "canceled"  by square roots in the cosine. for computing  v . w,
a second  and much  simpler way  involves  no  square  roots  in the  first  place.

)(1/ 

definition  2  the dot product v * w multiplies component by  component and adds:

v*w  =  v1w 1 +  v2 w 2

s  =(3)(2 

)+(0)(2)=6.

the first  form ivl  iwl  cos  0  is coordinate-free.  the  second  form vlw,  + v2w2  computes
with  coordinates.  remark 4 explains  why  these  two  forms are  equal.

i4b  the  dot product  or scalar product  or  inner product  of  three-dimensional
vectors  is

v * w=viwi  cos  =  v1  1 +  v2 w2+ v 3w 3.

if the vectors  are  perpendicular  then  0 = 90  and  cos  6 = 0  and  v  w = 0.

these  dot  products  32  and  0  equal  ivi  iwi  cos 0. in  the  second  one,  cos  0  must  be
zero.  the  angle  is 7n/2  or  - n/2-in either case  a right angle.  fortunately  the cosine
is  the same  for  0 and  - 0, so  we need  not  decide  the  sign of 0.
remark 1  when  v = w  the angle  is zero  but not  the cosine!  in this  case  cos  0 =  1
and  v . v =  ivl2. the  dot product of v  with  itself is the length squared:
v2 =  iv2

v.v= (v,  v2, v3)(vi,  v2, v3) =  v+  v+ 

remark  2  the  dot  product  of i = (1, 0, 0) with  j = (0,  1, 0)  is  i  j = 0.  the  axes  are
perpendicular.  similarly  i -k = 0  and j . k = 0.  those  are  unit  vectors:  i  i= j  =j
k-k= 1.

remark 3  the  dot  product  has three  properties  that  keep  the algebra  simple:

1.  v-w=  wv

2. (cv).  w = c(v.  w)

3.  (u+v).w= uw+v.w

when  v is  doubled  (c =  2) the  dot  product  is  doubled.  when  v  is  split  into  i, j, k
components,  the  dot  product  splits  in  three  pieces.  the  same  applies  to  w,  since

fig. 11.8  length squared = (v - w)  (v - w), from coordinates and the cosine law. 

v  w = w  v. the nine dot products of i, j, k are zeros and ones, and a giant splitting 
of  both v and w gives back  the correct v  w: 

remark 4  the two forms  of the dot product  are equal. this comes from computing 
iv  - wi2 by coordinates and also by the "law  of cosines": 

with coordinates:  iv  - wi2 = (vl - wl)2 + (v2 - w2)2 + (v3 - w3)2 
from cosine law:  iv  - wi2 = iv12 + iwi2 - 21vi  iwi  cos 8. 

compare those  two lines.  line  1 contains  v:  and  v:  and  v:.  their  sum matches 
iv12 in the cosine law. also w:  + w:  + w:  matches iwi2. therefore the terms contain- 
ing  - 2 are the same (you can mentally cancel the  - 2).  the definitions agree: 
- 2(v1 wl + v2 w2 + v3 w3) equals  - 21vi  iwi  cos 8 equals  - 2v  w. 

the cosine law is coordinate-free.  it applies  to all triangles  (even in  n dimensions). 
its vector form in figure 11.8 is iv  - wi2 = lv12 - 2v  w + iwi2. this application to 
v  w is its brief  moment of  glory. 

remark 5  the dot product is the best way  to compute the cosine of  8: 

cos 8 = - 

vow 
ivl  lwl ' 

here are examples of  v and w with a range of  angles from 0 to n: 

i and 3i have the same direction 
i  (i + j) = 1 is positive 
i and j are perpendicular: i  j = 0 
i.(-i+  j)=  - 1 is negative 
i and  - 3i have opposite directions  cos 8 = - 1 

cos 8 = 1 
c o s b = l / &  
cos 8 = 0 
cos 8 = - 1 / f i   8 = 3 4 4  

8 = 0  
8 = n / 4  
8 = 7112 

8 = n  

remark 6  the cauchy-schwarz inequality iv  wi < ivi i wi  comes from  lcos 81 < 1. 
the  left  side is  ivi  iwi  lcos 81.  it  never  exceeds  the  right  side  ivi  iwi.  this  is  a  key 
inequality  in mathematics, from which so many others follow: 
geometric mean f i  < arithmetic mean  &x + y) 
(true for any x 3 0 and y 3 0). 
triangle inequality iv + w i  < ivi  + i wi 
( (vi, iwi,  iv  + wi  are lengths of  sides). 
these  and  other  examples  are  in  problems  39  to  44.  the  schwarz  inequality 
iv  wi  < ivi  iw( becomes an equality when  lcos 81  = 1 and the vectors are 
.

11.2  planes and projections 

the most  important  "curves"  are straight  lines. the most  important  functions are 
linear.  those  sentences take  us  back  to  the  beginning  of  the  book-the 
graph  of 
mx + b is  a line. the goal now  is  to move into three dimensions,  where graphs  are 
surfaces.  eventually  the  surfaces  will  be  curved.  but  calculus  starts  with  the  flat 
surfaces that correspond to straight lines: 

what are the most important surfaces? planes. 
what are the most important functions? still linear. 

the geometrical idea of  a plane  is  turned  into algebra, by  finding the equation of a 
plane.  not just  a general formula, but  the particular equation  of  a particular  plane. 
a line is determined by one point (x,,  yo) and the slope m. the point-slope equation 
is y - yo = m(x - x,).  that is a linear equation, it is satisfied when y = yo and x = xo, 
and dyldx is m.  for a plane,  we  start again with a particular  point-which 
is now 
(x, ,yo, i:,).  but  the  slope of  a  plane  is not  so simple. many  planes  climb  at  a  45" 
angle-with 

"slope  1"-and  more information is needed. 

the direction of  a plane is described by a vector n. the vector is not in the plane, 
but perpmdicular to the plane. in the plane, there are many directions.  perpendicular 
to the plane,  there is only one direction. a  vector in that perpendicular direction is 
a normal vector. 

the normal vector n can point "up"  or "down".  the length of n is not crucial (we 
often make it a unit vector and call it n). knowing n and the point po = (x,,  yo, z,), 
we  know the plane (figure 11.9). for its equation  we  switch to algebra and use the 
dot product-which 
n  is  described  by  its components (a, b, c). in  other words  n  is ai + bj + ck. this 
vector is perpendicular  to every  direction in the plane.  a  typical  direction goes from 

is the key to perpendicularity.

po to another point p = (x, y, z) in the plane. the vector from po to p has components 
(x - xo, y - yo, z - z,).  this vector lies in the plane, so its dot product with n  is zero: 

116  the plane through po perpendicular  to n = (a, b, c) has the equation 

(a, b,c)*(x-xo,  y-yo,  z-zo)  = o  
4x-x0)  + qy-yo)+  c(z-zo)=  0. 

or 

(1) 
the point p lies on the plane when its coordinates x, y, z satisfy this equation. 

example 1  the plane  through  po = (1,2,3) perpendicular  to n = (1, 1, 1) has  the 
equation (x - 1) + (y - 2) + (z - 3) = 0. that can be rewritten as x + y + z = 6. 

notice three things. first, po lies on the plane because  1 + 2 + 3 = 6. second, n = 
(1, 1, 1) can be recognized from the x, y, z coefficients in x + y + z = 6. third, we could 
change n to (2,2,2) and we could change po to (8,2, - 4)-because  n is still perpen- 
dicular and po is still in the plane:  8 + 2 - 4 = 6. 
the  new  normal  vector  n = (2,2,2) produces  2(x - 1) + 2(y - 2) + 2(z - 3) = 0. 
that can be rewritten as 2x + 2y + 22 = 12. same normal direction, same plane. 
the  new  point  po = (8, 2,  - 4)  produces  (x - 8) + (y - 2) + (z + 4) = 0.  that  is 
another form of x + y + z = 6. all  we  require is a perpendicular n and a point  po in 
the plane. 

example 2  the plane  through  (1,2,4) with  the  same n = (1, 1, 1) has  a  different 
equation:  (x - 1) + (y - 2) + (z - 4) = 0.  this  is  x + y + z = 7  (instead  of  6).  these 
planes  with 7 and 6 are parallel. 

starting from  a(x - x,)  + b(y  - yo) + c(z - 2,)  = 0, we  often  move  ax,  + by,  + cz, 

to the right hand  side-and 

call this constant d: 

1 i d   with the po terms on the right side, the equation of the plane is n  p = d: 
(2) 

a x + b y + c z = a x o +  byo+czo=d. 

a different d gives a puraile1 plane; d = 0 gives a plane  throzcgh the origin. 

example 3  the plane  x - y + 3z = 0 goes through  the origin  (0, 0, 0). the normal 
vector is read directly from the equation: n = (1,  - 1, 3). the equation is satisfied by 
po = (1, 1,o) and  p = (l,4, 1). subtraction gives a  vector  v = (0, 3, 1) that  is  in  the 
plane, and n  v = 0. 
the parallel  planes x - y + 32 = d have the same n but different d's.  these planes 
miss  the origin  because  d is not  zero (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 on the left  side needs d = 0 
on  the  right  side). note  that  3x - 3y + 9z = - 15 is  parallel  to  both  planes.  n  is 
changed to 3n in figure  11.9, but its direction is not  changed. 

example 4  the angle between two planes  is the angle between their normal vectors. 
the  planes  x - y + 3z = 0  and  3y + z  = 0  are  perpendicular,  because  (1, - 1, 3) 
(0, 3, 1) = 0.  the  planes  z = 0  and  y = 0  are  also  perpendicular,  because  (o,0, 1) 
(0, 1,o) = 0.  (those are  the  xy  plane  and  the  xz  plane.) the  planes  x + y = 0  and 
x + z = o m a k e a 6 0     angle, becausecos60  =(l, 1,0)*(1,0, l)/dfi=+. 

the cosine of  the angle between two planes is in,  n,i/in,i in,i.  see figure 11.10.

fig.  11.10  angle  between  planes = angle  between  normals.  parallel  and  perpendicular  to  a

line.  a line  in space through p0  and q.

remark  1  we  gave the  "point-slope"  equation  of a  line  (using m),  and  the  "point-
normal"  equation  of a  plane  (using  n).  what is  the  normal  vector n  to  a  line?

the  vector  v = (1, m)  is  parallel  to  the  line  y =  mx + b.  the  line  goes  across  by  1
and  up  by  m.  the  perpendicular vector  is  n = (-  m,  1).  the  dot  product  n  v  is
- m +  m = 0.  then  the  point-normal  equation  matches  the point-slope  equation:

- m(x  - x0 ) +  1(y - yo)  = 0  is the  same  as  y - yo  = m(x  - xo). 

(3)

remark 2  what  is  the  point-slope  equation  for  a  plane?  the  difficulty  is  that  a
in  the  x  and  y  directions.  the  function  f(x, y)=
plane  has  different  slopes 
m(x  - x0) + m(y  - yo)  has  two  derivatives m  and  m.

this  remark  has  to  stop.  in  chapter  13,  "slopes"  become  "partial derivatives."

a  line  in space

in  three  dimensions,  a  line  is  not  as  simple  as  a  plane.  a  line  in  space needs  two
equations. each equation  gives  a  plane,  and  the  line  is  the  intersection of two planes.

the  equations x + y  + z  = 3 and 2x + 3y + z = 6  determine a line.

two  points on  that line are  p0  = (1, 1, 1) and q = (3, 0, 0).  they satisfy  both equations
so  they lie on  both planes.  therefore  they are  on the  line of intersection. the direction
of that line,  subtracting  coordinates  of p0  from  q, is  along  the  vector v  = 2i - j - k.

the  line goes  through p0  = (1, 1, 1) in the direction of v = 2i - j - k.

starting from  (xo,  yo,  zo)  = (1, 1, 1),  add on  any  multiple  tv.  then  x =  1 + 2t  and
y= 1 -
t.  those  are 
the  components  of  the  vector  equation
p = p0  + tv-which  produces  the  line.

t  and  z =  1 -

here  is  the  problem.  the  line  needs  two  equations-or  a  vector  equation  with  a
parameter t. neither  form  is  as  simple  as  ax + by  + cz = d.  some  books  push  ahead
anyway,  to  give  full  details  about  both  forms.  after  trying  this  approach,  i  believe
that  those  details  should  wait.  equations  with  parameters  are  the  subject  of
chapter  12,  and  a  line  in  space  is  the  first  example.  vectors  and  planes  give  plenty
to  do  here-especially  when  a  vector  is  projected  onto  another  vector  or  a  plane.

projection  of  a vector

what is  the projection  of a  vector  b onto another  vector  a?  one part  of b  goes along
a-that is the  projection. the other part of b is perpendicular to a. we now  compute
these  two  parts,  which  are  p and  b - p.

s11  vectors and  matrices

in  geometry,  projections  involve  cos 0.  in  algebra,  we  use the  dot product  (which
is  closely tied to cos 0).  in applications,  the vector  b might  be  a velocity v or  a force
f:

an  airplane  flies  northeast,  and  a  100-mile  per  hour  wind  blows  due
east.  what  is  the projection  of v = (100,  0) in the  flight  direction  a?
gravity  makes  a  ball  roll  down  the surface  2x + 2y  + z = 0.  what  are
the  projections  of  f = (0, 0,  - mg)  in  the  plane  and  perpendicular  to
the plane?

the  component  of  v  along  a  is  the  push  from  the  wind  (tail  wind).  the  other
component  of  v  pushes  sideways  (crosswind).  similarly  the  force  parallel  to  the
surface  makes  the  ball move.  adding  the two  components  brings back  v or  f.

fig.  14.14  projections  along  a of wind velocity  v  and force  f  and vector  b.

we  now  compute  the  projection  of  b  onto  a.  call  this  projection  p.  since  its

direction  is  known-p is  along  a-we can  describe  p in  two  ways:

1)  give the  length  of  p along  a
2)  give the  vector  p  as a multiple of a.

figure  11.1lb  shows  the  projection  p  and  its  length.  the  hypotenuse  is  ibi.  the
length is  ipi  =  hbi cos 0. the perpendicular component  b - p has length  ibi  sin 0. the
cosine  is  positive for  angles  less  than 900.  the  cosine (and  p!) are  zero  when  a  and
b  are  perpendicular.  ibi  cos 0  is  negative  for  angles  greater  than  900,  and  the  pro-
(the length is  ibi  icos 01).  unless the angle is  0o or  300  or 450
jection  points along  -a 
or  600  or  900,  we  don't  want  to compute  cosines-and  we  don't  have  to.  the  dot
product does  it automatically:

ia|i  bi  cos  0 = a -b so the length of p  along  a is  ibi cos  0 -

a'b

(4)

notice  that  the  length  of  a  cancels  out  at  the  end  of  (4).  if  a is  doubled,  p  is
unchanged.  but if b is doubled,  the projection  is  doubled.

what  is  the  vector  p?  its length  along  a  is  a . b/iai.  if a is  a  unit  vector,  then
jal = 1 and the  projection  is  a . b  times a. generally  a is  not a unit vector, until  we
divide  by  iai.  here is the projection  p of b  along a:

example  8  find the nearest point  to the  origin  on the plane  x + 2y + 2z = 5.

the  shortest distance from  the  origin is along the  normal vector  n.  the  vector  p to
the nearest  point  (figure 11.12) is  t times  n, for  some unknown  number  t. we find  t
by  requiring  p = tn to lie  on  the  plane.

the  plane  x + 2y  + 2z = 5  has  normal  vector  n = (1, 2, 2).  therefore  p = tn =

(t, 2t, 2t). to  lie  on  the  plane,  this must  satisfy x + 2y  + 2z = 5:

t+2(2t) + 2(2t) =  5  or  9t=5  or 

t=  .

then  p = !n  = (6,  , 
). that  locates  the  nearest  point.  the  distance  is 
this  example  is  important  enough to  memorize,  with  letters  not numbers:

the  steps  are the  same.  n has  components a, b, c.  the nearest  point  on  the plane  is
a multiple  (ta, tb,  tc).  it lies  on  the plane  if a(ta) + b(tb) + c(tc) = d.

thus  t =  d/(a2 + b2 + c2). the point (ta, tb, tc) = tn is in equation (7).  the distance

to  the  plane  is  itni  =  idl/ini.

question  how  far  is  the plane  from an  arbitrary  point  q = (xl, yl,  z1)?
answer  the vector from q to p is our multiple tn. in vector form p =  q + tn. this
reaches  the plane  if p -n = d,  and again  we find  t:

(q + tn)  n =  d

yields 

t = (d - q . n)/in12.

distance =  itni =  d - q  ni/ini  = id - ax1 - by,  - cz1 l/  a2 + b2

when  the  point  is  on the plane,  that distance  is  zero-because  ax,  + by,  + czx  = d.

projections  of the  heart  vector

an electrocardiogram  has leads  to your right arm-left  arm-left  leg.  you  produce the
voltage. the  machine  amplifies  and  records  the  readings.  there  are  also  six  chest
leads,  to  add  a  front-back  dimension  that  is  monitored  across  the  heart.  we  will
concentrate  on  the  big "einthoven  triangle,"  named after  the inventor  of the  ecg.
the graphs  show voltage  variations  plotted  against time. the  first graph plots the
voltage  difference  between  the  arms.  lead ii  connects  the  left  leg  to  the  right  arm.
lead  iii  completes  the  triangle,  which  has  roughly  equal  sides  (especially  if you are
a  little lopsided).  so  the  projections  are  based  on  600  and  1200  angles.

the  heart  vector  v  is  the  sum  of  many  small  vectors-all  moved  to  the  same
origin.  v  is the net effect  of action potentials  from the cells-small  dipoles  adding  to
a  single  dipole.  the  pacemaker  (s-a  node)  starts the  impulse.  the  atria  depolarize
to  give  the  p wave  on  the  graphs. this  is  actually  a  p loop of the  heart vector-the

fig.  a  the  graphs  show  the  component  of the  moving  heart  vector  along each  lead.  these

1 1.2  planes and projections 

graphs  only  show its projections. the  impulse reaches  the  a v  node,  pauses,  and 
moves quickly through  the ventricles. this produces the  qrs complex-the 
large 
sharp movement on the graph. 

the total qrs interval should not  exceed 1/10 second (2i spaces on the printout). 
v points first toward  the right shoulder. this direction is  opposite to the leads, so 
the tracings go slightly down. that is the q wave, small and negative. then the heart 
vector  sweeps  toward  the  left  leg.  in  positions  3  and  4,  its  projection  on  lead  i 
(between the arms) is strongly positive. the r wave is this first upward deflection in 
each lead. closing the loop, the s wave is negative (best seen in leads i and avr). 
question 1  how many graphs from the arms and leg are really independent? 
answer  only two! in a plane, the heart vector v has two components. if  we know 
two projections, we  can compute the others. (the ecg does that for us.) different 
vectors show better in different projections. a mathematician would use 90" angles, 
with an electrode at your throat. 
question 2  how are the voltages related? what is the avr lead? 
answer  project the heart vector v onto the sides of  the triangle: 

'the lead vectors have l, - l,, + l,,, = o-they 
'the projections have v, - v,, + v,,, = v  l, - v  l,, + v  l,,, = 0. 

form a triangle. 

the avr lead is - il, - qh,. it is pure algebra (no wire . by vector addition it points 

toward the electrode on the right arm. its length is j' 3 if  the other lengths are 2. 

including avl and avf to the left arm and foot, there are six leads intersecting at 
equal angles. visualize them going out from a single point (the origin in the chest). 

qrs 
loop 

l 

fig. b  heart vector goes around the qrs loop.  projections are spikes on the ecg. 

question 3  if  the heart vector is v = 2i - j,  what voltage differences are recorded? 
answer  the leads around the triangle have length 2. the machine projects v: 

lead i is the horizontal vector 2i. so v  l, = 4. 
lead i1 is the  - 60" vector i - f i j .   so v  l,, = 2 + fi. 
lead i11 is the  - 120" vector  - i - f i j .   so v  l,,, = - 2 + fi. 

the first and third add to the second. the largest r  waves are in leads i and 11. in 
avr the projection of v will be negative (problem 46), and will be labeled an s wave. 

i i vectors and matrlces 

question 4  what about the potential (not just its differences). is it zero at the center? 
answer  it is zero ifwe  say so. the potential contains an arbitrary constant c. (it is 
like  an  indefinite integral.  its  differences  are  like  definite integrals.) cardiologists 
define a "central terminal" where the potential is zero. 

the  average of v over a loop is  the  mean  heart vector h. this average requires 
[ vdt, by chapter 5. with no time to integrate, the doctor looks for a lead where the 
area under the qrs complex is zero. then the direction of h (the axis) is perpendicu- 
lar to that lead. there is so much to say about calculus in medicine.

11  vectors and matrices 

after  saying that  vectors are  not  multiplied, we  offered  the  dot product.  now  we 
contradict ourselves further, by defining the cross product. where a  b was a number, 
the cross product  a  x  b is a vector. it has length and direction: 

the length is ial  ibi  1 sin 81.  the direction is perpendicular to a and b. 

the cross product  (also called vector  product) is defined in three dimensions only. 
a  and  b lie  on  a  plane  through  the  origin.  a x b is  along  the  normal  vector  n, 
perpendicular to that plane. we still have to say whether it points "up"  or "down" 
along n. 

the length of a x b depends on sin 8, where a  b involved cos 8. the dot product 
rewards vectors for being parallel (cos 0 = 1). the cross product  is largest when a is 
perpendicular to b (sin n/2 = 1). at  every angle 

that will be a bridge from geometry to algebra.  this section goes from  definition to 
formula  to  volume  to determinant. equations (6) and  (14) are  the  key  formulas for 
a x b. 

notice  that  a  x a = 0. (this is the zero vector, not  the zero number.) when  b  is 
parallel to a,  the angle is zero and the sine is zero. parallel vectors have a x b = 0. 
perpendicular  vectors  have  sin 8 = 1 and  ia  x bi  = jal ibi  = area  of  rectangle with 
sides a and b. 

here are four examples that lead to the cross product  a x b. 

example 1  (from geometry) find the area of  a parallelogram and a triangle. 
vectors a and b, going out from the origin, form two sides of a triangle. they produce 
'the parallelogram in figure 1 1.13, which is twice as large as the triangle. 

the area of  a parallelogram is base times height (perpendicular height not sloping 
height). the  base  is  [a[. the  height  is  ibi  [sin 81.  we  take  absolute  values  because 
height and area are not negative. then the area is the length of  the cross product: 

area of parallelogram = ial  ib( [sin 81  = ia  x bi.

example 2  (from physics) the torque vector t = r x f  produces rotation. 
the force f  acts at the point  (x, y, z). when f  is parallel to the position vector r = 
xi + yj + zk, the force pushes outward (no turning). when  f is  perpendicular to r, 
the force creates rotation.  for in-between angles there is an outward force if1  cos 8 
and a turning force if1  sin 8. the turning force times the distance (ri is the moment 
jri (fi sin 8. 

11.3  cross  products and  determinants 

417

the  moment  gives  the  magnitude  and  sign  of the  torque vector  t = r  x  f.  the

direction  of t  is  along  the  axis  of rotation,  at right  angles  to  r and  f.

example  3  does  the cross product go up or down?  use the right-hand rule.

forces  and  torques  are  probably just fine  for physicists.  those  who  are  not  natural
physicists  want  to  see  something  turn.t  we  can  visualize  a  record  or  compact  disc
rotating  around  its  axis-which  comes  up  through  the center.

at  a  point  on  the  disc,  you  give  a  push.  when  the  push  is  outward  (hard to  do),
nothing  turns.  rotation comes  from force  "around"  the  axis. the  disc can  turn either
way-depending  on  the  angle  between  force  and  position.  a  sign  convention  is
necessary,  and  it  is  the right-hand rule:

a  x b points along your right thumb  when the fingers curl from a  toward b.
this  rule  is  simplest  for  the  vectors  i, j, k  in  figure  11.14-which  is  all we  need.

suppose  the  fingers  curl  from  i  to  j.  the  thumb  points  along  k.  the  x-y-z  axes
form a "right-handed triple."  since  li|  =  1 and  i|j =  1 and sin 7n/2  =  1, the  length of i x  j
is  1.  the  cross product  is  i x j =  k.  the  disc  turns  counterclockwise-its  angular
velocity  is  up-when  the  force  acts  at i in  the  direction j.

figure  11.14b  reverses  i  and  j.  the  force  acts  at j and  its direction  is  i.  the  disc
turns  clockwise  (the way  records  and  compact  discs  actually  turn).  when  the  fingers
curl from j to  i, the  thumb points  down. thus j x  i  =  - k. this is  a  special  case  of an
amazing  rule:

the cross product is anticommutative: b  x  a  =  - (a  x  b). 

(3)

that is quite  remarkable.  its  discovery  by hamilton  produced  an intellectual  revolu-
tion  in  19th  century  algebra,  which  had  been  totally  accustomed  to  ab  = ba.  this
commutative  law  is  old  and  boring  for  numbers  (it is  new  and  boring  for  dot  pro-
ducts).  here  we  see  its  opposite  for  vector  products  a  x  b.  neither  law  holds  for
matrix  products.

example  4  a  screw  goes  into  a  wall  or out,  following  the  right-hand  rule.

the  disc  was  in  the  xy  plane.  so  was  the  force.  (we are  not breaking  records  here.)
the  axis  was  up  and  down.  to  see  the  cross  product  more  completely  we  need  to
turn  a  screw  into  a  wall.

figure  11.14b  shows  the  xz  plane  as  the  wall.  the  screw  is  in  the  y  direction.  by
turning  from  x  toward  z we  drive  the  screw  into the  wall-which  is  the  negative y
direction.  in  other words  i  x  k equals  minus j. we  turn the  screw  clockwise  to  make
it go  in.  to  take  out the  screw,  twist  from  k  toward  i.  then  k  x  i equals  plus j.

teverybody  is a natural  mathematician.  that is the  axiom behind  this  book.

11  vectors and  matrices

to  summarize: k  x i = j and j x k = i have  plus  signs  because  kij  and jki  are  in  the
same "cyclic order" as ijk. (anticyclic is minus.) the z-x-y  and y-z-x axes  form right-
handed  triples like  x-y-z.

the  formula  for the  cross  product

we  begin  the  algebra  of a x  b.  it  is  essential  for  computation,  and  it  comes  out
beautifully.  the  square  roots  in  iai  ibi  isin 01  will disappear in formula  (6) for a  x b.
(the  square  roots  also  disappeared  in  a * b,  which  is  iai ibi  cos 0.  but  ial ibi  tan 0
would  be  terrible.)  since  a  x b  is  a vector  we  need  to find  three components.

start with  the two-dimensional  case.  the vectors  a, i + a2j and b, i + b2j are in the
?  k
xy  plane.  their  cross product  must go  in  the z  direction.  therefore  a x  b = 
and  there  is  only  one  nonzero  component.  it  must be  iai  ibi  sin 0  (with  the  correct
sign),  but  we  want  a  better  formula.  there  are  two  clean  ways  to  compute  a x b,
either  by  algebra (a) or  by  a bridge  (b) to the  dot product  and  geometry:
(a)  (ai+a2j) x  (bi+b2j)=albixi+ab 2 ixj + a2bjxi+a2b2jx 

(4)
on  the  right  are  0,  ab 2 k,  -a 2 b1 k,  and  0.  the  cross product is  (ab 2 - a2 b,)k.
(b)  rotate  b= bli + b2j clockwise  through  90o  into  b* = b2 i-  b1j. its  length  is

unchanged  (and  b - b* = 0).  then  iai ibi  sin 0  equals  ial ib*i  cos 0,  which  is  a " b*:

(5)

sf  in the xy  plane,  a x b  equals  (ab 2 - a2 b)k. the  parallelogram  with
sides  a and  b has area  |a1 b2 - a2b 1. the triangle oab  has area  -|a, b2 - a2 b  1.

example  5  for a  = i + 2j and b = 4i + 5j the cross product is (1  5 - 2 - 4)k =  - 3k.
area  of parallelogram  =  3, area  of triangle  =  3/2. the  minus  sign  in a  x  b =  - 3k  is
absent  in the  areas.
note  splitting  a  x  b  into  four  separate  cross  products  is  correct,  but  it  does  not
follow  easily  from  ial ibi  sin 0.  method  (a) is  not justified  until  remark  1 below.  an
algebraist  would  change  the  definition  of  a x  b  to  start  with  the  distributive  law
(splitting  rule) and  the anticommutative  law:

ax(b+c)=(axb)+(axc)  and  axb=-(bxa).

the  cross  product  formula  (3 components)

we  move  to three dimensions.  the  goal  is to compute  all three  components of a  x  b
(not just the length).  method (a) splits  each  vector  into its  i, j, k components,  making
nine  separate  cross products:

(ali + a2j + a 3k) x (bai + b2 j + b3k) = alb2(i x i) + alb 2(i  x j) + seven  more  terms.

remember  i x  i = j  x j = k x  k = 0. those  three terms  disappear. the  other six terms
come  in pairs,  and please notice the cyclic pattern:
formula  a x b =  (a2b 3 - a 3b2)i + (a3b,  - a1 b3)j + (alb2 - a2 b,)k. 
(6)
the  k  component  is  the  2 x 2  answer,  when  a3 = b3  = 0.  the  i component  involves
indices  2  and  3, j involves  3 and  1, k involves  1 and  2.  the  cross product  formula is

11.3  cross  products and  determinants 

419

written  as  a  "determinant"  in  equation  (14)  below-many  people  use  that  form  to
compute  a x  b.

example6 
(i+2j+3k) x (4i+5j+6k)= (2*6-  35)i+(3*4-  16)j+(1  5-  24)k.
the  i, j, k components  give  a  x b =  - 3i + 6j - 3k.  never  add  the  - 3, 6,  and  - 3.
remark  1  the  three-dimensional  formula (6) is  still to be  matched with  a x  b from
geometry.  one way  is to  rotate b  into  b* as  before,  staying in the plane  of a and  b.
fortunately  there  is  an  easier  test.  the  vector  in  equation  (6) satisfies  all  four  geo-
metric  requirements  on a  x  b: perpendicular to a,  perpendicular to b,  correct  length,
right-hand rule. the  length  is  checked  in  problem  16-here  is  the  zero  dot product
with  a:

a  (a x b)= al(a 2b3 - a3b 2)+  a2(a 3b  - ab 3)+ a 3(ab 2  - a2 b)= 0. 

(7)
remark 2  (optional) there is  a  wonderful  extension  of  the  pythagoras  formula
a2  + b 2 =  c2 . instead  of sides of a triangle,  we go to  areas of projections on  the yz,  xz,
and  xy  planes.  32 +  62 +  32  is  the  square  of the  parallelogram  area  in  example  6.

for triangles  these areas  are cut in half. figure  11.15a shows  three projected  trian-

gles  of area 1. its  pythagoras  formula  is  (1)2  + (1)2  + (  )2 = (area of pqr) 2.

example  7  p = (1, 0, 0),  q = (0,  1, 0),  r = (0,  0,  1) lie in a  plane.  find  its equation.
idea for any p, q, r:  find vectors a and b in the plane. compute the normal n = a x b.
solution  the vector  from  p to  q has components  -1,  1, 0.  it is  a = j - i (subtract
to go  from p to q).  similarly  the vector  from  p to  r  is b = k - i. since  a  and b  are
in  the plane  of figure  11.15,  n = a  x b  is  perpendicular:

(j - i) x (k - i)=(j  x  k)-  (i x k)-(j  x i)+(i  x i)= i + j + k. 

(8)

the  normal  vector  is n =  i + j +  k.  the  equation  of the plane  is  1x +  ly +  z =  d.
with the right choice d =  1, this plane  contains p, q, r. the equation is x + y  + z =  1.

determinants  and  volumes

we are  close  to good  algebra.  the  two  plane  vectors  ali + a2j  and  b1i + b2j are  the
sides  of a parallelogram.  its area  is  a1b2 - a2 bl,  possibly with  a sign change.  there

420 

11  vectors and  matrices

is  a  special  way to  write  these four  numbers-in  a "square matrix." there  is  also  a
name for  the combination  that  leads to  area.  it is  the  "determinant of the  matrix":

the  matrix is  a 

, 
b, b2  

its  determinant is

b1  b2

this  is  a  2  by  2  matrix  (notice  brackets)  and a  2 by  2 determinant  (notice  vertical
bars).  the  matrix  is  an  array  of four numbers  and  the determinant  is  one number:

the  second  has no  area  because  a = b.  the third  is  a unit square  (a = i, b = j).

now move to three dimensions,  where  determinants are most useful.  the parallelo-
gram  becomes  a parallelepiped.  the word  "box"  is much  shorter,  and we will  use it,
but remember that the box is squashed. (like a rectangle  squashed to a parallelogram,
the angles  are generally  not 900.)  the three edges  from the origin  are  a = (a,, a2, a3),
b=(bl, b2, b 3),  c=(c1 , c2, c 3). those  edges  are  at  right  angles  only  when  a  b=
a  c = b*c=  0.

question:  what  is the  volume  of the  box?  the  right-angle  case  is easy-it  is length
times  width times  height.  the  volume  is  iai  times  ibi  times  ici,  when  the  angles  are
90'.  for  a  squashed  box  (figure  11.15)  we  need  the  perpendicular  height,  not  the
sloping  height.

there  is a beautiful formula  for volume.  b and c give  a parallelogram  in the base,
and  lb x  ci  is  the  base  area.  this  cross product  points  straight up.  the  third  vector
a points  up  at  an  angle-its  perpendicular  height  is  jal  cos  0.  thus  the  volume  is
area  ib x  ci  times  jai  times  cos  0.  the  volume  is  the  dot product  of a  with  b  x  c.

11g  the  triple scalar product  is  a  (b  x  c).  volume  of box  = ia  (b  x  c)i.

important: a  . (b  x  c)  is  a  number,  not  a  vector.  this  volume  is  zero  when  a  is  in
the  same plane as  b and c (the box  is totally flattened).  then  b x  c is perpendicular
to  a and  their  dot  product  is zero.

usefulfacts:  a  (bx c)=(ax  b)c=c  (ax b)=b.(c  xa).

all those come from the same box, with different  sides chosen  as base-but no change
in  volume.  figure  11.15  has b  and c  in  the base  but it  can  be  a and b  or a and  c.
the  triple product  a-  (c  x  b)  has  opposite  sign,  since  c  x  b =  - (b  x c).  this  order
acb  is not  cyclic  like  abc  and  cab  and bca.

to compute  this triple  product  a . (b x  c),  we  take  b  x c  from  equation (6):

a  (b  x  c) =  al(b2 c3  - b3c2) +  a2 (b3 c 1 - blc3) + a3 (blc 2  - b2 cl). 

(9)
the  numbers  a,, a2,  a3  multiply  2 by  2 determinants  to  give  a  3 by  3 determinant!
there  are  three  terms with  plus signs  (like alb2c3).  the  other three  have  minus  signs
(like  -alb 3c2).  the  plus terms  have indices  123,  231,  312  in cyclic order.  the  minus
terms  have  anticyclic  indices  132,  213,  321.  again  there is  a  special  way  to  write the
nine  components  of a,  b, c-as  a "3  by  3 matrix."  the  combination  in  (9),  which

1 1.3  cross products and determinants 

gives volume, is a "3  by 3 determinant:" 

, determinant = a  (b x c) =

a single number is produced out of nine numbers, by formula (9). the nine numbers 
this product is not allowed. each 
are multiplied three at a time, as in a, blc2-except 
row and column must be represented once. this gives the six terms in the determinant: 

the trick is in the  _+  signs. products down to the right are "plus": 

with practice the six products like 2  2  2 are done in your head.  write down only 
8 + 1 + 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 4. this is the determinant and the volume. 

note the special case when the vectors are i, j, k. the box is a unit cube: 

volume of  cube = 

1 0 0  
0  1  0 
= 

0 0 1  

1 + 0 + 0  

= 1. 

- 0 - 0 - 0  

if a,  b, c lie in the same plane,  the volume is zero. a zero determinant is the test 

to see whether three vectors lie in a plane.  here row a = row b - row c: 

zeros  in  the  matrix  simplify  the  calculation.  all  three  products  with  plus  signs- 
down to the right-are 
zero. the only two nonzero products cancel each other. 
if the three  - 1's are changed to + l's,  the determinant is  - 2. the determinant can 
be  negative when  all nine  entries are positive! a negative determinant  only means 
that the rows a,  b, c form a  "left-handed  triple."  this extra information  from the 
sign-right-handed  vs. left-handed-is 
free and useful, but the volume is the absolute 
value. 

the  determinant  yields  the  volume  also  in  higher  dimensions.  in  physics,  four 
dimensions give space-time. ten dimensions give superstrings. mathematics uses all 
dimensions.  the  64  numbers  in  an  8  by  8  matrix  give  the  volume  of  an  eight- 
8! = 40,320 terms instead of  3! = 6. under pressure from my 
dimensional box-with 
class i omit the formula. 

11  vectors and matric@r 

question  when is the point  (x, y, z) on the plane  through  the origin containing b 
and c? for the vector  a = xi + yj + zk to lie in that plane,  the volume a  (b x c) 
must be zero. the equation of  the plane is determinant = zero. 

follow this example for b = j - i and c = k - i to find the plane parallel to b and c: 

this equation is x + y + z = 0. the normal vector n = b x c has components 1,1,1. 

the  cross product as  a determinant 

there is a connection between  3 by  3 and 2 by 2 determinants that you have to see. 
the numbers in the top row multiply determinants from the other rows: 

the highlighted product  al(b2c3 - b3c2) gives two of  the six terms. an six products 
contain an a and b and c from  diflerent columns. there are 3! = 6 different orderings 
of columns 1,2, 3. note how a3 multiplies a determinant from columns  1 and 2. 

equation (1 3) is identical with equations (9) and (10). we are meeting the same six 
terms in different ways. the new  feature is the minus  sign in front of  a,-and 
the 
common mistake  is to forget that sign. in  a 4 by  4 determinant, a l ,  - a,,  a3, - a, 
would multiply 3 by  3 determinants. 

now comes a key step. we write a x b as a determinant. the vectors i, j,  k go in

it  works.  this is  the  good  way  to remember  and compute a x b.  in  the example

1 1.4  matrices and linear equations 

we are moving from geometry to algebra. eventually we get back to calculus, where 
linear equations come first. in chapter 1, y = mx + b 
functions are nonlinear-but 
produced a line. two equations produce two lines. if they cross, the intersection point 
solves both equations-and  we  want to find it. 

three  equations  in  three  variables  x, y, z  produce  three  planes.  again  they  go 
through  one  point  (usually). again  the  problem  is  to  find  that  intersection  point 
-which 

solves the three equations. 

the ultimate problem is to solve n equations in n unknowns.  there are n  hyper- 
planes in n-dimensional space, which meet at the solution. we need a test to be sure 
they meet. we also want the solution. these are the objectives of id202, which 
joins  with calculus at the center of  pure and applied mathematics.? 

like every subject, id202 requires a good notation. to state the equations 
and solve them, we  introduce  a  "matrix."  the problem  will be  au = d.  the solution 
will be  u = a-'d.  it  remains to understand  where the equations come from, where 
the answer comes from, and what the matrices a  and a -  ' stand for. 

two  equations in two  unknowns 

id202 has no reason to choose one variable as special. the equation y - yo = 
m(x - xo) separates y from x. a better equation for a line is ax + by = d. (a vertical 

?id202 dominates some applications while calculus governs others. both are essential. 
a  fuller  treatment  is  presented  in  the  author's  book  linear  algebra  and  its  applications 
(harcourt brace jovanovich, 3rd edition 1988), and in many other texts. 

11  vectors and matrices 

line like x = 5 appears when  b = 0. the first form did not allow  slope m = oo.) this 
section studies two lines: 

by  solving  both  equations  at  once,  we  are  asking  (x, y)  to lie  on  both  lines.  the 
practical question is: where do the lines cross? the mathematician's  question is: does 
a solution exist and is it unique? 

to understand  everything is not possible.  there are parts of life where  you never 
know what is going on (until too late). but two equations in two unknowns can have 
no mysteries.  there are three ways to write  the system-by 
rows,  by  columns, and 
by matrices.  please look  at all three, since setting up a problem  is generally  harder 
and more important than solving it. after that comes the concession to the real world: 
we  compute x and y. 

example 1  how do you invest $5000 to earn $400 a year interest, if a money market 
account pays  5% and a deposit account pays  lo%? 

set up equations by rows: with x dollars at 5% the interest is .05x. with y  dollars at 
10% the interest  is .10y.  one row for principal,  another row for interest: 

same equations by  columns: the left  side  of  (2) contains x  times  one vector  plus  y 
times  another vector. the right  side is a third vector. the equation by  columns is 

same equations by matrices: look  again  at the left  side. there are two unknowns x 
and y, which go into a vector u. they are multiplied by  the four numbers  1, .05,  1, 
and .lo, which  go into a  two by two matrix a. the left  side becomes  a matrix times 
a vector: 

now you  see where  the "rows"  and "columns"  came from. they are the rows  and 
columns  of  a  matrix.  the  rows  entered  the  separate  equations  (2). the  columns 
entered  the  vector  equation (3). the matrix-vector  multiplication  au  is  defined  so 
that all these equations are the same: 

au  by  rows: 

au  by  columns:

[:i [;i  = x [ ~ l ]+ y[:l]

is 

(combination of 
column  vectors) 

a  is the coeficient  matrix. the unknown  vector is u. the known vector on the right 
side, with components  5000 and 400, is d. the matrix equation is au = d. 

1i.4  matrices and linear equations 

fig. 11.16  each row  of  au = d gives a line. each column gives a vector. 

this notation au = d continues to apply when there are more equations and more 
unknowns. the matrix a has a row for  each equation (usually m rows). it has a column 
for  each unknown (usually n columns).  for 2 equations in 3 unknowns it is a 2 by  3 
matrix (therefore rectangular).  for 6 equations  in 6 unknowns  the matrix is  6 by  6 
(therefore square). the best  way to get familiar with  matrices  is to work  with  them. 
note also the pronunciation: "matrisees"  and never "matrixes." 

answer  to  the  practical  question  the  solution  is  x = 2000,  y = 3000.  that  is  the 
intersection point in the row picture (figure 11.16). it is also the correct combination 
in the column picture.  the matrix  equation checks both  at once,  because matrices 
are multiplied by rows or by columns.  the product either way is d: 

in the row picture,  the lines cross at the solution. but there is a case 
singular case 
that gives trouble.  when the lines areparallel, they never cross and there is no solution. 
when the lines are the same, there is an infinity of  solutions: 

parallel lines 

2x+y=o 

2 x + y = 1  

same line 

2x+  y = o

4x+2y=o 

(5)

this trouble also appears in the column picture.  the columns are vectors a and  b. 
the equation au  = d is the same as xa + yb = d. we are asked to find the combination 
of  a and b (with coefficients x and y) that produces d. in the singular case a and b lie 
along the same line (figure 11.17). no combination can produce d, unless it happens 
to lie on this line.

the investment problem is nonsingular, and 2000 a  + 3000 b equals d.  we also  drew

the  crossing  point  is  (1, 1) in  the  row  picture.  the  solution  is  x =  1, y =  1 in  the
column picture  (figure 11.17b).  then  1 times  a plus  1 times b equals  the  right side  d.

solution  by  determinants

up to now we just wrote down  the answer.  the real  problem is  to find x  and y  when
they  are  unknown.  we  solve  two  equations  with  letters  not numbers:

a  x + b  y = d,
a2 x +  b2y= d2.

the  key is  to  eliminate  x. multiply  the first equation  by a2  and  the second  equation
by  a,.  subtract  the first  from  the second  and  the x's disappear:

to eliminate  y,  subtract  b, times  the second  equation  from  b2  times the  first:

(ab 2  - a 2 bl)y = (ad 2  - a2 d,).

(b2al - b  a2 )x = (b2 d,  - bid 2).

what  you  see  in  those  parentheses  are  2  by  2  determinants!  remember  from
section  11.3:

the  determinant  of 

f a1   b1  

a2  b2  

is  the  number 

a1   b1

a2  b2

alb 2 - a2 bl.

this  number  appears  on  the  left  side  of (6) and  (7).  the  right  side  of  (7) is  also  a
determinant-but  it  has  d's in  place  of a's. the  right  side  of (6) has  d's in  place  of
b's.  so  x and  y  are  ratios of determinants, given  by  cramer's  rule:

cramer's  rule  has  x =  100/.05 = 2000  and  y =  150/.05  = 3000.  this  is  the  solution.
the singular  case  is when  the determinant of a  is zero-and we  can't divide  by  it.

111  cramer's  rule  breaks  down  when  det  a =  0-which is  the  singular  case.
then  the lines in  the row  picture  are parallel,  and  one  column  is a  multiple  of
the  other column.

11.4  matrices and linear equations 

example 3  the lines 2x + y = 0, 2x + y = 1 are parallel. the determinant is zero: 

the lines in figure 11.17a don't  meet. notice the columns: [:i 
is a multiple of  [:i. 
one final comment on 2 by  2 systems. they are small enough so that all solution 
methods  apply.  cramer's  rule  uses  determinants.  larger  systems  use  elimination 
(3 by  3  matrices are on the borderline). a  third solution (the same solution!) comes 
from the inverse matrix a-',  to be described next. but the inverse is more a symbol 
for  the  answer than  a  new  way  of  computing  it,  because to  find  a-'  we  still use 
determinants or elimination. 

the  inverse of a matrix 

the  symbol a-'  is  pronounced  "a inverse."  it  stands for  a  matrix-the 
one  that 
solves au = d. i think  of  a  as a matrix that takes u to d. then a-'  is a matrix that 
takes d back to u. if au = d then u = a -  'd (provided the inverse exists). this is exactly 
like functions and inverse functions: g(x) = y and x =gp'(y). our goal is to find a - ' 
when we  know a. 

the first approach  will be  very direct. cramer's  rule gave formulas for x and y, 
the  components  of  u.  from  that  rule  we  can  read  off  a - ' ,   assuming  that  d  = 
a ,  b2 - a2bl  is  not  zero. d  is det a  and we divide by  it: 

the  matrix  on  the  right  (including 1/d in  all four  entries) is  a-'.  notice  the  sign 
pattern and the subscript pattern. the inverse exists if  d is not zero-this 
is impor- 
tant. then the solution comes from a matrix-vector multiplication, a-'  times d. we 
repeat the rules for that multiplication: 

definition  a matrix  m  times a vector v  equals a vector of  dot products: 

equatioin (8) follows this rule with m = a-'  and v = d. look  at example 1: 

row 2 

there st,ands the inverse matrix.  it multiplies d  to give the solution u: 

the formulas work perfectly, but you have to see a direct way to reach a -  id. multiply 
both sides  of  au = d  by  a - ' .   the  multiplication  "cancels"  a  on  the  left  side, and 
leaves u = a-'d.  this approach comes next. 

430

11  vectors  and matrices

matrix  multiplication

to  understand  the power  of matrices,  we  must  multiply  them.  the  product  of a- 1
with  au is  a matrix  times  a vector.  but that multiplication  can be  done  another  way.
first a-'  multiplies  a, a matrix  times a matrix.  the product a -'a  is another matrix
(a very special  matrix).  then this new  matrix  multiplies  u.

the  matrix-matrix  rule  comes  directly  from  the  matrix-vector  rule.  effectively,  a
vector v is a matrix  v with  only one column. when  there are  more columns,  m times
v  splits  into  separate  matrix-vector  multiplications,  side by  side:

definition  a matrix  m  times a matrix  v  equals  a matrix  of dot products:

i was amazed to learn that it was leibniz (again!) who proposed the 
notation  we  use  for  matrices.  the entry  in  row  i  and  column j  is  aij. the  identity 
matrix has a l l  = a,,  = 1 and a,,  = a,,  = 0. this is in a id202 book by charles 
wonderland.  i  regret  to  say  that  he  preferred  his  own  notation iu  instead  of  aij.

projection onto a plane = least  squares  fllllng by a line 

we close with  a genuine application. it starts with  three-dimensional  vectors a, b, d 
and leads to a 2 by 2 system. one good feature: a, b, d can be n-dimensional with no 
change  in  the  algebra.  in  practice  that  happens.  second  good  feature:  there  is  a 
calculus  problem  in the background.  the example is tofit points  by a straight  line. 

there are three ways to state the problem, and they  look  different: 
1.  solve xa + yb = d as well as possible (three equations, two unknowns x and y). 
2.  project  the vector d onto the  plane of  the vectors a and b. 
3.  finld the closest straight line ("least squares") to three given points. 

figure  11.19 shows a  three-dimensional  vector  d above  the plane of  a  and b.  its 
projection  onto the  plane  is  p = xa + yb.  the numbers  x  and y are  unknown,  and 
our goal is to find them. the calculation  will  use the dot product, which  is always 
the key to right angles. 

the diflerence d - p is the "error."  there has to be an error, because no combination 
of  a  and b can produce d exactly. (otherwise d is in the plane.) the projection  p is 
the  closest  point  to  d,  and  it  is  governed  by  one  fundamental  law:  the  error  is 
perpendicular  to  the plane.  that  makes  the  error  perpendicular  to  both  vectors  a 
and b: 

a * ( x a + y b - d ) = o  

and 

b - ( x a + y b - d ) = o .  

(13) 

11  vectors and matrices 

rewrite those as two equations for the two unknown  numbers x and y: 

(a  a)x + (a  b)y = a  d 
(b  a)x + (b  b)y = b  d. 

(14) 

these are the famous normal equations in statistics, to compute x and y and p. 

example 7  for a = (1, 1, 1) and b = (l,2, 3) and d = (0, 5,4), solve equation (14): 

3x+  6y=  9 
6x + 14y = 22 

gives 

x =  -1 
y =   2 

so  p = -a  + 2b = (1, 3,5) = projection. 

notice the three equations that we  are not solving (we can't): xa + yb = d is 

x +   y=o 
x + 2y = 5  with the 3 by  2 matrix  a = 
x + 3 y = 4  

for d = (0, 5,4) there is no solution; d is not in the plane of  a and b.  for p = (1,3, 5) 
there is a  solution, x = - 1 and y = 2.  the vector p is in the plane. the error d - p 
is (-  1,2, - 1). this error is perpendicular to the columns (1, 1, 1) and (l,2, 3), so it is 
perpendicular to their plane. 

same example  (written as a line-fitting problem) fit the points (1,o) and (2, 5) and 
(3,4) as closely as possible ("least  squares")  by a straight line. 
two points determine a line. the example asks the line f = x + yt to go through three 
points.  that gives the  three equations in  (is), which  can't  be  solved with  two  un- 
knowns.  we  have to settle for the closest line, drawn  in  figure 11.19b. this line is 
computed again below, by calculus. 

notice that the closest line has heights 1, 3, 5 where the data points have heights 
0,5,4. those are the numbers in p and d! the heights 1,3,5 fit onto a line; the heights 
0, 5,4 do not.  in  the first figure, p = (1, 3, 5) is in the plane and d = (0, 5,4) is not. 
vectors in the plane lead to heights that lie on a line. 
notice another coincidence. the coefficients x = - 1 and y = 2 give the projection 
- a   + 2b.  they also  give  the  closest line f = - 1 + 2t.  all  numbers  appear  in  both 
figures. 

closest line f = -1 

kl; : 2  

fig. 11.19  projection  onto plane  is (1, 3, 5) with coefficients -1,  2.  closest line has  heights 

1, 3, 5 with coefficients -1,  2.  error in both pictures is  -1,  2,  -1.

remark  finding  the  closest  line  is  a  calculus problem: minimize  a sum  of squares.
the  numbers  x  and  y  that  minimize  e give  the  least squares  solution:

e(x,  y) = (x + y - 0)2  + (x + 2y  - 5)2  +  (x +  3y - 4)2.

(16)

those  are  the  three  errors  in  equation  (15),  squared  and  added.  they  are  also  the
three errors in the straight line fit, between the line and the data points. the projection
minimizes  the  error (by  geometry),  the normal  equations  (14)  minimize  the error  (by
algebra),  and now calculus  minimizes  the error by setting  the derivatives  of e to zero.
the  new  feature  is  this:  e depends  on  two  variables  x  and  y.  therefore e has two
derivatives. they both  have to be  zero  at the minimum. that  gives  two equations  for
x  and  y:

x  derivative  of  e is zero:  2(x + y) + 2(x  + 2y - 5)  + 2(x  + 3y - 4)  = 0
y  derivative  of  e is  zero:  2(x + y) + 2(x  + 2y - 5)(2) + 2(x  + 3y - 4)(3) = 0.

when  we  divide  by  2,  those  are  the  normal  equations  3x + 6y = 9 and  6x + 14y =
22.  the  minimizing  x  and  y  from  calculus  are  the same  numbers  -1  and 2.

the  x  derivative  treats  y  as  a  constant.  the  y  derivative  treats  x  as  a constant.
these  are partial derivatives. this calculus  approach to least  squares is in chapter  13,
as  an  important  application  of partial  derivatives.

we  now  summarize  the  least squares problem-to find  the  closest  line  to  n  data
points. in practice  n may be  1000 instead  of 3. the points have horizontal coordinates
bl,  b2 ,  ... , b,.  the  vertical  coordinates  are  dl,  d 2 , ... , d..  these  vectors  b and  d,
together  with a  = (1, 1, ... , 1),  determine  a  projection-the  combination  p = xa + yb
that  is  closest  to  d.  this  problem  is  the  same  in  n  dimensions-the  error  d - p is
perpendicular  to  a  and  b.  that is  still  tested by  dot products,  p  a  = d  a and p  b =
d - b, which  give  the  normal  equations  for  x  and y:

(a . a)x + (a . b)y  = a . d

(b . a)x + (b " b)y = b . d

(n)  x + (xbi)y = =di

(eb,)x + (ib  )y =  ebid,.

(17)

44k  the  least  squares  problem  projects  d  onto  the  plane  of a  and  b.  the
projection  is  p =  xa + yb,  i  n dimensions.  the closest  line is f  = x + 
t, in  two
dimensions.  the normal  equations  (17)  give  the  best  x and  y.

11.5  id202 

this section moves from two to three dimensions. there are three unknowns x, y,  z 
and  also  three  equations.  this  is  at  the  crossover  point  between  formulas  and 
is real  id202. the formulas give a direct solution  using det- 
algorithms-it 
erminants.  the  algorithms  use  elimination  and  the  numbers  x, y, z  appear  at  the 
end.  in practice  that end result  comes quickly.  computers solve linear equations  by 
elimination. 
is  similar.  quadratic  equations 
ax2 + bx + c = 0 are solved by  a formula.  cubic equations are solved  by  newton's 
method (even though a formula exists). for equations involving x  or x lo, algorithms 
take over completely. 

the  situation  for  a  nonlinear  equation 

since we are at the crossover  point, we look both ways.  this section  has a lot to 

do, in mixing geometry, determinants,  and 3 by  3 matrices: 
1. the row picture:  three planes intersect  at the solution 
2.  the column picture:  a vector equation combines the columns 
3.  the formulas: determinants and cramer's  rule 
4.  id127 and a -' 
5.  the algorithm: gaussian elimination. 

part of our goal is three-dimensional  calculus. another part is n-dimensional algebra. 
and  a  third  possibility  is  that  you  may  not  take  mathematics  next  year.  if  that 

436

happens,  i hope  you will  use mathematics.  linear  equations  are so  basic and  impor-
tant, in  such  a variety of applications,  that the effort  in this section  is worth making.
an  example  is  needed.  it is  convenient  and  realistic  if the  matrix  contains  zeros.
most  equations  in  practice  are  fairly  simple-a  thousand  equations  each  with  990
zeros  would  be  very  reasonable.  here  are  three equations  in  three  unknowns:

x+ 

y 

=  1

x 

+ 2z = 

0 

- 2y  + 2z  =  -4.

(1)

in matrix-vector form, the unknown u has components x, y, z. the right sides  1, 0,  - 4
go  into d. the  nine  coefficients,  including  three zeros,  enter the  matrix  a:

1  1  0  x 
1  0  2 
0  -2 
2 

z 

1
=  0 

-4

or  au=d. 

(2)

the  goal  is  to  understand  that system  geometrically,  and then  solve  it.

the  row  picture:  intersecting  planes

start with  the  first equation  x + y = 1. in the  xy  plane  that produces  a line.  in three
dimensions  it is  a plane. it has the usual form ax + by + cz = d,  except that c happens
to be zero.  the plane is easy to visualize (figure 11.20a),  because it cuts straight down
through  the line.  the  equation  x + y =  1 allows  z  to have  any  value,  so  the  graph
includes  all  points  above and  below  the  line.

the  second  equation  x + 2z = 0  gives  a  second  plane,  which  goes  through  the
origin.  when  the right side is zero, the point (0, 0, 0) satisfies the equation. this  time  y
is absent from  the equation, so the plane contains  the whole y  axis.  all points (0, y, 0)
meet  the  requirement  x + 2z = 0.  the  normal vector to  the plane is n = i  + 2k.  the
plane  cuts across,  rather  than  down,  in  11.20b.

before  the third  equation  we combine  the first  two.  the  intersection of two planes
is  a line.  in  three-dimensional  space,  two  equations  (not one)  describe  a  line.  the
points  on  the  line  have  to  satisfy  x + y  =  1 and  also  x + 2z =  0.  a convenient  point
is p = (0,  1, 0).  another point is  q = (-1, 2, -). the line through  p and q extends  out
in both  directions.

the  solution  is  on  that line.  the  third  plane  decides  where.

the third equation  - 2y + 22 = - 4 gives the third plane-which  misses the origin 
because  the  right  side is  not  zero.  what  is  important  is  the  point  where  the  three 
planes  meet.  the  intersection line  of  the  first  two  planes  crosses  the  third  plane. 
we  used  determinants (but elimination is better) to find x = - 2,  y = 3, z = 1. this 
solution satisfies the three equations and lies on the three planes. 
a brief comment on 4 by 4 systems. the first equation might be x + y + z - t = 0. 
it represents a three-dimensional "hyperplane"  in four-dimensional space. (in physics 
this is space-time.) the second equation gives a second hyperplane, and its intersection 
with the first one is two-dimensional. the third equation (third hyperplane) reduces 
the intersection to a line. the fourth hyperplane meets that line at a point, which is 
the solution. it satisfies the four equations and lies on the four hyperplanes. in this 
course three dimensions are enough. 

column picture: combination of  column vectors 

there is an extremely important way to rewrite our three equations. in (1) they were 
separate, in (2) they went into a matrix. now they become a vector equation: 

the columns of the matrix are multiplied by x, y, z. that is a special way to see matrix- 
vector multiplication: au is a combination of the columns of a. we  are looking for 
the numbers x, y, z  so that the combination produces the right side d. 
the  column  vectors  a, b, c  are  shown  in  figure 11.21a. the  vector  equation  is 
xa + yb + zc = d. the combination that solves this equation must again be x = - 2, 
y = 3, z = 1. that agrees with  the  intersection point  of  the three planes in  the row 
picture.

the  determinant and  the  inverse  matrix 

for a 3 by 3 determinant, the section on cross products gave two formulas. one was 
the triple product  a  (b x c). the other wrote out the six terms: 

det a = a  (b x c) = al(b2c3 - b3c2) + a2(b3c, - blc3) + a3(b,cz - b2cl). 

i i  vectors and matrices 

geometrically this is the volume of  a box. the columns a, b, c are the edges going out 
from the origin. in our example the determinant and volume are 2: 

a slight dishonesty  is present  in  that calculation,  and will  be  admitted  now.  in 
section 1 1.3 the vectors a, b, c were rows. in this section a, b, c are columns. it doesn't 
matter,  because  the  determinant  is  the  same  either  way.  any  matrix  can  be 
"transposedw-exchanging 
rows for columns-without  altering the determinant. the 
six terms (alb2c3 is the first) may come in a different order, but they are the same six 
terms. here four of those terms are zero, because of the zeros in the matrix. the sum 
of  all six terms is d = det a = 2. 

since d is not zero, the equations can be solved. the three planes meet at a point. 
the column vectors a, b, c produce a genuine box, and are not flattened into the same 
plane (with zero volume). the solution involves dividing by d-which 
is only possible 
if  d = det a is not zero. 

i 14l  when the determinant d is not zero, a bas an inverse: aa-'  = a-'a  = 

i. then the equations au = d have one and only one solution u = a - 'd. 

i 

the 3 by  3 identity matrix i is at the end of  equation (5). always iu = u. 

we  now  compute  a-',  first  with  letters  and  then  with  numbers.  the  neatest 
is special for 3 by  3 matrices.

to test this formula, multiply  by  a.  matrix  multiplication produces  a matrix of dot 
products-from 
the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second, a- 'a  = i:

on the right side, six of  the triple products are zero. they are the off-diagonals like 
b  (b x c), which contain the same vector twice. since b x c is perpendicular to b, this 
triple product is zero. the same is true of  the others, like a  (a x b) = 0. that is the 
volume of  a box with two identical sides. the six off-diagonal zeros are the volumes 
of  completely flattened boxes. 

on  the main  diagonal the triple products equal d.  the order of  vectors can be  abc 
or bca or cab, and the volume of the box stays the same. dividing by this number d, 
which is placed outside for that purpose,  gives the  1's in the identity matrix  i. 

now we change to numbers.  the goal is to find a-'  and to test it. 

11.5  llnear algebra 

that comes from  the formula,  and it absolutely  has to be checked. do not fail to 
multiply a-'  times a (or a times a- ').  id127  is much easier than 
the formula for a-'.  we highlight row 3 times column 1, with dot product zero: 

remark on  a- '  inverting  a  matrix  requires  d  # 0. we  divide by  d = det a.  the 
cross  products  b x c and c x a and a x b  give a-'  in  a  neat  form,  but  errors are 
easy.  we  prefer  to  avoid  writing  i, j,  k.  there  are nine  2 by  2 determinants  to  be 
the nine "cofcretors~' divided by  d: 
calculated, and here is a-'  in full-containing 

important:  the first row of  a-'  does not use the first column of  a,  except in  1/d. 
in  other words,  b x c  does  not  involve a.  here  are  the  2  by  2  determinants  that 
produce 4,  -2, 2-which 

is divided by d = 2 in the top row of  a-': 

the second highlighted determinant looks like + 2 not  -2.  but the sign matrix on 
the right assigns a minus to that position in a-'.  we reverse the sign of blc3 - b3cl, 
to find the cofactor b3c1 - blc3 in the top row  of  (6). 

to repeat: for a row of  a-i, cross out the corresponding column of  a. find the three 

2 by  2 determinants, use the sign matrix, and divide by  d. 

the multiplication  bb-i  = i checks the arithmetic.  notice  how :  in b leads to a 
zero in the top row of  b-'.  to find row 1, column 3 of b-'  we ignore column 1 and 
row  3 of  b. (also: the inverse of  a triangular matrix  is triangular.) the minus signs 
come from the sign matrix. 

the  solution u =a- 'd 

the purpose of  a-'  is to solve the equation  au = d. multiplying by  a-'  produces 
iu = a-'d.  the  matrix  becomes  the  identity,  iu  equals  u,  and  the  solution  is 
immediate: 

11  vectors and matrices 

by writing those components x, y, z as ratios ofdeterminants,  we have cramer's rule: 

the solution is x = -- 

id  b  cl 
la  b cl' 

y=- 

la  d  cl 
}a b  cl' 

z=- 

la b 4 
la  b el' 

(10) 

the right side d replaces, in turn, columns a and b and c. all denominators are d = 
a  (b x c). the numerator of x is the determinant d  (b x c) in (9). the second numera- 
tor agrees with  the second component d  (c x a), because  the cyclic order is correct. 
the third determinant with columns abd equals the triple product d  (a x b) in a -  'u. 
thus (10) is the same as (9). 

example a:  multiply  by  a-'  to find the known  solution x = - 2, y = 3, z  = 1: 

example b: 

multiply  by  b-'  to solve bu = d when d is the column (6, 5, 4): 

" =  b - ' d =  

example c: 

put d = (6, 5,4) in each column of  b. cramer's rule gives u = (1, 1,4): 

this  rule  fills  the  page  with  determinants.  those  are  good  ones  to  check  by  eye, 
without writing down the six terms (three + and three -). 

the formulas for a-'  are honored  chiefly in their absence. they are not used  by 
the computer, even though the algebra is in some ways beautiful. in big calculations, 
the computer never  finds a -  '-just 

the solution. 

we  now  look  at the  singular  case  d = 0.  geometry-algebra-algorithm  must  all 

break down. after that is the algorithm: gaussian elimination. 

the  singular case 

changing one entry of  a matrix  can make the determinant zero. the triple product 
a *(b x c),  which  is  also  the  volume,  becomes  d = 0.  the  box  is  flattened  and  the 
matrix is singular. that happens in our example when the lower right entry is changed 
from 2 to 4: 

s = 1  1 

0 

2  has determinant d = 0. 

i 

11.5  id202 

this does more than change the inverse. it destroys the inverse. we  can no longer 
divide by d. there is no s -'. 

what  happens to the  row  picture and column picture?  for  2 by  2 systems, the 
singular case had  two parallel lines. now  the row  picture has three  planes,  which 
need not be parallel. here the planes are not  parallel. their normal vectors are the 
rows of s, which go in different directions. but somehow the planes fail to go through 
a common point. 

what  happens is more  subtle. the intersection line from  two  planes misses the 
third plane. the line is parallel to the plane and stays above it (figure 11.22a). when 
all three planes are drawn, they form an open tunnel. the picture tells more than the 
numbers, about  how  three planes  can fail  to meet.  the third  figure shows an end 
view, where the planes go directly into the page. each pair meets in a line, but those 
lines don't  meet in a point. 

fig. 11.22  the row picture in the singular case: no intersection point, no solution. 

when two planes are parallel, the determinant is again zero. one row of the matrix 
in a 

is a multiple of  another row. the extreme case has all three planes parallel-as 
matrix with nine  1's. 

the column picture must also break down. in the 2 by 2 failure (previous section), 
the columns were on the same line. now  the three columns are in  the same plane. the 
combinations of  those columns produce d only if  it happens to lie in that particular 
plane.  most vectors d will  be  outside the plane, so most  singular systems have no 
solution. 

when the determinant is zero, au = d  has no solution or infinitely many. 

the  elimination algorithm 

go back to the 3 by  3 example au = d. if you were given those equations, you would 
never think of determinants. you  would-quite  correctly-start  with the first equa- 
tion. it gives x = 1 - y, which goes into the next equation to eliminate x: 

stop there for a minute. on the right is a 2 by 2 system for y and z. the first equation 
and  first  unknown  are eliminated-exactly  what  we  want.  but  that  step  was  not 
organized in the best way, because a "1"  ended up on the left side. constants should 
stay on the right side-the  pattern should be preserved. it is better to take the same 

11  vectors and matrices 

step by  subtracting the fist  equation from  the second: 

same equations, better organization. now look at the corner term  -y. its coefficient 
-1 is the secondpivot. (the first pivot was +1, the coefficient of x in the first corner.) 
we are ready for the next elimination step: 

plan:  subtract a multiple of  the "pivot  equation"  from the equation below it. 
goal:  to produce a zero below the pivot, so y is eliminated. 

method:  subtract 2 times the pivot equation to cancel  -2y. 

the answer comes by back substitution. equation (12) gives z = 1. then equation (1 1) 
gives y = 3. then the first equation gives x = - 2. this is much quicker than determi- 
nants.  you may ask:  why  use  cramer's rule? good question. 

with numbers elimination is better.  it is faster and  also safer. (to check  against 
error,  substitute  -2, 3, 1 into  the  original  equations.)  the  algorithm  reaches  the 
answer without the determinant and without the inverse. calculations with letters use 
det a  and a - '. 

here are the steps in a definite order (top to bottom): 

subtract a multiple of equation  1 to produce ox  in equation 2 
subtract a multiple of  equation  1 to produce ox  in equation 3 
subtract a multiple of  equation 2 (new) to produce oy  in equation 3. 

example  (notice the zeros appearing under the pivots): 

elimination leads to a triangular system. the coefficients below the diagonal are zero. 
first z = 2, then y = 1, then x = - 2. back substitution solves triangular systems (fast). 

as  a final example, try the singular case su = d when the corner entry is changed 
from  2 to 4.  with  d = 0, there is  no  inverse matrix  s - l .  elimination also fails, by 
reaching an impossible equation 0 = - 2: 

the three planes do not  meet at a point-a 
fact that was not  obvious at the start. 
algebra discovers this fact  from d = 0. elimination discovers it from 0 = -2.  the 
chapter is ending at the point  where my  id202 book  begins. 

11.5  id202 

one final comment. in actual computing, you will use a code written by profession- 
als. the steps will be the same as above. a multiple of  equation  1 is subtracted from 
each equation below it, to eliminate the first unknown x. with  one fewer unknown 
and equation, elimination starts again. (a parallel computer executes many  steps at 
once.) extra  instructions are included  to  reduce  roundoff  error.  you  only  see  the 
result! hut it is more satisfying to know what  the computer is doing. 

in the end, solving linear equations is the key step in solving nonlinear equations. 

the central idea of  id128 is to linearize near a point.

this chapter is  about  "vector  functions."  the  vector  2i +4j + 8k  is  constant.  the 
vector r(t) = ti + t2j+ t3k is moving. it is a function of  the parameter t, which often 
represents time. at each time t, the position vector r(t) locates the moving body: 

position  vector =r(t) =x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k.

our example has  x = t, y = t2, z =t3. as  t varies, these points  trace out a curve in 
space. the  parameter  t  tells  when  the  body  passes  each  point  on  the  curve. the 
constant  vector 2i +4j + 8k is the position vector r(2) at the instant t =2. 
what  are  the  questions to  be  asked?  every  student  of  calculus knows  the  first 
question: find the deriuatiue. if something moves, the navy salutes it and we differen- 
tiate it. at each instant, the body moving along the curve has a speed and a direction. 
this information  is  contained  in  another  vector  function-the  velocity  vector  v(t) 
which is the derivative of  r(t): 

since i, j,  k are fixed vectors, their derivatives are zero. in polar coordinates i and j 
are replaced by moving vectors. then the velocity v has more terms from the product 
rule (section 12.4). 

two important cases are uniform motion along a line and around a circle. we study 
those motions in detail (v =constant  on line, v =tangent to circle). this section also 
finds the speed and distance and acceleration for any motion r(t). 

equation (2) is the computing rulefor  the velocity dr/dt. it is not the definition of 

dr/dt, which goes back to basics and does not depend on coordinates:

we repeat: r is a vector so ar  is a vector so dr/dt is a vector. all three vectors are 
in figure 12.1 (t is not a vector!). this figure reveals the key fact about the geometry: 
the velocity v =dr/dt is tangent to the curve. 

12.1  the posmon vector 

the vector ar  goes from one point  on the curve to a nearby  point.  dividing by 
at  changes its length, not  its direction. that direction  lines up with  the tangent  to 
the curve, as the points come closer. 
example i  r(t) = ti + t2j+ t3k 
this curve swings upward as t increases. when t = 0 the velocity is v = i. the tangent 
is along the x axis, since the j and k components are zero. when t = 1 the velocity is 
i + 2j + 3k, and the curve is climbing. 
is ti + t2j. velocity along the shadow is i + 2tj. the shadow is a plane curve. 

for the shadow on the xy plane, drop the k component. position on the shadow 

v(t) = i + 2tj + 3t2k

example 2  uniform motion in a straight line: the velocity vector v is constant. 
the  speed  and direction  don't  change.  the position  vector  moves  with  dr/dt = v: 

r(t) = r,  + tv 

(3) 
that is the equation of a line in vector form. certainly dr/dt = v.  the starting point 
r,  = x,i  + yd + zok is given. the velocity v = v1 i + v2j + v3k is also given. separating 
the x, y and z components, equation (3) for a line is

the speed along the line is  ivl= 
the direction  of  the line is the unit 
vector v/lvl. we have three equations for x, y, z, and eliminating t leaves two equations. 
the parameter  t equals (x -xo)/vl from equation  (4). it also equals (y -y0)/v2and 
(z -zo)iv3.sothese ratios equal each other, and t is gone:

v3 
an example is x = y/2 = z/3. in this case (x,,  yo, z,)  = (0, 0, 0)-the 
line goes through 
the origin. another point on the line is (x, y, z) = (2,4 6). because t is gone, we cannot 
say when we reach that point and how fast we are going. the equations x/4 = y/8 = 
2/12 give the same line. without  t we can't  know the velocity v = dr/dt.

example 3  find an equation for the line through  p = (0,2, 1) and q = (1,3,3). 
solution  we have choices! r,  can go to any point  on the line. the velocity v can 
be  any multiple  of  the vector  from  p to  q.  the decision on r,  controls where we 
start, and v controls our speed. 
the vector from p to q is i + j + 2k. those numbers  1,1,2 come from subtracting 
0,2, 1 from  1,3,3. we choose this  vector i + j + 2k  as a  first v,  and double it  for a 

12  motion along a curve 

second v.  we choose the vector r,  = p as a first  start and r,  = q as a second start. 
are p + tv  and q + t(2v): 
here are two different  expressions for the same line-they 

the vector r(t) gives x = t, y = 2 + t, z  = 1 + 2t. the vector  r* is at a different  point 
on the same line at the same time: x* = 1 + 2t, y* = 3 + 2t, z* = 3 + 4t. 

if  i pick  t = 1 in r and t = 0 in r*, the point is (1,3,3). we arrive there at different 
times.  you  are seeing  how  parameters work,  to tell  "where"  and also  "when."  if  t 
goes from  - go  to + go, all points on one line are also on the other line. the path is 
the same, but  the "twins"  are going at different  speeds. 
question 1  when do these  twins meet? when does r(t) = r*(t)? 
answer  they meet  at t = - 1, when  r = r* = - i + j - k. 
question 2  what is  an equation for the segment  between  p and q (not beyond)? 
answer 

in the equation for r(t), let  t go from 0 to  1 (not beyond): 
[0 < t < 1 for segment]. 

x = t  y = 2 + t  z = 1 + 2t 

(6) 

at  t = 0 we  start from p = (0,2, 1). at  t = 1 we  reach  q = (1, 3, 3). 
question 3  what is an equation for the line without the parameter t? 
answer  solve equations (6) for  t or use (5): x/l = (y - 2)/1 = (z - 1)/2. 
question 4  which  point on the line  is closest  to the origin? 
answer  the derivative of x2 + y2 + z2 = t2 + (2 + t)2 + (1 + 2t)2 is 8 + 8t. this deriv- 
ative is zero at t = - i. so the closest  point is (-  1, 1, - 1). 
question 5  where does the line meet  the plane x + y + z  = 1 i? 
answer  equation  (6) gives  x + y + z = 3 + 4t = 11. so  t  = 2.  the  meeting  point  is 
x = t = 2 ,  y = t + 2 = 4 , z = l + 2 t = 5 .  
question 6  what line goes through (3, 1, 1) perpendicular to the plane x - y - z = 1 ? 
answer  the  normal  vector  to  the  plane  is  n = i - j - k.  that  is  v.  the  position 
vector  to (3, 1, 1) is r,  = 3i + j + k. then r = r,  + tv. 

comparing lines and  planes 

a line has one parameter or two equations. we give the starting point  and velocity: 
(x, y, z) = (x,,  yo, z,  ) + t(v, , v2, v,).  that  tells  directly  which  points  are  on  the  line. 
or we eliminate t  to find  the two equations in (5). 
a  plane  has  one  equation  or  two  parameters!  the  equation  is  ax + by + cz = d. 
that tells us indirectly  which  points are on the plane. (instead of  knowing x, y, z, we 
know  the equation  they  satisfy.  instead  of  directions v  and  w in  the  plane,  we  are 
told  the  perpendicular  direction  n =(a, b, c).) with  parameters,  the  line  contains 
r,  + tv  and the  plane  contains r,  + tv + sw. a plane  looks worse  with  parameters 
(t and s), a line looks better. 

questions  5  and  6 connected  lines  to planes.  here  are  two  more.  see  problems 

4 1 -44: 
question 7  when is the line r, + tv parallel to the plane? when is it perpendicular? 
answer  the test  is  v  n = 0. the test  is v  x n = 0. 

example 4  find  the  plane  containing  po = ( i ,  2,  1)  and  the  line  of  points 
(1,0,0) + t(2,0,  - 1). that vector  v  will  be  in the plane. 

12.1  the position vector 

solution  the vector v = 2i -k goes along the line. the vector w = 2j + k goes from 
(1,0,o) to (1,2, 1). their cross product is 

the plane 2x -2y + 42 = 2 has this normal n and contains the point (1,2,1). 

speed,  direction, disiance, acceleration 

we go back to the curve traced out by r(t). the derivative v(t) = dr/dt is the velocity 
vector along that curve. the speed is the magnitude of  v: 

speed = ivl=  j(dx/dt)'  + (dyldt)'  + (dzldt)'. 

(7) 
the direction of  the velocity vector is v/lvl.  this is a unit vector, since v is divided by 
its length. the unit tangent  vector v/lvl  is denoted by  t. 

the tangent  vector is constant for lines. it changes direction for curves. 

example 5  (important)  find v and (v(and t for steady motion around a circle: 

x = r cos a t ,   y = r sin a t ,   z = 0. 

solution  the position vector is r = r cos wt i + r sin wt j. the velocity is 
(tangent, not unit tangent) 

v = dr/dt = -wr  sin wt i + wr  cos wt j 

the speed is the radius r times the angular velocity w: 

~ v l =,/(-or 

sin cot)'  + (wr cos wt12 = wr. 

the unit tangent  vector is v  divided by  ivl: 

t =  -sin  wt i+cos wt j 

(length 1 since sin2wt + cos2wt= 1). 

think next about the distance traveled. distance along a curve is always denoted 
by  s (called arc length). i don't  know why  we  use s-certainly  not  as the initial for 
speed. in  fact  speed is  distance divided by  time.  the ratio  s/t gives average speed; 
dsldt is instantaneous  speed. we are back to chapter 1 and section 8.3, the relation 
of  speed to distance: 

speed lv( = dsldt 

distance s = 1(dsldt) dt = 1lv(t)l dt. 

notice that  (vl and s and t  are scalars. the direction vector is t: 
dr/dt - dr - unit tangent  vector.

in  figure 12.3, the chord length (straight) is  (ari. the arc length (curved) is as.  as 
ar  and as  approach zero, the ratio  jar/asl approaches (ti= 1. 

think finally about the acceleration vector a(t). it is the rate of change of velocity 

(not the rate of  change of  speed):

fig. 12.3  steady motion around a circle. half turn up a helix. 

for steady motion along a line, as in x = t, y = 2 + t, z = 1 + 2t, there is no accelera- 
tion. the second derivatives are all zero. for steady motion around a circle, there is 
acceleration. in driving a  car, you accelerate with  the gas pedal  or the  brake.  you 
also accelerate by  turning the  wheel. it is  the velocity vector  that  changes,  nat  the 
speed. 

example 6  find the distance s(t) and acceleration a(t) for circular motion. 
solution  the speed in example 5 is dsldt = or. after integrating, the distance is s = 
art. at time t we  have gone through an angle of cut. the radius is r, so the distance 
traveled agrees with ot  times r. note that the dimension of  w is l/time. (angles are 
dimensionless.) at  time t = 2n/w we  have gone once around the  circle-to 
s = 2nr 
not  back  to s = 0. 
the acceleration is a = d2r/dt2. remember r = r cos wt i + r sin a t  j: 

a(t) = -w2r cos wt i -w2r sin wt j. 

(10) 
that direction is opposite to r. this is a special motion, with no action on the gas 
pedal or the brake. all  the acceleration is from turning. the magnitude is la1 = w2r, 
with the correct dimension of distance/(timej2. 
example 7  find  v  and s and a around the helix r = cos t i + sin t j + t k. 
solution  the velocity is v = - sin t i + cos t j + k. the speed is 
ds/dt = ivl=  jsin2t  + cos2t + 1 = & (constant). 

then distance is s = f i  t. at  time t = n, a half  turn is complete. the distance along 
the  shadow is  n (a half  circle). the distance along the helix is 8n,  because of  its 
45" slope. 
the unit tangent  vector is velocity/speed, and the acceleration is dvldt: 

t = ( - s i n t i + c o s t j + k ) / &  

a = - c o s t i - s i n t j .  

example 8  find v  and s and a around the ellipse x = cos t, y = 2 sin t, z = 0. 
solution  take derivatives: v = -sin t i + 2 cos t j and lv( = jsin2t  + 4 cos2t. this is 
the speed dsldt. for  the distance s, something bad  happens (or something normal). 
the speed is not  simplified by  sin2t + cos2t = 1. we cannot integrate dsldt to find a 
formula for s. the square root defeats us. 

the acceleration  - cos t i - 2 sin t j still points to the center. this is not the earth

suppose  we  know  the acceleration  a(t) and the initial  velocity  vo  and position  ro.

then v(t)  and r(t)  are also  known.  we  integrate  each  component:

a(t) = constant  : v(t) = vo  + at 
a(t) = cos  t k  =  v(t) = v0 + sin  t k=  r(t) = r0 + vot  - cos  t k.

the  curve  of a baseball

there is  a nice discussion of curve balls in the calculus book by edwards  and penney.
we summarize  it here (optionally).  the ball  leaves  the pitcher's  hand  five  feet  off the
ground: ro = oi  + oj + 5k. the initial velocity is vo  = 120i - 2j + 2k (120  ft/sec is more
than 80 miles  per hour). the acceleration is  - 32k from gravity, plus a new term  from
spin. if the  spin  is  around  the  z  axis,  and  the  ball  goes  along  the  x  axis,  then  this
acceleration  is  in  the y  direction.  (it comes  from the  cross  product  k  x i-there is  a
pressure  difference  on  the sides  of the ball.) a good pitcher  can achieve  a = 16j - 32k.
the  batter  integrates  as  fast  as  he  can:

v(t) = vo  + at = 120i + (-2 + 16t)j + (2 - 32t)k
r(t) = ro  + vot +   at2 = 120t  i + (-2t + 8t2)j + (5 + 2t - 16t 2)k.

notice the  t2. the  effect  of spin is small  at first, then  suddenly  bigger (as every  batter
knows).  so  is  the effect  of gravity-the  ball  starts to dive.  at  t = -, the i component
is  60  feet  and  the  ball  reaches  the  batter.  the  j  component  is  1 foot  and  the  k
component  is  2 feet-the  curve  goes  low  over  the outside  corner.

at  t = 1, when  the batter saw  the ball halfway,  the j component  was zero. it looked

as  if it was  coming  right  over the  plate.

46  from 12:oo to  1:00 a snail crawls steadily out the minute 
hand  (one meter  in  one  hour).  find  its  position  at  time  t 
starting from (0,o). 

the previous section started with r(t). from this position vector we computed v and 
a. now we find r(t) itself, from more basic information. the laws of  physics  govern 
projectiles, and the motion of a wheel produces a cycloid (which enters problems in 
robotics). the projectiles fly without friction, so the only force is gravity. 

these motions occur in a plane. the two components of position will be x (across) 
and y  (up). a  projectile  moves  as  t  changes,  so  we  look  for  x(t)  and  y(t).  we  are 
shooting a basketball  or firing a gun or peacefully  watering the lawn, and we  have 
to aim in the right direction (not directly at the target). if  the hose delivers water at 
10 meters/second,  can you  reach  the car  12 meters away? 

12  motion along a curve 

the  usual initial position  is (0,o). some flights start higher, at (0, h).  the initial 
velocity  is  (v,  cos a,  v,  sin a),  where  v, 
is  the  speed  and  a  is  the  angle  with  the 
horizontal.  the  acceleration from  gravity is  purely  vertical: d 2y/dt2 = -g.  so the 
horizontal velocity stays at its initial value. the upward velocity decreases by  -gt: 

dxldt = v,  cos a, dyldt = vo  sin a -gt. 

the horizontal distance x(t) is steadily increasing. the height y(t) increases and then 
decreases. to find the position, integrate the velocities (for a high  start add h to y): 

the projectile path  is x(t) = (v,  cos a)t ,y(t) = (vo sin a)t - igt2. 

(1) 
this path is a parabola. but  it is not  written as y = ax2+ bx + c. it could be, if  we 
eliminated t. then we would lose track of  time. the parabola is y(x), with no param- 
eter, where we  have x(t) and y(t). 

basic question: where does the projectile hit the ground? for the parabola, we solve 
y(x) = 0. that gives the position x. for the projectile we  solve y(t) = 0. that gives the 
time it hits the ground, not the place. if  that  time is  t, then x(t) gives the place. 
the information is there. it takes two steps instead of  one, but  we  learn more. 

example 1  water leaves the hose at 10 meters/second (this is v,).  it starts up at the 
angle a. find the time  t when y is zero again, and find where the projectile lands. 
solution  the  flight ends  when  y = (10 sin a)t -igt2 = 0. the  flight time  is  t = 
(20 sin a)/g. at  that  time, the horizontal distance is 

x(t) = (10 cos a)t = (200 cos a sin a)/g. this is the range r. 

the projectile (or water from the hose) hits the ground at x = r. to simplify, replace 
200 cos a sin a by  100 sin 2a. since g = 9.8 meters/sec2, we  can't  reach the car: 

the range r = (100 sin 2~)/9.8 is  at most  10019.8. this is less than  12. 

the range is  greatest when  sin 2a = i  (a is 45"). to  reach  12 meters we  could stand 
on a ladder (problem 14). to hit  a baseball  against air resistance, the best  angle is 
nearer to 35". figure 12.5 shows symmetric parabolas (no air resistance) and unsym- 
metric flight paths that drop more steeply. 

(128  the flight time  t and the horkzontaf  range  r = x(t) are reached when 
y = 0,which means (uo sin a)t =igt2:

example 2  what are the correct angles a for a given range r and given v,? 
two 
solution  the  range  is  r = (vi sin 2a)lg. this  determines the  sine of  2a-but 
angles can have the same  sine. we might find 2a = 60"  or  120". the starting angles 
a = 30" and a = 60" in figure 12.5 give the same sin 2a and the same range r. the 
flight times contain  sin a and are different. 

by  calculus, the maximum height occurs when dyldt = 0. then vo sin a =gt, which 
time going up 

means that t = (v,  sin ix)/g. this is half  of  the total flight time  t-the 
equals the time coming down. the value of y at this halfway time t =ftis

example 3  if  a ski jumper  goes 90 meters down a 30" slope, after taking off at 28 
meterslsecond, find equations for the flight time and the ramp angle a. 
solution  the jumper lands at the point x = 90 cos 30  , y = -90 sin 30" (minus sign 
for obvious reasons). the basic equation (2) is x = (28 cos a)t, y = (28 sin a)t -fgt 2. 
those are two equations for a and t.  note that t is not  t, the flight time to y =0. 
conclusion  the position of a projectile involves three parameters vo, a, and t. three 
pieces  of information determine theflight (almost). the reason for the word almost is 
the presence of  sin a and cos a. some flight requirements cannot be  met (reaching a 
car at 12 meters). other requirements can be met in two ways (when the car is close). 
the equation sin ct = c is more likely to have no solution or two solutions than exactly 
one solution. 

watch for the three pieces of information in each problem. when a football starts 
at  v,  = 20  meterslsecond  and  hits  the  ground  at  x = 40  meters,  the  third  fact  is 
. this is like a lawyer who is asked the fee and says $1000 for three questions. 
"isn't  that  steep?"  says  the  client.  "yes,"  says  the  lawyer,  "now  what's  your  last 
question?" 

a projectile's path is a parabola. to compute it, eliminate t from the equations for x 
and y.  problem 5 finds y = ax2 + bx, a  parabola  through the  origin. the path  of  a 
point on a wheel seems equally simple, but eliminating t is virtually impossible. the 
cycloid is a curve that really needs and uses a parameter. 

to trace out a cycloid, roll a circle of radius a along  the x axis. watch the point 
that starts at the bottom of  the circle. it comes back to the bottom at x = 2na, after 
a complete turn of  the circle. the path in between is shown in  figure 12.6. after a 
century of looking for the xy equation, a series of great scientists (galileo, christopher 
wren, huygens, bernoulli, even newton and l'h6pital) found the right way to study 
a cycloid-by 

introducing a parameter. we will call it 8; it could also be t. 

fig. 12.6  path of p on a rolling circle is a cycloid. fastest slide to q. 

12  motion along a curve 

the parameter is the angle 0 through which the circle turns. (this angle is not  at 
the  origin, like 0 in  polar  coordinates.) the circle rolls a  distance a0, radius  times 
angle, along the x axis. so the center of  the circle is at x =a0, y = a. to account for 
the segment cp, subtract a sin 0 from x and a cos 0 from y: 

the point  p  has x = a(0 - sin 0) and y =a(l -cos 0). 

(3) 
at 0 =0 the position is (0,o). at 0 =271  the position is (271a, 0). in between, the slope 
of  the cycloid comes from the chain rule: 

dyld0 

dy 
---- 
dx - dxld0 - a(l - cos 0)' 

a sin 0 

this is infinite at 0 =0. the point on the circle starts straight upward and the cycloid 
has a cusp. note how all calculations use the parameter 0.  we go quickly: 
question 1  find the area under  one arch of  the cycloid (0 =0 to 0 =27c). 
answer  the area is 1y dx =1;" a(l - cos 0)a(l - cos @db. this equals 37ca2. 
question 2  find the length of  the arch, using ds =j ( d x / d ~ ) ~+(dy/d6)2 do. 
answer  1ds =5:"  a&-
now substitute 1 -cos 0 =2 sin2 $6.  the square root is 2 sin 40. the length is 8a. 
question 3  if  the cycloid is turned over (y is downward), find the time to slide to 
the bottom. the slider starts with  v =0 at y =0. 
answer  kinetic  plus  potential  energy  is  f mv2-mgy =0  (it  starts  from zero  and 
can't  change). so the speed is v =f i .this is dsldt and we  know ds:

check dimensions: a =distance, g =di~tance/(time)~, 
est  sliding  time for  any  curve. the  cycloid  solves  the  "brachistochrone  problem," 
which  minimizes the time down curves from 0 to q (figure 12.6). you  might think 
a  straight  path  would  be  quicker-it 
is  certainly  shorter.  a straight  line  has  the 
equation x =71~12, so the sliding time is

instead  of  publishing  his  solution,  john  bernoulli  turned  this  problem  into  an 
international challenge: prove that the cycloid gives the fastest  slide. most mathemati- 
cians couldn't  do it. the problem  reached isaac newton  (this was later  in  his life). 
as you would expect, newton solved it. for some reason he sent back his proof with 
no name. but when bernoulli received the answer, he was not fooled for a moment: 
"i  recognize the lion by  his claws." 

what is also amazing is a further property of the cycloid: the time to q is the same 
ifyou begin anywhere along the path. starting from rest at p instead of  0 ,  the bottom 
is  reached  at  the  same  time.  this  time  bernoulli got  carried  away: "you  will  be 
petrified with astonishment  when i say...". 

there are other beautiful curves, closely related to the cycloid. for an epicycloid, 
the  circle rolls  around the  outside  of  another  circle. for  a  hypocycloid, the  rolling 
circle is inside the fixed circle. the astroid is the special case with radii in the ratio  1 
to 4. it is the curved star in problem 34, where x = a cos36 and y = a sin30. 

12.2  plane motion: projectiles and cycloids 

the cycloid even  solves the  old puzzle:  what point  moves  backward  when a  train 
starts jbrward?  the  train  wheels  have  a  flange that  extends  below  the  track,  and 
dxldt <:  0 at the bottom of  the flange.

12.3  curvature and normal vector 

459 

a driver produces acceleration three ways-by 
the gas pedal, the brake, and steering 
wheel. the first two change the speed. turning the wheel changes the direction. all 
three change the velocity (they give acceleration). for steady motion around a circle, 
the  change is  from  steering-the 
acceleration dvldt  points  to the  center. we  now 
look at motion  along other curves, to separate change in the speed ivl  from change 
in the direction t. 

the  direction  of  motion  is  t = vllvl.  it  depends  on  the  path  but  not  the  speed 

(because we  divide by  ivl). for turning we  measure two things: 
1.  how fast t turns:  this will be the curvature k  (kappa). 
2.  which direction t turns:  this will be the normal vector n. 

k  and n depend, like s and t, only on the shape of  the curve. replacing t by  2t or 
t2 leaves them unchanged. for a circle we  give the answers in advance. the normal 
vector n points to the center. the curvature k is llradius. 

a smaller turning circle means a larger curvature k: more bending.. 
the curvature k is change in direction (dti divided by change in position  idsl. there 
are three formulas for rc-a 
direct one for graphs y(x), a brutal but valuable one for 
any parametric curve (x(t), y(t)), and a neat formula that uses the vectors v and a. we 
begin  with the definition and the neat formula. 

definition  k = ldt/ds) 

formula 

rc  = lv  x al/lvi3 

(1) 

the definition does not involve the parameter  t-but 
the calculations do. the posi- 
tion vector r(t) yields v = dr/dt and a = dvldt. if  t is changed to 2t, the velocity v is 
doubled and r is multiplied by 4. then lv  x a1  and lv13 are multiplied by  8, and their 
ratio  k  is unchanged. 
proof of formula (1)  start from v = jvlt and compute its derivative a: 

a = - t + ivl - by the product  rule. 

dt

now  take the cross product with v = ivjt. remember that t x t = 0: 

we  know that  it1 = 1. equation (4) will  show that  t  is perpendicular  to dtldt. so 
iv  x a1  is the first length ivl  times the second length ivl idtidtl. the factor sin 8 in the 
length of  a cross product  is  1 from the 90" angle. in other words 

the chain rule brings the extra ids/dt( = ivl  into the denominator. 

before any examples, we  show that dt/dt is perpendicular to t. the reason is that 

t is a unit vector. differentiate both sides of  t  t = 1: 

12  motion along a curve 

that  proof  used  the  product  rule  u ' * v  + u *v' for  the  derivative  of  u * v  
(problem 23, with u = v = t). think of the vector t moving around the unit sphere. 
to keep a constant length  (t + d t)  (t + dt) = 1, we  need  2t  dt = 0.  movement 
dt is perpendicular to radius vector t. 

our first examples will be plane curves. the position vector r(t) has components 
x(t) and  y(t) but  no  z(t). look  at the  components of  v  and  a  and  v  x a  (x'  means

equation (5) is the brutal but valuable formula for k .  apply it to movement around 
a circle. we should find  k = llradius a: 

example 1  when x = a cos wt  and y = a sin wt  we  substitute x',  y',  x", y" into (5):

this is 03a2/w3a3 and w cancels. the speed makes no difference to k  = lla. 

the  third  formula  for  k  applies  to  an  ordinary  plane  curve given  by  y(x). the 

parameter t is x!  you  see the square root in the speed ivl=  dsldx: 

in practice this is the most popular formula for k .  the most popular approximation 
is id 2y/dx21. (the denominator is omitted.) for the bending of  a beam, the nonlinear 
equation uses  ic  and the linear equation uses d 2 y / d ~ 2 .  we  can see  the difference for 
a parabola: 
example 2  the curvature of  y = +x2 is ic = ly"l/(l + (y')2)312  = 1/(1 + x ~ ) ~ / ~ .  

fig. 12.7  normal  n divided by  curvature  k for circle and parabola and unit  helix. 

12.3  cunrature and normal vector 

the approximation is y"  = 1. this agrees with  k at x =0, where the parabola turns 
the corner. but for large x, the curvature approaches zero. far out on the parabola, 
we go a long way for a small change in direction. 

the parabola y = -fx2, opening down, has the same u.  now try a space curve. 
example 3  find the curvature of  the unit helix r = cos t i + sin t j + tk. 
take the cross product  of  v = -sin t i + cos t j + k and a = -cos t i -sin t j:

this cross product has length d.also the speed is (v( = jsin2t  + cos2t+ 1 = f i  

k = iv x al/lv13= 

=f. 

compare with a unit circle. without the climbing term tk, the curvature would be  1. 
because of  climbing, each turn of  the helix is longer and k = f .  
that makes one think: is the helix twice as long as the circle? no. the length of  a 
turn  is only increased  by  lvl  = $.  the other $ is  because  the  tangent  t  slopes 
upward. the shadow in the base turns a full 360  , but  t turns less. 

the  normal vector  n 

the discussion is bringing us to an important vector. where k measures the rate of 
turning, the unit vector n gives the direction of turning. n is perpendicular to t, and 
in the plane that leaves practically no choice. turn left  or right. for a space curve, 
follow dt.remember equation (4), which makes dt perpendicular to t. 

the normal vector n is a unit  vector along dt/dt. it  is perpendicular  to t: 

dt/ds

definition  n = -- - - formula  n=-

dt/dt 
(dt/dt(' 

t = v/lv(= (-sin 

t i + cos t j + k)/fi  and  dt/dt = (- cos t i - sin t j)/& 

to  change  dt/dt  into  a  unit  vector,  cancel  the a.the  normal  vector  is  n = 

-cos t i - sin t j.  it is perpendicular to t. since the k component is zero, n is hori- 
zontal. the tangent t  slopes up at 45"-it 
goes around  the circle at that  latitude. 
the normal  n  is tangent  to this circle (n is tangent  to the  path  of  the  tangent!). 
so n  stays horizontal as the helix climbs. 

there is also a third direction, perpendicular to t and n. it is the binormal vector 
b = t x n,  computed  in  problems  25-30.  the  unit  vectors  t,  n,  b  provide  the 
natural coordinate system for the path-along 
the curve, in the plane of  the curve, 
and  out of  that plane.  the theory is beautiful  but  the computations are not  often 
done-we 

stop here.

tangential and  normal components of acceleration 

may  i  return  a  last  time  to the  gas  pedal  and brake and steering wheel?  the first 
two give acceleration along t. turning gives acceleration along n. the rate of turning 
(curvature k) and  the  direction  n  are  established.  we  now  ask  about  the force 
required.  newton's  law  is  f = ma,  so  we  need  the  acceleration  a-especially 
its 
component  along t and its component  along n. 

the acceleration is a = 7t + k  - n.

example 6  find the components of a for circular speed-up r(t) = cos t 2  i + sin t 2  j. 
without stopping to think, compute dr/dt = v and dsldt = ivl  and v/lvl= t: 

the derivative of  dsldt = ivl  is d2s/dt2 = 2.  the derivative of  v  is a: 

a =  - 2   sin t 2  i + 2  cos t 2  j-4t2  cos t 2  i-4t2  sin t 2 j .  

in the first terms of a we  see 2t. in the last terms we must be seeing k ~ v ~ ~ n .

12.4  polar coordinates and planetary motion 

this  section has  a  general purpose-to  do vector calculus in polar  coordinates. it 
to study central forces  and the motion of planets. the 
also has a specific purpose- 
main gravitational force on a planet is from the sun. it is a central force, because it 
comes from the sun at the center. polar coordinates are natural, so the two purposes 
go together. 

you  may  feel that  the planets  are too  old  for  this  course. but  kepler's  laws are 

more  than  theorems, they  are something  special  in  the  history  of  mankind-"the 
greatest scientific discovery of all time."  if  we  can recapture that glory we  should do 
it. part of  the greatness is in the difficulty-kepler  was  working sixty years before 
newton  discovered calculus. from pages of  observations, and some terrific guesses, 
a theory  was  born.  we  will  try  to preserve the greatness without  the difficulty, and 
show how elliptic orbits come from calculus. the first conclusion is quick. 

motion in a central force #eld  always stays in a plane. 

f is  a  multiple  of  the  vector  r  from  the  origin  (central force). f also  equals  ma 
(newton's  law). therefore r  and  a are in  the same direction and  r x a = 0. then 
r x v  has zero derivative and is constant: 

by  the product rule:  -(r  x v ) = v   x v + r  x a=o+o. 

d 
dt 

(1) 

r x v  is a constant vector h. so r  stays in the plane perpendicular to h. 

how  does  a  planet  move  in  that  plane? we  turn  to  polar  coordinates.  at  each 
point  except the origin (where the sun is), u,  is the unit  vector  ointing outward. it is 
the position  vector r divided by  its length r (which is ~

j

:

 

d
u,  = r/r = (xi + yj)/r = cos 8 i + sin 8 j. 

(2) 
that  is  a  unit  vector  because  cos28 + sin28 = 1.  it  goes  out  from  the  center. 
figure 12.9 shows u,  and the second unit vector u,  at a 90" angle: 

the dot product is u,  u,  = 0. the subscripts r and 8 indicate direction (not derivative). 
question 1:  how do u,  and ue change as r changes (out a ray)?  they don't. 
question 2:  how do u,  and u,  change as 8 changes? take the derivative: 

dujd8  = -sin  8 i + cos 8 j = ue 
du,/d8 = - cos 8 i - sin 8 j = - u,. 

12.4  polar coordinates and planetary motion 

fig. 12.9  u,  is outward, uo is around the center. components of v  and a in those directions. 

since u,  = rlr, one formula is simple: the position vector is r = ru,.  for its derivative 
v = dr/dt, use the chain rule du,/dt  = (dur/d8)(d8/dt)= (do/dt)u,: 

the velocity is v = -(ru,) = -u,  + r -u, .

dr 
dt 

d8
dt 

d 
dt 

the outward speed is drldt. the circular speed is r do/dt. the sum of  squares is lvi2. 
return one more time to steady motion around a circle, say r = 3 and 8 = 2t. the 
velocity is v = h e ,  all circular. the acceleration is  -124, all inward.  for circles u, 
is the tangent vector t. but the unit vector u,  points outward and n points inward- 
the way  the curve turns. 

now  we  tackle  acceleration  for  any  motion  in  polar  coordinates.  there  can  be 
speedup in r and speedup in 8 (also change of  direction). differentiate v in (5) by  the 
product rule: 

for du,/dt  and due/dt, multiply equation (4) by d8ldt. then all terms contain u,  or u,. 
the formula for a is famous but not popular (except it got us to the moon): 

in the steady motion  with r = 3 and 8 = 2t, only one acceleration  term  is nonzero: 
a = - 12u,. formula (6) can be memorized (maybe). problem  14 gives a new way  to 
reach it, using reie. 

example 1  find r and v  and a for speedup 8 = t2 around the circle r = 1. 
solution  the position  vector is r = u,.  then v and a come from (5-6): 

this question and answer were also in example 6 of the previous section. the acceler- 
ation was 2t + 4t2n. notice again that t = u,  and n = - u,,  going round the circle. 

example 2  find r and v  and ivl  and a for the spiral motion  r = 3t, 8 = 2t. 
solution  the position  vector is r = 3t u,.  equation (5) gives velocity and speed: 

v = 3 4  + 6tu, 

and 

ivl= jm. 

12  motion along a curve 

the motion  goes out  and also  around. from  (6) the  acceleration  is  -12t  u, + 12ue. 
the same answers would  come more slowly from r = 3t cos 2t i + 3t sin 2t j. 

this example uses polar coordinates, but the motion is not circular. one of kepler's 

inspirations, after many struggles, was to get away from circles. 

kepler's laws 

you may know that before newton and leibniz and calculus and polar coordinates, 
johannes kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion. he was the court mathe- 
matician  to  the  holy  roman  emperor,  who  mostly  wanted  predictions  of  wars. 
kepler  also  determined  the  date of  every  easter-no 
small problem.  his  triumph 
was  to  discover  patterns  in  the  observations  made  by  astronomers  (especially by 
tycho brahe). galileo and copernicus expected  circles, but  kepler found ellipses. 

law  1:  each planet  travels in an ellipse with  one focus at the sun. 
law 2:  the vector  from  sun  to planet  sweeps  out area  at a  steady  rate:  da/dt = 
constant. 
law 3:  the length  of  the  planet's  year  is  t = ka3i2, where  a = maximum  distance 
from the center (not the sun) and k = 2n/@ 

is the same for all planets. 

with calculus the proof  of  these laws is a thousand times  quicker. but  law 2 is the 
only easy one. the sun exerts a central force. equation (i) gave r x v = h = constant 
for central forces. replace r by  ru,  and replace v  by equation (5): 

this vector h is constant, so its length  h = r2do/dt is constant. in polar coordinates, 
the area is  da =$r2d0. this area da  is  swept  out by  the planet  (figure 12.10), and 
we  have proved  law 2: 

da/dt =i r 2  d01dt =i h = constant. 

(8) 

near the sun r is small. so d0ldt is big and planets  go around faster. 

fig. 12.10  the planet  is on an ellipse with  the sun at a focus. note a, b,  c, q. 

now  for  law  1, about ellipses. we are aiming for  1 /r = c - d cos 0, which  is  the 
polar  coordinate equation  of  an  ellipse. it  is  easier  to write  q than  llr, and  find  an 
equation  for  q.  the  equation  we  will  reach  is  d 'q/d02 + q = c.  the  desired  q = 
c - d cos 0 solves that equation (check this), and gives us  kepler's  ellipse. 

12.4  polar coordinates and planetary motion 

the first step is to connect dr/dt to dqlde by  the chain rule: 

notice especially db/dt =h/r2=hq2. what we  really want are second derivatives: 

after this trick of introducing q, we are ready for physics. the planet obeys newton's 
law f =ma, and the central force f is the sun's  gravity: 

that right side is the u,  component of  a in (6). change r to l/q and change db/dt to 
hq2. the  preparation  in  (10) allows  us  to  rewrite  d2r/dt2 in  equation  (11). that 
equation becomes 

dividing by  -h2q2 gives what we  hoped for-the 

simple equation for q: 

d 'q/db2 +q = g m / ~ ~= c (a constant). 

(12) 
the solution is q = c -d cos 8. section 9.3 gave this polar equation for an ellipse or 
parabola or hyperbola. to be sure it is an ellipse, an astronomer computes c and d 
from the sun's mass m and the constant g and the earth's position and velocity.  the 
main point is that c >d.  then q is never zero and r is never infinite. hyperbolas and 
parabolas are ruled out, and the orbit in figure 12.10 must be an ellipse.? 

astronomy  is really impressive. you  should visit  the greenwich observatory in 
london, to see how  halley watched his comet. he amazed the world by  predicting 
the  day  it  would  return. also  the  discovery of  neptune  was  pure  mathematics- 
the path of  uranus was not accounted for by  the sun and known planets. leverrier 
computed a point in  the sky and asked  a  berlin  astronomer to look. sure enough 
neptune was there. 

recently one more problem was solved-to  explain the gap in the asteroids around 
three-body  problem  goes  unstable  and  an 

jupiter.  the  reason  is  "chaos"-the 
asteroid won't  stay in that  orbit. we  have come a long way from circles. 

department  of  royal  mistakes  the last  pound  note issued by  the  royal  mint 
showed  newton  looking up from his  great  book  principia mathematica. he  is  not 
smiling and we  can see why. the artist put  the sun at the center! newton has just 
proved it is at the focus. true, the focus is marked s  and the planet is p. but  those 
rays at the center brought untold headaches to the mint-the  note is out of  circula- 
tion. i gave an antique dealer three pounds for it (in coins). 

kepler's  third law  gives  the  time  t to  go  around  the ellipse-the  planet's  year. 
what is special in the formula is a3iz-and  for kepler himself, the 15th of  may  1618 
was unforgettable: "the  right ratio outfought the darkness of  my  mind, by  the great 
proof afforded by my  labor of  seventeen years on brahe's  observations." the second

to  think  of kepler  guessing  a 3/ 2  is  amazing.  to  think  of  newton  proving  kepler's
laws  by  calculus  is  also  wonderful--because  we  can  do  it  too.

example  3  when  a  satellite  goes around  in a  circle,  find  the  time  t.
let  r be  the  radius  and  ca  be  the  angular  velocity.  the  time  for  a  complete  circle
(angle  2in)  is  t = 27t/w.  the acceleration  is  gm/r2  from gravity, and  it is  also  ro 2  for
circular  motion.  therefore  kepler  is  proved  right:

rw)2 = gm/r2

so  gm= =  t = 27r/w  = 2nr 3/2/  gm.

partial derivatives

this chapter is at the center of  multidimensional calculus. other chapters and other 
topics may be  optional; this chapter and these topics are required. we  are back  to 
the basic idea of  calculus-the  derivative. there is a functionf, the variables move a 
little bit, and f  moves.  the question is how much f  moves  and how fast. chapters 
1-4  answered this question for f(x), a function of  one variable. now we  have f(x, y) 
orf(x, y, z)-with 
two or three or more variables that move independently. as  x and 
y change,f  changes. the fundamental problem of  id128 is to connect 
ax  and ay to af. 

calculus solves that problem in the limit. it connects dx and dy to df. in using this 
language i am building on the work  already done. you  know that dfldx is the limit 
of  aflax.  calculus computes the rate of  change-which 
is the slope of  the tangent 
line. the goal is to extend those ideas to 

f(x, y,  z) = 2x + 3y + 42. 
fix,  y) = x2 - y2 
these functions have graphs, they have derivatives, and they must have tangents.

13  partial  derivatives

13.1  surfaces  and  level  curves

the  graph  of  y =f(x)  is  a  curve  in  the  xy  plane.  there  are  two  variables-x  is
independent  and free,  y  is dependent  on x. above x on  the base  line is the point (x, y)
on  the  curve.  the  curve  can  be  displayed  on  a two-dimensional  printed  page.

the  graph  of z =f(x, y) is  a surface in xyz  space. there  are three variables-x and
y are independent,  z  is dependent.  above  (x, y) in the base  plane  is the  point (x, y, z)
on  the  surface  (figure  13.1).  since  the  printed  page  remains  two-dimensional,  we
shade or color or project the surface.  the eyes are extremely  good at converting  two-
dimensional images into three-dimensional  understanding--they  get a lot of practice.
the mathematical part of our brain also  has something new to work  on-two partial
derivatives.

this  section  uses examples  and figures  to illustrate  surfaces  and their  level curves.

the  next section  is  also  short.  then  the  work  begins.

example  i  describe the  surface and the  level curves  for  z =f(x, y) = 
x 2 + y2  is  the distance  in the  base  plane  from (0, 0)
the surface is a cone. reason: 
to (x, y).  when  we go out  a distance  5 in the base  plane,  we go  up  the same distance
5 to  the  surface.  the  cone  climbs with  slope  1. the  distance  out to  (x, y) equals  the
distance  up  to z  (this is  a  450  cone).

x2 +  y2.

the level  curves  are circles. at  height  5, the  cone  contains  a  circle  of points-all
x2 + y2 at
at the same "level"  on the  surface. the  plane z = 5 meets the surface  z = 
those  points  (figure 13.1b).  the  circle  below  them  (in  the  base  plane)  is  the  level
curve.
definition  a  level curve or contour line of z =f(x, y) contains  all  points  (x, y) that
share the same valuef(x, y) =  c. above  those points,  the surface  is at the height z = c.

there  are  different  level  curves  for  different  c.  to  see  the  curve  for  c = 2,  cut
through  the  surface  with  the  horizontal  plane  z = 2.  the  plane  meets  the  surface
above  the points  where f(x, y) =  2.  the  level curve in the base plane has the equation
f(x, y) = 2. above  it are all the  points at "level  2"  or "level  c"  on the  surface.

every  curve f(x, y) = c  is  labeled  by  its  constant  c.  this  produces  a  contour map
(the  base  plane  is  full  of  curves).  for  the  cone,  the  level  curves  are  given  by
.x 2 + y2 = c,  and the contour  map  consists  of circles  of radius c.
question  what  are  the level  curves  of z =f(x, y) = x2 + y2?
answer  still circles. but the  surface  is not  a cone (it bends  up like  a parabola). the
circle  of radius  3 is the level  curve  x2 + y2 = 9. on the surface  above,  the height is  9.

example  2  for  the  linear function f(x, y) = 2x + y,  the  surface  is  a  plane.  its  level
curves  are  straight  lines.  the  surface  z =  2x + y  meets  the plane z =  c  in  the  line
2x + y = c.  that  line is  above the base  plane  when c is  positive,  and below when  c is
negative.  the  contour  lines  are  in the  base  plane.  figure  13.2b  labels  these  parallel
lines  according  to their  height  in the  surface.
question 
answer  no.  the  surface  z = y/x  has  level  curves  y/x  = c. those  lines  y = cx  swing
around  the  origin,  as  the  surface  climbs  like  a spiral  playground  slide.

if the  level curves  are  all  straight lines,  must  they be  parallel?

example  3  the weather map  shows contour  lines of the temperature function. each
level  curve  connects  points  at a constant  temperature.  one  line  runs from  seattle  to
omaha  to cincinnati to  washington.  in winter it is  painful  even  to think about  the
line  through  l.a.  and  texas  and  florida.  usa  today  separates  the  contours  by
color,  which  is  better. we  had never  seen  a  map  of universities.

question  from a contour map, how do you find the highest point? 
answer  the level curves form loops around the maximum point. as  c increases the 
loops become tighter. similarly the curves squeeze to the lowest point as c decreases. 

example 4  a contour map of a mountain may be the best example of all. normally 
the level curves are separated by  100 feet in height. on a steep trail those curves are 
bunched together-the 
trail climbs quickly. in a flat region the contour lines are far 
apart. water runs perpendicular to the level curves. on my map of  new  hampshire 
that is true of  creeks but looks doubtful for rivers. 
question  which direction in the base plane is uphill on the surface? 
answer  the steepest direction is perpendicular to the level curves. this is important. 
proof to come. 

example 5  in economics x2y is a utility function  and x2y = c is an indiference  c u m .  
the utility function x2y gives the value of  x  hours awake and y  hours asleep. two 
hours awake and fifteen minutes asleep have the value f  = (22)(4). this is the same as 
one hour of  each: f =(12)(1). those lie on the same level curve in  figure 13.4a. we 
are indifferent, and willing to exchange any two points on a level curve. 

the indifference curve is "convex."  we prefer  the average of any  two points.  the 
line between two points is up on higher level curves. 
figure 13.4b shows an extreme case. the level curves are straight lines 4x + y  = c. 
four quarters are freely substituted for one dollar. the value is f  = 4x + y  dollars. 
figure 13.4~ shows the  other  extreme. extra left  shoes or  extra right  shoes are 

useless. the value (or utility) is the smaller  of  x and y.  that counts pairs  of  shoes.

partial derivatives 

the central idea of  id128 is the derivative. a  change in x produces a 
change in$  the ratio af/ax  approaches the derivative, or slope, or rate of  change. 
what to do iff  depends on both x and y? 
the new idea is to vary x and y one at a timk. first, only x moves. if  the function 
is x + xy, then af  is ax + yax. the ratio af/ax  is  1+ y. the "x derivative"  of  x + xy 

13  partial derhratives 

is 1 + y.  for all functions the method is the same: keep y constant, change x, take the 
firnit of aflax: 

definition 

df(x, y) = lim  -=  lim f(x + ax, y) -f (x, y)
ax 

a x - o a x  

af 

ax 

ax-o 

on the left is a new symbol af/dx.  it signals that only x is allowed to vary-afpx 
is 
a partial derivative. the different form a of  the same letter (still say "d")  is a reminder 
that x is not the only variable. another variable y is present but not moving. 

do  not  treat  y  as  zero!  treat  it  as  a  constant,  like  6.  its  x  derivative  is  zero. 
if f(x) = sin 6x then dfldx  = 6 cos 6x. if f(x, y) = sin xy then af/ax = y cos xy. 

spoken aloud,  af/ax  is  still "d f d x."  it  is  a function of  x  and  y.  when more is 
needed, call it "the partial off with respect to x."  the symbol f '  is no longer available, 
since it gives no special indication about x. its replacement fx  is pronounced "fx"  or 
"fsub  x,"  which is shorter than af/ax  and means the same thing. 

we may also want to indicate the point (x,,  yo) where the derivative is computed: 

example 2  f(x, y) = sin 2x cos y 

fx  = 2 cos 2x cos y 

(cos y is constant for a/dx) 

the  particular  point  (x,,  yo) is  (0,o).  the  height  of  the  surface  is f(0,o) = 0. 
the  slope in  the  x  direction  is fx  = 2.  at  a  different  point  x,  = n,  yo = n  we  find 
fx(n, n) = - 2. 

now keep x constant and vary y.  the ratio af/ay  approaches aflay: 

f,(x, y) = lim  f=  lim f(x, y + by) -f(x,  y) 

ay+o  ay 

a ~ + o  

ay 

this is the slope in the y direction. please realize that  a surface can go up in the x 
direction and down in the y direction. the plane f(x, y) = 3x - 4y has fx  = 3 (up) and 
f ,= - 4 (down). we will soon ask what happens in the 45"  direction. 

the x derivative of  ,/xz+y'is really one-variable calculus, because y is constant. 
the exponent drops from 4to  -i,and there is 2x from the chain rule.  this distance 
function  has the curious derivative af/ax = xlf. 

the  graph  is  a  cone.  above  the  point  (0,2)  the  height  is  ,/-= 

2.  the 
partial  derivatives are fx  = 012  and f, = 212.  at  that point,  figure13.5 climbs in the 
y direction. it is level in the x direction. an  actual step ax  will increase o2 + 22 to 
ax)^ + 22. but this change is of  order (ax)2 and the x derivative is zero. 

figure 13.5 is  rather  important.  it shows how  af@x and  af/dy  are the  ordinary 
derivatives of f(x, yo) and f(x,,  y). it is natural to call these partial functions. the first 
has y fixed  at yo while x varies. the second has x fixed  at xo while y varies. their 
graphs are cross sections down the surface-cut  out by  the vertical planes y = yo and 
x = x,.  remember that the level curve is cut out by  the horizontal plane z = c.

the  limits  of af/ax  and  af/ay  are  computed  as  always.  with  partial  functions
we  are  back  to a  single  variable.  the  partial derivative  is the ordinary derivative  of a
partial function  (constant  y  or  constant  x).  for  the  cone,  af/ay  exists  at  all  points
except  (0, 0).  the  figure  shows  how  the  cross  section  down  the  middle  of the  cone
produces  the absolute  value function:f(0, y) =  lyl.  it has one-sided  derivatives  but not
a  two-sided  derivative.

similarly  of/ax  will  not  exist at  the  sharp  point  of the  cone.  we develop  the  idea
of a  continuous function f(x, y)  as  needed  (the  definition  is  in  the  exercises).  each
partial  derivative  involves  one direction,  but  limits  and  continuity  involve  all  direc-
tions. the  distance  function is  continuous  at (0, 0),  where  it is  not differentiable.

af/ox =  - 2x 

example  4  f(x,  y)  = y 
move  in  the  x  direction  from  (1, 3).  then  y 2 - x 2  has  the  partial  function  9 - x 2 .
with y  fixed  at  3, a  parabola  opens  downward.  in  the  y  direction  (along x =  1) the
partial  function  y2  - 1 opens  upward. the surface  in figure  13.6  is called  a hyperbolic
paraboloid, because the level  curves y 2 -_  2 = c are  hyperbolas.  most  people call  it a
saddle,  and  the  special  point  at  the  origin is  a  saddle point.

of/ay  = 2y

the  origin  is  special  for  y2  - x 2  because  both  derivatives  are  zero.  the  bottom of
the  y parabola at (0, 0) is the  top of the x parabola. the  surface  is  momentarily  flat  in
all  directions.  it is  the top of a hill and  the bottom of a mountain  range  at the  same

time. a saddle point is neither a maximum nor a minimum, although both derivatives 
are zero. 
note  do not think that f(x, y) must contain y2 and x2 to have a saddle point. the 
function  2xy  does just  as well.  the level  curves  2xy = c  are  still hyperbolas.  the 
partial functions 2xyo and 2xoy now give straight lines-which 
is remarkable. along 
the 45"  line x = y,  the function is 2x2 and climbing. along the  -45"  line x = - y, 
the function is  -2x2 and falling. the graph of  2xy is figure 13.6 rotated by  45". 

examples 5-6 

f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 

p(t,  v) = nrt/v 

example  5 shows more variables. example 6 shows that  the  variables may  not  be 
named x and y.  also, the function may not be  named f! pressure and temperature 
and volume are p and  t and  v. the letters change but nothing else: 

ap/at = nr/v 

dp/av = - ~ r t / v ~  (note the derivative of  1/v). 
there is no dp/ar because r is a constant from chemistry-not  a variable. 

physics produces six variables for a moving body-the 

coordinates x, y, z and the 
momenta p,,  p,,  p,.  economics and the social sciences do better than that.  if  there 
are  26  products  there  are  26  variables-sometimes  52,  to  show  prices  as  well  as 
amounts. the profit  can be  a  complicated function of  these  variables.  the partial 
derivatives are the marginalprofits, as one of the 52 variables is changed. a spreadsheet 
shows the 52 values and the effect of  a change. an  infinitesimal spreadsheet shows 
the derivative. 

second derivative 

genius is not essential, to move to second derivatives. the only difficulty is that two 
first derivatives f, and f , lead to four  second derivatives fxx  and fxy  and f ,and f,. 
(two  subscripts: f,,  is  the  x  derivative  of  the  x  derivative.  other  notations  are 
d2 flax2 and a2f/axdy and a*flayax  and  d2flay2.) fortunately fxy  equals f,,  as we 
see first by  example. 

example 7  f = x/y  has f, = l/y,  which  has  fxx  = 0  and f,  = - l/y2. 
the function x/y is linear in x (which explains fxx  = 0). its y derivative isf, = - xly2. 
this has the x derivative f,,, = -l/y2. the mixed derivatives fxy  and fyx  are equal. 

in the pure y direction, the second derivative isf,  = 2x/y3. one-variable calculus 

is sufficient for all these derivatives, because only one variable is moving. 
example 8  f = 4x2 + 3xy + y2  has f, = 8x + 3y  and f ,= 3x + 2y. 
both "cross  derivatives" f,,  andf,,  equal 3. the second derivative in the x direction 
is  a2f/ax2 = 8  or  fxx  = 8.  thus  "fx x"  is  "d  second  f d x  squared."  similarly 
a2flay2 = 2.  the only change is from d to a. 

iff(x, y) has continuous second derivatives then f,,  =&,.  problem 43 sketches a proof 
based on the mean value theorem. for third derivatives almost any example shows 
that f,,  =fxyx  =f,,  is different from fyyx  =fyxy  =fxyy  . 
question  how do you plot  a space curve x(t), y(t), z(t) in a plane?  one way is to look 
parallel  to  the  direction  (1, 1, 1).  on  your  xy  screen,  plot  x = (y - x ) / d  and 
y = (22 - x - y)/$.  the line x = y = z goes to the point (0, o)! 

how  do you graph  a surface  z =f(x, y)? use the same x  and  y.  fix  x and let  y 
vary, for curves one way in the surface. then fix y and vary x, for the other partial 
function. for a parametric surface like x = (2 + v sin i u )  cos u, y = (2 + v sin fu) sin u, 
z = v cos iu,vary u and then u. dick williamson showed how this draws a one-sided 
"mobius strip."

what happens  with  two  variables?  the function  is  z =f(x, y),  and  its  graph  is  a 
surface. we are at a point on that surface, and we  are near-sighted.  we don't  see far 
away. the surface may  curve out of  sight at the horizon,  or it may  be  a bowl or a 
saddle. to our myopic  vision, the  surface looks flat. we believe we  are on a plane 
(not necessarily horizontal), and we want the equation of  this tangent plane.

notation  the  basepoint  has  coordinates  x0  and  yo.  the  height  on  the  surface  is
zo  =f(xo, yo).  other  letters  are  possible:  the  point  can  be  (a, b) with  height  w.  the
subscript  o indicates  the  value  of x  or y  or z or  8f/ox  or  aflay at the  point.

with  one  variable  the  tangent  line  has  slope  df/dx.  with  two  variables  there
are  two  derivatives  df/8x  and  of/oy.  at  the  particular  point,  they  are  (af/ax)o  and
(af/ay)o.  those  are the  slopes  of the  tangent plane. its  equation  is  the  key  to  this
chapter:

43a  the  tangent  plane  at (xo,  yo,  zo)  has  the  same  slopes  as the  surface  z =
f(x, y).  the  equation  of the  tangent  plane (a linear  equation)  is

z - zo =

example  1  find the  tangent  plane  to  z =  14 - x 2  - y2  at  (xo,  yo,  zo)  = (1, 2,  9).
solution  the  derivatives  are  af/ax =  - 2x  and  ofl/y =  - 2y.  when  x =  1 and  y = 2
those are  (af/ax)o =  - 2  and  (df/ay)o =  - 4.  the equation  of the  tangent  plane  is

z  - 9 =  - 2(x  - 1)-  4(y - 2)

or 

z+2x+4y=  19.

the  normal  vector  n  has  components  -2, 

this  z(x, y) has derivatives  - 2 and  - 4, just like the surface.  so the plane  is  tangent.

these  particular lines  are tangent  to the  "partial  functions"--where  y is fixed at yo  =

t to  the  curve  and  the  normal  n to  the  surface  are  perpendicular:  t . n = 0.

ta safer  word is  "osculate."  at  saddle  points  the plane  is kissed  from  both  sides.

at  (1, 2)  those  slopes  are  - 4 and  - s. the  equation  of the tangent  plane is  linear:
z  - 3 =  -   (x - 1) - 1(y  - 2).  i cannot  resist  improving the  equation,  by multiplying
through  by  3 and moving  all  terms  to the  left side:

tangent plane to  sphere: 

l(x - 1) +  2(y - 2) +  3(z - 3) = 0. 

(4)
if mathematics is the "science  of patterns,"  equation (4) is a prime candidate for study.
the  numbers  1, 2,  3 appear  twice.  the  coordinates  are  (xo, yo,  zo)  = (1, 2,  3).  the
normal vector is  ii + 2j + 3k. the tangent equation  is  lx + 2y + 3z =  14. none  of this
can  be  an  accident,  but  the  square  root of  14 - x 2  - y2  made  a  simple pattern  look
complicated.

this  square  root  is  not  necessary.  calculus  offers  a  direct  way  to  find  dz/dx-

implicit differentiation. just  differentiate  every  term  as  it stands:

2  y2 

z2  =  14 

(5)
canceling  the 2's, the derivatives  on a sphere are  - x/z  and  - y/z.  those are  the  same
as  in  (3).  the  equation  for the  tangent  plane  has an  extremely  symmetric  form:

leads  to  2x + 2z  az/ax =  0  and  2y + 2z az/ay = 0.

the  tangent  plane  to  f(x, y, z)=  c

the  sphere  suggests  a  question  that  is  important  for  other  surfaces.  suppose  the
equation  is  f(x, y, z) = c instead  of z =f(x, y).  can  the partial  derivatives  and tangent
plane  be  found  directly  from f?

the  answer  is  yes.  it  is  not  necessary  to  solve  first  for  z.  the  derivatives  of f,

13.3  tangent  planes  and  linear approximations

computed  at  (xo, yo,  zo),  give  a  second  formula  for  the  tangent  plane  and  normal
vector.

13b  the  tangent  plane  to the  surface  f(x, y, z)=  c  has the  linear equation

notice  how  this  includes  the  original  case  z =f(x, y).  the  function  f  becomes
f(x, y) - z. its  partial  derivatives  are  of/ox  and  of/oy  and  -1.  (the  -1 
is  from  the
derivative  of  - z.)  then  equation  (7) is the same  as our original  tangent  equation (1).

example  3  the surface  f =  x2  + y 2 - z2  = c is a hyperboloid. find its tangent  plane.
solution  the  partial  derivatives  are  fx = 2x,  f, =  2y,  fz =  - 2z.  equation  (7)  is

tangent plane:  2xo(x  - xo) + 2 yo(y - yo)  - 2zo(z  - zo)= 0. 

(8)
we  can  cancel  the  2's.  the  normal  vector  is  n = x 0i + yoj  - z0k.  for  c > 0  this
hyperboloid has one sheet (figure 13.8).  for  c = 0 it is  a cone  and for  c < 0 it breaks
into two  sheets  (problem  13.1.26).

differentials

come  back  to  the  linear  equation  z - zo = (oz/ox) 0(x - x0) + (oz/oy)o(y - yo)  for the
tangent  plane.  that may be  the most important  formula in this chapter.  move  along
the tangent  plane  instead  of the curved  surface.  movements  in  the plane are  dx  and
dy  and  dz-while  ax  and  ay  and  az  are  movements  in  the  surface.  the  d's  are
governed  by the tangent  equation- 
the a's are  governed  by  z =f(x, y).  in chapter  2
the d's were  differentials along  the  tangent  line:
dy = (dy/dx)dx  (straight  line)  and  ay, 

(9)
now  y  is  independent  like  x.  the dependent  variable  is z.  the  idea  is the  same.  the
distances  x - x0  and  y - yo  and  z  - zo  (on  the  tangent  plane)  are  dx  and  dy  and  dz.
the equation of the plane is

(dy/dx)ax  (on  the curve). 

dz = (oz/ox) 0dx + (oz/oy)ody  or  df=fxdx +fdy. 

(10)
this  is  the  total differential. all  letters  dz  and  df and  dw  can  be  used,  but  oz  and  of
are not used.  differentials suggest small movements  in x and y;  then dz is the resulting
movement  in z. on the  tangent  plane,  equation  (10)  holds  exactly.

a  "centering  transform"  has  put  x0, yo,  zo  at  the center  of coordinates.  then the

"zoom  transform"  stretches the  surface  into its tangent  plane.

example  4  the  area of a  triangle  is  a = lab sin 0.  find  the total  differential  da.
solution  the base has length b and the sloping side has length a. the angle between
them is 0. you may prefer  a =   bh, where  h is the perpendicular height a sin 0. either
way we  need  the  partial derivatives.  if a =   ab sin  0, then

example  5  the volume of a cylinder is  v =  nr2 h. decide whether  v is more sensitive
to  a change  from  r =  1.0  to  r =  1.1  or from  h =  1.0  to  h  =  1.1.
solution  the  partial  derivatives  are  v/or = 2n7rh  and  dv/ah = irr2 . they  measure
the  sensitivity  to  change.  physically,  they  are  the  side  area  and  base  area  of  the
cylinder.  the  volume  differential  dv comes  from a shell  around the  side plus  a layer
on  top:

(12)
starting  from  r =  h =  1, that  differential  is  dv= 2rndr + 7rdh.  with  dr =  dh = .1, the
shell  volume  is  .21t  and the  layer  volume  is only  .17r.  so  v  is  sensitive  to dr.

dv =  shell +  layer = 2nrh dr +  rr2dh. 

for a short cylinder  like a penny, the layer  has greater  volume.  vis  more sensitive

to  dh.  in our case  v=  rtr2h increases  from  n(1)3  to ~n(1.1)3 . compare av  to dv:

av= n(1.1) 3  - 7(1) 3  = .3317r 

and 

dv= 27r(.1)+  7n(.1)= .3007r.

the  difference  is  av-  dv= .0317.  the  shell  and  layer  missed  a  small  volume  in
figure  13.9,  just  above  the  shell  and  around  the  layer.  the  mistake  is  of  order
(dr)2 + (dh)2 . for  v= 7rr 2 h, the differential  dv=  27rrh dr + 7rr 2dh is a linear approxima-
tion  to  the  true  change  a v. we  now  explain  that  properly.

linear  approximation

tangents  lead immediately  to linear approximations. that is  true  of tangent  planes  as
it was  of tangent  lines.  the  plane  stays  close  to  the  surface,  as  the line  stayed  close
to  the  curve.  linear  functions  are  simpler  than f(x)  or f(x, y)  or  f(x, y,  z).  all  we
need  are first derivatives  at the point. then  the approximation  is good near the point.
this  key  idea of calculus  is  already  present in differentials.  on the plane,  df equals

fxdx  +fydy.  on  the curved  surface  that  is  a linear approximation  to  af:

43c  the linear  approximation  to f(x, y)  near  the point  (xo, yo)  is

f(x,  y)   f(xo, yo)  + ( 

(x - xo)  + (  y(y  - yo). 

(13)

fxax  +fay,  as  proved  in  problem  24.  the  right  side  of  (13)
in  other  words  af 
is  a  linear function fl(x,  y).  at (xo,  yo),  the functions f  and fl  have  the  same  slopes.
then f(x, y) curves  away  fromfl  with  an error  of "second  order:"
if(x,  y) -fl(x,  y)i  < m[(x  - xo) 2  + (y  - yo) 2]. 

(14)
this  assumes  thatfx,,,fx,  and fy  are  continuous  and bounded  by  m along  the  line
from (xo, yo)  to (x, y).  example 3 of section  13.5 shows that if,,i  < 2m along  that line.
a factor     comes  from equation  3.8.12,  for the  error f-fl  with  one variable.

for the volume  of a cylinder,  r and  h  went from  1.0  to  1.1.  the second  derivatives
of  v = lrr 2h are  v, , = 27rh  and  vh =  27rr  and  vhh  = 0. they  are  below  m = 2.27r.  then
(14)  gives the error bound 2.27r(.1 2 + .12)  =  .0447r,  not far above  the actual  error .03 17r.
the  main  point  is  that  the  error in  linear approximation comes from  the  quadratic
terms-those are  the first  terms  to be  ignored  by fl.

z ,/m

if  y is fixed at 2, this is a one-variable approximation to d m .if  x is fixed at  1, 
it is a linear approximation in y.  moving both variables,  you might  think  dr would 
involve dx and dy in a square root. it doesn't.  distance involves x and y in a square 
root, but: change of  distance is linear in ax  and ay-to 

a first approximation. 

there  is  a  rough  point  at  x = 0,  y = 0.  any  movement  from  (0,o) gives  ar = 
jmk(ay)2. the square root has returned. the reason is that the partial deriva- 
tives x/r  and y/r  are not  continuous at (0,o). the cone  has  a  sharp point  with  no 
tangent  plane. linear approximation breaks down. 

the  next  example  shows  how  to  approximate  az  from  ax  and  ay,  when  the 
equation is f(x, y, z) = c. we use the implicit derivatives in (7) instead of  the explicit 
derivatives  in  (1). the idea  is the  same:  look  at the  tangent  equation  as a  way  to 
find az,  instead  of  an equation for z. here is example 6 with new letters. 
example 7  from f = - x2 - y2 + z2 = 0 find a linear approximation to az 
solution  (implicit derivatives) use the derivatives of  f:  -2xax - 2yay + 2zaz z 0. 
then solve for az, which gives az z (x/z)ax + (y/z)ay-the 
example 8  how does the equilibrium price change when the supply curve changes? 
the  equilibrium  price  is  at  the  intersection  of  the  supply  and  demand  curves 
(supply =: demand). as  the price p rises, the demand q drops (the slope is  - .2): 

same as example 6. 

demand line dd: p = - .2q + 40. 

(15) 

the supply (also q) goes up  with the price. the slope s is positive (here s = .4): 

supply line ss: p = sq + t = .4q + 10. 

those  lines  are  in  figure 13.10. they  meet  at  the  equilibrium price  p = $30.  the 
quantity q = 50 is available at p (on ss) and demanded  at p (on dd). so it is sold. 
where  do partial derivatives  come  in? the reality  is that  those lines dd  and  ss 
are  not  fixed  for  all  time.  technology  changes,  and  competition  changes,  and  the 
value of money changes. therefore the lines move. therefore the crossing point (q, p) 
also moves.  please recognize that  derivatives are hiding in those sentences. 

13  partial derivatives 

main point:  the equilibrium price  p  is a function  of s and  t. reducing  s by  better 
technology lowers the supply line to p = .3q + 10. the demand line has not changed. 
the  customer  is  as  eager  or  stingy  as  ever.  but  the  price  p  and  quantity  q  are 
different.  the  new  equilibrium  is  at  q = 60  and  p = $28,  where  the  new  line  xx 
crosses dd. 
is p = .3q + 20. that gives a higher equilibrium p = $32 at a lower quantity q = 40-
the demand was too weak for the technology. 

if  the technology is expensive, the supplier will raise  t when reducing  s. line  yy 

calculus question  find dp/ds and ap/at.  the difficulty is that p is not given as 
a function of s and t. so take implicit derivatives of the supply = demand equations: 

supply = demand:  p = - .2q + 40 = sq + t 

s derivative: 

t derivative: 

p, = - .2q, = sq, + q  (note t,  = 0) 
p, = - .2q, = sq, + 1 
(note t, = 1) 

(16) 

now substitute s = .4, t = 10, p = 30, q = 50. that is the starting point, around which 
we  are finding  a  linear  approximation.  the last  two  equations  give  p, = 5013  and 
p, = 113 (problem 25). the linear approximation is 

comment  this example turned out to be subtle (so is economics). i hesitated before 
including it. the equations are linear and their derivatives  are easy, but  something 
in the problem is hard-there 
is no explicit formula for p. the function p(s, t) is not 
known. instead of a point on a surface, we are following the intersection of two lines. 
the solution changes as the equation changes. the derivative of the solution comes from 
the derivative of the equation. 

summary  the foundation of this section is equation (1) for the tangent plane. every- 
thing  builds  on  that-total 
differential,  linear  approximation,  sensitivity  to  small 
change.  later  sections  go  on to  the  chain  rule  and  "directional  derivatives"  and 
"gradients."  the central idea of id128 is af  zf,ax  +f,,ay. 

n w o n ' s  method for mi0 equations 

linear approximation is used to solve equations. to find out where a function is zero, 
look  first to see where its approximation is zero. to find out where a graph crosses 
the xy plane, look  to see where its tangent  plane crosses. 
remember  newton's  method  for f(x) = 0.  the  current  guess  is  x,.  around  that 
point, f(x)  is  close  to f(x,)  + (x - x,)f'(x,).  this  is  zero  at  the  next  guess  x,,,  = 
x,  -f(x,)/f'(x,).  that is where the tangent  line crosses the x axis. 

with two variables the idea is the same-  but two unknowns x and y require two 
equations.  we  solve g(x, y) = 0  and h(x, y) = 0.  both  functions have linear  approxi- 
mations that start from the current point (x,,  y,)-where 
derivatives are computed: 

the natural idea is to set  these approximations to zero. that gives linear equations 
for x - x,  and y - y,.  those are the steps ax  and ay  that take us to the next  guess

example  9  g = x 3  - y  = 0 and h  = y3 - x = 0 have 3 solutions (1, 1),  (0, 0), (-1,  -1).
i  will start  at different  points  (xo, yo).  the  next  guess  is  x,  = xo  + ax,  yl = yo  + ay.
it is  of extreme  interest  to know  which  solution newton's  method  will choose-if it
converges  at  all.  i  made  three small  experiments.

1.  suppose (xo,  yo)  = (2,  1).  at that point g = 2  - 1 = 7 and  h =  13 - 2 =  -1.  the
derivatives  are gx =  3x2 = 12,  gy  =  - 1, hx =  - 1, hy  =  3y 2 =  3. the  steps  ax  and  ay
come  from  solving  (19):

12ax  - ay=  -7 
-ax+3ay=  +1 

ax =  - 4/7 
ay=  +  1/7 

x  = xo  + ax=  10/7
=  yo + ay=  8/7.

this  new  point  (10/7,  8/7) is  closer  to the  solution  at  (1, 1).  the  next  point  is  (1.1,
1.05)  and convergence  is  clear.  soon  convergence  is fast.

2.  start  at (xo,  yo)  = (  , 0).  there  we find  g =  1/8  and  h =  - 1/2:

(3/4)ax - ay=  -1/8 

- ax + oay=  + 1/2 

ax =  - 1/2 
ay  =  + 1/4 

x  = xo  + 
y,  =  yo  + ay  =  - 1/4.

=0
=ax 

newton  has jumped  from  (  , 0)  on  the x  axis to  (0,  - f) on  the  y axis.  the  next step
goes  to  (1/32,  0),  back on  the  x  axis.  we  are  in the  "basin  of attraction"  of (0, 0).

3.  now  start further  out the  axis  at (1, 0),  where  g =  1 and  h  =  - 1:

3ax-  ay=  -1 
-ax+oay=  +1 

ax=  -1 
ay=-2 

x= xo+ax=0o
yl=yo+ay=-2.

newton  moves  from  (1, 0)  to  (0,  -2)  to  (16,  0).  convergence  breaks  down-the
method  blows  up.  this  danger  is ever-present,  when  we  start far  from a  solution.

please recognize  that even  a small computer  will  uncover  amazing patterns.  it can
start from  hundreds  of points  (xo, yo),  and  follow  newton's  method.  each  solution
has  a basin of attraction, containing  all (xo,  yo)  leading  to that solution.  there is  also
a basin leading to infinity. the basins in figure  13.11  are completely mixed together-
a color figure  shows  them asfractals. the most extreme  behavior is on  the borderline
between basins, when newton can't decide which  way to go.  frequently  we see chaos.
chaos  is  irregular  movement  that follows  a definite  rule.  newton's  method  deter-
mines  an  iteration from  each  point  (x,, y,)  to  the  next.  in  scientific  problems  it
normally  converges  to the  solution  we  want.  (we  start close  enough.)  but  the com-
puter  makes  it  posible  to  study  iterations  from  faraway  points.  this  has  created  a
new  part  of mathematics-so  new  that  any  experiments  you  do  are  likely  to  be
original.

section  3.7 found chaos  when trying to  solve  x 2  +  1 = 0.  but don't think newton's
method is a failure.  on the contrary, it is the best method to solve nonlinear equations.
the error  is squared  as the  algorithm converges,  because linear approximations  have
errors  of order  (ax) 2  + (ay) 2. each  step  doubles  the  number  of correct  digits,  near
the solution. the  example  shows  why  it  is important  to  be  near.

13.4  directional derivatives and gradients 

as  x changes, we know how f(x, y) changes. the partial derivative dfldx  treats y as 
constant. similarly df/dy  keeps x constant, and gives the slope in the y direction. but 
east-west and north-south are not the only directions to move. we could go along a 
45" line, where ax = ay.  in principle, before we draw axes, no direction is preferred. 
the graph is a surface with  slopes in all directions. 

on that  surface,  calculus  looks for  the  rate  of  change  (or the  slope).  there  is  a 
directional derivative, whatever the direction. in the 45" case we are inclined to divide 
af  by  ax, but we would  be wrong. 

let me state the problem. we are given f(x, y) around a point p = (x,,  yo). we are 

also given a direction u  (a unit  vector). there must be a natural definition of  d,f-
the derivative off  in the direction u. to compute this slope at p, we  need  a formula. 
preferably the formula is based  on df/dx  and dfldy,  which  we already know. 
note that the 45" direction  has u = i/$  + j/$.  the square root of  2 is going to 
enter the derivative. this shows that dividing af  by  ax  is wrong.  we should  divide 
by  the step length as. 

example 1  stay on the surface z = xy. when (x, y) moves a distance as  in the 45" 
direction  from (1, i), what is az/as? 
solution  the step is  as  times  the  unit  vector  u.  starting  from  x = y = 1 the  step 
ends at x = y = 1 + as/$. 

(the components of  "as  are as/$.)  then z = xy is 
r = (1 + ~ s / f i ) ~= 1 + $as  + %as)',  which means az  = $as  + $(as)2. 
the ratio azlas approaches fi as as + 0. that is the slope in the 45" direction. 
definition  the derivative off'in  the direction u at the point  p  is d,f ( p ) :  

the step from  p = (x,,  yo) has  length  as.  it  takes us  to (x, + ulas, yo + u2as). we 
compute the change af  and divide by  as.  but  formula (2) below saves time. 

13.4  directional derivatives  and  gradients 

491

the  x  direction  is  u = (1, 0).  then  uas  is (as,  0) and we  recover  af/ax:

af 
as 

f(xo  + as,  yo)  -f(xo,  yo)  approaches  d(1, 0)f

as 

ax

similarly  df= aflay,  when  u = (0,  1) is  in  the  y  direction.  what  is  d,f when  u=
(0,  -1)?  that is  the negative  y direction,  so df= - aflay.

calculating  the  directional  derivative

d,f is the slope  of the surface  z =f(x, y) in  the direction  u.  how  do  you  compute  it?
from  af/ax  and  af/ay, in two  special  directions, there  is  a quick  way  to find  df in
all directions.  remember  that u is  a unit  vector.

13e  the  directional derivative d,f in the  direction  u = (u1 , u2) equals

af  ,f

df= - ua +  - u 2.

(2)

the  reasoning  goes  back  to  the linear  approximation  of af:

af4ax+f 
ax 

ay 

af "  ax +  ay=  ulas+ 

ax 

f
ay

u2as.

divide  by  as  and  let  as  approach  zero.  formula  (2)  is  the  limit  of  af/as,  as  the
approximation  becomes  exact.  a  more  careful  argument  guarantees  this  limit  pro-
vided f and fy are  continuous  at the  basepoint  (xo, yo).

main  point:  slopes  in  all directions  are  known from  slopes  in two  directions.

example  1 (repeated) 
the  derivatives f  = y  and fy =  x equal  1 at  p. the  450  derivative  is

f= xy and  p = (1, 1) and  u =  (1/,i,  1//-2). find  df(p).

d.f(p) =fui +fyu 2 =  1(1/./)  +  1(1//2) =  /2  as  before.

example  2  the linear  function f= 3x + y + 1 has  slope  df= 3u,  + u2.
the  x  direction  is  u = (1, 0),  and  d.f= 3. that is  af/ax.  in  the  y  direction  df= 1.
two  other directions are special--along the level lines off(x, y)  and perpendicular:
level direction: 

d.f is zero  because f  is  constant

steepest direction:  d.f is  as  large  as  possible  (with  u2 +  u2 =  1).
to  find  those  directions,  look  at  d,f= 3u, + u2 . the level  direction  has  3u,  + u2 = 0.
then  u is  proportional  to (1, - 3).  changing  x by  1 and y  by  - 3 produces  no  change
in f= 3x + y  + 1.

in  the  steepest  direction  u  is  proportional  to  (3, 1).  note  the  partial  derivatives
is  zero-steepest direction

f =  3  and fy =  1. the  dot  product  of (3, 1) and  (1,  -3) 
is perpendicular to level  direction. to  make (3,  1) a  unit vector,  divide  by 

1/0.

steepest  climb: 

d,f= 3(3/_0) +  l(1//10) =  10//10 =  /10

steepest descent:  reverse  to  u= (-3//10, -1//10) 
the  contour  lines around  a mountain  follow  df= 0. the  creeks  are perpendicular.
on  a  plane  like  f= 3x + y + 1,  those  directions  stay  the  same  at  all  points
(figure 13.12).  on  a mountain  the  steepest  direction  changes  as  the slopes  change.

and  df=  -/10.

the  space-saving  symbol  v is read  as  "grad."  in  chapter  15  it becomes  "del."

for  the  linear function  3x +  y +  1, the  gradient  is  the  constant  vector  (3, 1).  it is
the  way  to  climb  the plane.  for  the  nonlinear  function  x 2  + xy,  the  gradient  is  the
non-constant  vector (2x + y, x).  notice that gradf shares  the  two  derivatives  in n =
(f  ,fy,  -1).  but  the  gradient  is  not  the  normal  vector.  n  is  in  three  dimensions,
pointing  away  from  the  surface  z =f(x, y).  the gradient vector is in the  xy plane! the
gradient  tells which  way  on the  surface  is up,  but it does  that from down in  the  base.
the  level  curve  is also  in  the  xy plane,  perpendicular  to  the  gradient.  the contour
map  is  a  projection  on  the  base  plane  of what  the  hiker  sees  on  the  mountain.  the
vector  grad f  tells  the  direction of  climb,  and  its  length  igradfl  gives  the  steepness.

13f  the  directional  derivative  is  df= (grad f)  u.  the level  direction  is  per-
pendicular  to gradf, since  d,f=  0.  the slope  df is largest when  u is parallel to
gradf. that  maximum  slope  is  the length  igradfl  = 

xf  +fy:

the  example  f= 3x + y  +  1 had  grad f= (3, 1).  its  steepest  slope  was  in  the  direc-
tion  u = (3, 1)/!10. the  maximum  slope  was  f10. that  is  igradf i =  s  +  1.

important  point:  the  maximum  of (grad f)  * u  is  the length  igradf 1. in  nonlinear
examples,  the  gradient  and  steepest  direction  and  slope  will  vary.  but  look  at  one
particular  point  in  figure  13.13.  near  that  point,  and  near  any  point,  the  linear
picture  takes  over.

on  the graph  off, the  special  vectors  are  the  level  direction  l = (fy,  -fx,  0) and
x +f 2) and the normal  n = (f,fy,  - 1).  problem  18

the uphill  direction  u = (,,f 
checks  that  those  are  perpendicular.

13.4  directional derivatives and gradients 

example 3  the gradient of  f(x, y) = (14 - x2 - y2)/3  is  vf  = (- 2x13,  -2~13). 

on the surface, the normal vector is n = (- 2x13,  -2~13,-1). at  the point (1,2, 3), 
this  perpendicular  is  n = (- 213,  -413,  -1). at  the  point  (1, 2)  down  in  the  base, 
the gradient is (- 213,  -413). the length of  grad f is the slo  e ,/%/3. 

probably a hiker does not go straight up. a "grade"  of &/3 

is fairly steep (almost 
150%). to estimate the slope in other directions, measure the distance along the path 
between two contour lines. if  af  = 1 in a distance as = 3 the slope is about  113. this 
calculation is not exact until the limit of  aflas,  which is dj 

vel 

fig. 13.13  n perpendicular to surface and grad f perpendicular to level line (in the base). 

example 4  the gradient  of f(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz has three components. 
the pattern extends from f(x, y) to f(x, y, z). the gradient is now the three-dimensional 
vector ( j ; ,  fy  ,f,).  for this function grad f is (y + z, x + z, x + y). to draw the graph 
of  w =f(x, y, z)  would  require  a  four-dimensional  picture,  with  axes  in  the  xyzw 
directions. 

notice: the dimensions. the graph is a  3-dimensional "surface"  in 4-dimensional 
space. the gradient is down below in the 3-dimensional base. the level sets off  come 
from xy -tyz + zx = c-they 
are 2-dimensional. the gradient is perpendicular to that 
level set (still down in  3  dimensions). the  gradient  is not  n! the normal  vector  is 
(fx  ,fy  ,fz  :,  -i), perpendicular  to the surface up in 4-dimensional space. 
example!5  find grad z when z(x, y) is given implicitly: f(x, y, z) = x2+ y2-z2= 0. 
in  this  case  we  find 
and 
+ y2, which go into grad z. but the point is this: to find that gradient faster, 
fy/,/? 
differentiate f(x, y, z) as it stands. then divide by  f,: 

z = fjm.

the  derivatives  are  & 

the gradient  is  (- fx/fz, - fy/f,). those derivatives are evaluated  at (xo, yo). the 
computation does not need the explicit function z =f(x, y): 

f =  x2 + y2 - z2  =.  fx = 2x, fy = 2y, fz = - 2z 

grad z = (xlz, ylz). 

to  go  uphill  on the  cone, move  in. the  direction  (xlz, ylz). that gradient  direction 
goes radially outward. the steepness of  the cone is the length of  the gradient vector: 

lgrad zl  = j(x/z)~+ ( y l ~ ) ~= 1 because z2 = x2 + y2 on the cone. 

13  partial derivatives 

derivatives along curved paths 

on a straight path the derivative off  is d, f = (grad f )  u. what is the derivative on 
a curved path?  the path  direction u is the tangent vector t. so replace u by t, which 
gives the "direction"  of the curve. 
the  path  is  given  by  the  position  vector  r(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j. the  velocity  is  v = 
(dx/dt)i + (dy/dt)j. the tangent vector is t = vllvl. notice the choice-to  move at any 
speed  (with  v)  or  to  go  at  unit  speed  (with t). there  is  the  same  choice  for  the 
derivative of.f(x, y) along this curve:

the first involves time. if we move faster, dfldt increases. the second involves distance. 
if  we  move a distance  ds, at any speed, the function changes by  df.  so the  slope in 
that direction is dflds.  chapter 1 introduced velocity as dfldt  and slope as dyldx and 
mixed them up. finally we  see the difference. 
uniform motion on a straight line has r = r,  + vt. the velocity v is constant. the 
direction  t = u = vllvl  is also constant.  the directional  derivative is (grad f )   u,  but 
the rate of  change is (grad f )  v. 

equations (4) and (5) look like chain rules. they are chain rules. the next section 
extends dfldt  = (df/dx)(dx/dt) to more  variables, proving  (4) and (5). here we  focus 
on  the  meaning:  dflds  is  the  derivative  off in  the  direction  u = t  along  the  curve. 

example 7  find dfldt  and dflds for f = r. the curve is x = t2, y = t in figure 13.14a. 
solution  the velocity  along  the curve is v = 2ti + j.  at  the typical point  t = 1 it  is 
v = 2i + j.  the unit  tangent is t = v/&.  the gradient  is a  unit  vector i l f i   + j / f i  
pointing  outward,  when f (x, y) is  the  distance  r  from  the  center.  the  dot  product 
with v  is dfldt  = 3 / d .  the dot product  with t is dflds  = 3 / a .  

when we  slow down to speed  1 (with t), the changes in f(x, y) slow down too. 

example 8  find dflds  for f = xy along the circular path x = cos t, y = sin t. 
first take a direct approach. on the circle, xy equals (cos t)(sin t). its derivative comes 
from  the  product  rule:  dfldt  = cos2t - sin2t. normally  this  is  different  from  dflds, 
because the time  t need  not  equal the arc length s. there  is  a  speed factor  dsldt to 
here the speed is  1. (a circle of length s = 271  is completed at t = 2n.) 
divide by-but 
thus the slope dflds  along the roller-coaster in figure 13.14 is cos2t - sin2t.

fig. 13.14  the  distance f = r  changes  along  the  curve.  the  slope  of  the  roller-coaster  is 

(grad f )  t. the distance d from (x,,  y o )  has grad d = unit  vector. 

13.4  directional derhrcrhves and gradients 

the  second  approach uses  the  vectors  grad f and  t.  the  gradient off = xy  is 
(y, x) = (sin t, cos t). the unit tangent vector to the path is t = (-  sin t, cos t). their 
dot product is the same dflds: 

slope along path = (grad f )   t = - sin2t + cos2t. 

gradients without  coordinajes 

this section ends with a little "philosophy."  what is the coordinate-free dejnition of 
the gradient? up to now, grad f = (fx, f,,)  depended totally on the choice of  x and y 
axes. but the steepness of  a surface is independent of  the axes. those are added later, 
to help us compute. 

the steepness dflds  involves only f and the direction, nothing else. the gradient 
should be a "tensorw-its  meaning does not depend on the coordinate system. the 
gradient has different formulas in different systems (xy or re or . . .),  but the direction 
and length of  grad f are determined by  dflds-without 

any axes: 

the drrection of  grad f is the one in which  dflds  is largest. 
the length igrad f 1  is that largest slope. 

the key equation is (change in f )  x (gradient off)  (change in position). that is another 
way to write af  x fxax +@y.  it is the multivariable form-we  used two variables- 
of  the basic linear approximation ay  x (dy/dx)ax. 

example 9  d(x, y) = distance  from  (x, y)  to  (x,,  yo). without  derivatives  prove 
lgrad dl  = 1. the graph of  d(x, y) is a cone with slope 1 and sharp point (x,,  yo). 

first question  in which direction does the distance d(x, y) increase fastest? 
answer  going directly away from (x,,  yo). therefore this is the direction of grad d. 

second question  how quickly does d increase in that steepest direction? 
~nswer a step of  length as  increases d by as.  therefore ]grad dl  = aslas = 1. 

conclusion  grad d  is  a  unit  vector.  the  derivatives  of  d  in  problem 48  are 
(x - xo)/d and  (y - yo)/d. the  sum  of  their  squares  is  1,  because  (x - x,)~ + 
(y - yo)* equals d ~ .

13.5  the  chain rule 

calculus goes back and forth between solving problems and getting ready for harder 
problems. the first is "application,"  the second looks like "theory."  if  we minimize f 
to save time or money or energy, that is an application. if we don't  take derivatives 
to find the minimum-maybe  because f is a function of other functions, and we don't 
have a chain rule-then 
it is time for more theory. the chain rule is a fundamental 
working tool, because f(g(x)) appears all the time in applications. so do f(g(x, y)) and 
f(x(t), y(t)) and worse. we  have  to know their  derivatives. otherwise calculus can't 
continue with the applications. 

you may instinctively say: don't bother with the theory, just teach me the formulas. 
that is not  possible. you  now  regard  the  derivative of  sin 2x  as a  trivial problem, 
unworthy of  an answer. that was not always so. before the chain rule, the slopes of 
sin 2x  and sin x2 and sin2x2 were hard  to compute from af/ax.  we  are now  at the 
same point for f(x, y). we know the meaning of dfldx, but iff  = r tan b and x = r cos 8 
and y = r sin 8, we need a way to compute afldx.  a little theory is unavoidable, if  the 
problem-solving part of  calculus is to keep going. 

to  repeat:  the chain rule applies to a function  of a function.  in one variable that 

was f(g(x)). with two variables there are more possibilities: 

1. f ( ~ )   withz=g(x,y) 

find  df/dx  and afldy 

2.  f(x,  y)  with x = x(t), y = y(t) 
3. f(x,  y)  with x = x(t, u), y = y(t, u)  find  dfldt  and afldu 

find dfldt 

13  partial derhrattves 

all  derivatives  are  assumed  continuous.  more  exactly,  the  input  derivatives like 
ag/ax and  dxldt  and  dx/au are continuous. then  the output derivatives like af/ax 
and  dfldt  and  df/au will  be  continuous from the  chain  rule.  we  avoid  points  like 
r = 0 in polar coordinates-where  ar/dx = x/r has a division by zero. 

a  typical problem  start with  a function of  x  and y,  for example x  times y.  thus 
f(x, y) = xy. change x  to r cos 8 and y to r sin 8. the function becomes (rcos 8)times 
(r sin 8). we want its derivatives with respect to r and 8. first we  have to decide on 
its name. 

to be correct, we  should not reuse the letter5 the new function can be f :  

f(x, y) = x y  

f(r cos 8, r sin 8)= (r cos 8)(rsin 8)= f(r, 8). 

w h y  not  call  it f(r, 8)? because  strictly speaking that  is  r  times  8! if  we  follow the 
rules, then f(x, y) is  xy and f(r, 8) should be  re. the new  function f  does the right 
thing-it  multiplies (r cos 8)(rsin 8). but  in many cases, the  rules get bent  and the 
letter f  is changed back to 5 

this  crime has  already  occurred. the  end  of  the last  page  ought  to say  dflat. 
instead  the printer  put  dfldt. the purpose  of  the chain rule is to find derivatives in 
the new  variables t  and u (or r and 8). in our example we  want  the derivative of f 
with respect to r. here is the chain rule: 

d~ - d f a x  + g? = (y)(cos 8) + (x)(sin 8) = 2r sin 8 cos  8. 
---- 
dr 

dx ar 

dyer 

i  substituted  r sin 8  and  r cos 8  for  y  and  x.  you  immediately check  the  answer: 
f(r, 8) = r2 cos 8 sin 8  does  lead  to  zf/dr = 2r cos 8 sin 8. the derivative is  correct. 
the only incorrect thing-but  we do it anyway-is 
it is --+ --.

to write f  instead of  f.

the  derivatives of  f(g(x, y)) 

here g  depends on x  and y,  and f  depends on g.  suppose x  moves by  dx, while y 
stays constant.  then g  moves  by  dg = (ag/ax)dx. when g  changes, f also  changes: 
df = (df/dg)dg.now substitute for dg  to make the chain: df = (df/dg)(ag/dx)dx.this

example 1  every f(x + cy) satisfies the  l-way wave equation df/ay = c af/ax. 
the inside function is g = x + cy. the outside function can be  anything, g2 or sin g 
or eg. the  composite function is  ( x  + cy)2 or  sin(x + cy) or  ex+cy. in each  separate 
case we  could check  that  df/dy = c dfldx. the chain rule  produces this equation in 
all cases at once, from aglax = 1 and i?g/ay= c: 

this is important: af/ay = c afldx is our first example of a partial dierential equation. 
the unknown f(x, y) has two variables. two partial derivatives enter the equation. 

13.5  the chain rule 

up to now  we  have  worked  with  dyldt  and  ordinary  di$ercntial  equations. the 
independent variable was time or space (and only one dimension in space). for partial 
differential equations the variables are time and space (possibly several dimensions 
in space). the great equations of mathematical physics-heat 
equation, wave equa- 
tion, laplace's equation-are  partial differential equations. 

notice how the chain rule applies to f = sin xy. its x derivative is y cos xy. a patient 
reader  would check that f is sing and g is xy and f,  is &g,.  probably  you  are not 
so patient-you  know the derivative of sin xy. therefore we pass quickly to the next 
chain rule. its outside function depends on two inside functions,  and each of  those 
depends on t. we want dfldt. 

the  derivative of  f(x(t), y(t)) 

before the formula, here is the idea. suppose t changes by at.  that affects x and y; 
they change by ax  and ay.  there is a domino effect onfi it changes by a$  tracing 
backwards, 

a f z d f ~ x + - a y  

ax 

af 
dy 

dx 
and  ax=-at 
dt 

d~
and  ayz-at.
dt 

substitute the last two into the first, connecting af  to at.  then let at -,0: 

this is close to the one-variable rule dzldx = (dz/dy)(dy/dx). there we could "cancel" 
dy.  (we actually  canceled ay  in  (az/ay)(ay/ax), and  then  approached  the  limit.) 
now  at  affects af 
in two ways,  through  x  and  through  y.  the chain rule  has two 
terms. if  we cancel in (af/ax)(dx/dt) we only get one of  the terms! 

we mention  again  that the true name for f(x(t), y(t)) is f(t) not f(t).  for f(x, y, z) 

the rule has three terms: fxx, +fyyt +fiz, isf, (or better df/dt). 

example 2  how quickly does the temperature change when you drive to florida? 
suppose  the  midwest is  at  30  f and  florida  is  at 80  f.  going  1000 miles south 
increases the temperature f(x, y) by 50  , or .05 degrees per mile. driving straight south 
at 70 miles per hour, the rate of increase is (.05)(70) = 3.5 degrees per hour. note how 
(degreeslmile) times (miles/hour)equals (degrees/hour). that is the ordinary chain rule 
(df/dx)(dx/dt) = (df/dt)-
if  the  road  goes  southeast,  the  temperature  is f = 30 + .05x + .oly. now  x(t) is 

there is no y variable going south.

in reality there is another term. the temperature also depends directly on t, because 
of  night and day. the factor cos(2?ct/24) has  a period  of  24 hours, and it  brings  an

is  -n degrees per hour. you have to drive faster than 70 mph to get warm. 

second derivatives 

what is d2 f/dt2? we need the derivative of (4),  which is painful. it is like acceleration 
in chapter 12, with many terms. so start with movement in a straight line. 
suppose x = xo + t cos 9 and y =yo + t sin 9. we are moving at the fixed angle 9, 
with speed 1. the derivatives are x, = cos 9 and y, = sin 9 and cos29 + sin29= 1. then 
dfldt  is immediate from the chain rule: 

f, =fxx, +fyyt=fx  cos 9 +f, sin 9. 
for the second derivative f,,, apply this rule to f,. then f,, is 

cos 9 + (f,),  sin 9 = (fxx cos 9 +ax sin 9) cos 9 + (f,  cos 9 +fyy  sin 9) sin 9. 

f,,=fxx cos26+ 2fxycos 6 sin 6 +fyy sin26. 

collect terms: 
(6) 
in  polar  coordinates  change  t  to  r.  when  we  move  in  the  r  direction,  9 is  fixed. 
equation (6) givesf, from fxx, fxy, fyy.  second derivatives on curved paths (with new 
terms from the curving) are saved for the exercises. 

example 3  if fxx, fxy, fyy  are all continuous and bounded by m, find a bound onf;,. 
this is the second derivative along any line. 
solution  equation (6) gives if,l  < m cos26 + m sin 29 + m sin29 < 2m. this upper 
bound  2m was needed in equation  13.3.14, for the error in linear approximation. 

the  derivatives of  f(x(t, u), y(t, u)) 

suppose there are two inside functions x and y, each depending on t and u.  when t 
moves, x and y both  move: dx = x,dt and dy = y,dt. then dx and dy force a change

this rule has a/at instead of dldt, because of the extra variable u. the symbols remind 
us  that  u is constant. similarly t is constant  while u moves,  and  there is  a  second 
chain rule for aflau: 

fu  =fxxu +f,yu. 

in polar coordinates findf, andf,,.  start from f(x, y) =f(r cos 9, r sin 9).

9=fxx(- r sin 9) +fxy(r cos 9). 

the second 9 derivative is harder, because (8) has four terms that depend on 6. apply 
the chain rule to the first term  af/ax.  it  is  a function of  x  and  y,  and  x  and  y are

this formula is not attractive. in mathematics, a messy formula is almost always a 
signal of  asking the wrong  question. in fact the combination f,,  +f,,  is much more 
special thian the separate derivatives. we might hope the same forf,, +f,,,  but dimen- 
sionally  that is impossible-since 
r is a length and 8 is an angle. the dimensions of 
f,,  andf,,  are matched byf,,  andf,/r and f,,/r2.  we could even hope that 

f x x  +f,, =f,r  + ;f,+

this  equation  is  true.  add  (5) + (6) + (9)  with  t  changed  to  r.  laplace's  equation 
fxx  +&,  =  0 is now expressed in polar  coordinates: f,, +f,/r +f,,/r2  = 0. 

a paradox 

before leiaving polar  coordinates there  is one more question. it goes back  to drldx, 
which wals  practically the first example of  partial derivatives: 

my problem  is this. we know that x is r cos 8. so x/r on the right side is cos 8. on 
the other hand r is xlcos 8. so &-/ax is also  l/cos 8. how  can drldx lead to cos 8 one 
way and  l/cos 8 the other way? 

i will  admit  that  this  cost  me  a  sleepless night.  there  must  be  an explanation- 

we  cannot  end  with  cos 8 = l/cos 8.  this  paradox  brings  a  new  respect  for  partial 
derivatives.  may  i  tell  you  what  i  finally  noticed?  you  could  cover  up  the  next 
paragraph and think  about the puzzle first. 

the  key  to  partial  derivatives  is  to  ask:  which  variable  is  held  constant?  in 
equation (1 1), y is constant. but when r = xlcos 8 gave &/ax = l/cos 8 , 8  was constant. 
in both cases we change x and look at the effect on r. the movement is on a horizontal 
line (constant y) or on a radial line (constant 8). figure 13.15 shows the difference. 

remark  this example shows that drldx is different from l/(dx/ar). the neat formula 
(dr/dx)(dx/dr)= 1 is not generally true. may i tell you what takes its place? we have 
to includle (dr/dy)(ay/dr). with two  variables xy and two variables re, we  need  2 by 
2 matrices!  section 14.4 gives the details: 

,.  /  - :r ar = ax cos u

/ d.r 

fig. 13.15  dr = dx cos 0 when  y  is constant, dr = dxlcos 8 when 0 is constant.

non-independent variables 

this paradox points to a serious problem. in computing partial derivatives off(x, y, z), 
we  assumed that  x, y, z were independent. up to now, x could move while y and z 
were fixed. in physics and chemistry and economics that may not be possible. if  there 
is a relation between x, y, z, then x can't  move by itself. 

example 5  the gas law  pv = nrt relates pressure to  volume and  temperature. 
p, v,  t are not independent. what is the meaning of  dv/ap? does it equal l/(dp/av)? 

those questions have no answers, until we say what is held constant. in the paradox, 
&/ax had one meaning for fixed y and another meaning for fixed 8. to inrlicate what 
is held constant, use an extra subscript (not denoting a derivative): 

(af/ap),  has  constant  volume  and  (af/ap),  has  constant  temperature.  the  usual 
af/dp  has both  v and  t constant.  but then the gas law won't  let us change p. 
example 6  let f = 3x + 2y + z. compute af/ax  on the plane z = 4x + y. 
solution 1  think of  x and y as independent. replace z by 4x + y: 

f =  3x + 2~ + ( 4 ~+ y)  so  (af/ax), = 7. 

solution 2  keep x and y independent. deal with z by  the chain rule: 

(aflax),  = aflax + (aflaz)(az/ax)= 3 + (i)(+ = 7. 

solution 3  (di$evnt)  make x and z independent. then y = z - 4x: 

without a subscript, af/ax  means: take the x derivative the usual way. the answer 
is af/ax  = 3, when y and z don't move. but on the plane z = 4x + y, one of them must 
move! 3 is only part of  the total answer, which is (aflax),  = 7 or (af/ax), = - 5. 
here is the geometrical meaning. we  are on the plane z = 4x + y.  the derivative 
(afldx),, moves  x  but  not  y.  to  stay  on  the  plane,  dz  is  4dx.  the  change in f =  
3 ~ + 2 y + z i s d f = 3 d x + o + d z = 7 d x .  
example 7  on the world line x2 + y2 + z2= t2 find (af/dy),,,  for f= xyzt. 
the  subscripts x, z  mean  that  x  and  z  are  fixed.  the  chain  rule  skips af/dx  and 
aflaz : 

(af1a~)x.z= aflay + (aflat)(at/ay)= xzt + (xyz)(y/t). why ylt? 

example 8  from the law pv = t, compute the product (ap/av),(av,/at),(at/ap),. 
any intelligent person cancels av's,  at's,  and ap's  to get  1. the right answer is  -1: 

(a la v),  = - tiv2 

(av,at),  = 1/p 

(atiap),  = v. 

the product  is  - tipv.  this is  -1 not  + l! the chain rule is tricky (problem 42). 

example 9  implicit differentiation was used in chapter 4. the chain rule explains it: 

if f(x, y) = 0 then f,  + fyyx= 0 so dyldx = - fx/fy.

the outstanding equation of id128 is also the simplest: dfldx  = 0. the 
slope  is  zero  and  the  tangent  line  is  horizontal.  most  likely  we  are at  the  top or 
bottom of the graph-a  maximum or a minimum. this is the point that the engineer 
or manager  or scientist or investor is looking for-maximum 
stress or production 
or velocity or profit. with more variables in f(x, y) and f(x, y, z),  the problem becomes 
more realistic. the question still is: how  to locate the maximum and minimum? 

the answer is  in  the  partial  derivatives.  when  the  graph  is level,  they  are zero. 
deriving  the  equations f, = 0  and f,= 0  is  pure  mathematics  and  pure  pleasure. 
applying them  is the  serious part. we  watch  out for  saddle  points,  and  also for a 
minimum at a  boundary point-this 
section takes extra time.  remember the steps 
for f(x) in one-variable calculus: 

1.  the leading candidates are stationary points (where dfldx = 0). 
2.  the other candidates are rough points  (no derivative) and endpoints (a  or b). 
3.  maximum vs. minimum  is decided by  the sign of  the second derivative. 

in two dimensions, a stationary point requires  af/dx  = 0 and df/ay  = 0.  the tangent 
line  becomes  a  tangent  plane.  the endpoints a  and  b  are replaced  by  a  boundary 
curve. in practice boundaries contain about 40% of the minima and 80% of the work. 

13.6  maxima,  minima,  and saddle  points

505

finally  there are  three second  derivatives fxx,fxy,  and fy,.  they  tell  how  the  graph
bends  away  from  the  tangent  plane-up  at  a  minimum,  down  at  a  maximum,  both
ways  at a saddle point. this  will be  determined  by  comparing  (fxx)(fyy)  with  (fx) 2 .

stationary  point -+ horizontal  tangent  --  zero  derivatives

supposef has a minimum  at  the point (xo,  yo).  this may  be  an absolute minimum or
only  a local minimum. in both casesf(xo, yo)  <f(x, y) near the point.  for an absolute
minimum,  this  inequality  holds  wherever  f  is  defined.  for  a  local  minimum,  the
inequality  can  fail  far  away  from  (xo,  yo).  the  bottom  of your  foot  is  an  absolute
minimum,  the end  of your  finger is  a local minimum.

we  assume  for  now  that  (xo,  yo) 

is  an  interior point  of  the  domain  off. at  a

boundary  point, we  cannot  expect  a  horizontal  tangent  and zero  derivatives.

main  conclusion:  at a minimum or maximum (absolute or local) a nonzero  deriva-
tive is  impossible.  the  tangent  plane  would  tilt.  in some  direction f  would  decrease.
note  that the  minimum  point is  (xo,  yo),  and the minimum  value is f(xo,  yo).

13j 

if derivatives  exist  at  an  interior  minimum  or maximum,  they  are  zero:

of/lx  = 0  and  oflay  = 0 

(together  this is  grad f= 0). 

(1)

for  a  function f(x, y,  z) of three  variables,  add  the  third  equation  af/az = 0.

the reasoning  goes  back to  the one-variable  case.  that is because  we look  along the
lines  x = x0  and  y = yo.  the  minimum  off(x, y) is  at the  point  where  the lines  meet.
so  this  is  also  the  minimum  along each line separately.

moving in the x direction along y = yo,  we find of/ox  = 0. moving in the y direction,
of/oy  = 0  at  the  same  point.  the  slope  in  every  direction is  zero.  in  other  words
grad f= 0.

graphically,  (xo,  yo)  is  the  low  point  of the surface  z =f(x, y).  both  cross  sections
in  figure  13.16  touch  bottom.  the  phrase  "if derivatives  exist"  rules  out  the vertex
of a cone,  which  is  a rough point. the absolute  value f= ixi  has  a minimum  without
df/dx = 0,  and  so  does the distance f= r. the  rough point  is  (0, 0).

(cid:127)
13  partial derivatives 

notice what's  important:  there are two equations for  two unknowns x and y.  since f 
is quadratic, the equations are linear. their solution is xo = 3, yo = $ (the stationary 
point). this is actually a minimum, but to prove that you need  to read further. 

the constant 1 affects the minimum value f = :-but 

not the minimum point. the 
graph shifts up by 1. the linear terms  -x - y affect fx  andfy  . they move the minimum 
away from (0,o). the quadratic part x2 + xy + y2 makes the surface curve upwards. 
without  that  curving  part,  a  plane  has  its  minimum  and  maximum  at boundary 
points. 

example 2 
(steiner's problem)  find  the point  that  is nearest to three given points. 
this example is worth your attention. we are locating an airport close to three cities. 
or we  are choosing a  house close  to  three jobs.  the problem  is  to get  as near  as 
possible to the corners of a triangle. the best point depends on the meaning of "near." 
the  distance  to  the  first  corner  (x, , y,)  is  dl = ,/(x  - x,),  + (y - y,),.  the  dis- 
tances to the other corners (x,,  y,)  and (x,,  y,)  are d;  and d,.  depending on whether 
cost equals (distance) or (di~tance)~ 

our problem  will  be: 

minimize  d , + d , + d ,  

oreven  d ~ + d ~ + d ~  

or (di~tance)~, 
or  d : + d i + d :  

the second problem  is the easiest, when  d:  and d t  and d i  are quadratics: 

a ~ j a x = 2 ~ ~ - x l + x - x 2 + x - x 3 ~ = ~a f / a y = 2 [ y - y l + y - y 2 + y - y 3 1 = o .  
solving iflax  = 0 gives x = i ( x l  + x,  + x,).  then af/dy  = 0 gives y = i(y, + y,  + y,). 
the best  point  is  the  centroid  of the  triangle (figure 13.17a). it is  the nearest  point 
to the corners when the cost is (distance),.  note how squaring makes the derivatives 
linear. least  squares dominates an enormous part  of  applied  mathematics. 

u3 


fig. 13.17  the centroid minimizes  d :  + d $ + d 3 .  the steiner point  minimizes  dl + d2 + d3 
the real "steiner problem"  is to minimize f(x, y) = dl + d,  + d, . we are laying down 
roads from  the corners, with  cost proportional to length.  the equations f, = 0 and 
in 
f , = 0  look  complicated  because  of  square  roots.  but  the  nearest  point 
figure  13.17b has a remarkable property, which you  will appreciate. 
calculus  takes  derivatives  of  d:  = (x - xl), + (y - y,),.  the  x  derivative  leaves

this gradient  is a unit  vector. the sum of  (x - ~ , ) ~ / d :and (y - yj2/d:  is d:/d:  = 1. 
this  was  already  in  section 13.4: distance  increases  with  slope  1 away  from  the 
center. the gradient of  dl (call it u,)  is a  unit vector from the center point (x,, y,). 

13.6  maxima, minima, and saddle points 

similarly the gradients of  d,  and d,  are unit vectors u2 and u3. they point directly 
away from  the other corners  of  the triangle. the total cost is f(x, y) = dl + d ,  + d3, 
so  we  add  the  gradients.  the equations f, = 0  and f, = 0  combine  into  the  vector 
equation 

grad f = u, + u2 + u3 = 0 at the minimum. 

the three unit  vectors add to zero! moving away from one corner brings us closer to 
another.  the  nearest  point  to the three  corners  is  where  those  movements  cancel. 
this is the meaning of  "grad f = 0 at the minimum." 

it is unusual  for three unit  vectors  to add to zero-this 

can only happen  in one 
way.  the three directions must form  angles of  120". the best point has this property, 
which is .repeated in figure 13.18a. the unit vectors cancel each other. at the "steiner 
point,"  the  roads  to  the  corners make  120" angles.  this  optimal  point  solves the 
problem,, except for one more possibility.

120". 

the  other  possibility  is  a  minimum  at a  rough point.  the graph  of  the  distance 
function d,(x, y) is a cone. it has a sharp point at the center (x,, y,).  all three corners 
of the triangle are rough points for dl + d,  + d,,  so all of them are possible minimizers. 
suppo,se the angle at a corner exceeds  120". then there is no steiner point.  inside 
the triangle, the  angle  would  become  even wider.  the best  point  must  be  a  rough 
point-one  of the corners. the winner is the corner with the wide angle. in the figure 
that mea.ns dl = 0. then the sum d,  + d,  comes from the two shortest edges. 
sum mar.^  the solution is at a 120" point or a wide-angle corner. that is the theory. 
the real problem  is to compute the steiner point-which

dl + d24- d3 + d4-there

minimizing their total length, and allow the roads to branch. a typical  solution is in

minimum or  maximum on the  boundary 

steiner's problem had no boundaries. the roads could go anywhere. but most appli- 
cations have restrictions on x and y, like x 3 0 or y d 0 or x2 + y2 2 1. the minimum 
with these restrictions is probably higher than the absolute minimum. there are three 
possibilities: 

(1) stationary point fx  = 0, fy  = 0 

(2) rough point 

(3) boundary point 

that third possibility requires us to maximize or minimize f(x, y) along the boundary. 
example 3  minimize f(x,  y) = x2 + xy + y2 - x - y + 1 in the halfplane  x 2 0. 
the minimum  in  example  1 was 3. it  occurred  at x,  = 3, yo = 3. this point  is  still 
allowed. it satisfies the restriction x 3 0. so the minimum is not moved. 
example 4  minimize the same f (x, y) restricted  to the  lower halfplane y < 0. 
now  the absolute minimum at (3, i)is not  allowed. there are no rough  points.  we 
look  for  a  minimum  on  the  boundary  line  y = 0  in  figure 13.19a.  set  y = 0,  so f 
depends only  on x. then choose the best x: 

f(x, 0) = x2 + 0 - x - 0 + 1 

fx  = 2x - 1 = 0. 
the minimum is at x =  and y = 0, where f = 2. this is up from 5. 

and 

fig. 13.19  the boundaries  y = 0 and x2 + y2 = 1 contain  the minimum  points. 

example 5  minimize  the same f(x, y) on or outside the  circle x2 + y2 = 1. 
one possibility  is fx  = 0 and f,,= 0. but  this  is  at (i,k), inside  the  circle. the  other 
possibility  is a minimum at a boundary  point, on  the circle. 
to follow this boundary  we  can set y = jm.the function f gets complicated, 
and dfldx  is worse. there is a way to avoid square roots:  set x = cos t and y = sin t. 
then f = x2 + xy + y 2  - x - y + 1 is a function of  the angle t: 

f(t) = 1 + cos  t  sin t - cos t - sin t + 1 
dfldt  = cos2t - sin2t+ sin t - cos t = (cos t  - sin t)(cos t + sin  t - 1). 

now dfldt  = 0 locates a minimum or maximum along the boundary. the first factor 
(cos t - sin t )  is zero when x = y. the second factor is zero when cos t + sin t = 1, or 
x + y = 1. those points on  the circle are the candidates.  problem 24 sorts them  out, 
"lagrange multipliers." 
and  section  13.7 finds  the  minimum  in  a  new  way-using 

13.6  maxima,  minima,  and  saddle  points

minimization  on  a  boundary  is  a  serious  problem-it  gets  difficult  quickly-and
multipliers  are ultimately  the  best solution.

maximum  vs.  minimum  vs.  saddle  point

how to separate the maximum from  the minimum?  when possible,  try all candidates
and decide.  computef at every  stationary  point and other critical  point  (maybe also
out  at  infinity),  and  compare.  calculus  offers  another  approach,  based  on  second
derivatives.

with  one  variable  the  second  derivative  test  was  simple: fxx  >  0  at  a  minimum,
fxx  = 0  at  an inflection  point, fxx  < 0  at a maximum.  this  is  a  local  test, which  may
not  give  a  global  answer.  but it  decides  whether  the  slope  is  increasing  (bottom  of
the graph) or  decreasing  (top of the graph).  we  now find  a similar  test  for f(x, y).

the  new  test  involves  all  three  second  derivatives.  it  applies  where  fx  = 0  and
f,  = 0.  the  tangent  plane  is  horizontal.  we  ask whether the graph off goes above or
below  that plane. the  tests fxx  > 0  and fy,  > 0  guarantee  a  minimum  in the  x  and  y
directions,  but  there are  other directions.

example  6  f(x, y) =  x 2 + loxy + y2  has fxx  = 2, fx  =  10, fyy, = 2 (minimum or not?)
all second  derivatives  are  positive-but  wait  and  see.  the  stationary  point  is  (0, 0),
where  af/ax and  aflay are both  zero.  our function  is  the sum  of x2 + y2, which  goes
upward,  and  10xy which  has  a  saddle.  the  second  derivatives  must  decide  whether
x2 +  y2  or  loxy  is  stronger.

along  the x axis,  where  y = 0 and f= x 2, our point is at the bottom.  the minimum
in the  x direction is  at (0, 0).  similarly for the y  direction.  but (0,  0) is not a minimum
point for  the whole  function,  because  of loxy.

try  x =  1, y  =  - 1. then f= 1 - 10 + 1, which  is  negative.  the graph  goes  below

the  xy  plane  in that  direction.  the stationary  point at  x = y =  0 is  a saddle point.

example  7  f(x,  y) = x 2 + xy  + y2  has fxx  = 2,  fx,  =  1, fyy  = 2  (minimum or not?)
the second  derivatives  2,  1, 2 are  again positive.  the graph  curves  up  in the x  and y
directions.  but there  is  a big difference  from  example  6: fx,  is  reduced  from  10  to  1.
it is the size of fx  (not its sign!) that makes the difference. the extra terms  - x - y + 4
in  example  1 moved  the  stationary  point  to  (-, -).  the  second  derivatives  are  still
2, 1, 2, and  they  pass  the test  for a  minimum:

13  partial derivatives

for  a  direct  proof, split f(x, y) into two  parts  by  "completing  the  square:"

ax2  + 2bx y  + cy 2 = a  x+  y  + ac - b2

that  algebra  can  be  checked  (notice  the  2b).  it  is  the  conclusion  that's  important:

if a > 0 and  ac > b2 , both  parts  are  positive:  minimum  at (0,  0)

if a < 0 and  ac > b2, both  parts  are  negative:  maximum  at (0,  0)
if ac < b2 , the parts  have  opposite  signs: 

saddle point  at (0, 0).

since  the  test  involves  the  square of  b,  its  sign  has  no  importance.  example  6  had
b =  5  and  a  saddle  point.  example  7  had  b  = 1  and  a  minimum.  reversing  to
- x2 - xy  - y2 yields  a  maximum.  so  does  - x 2 + xy  - y2

now comes  the final  step,  from  ax 2 +  2bxy + cy 2  to  a general  functionf(x, y).  for

all  functions,  quadratics  or not, it is  the  second order terms that  we test.

example  8  f(x, y) =  ex - x  - cos y has  a  stationary  point at  x = 0, y = 0.

the  first  derivatives  are  ex  - 1 and  sin y,  both  zero.  the second  derivatives  are fxx
ex =  1 and fry = cos  y =  1 and fxy =  0.  we  only  use  the  derivatives  at the stationary
point. the  first  derivatives  are  zero,  so  the  second  order  terms  come  to  the  front  in
the  series  for  ex - x - cos y:

(1 + x +   x2   ... _ 

2  ...  2  2  + higher order terms. 

(7)

there  is  a  minimum at the  origin.  the  quadratic part    x2 +    y 2 goes  upward.  the x3
and  y 4  terms  are  too  small  to  protest.  eventually  those  terms  get  large,  but  near  a
stationary  point  it  is  the  quadratic  that  counts.  we  didn't  need  the  whole  series,
because  from fxx =f,, =  1 and fxy = 0  we  knew  it  would  start  with    x 2 +   y2.

13l  the  test  in  43k applies  to  the  second  derivatives  a =fxx,  b =fx,, c =fy
of any f(x, y) at any  stationary  point.  at  all points  the test  decides whether  the
graph is  concave  up, concave  down,  or "indefinite."

example  9  f(x, y) =  exy  has fx = yexy  and f,  = xexy.  the  stationary point  is  (0,  0).

the  second  derivatives  at  that  point  are  a =fxx =  0,  b =fxy = 1, and  c =fy, = 0. the
test  b 2 > ac makes  this  a  saddle  point.  look  at  the  infinite  series:

exy  =  1 +  xy  +  x 2y 2  + ...

no  linear  term  becausefx  =f, = 0:  the  origin  is  a stationary point. no x 2  or y2  term
(only  xy):  the  stationary  point  is a  saddle point.

at  x = 2,  y =  - 2  we find  fxxfry > (fxy) 2 . the  graph  is  concave  up  at that  point-

but  it's not  a  minimum  since  the  first  derivatives  are  not  zero.

the  series  begins  with  the  constant  term-not  important.  then  come  the  linear
terms-extremely  important.  those  terms  are  decided  by first derivatives,  and  they
give the  tangent plane. it is only at stationary points-when  the linear part disappears
and  the  tangent  plane  is horizontal-that  second  derivatives  take  over.  around  any
basepoint,  these constant-linear-quadratic terms are the start of the  taylor series.

13.6  maxima,  minima, and  saddle  points 

511

the  taylor  series

we  now put  together  the whole  infinite series.  it is a "taylor  series"-which  means
it  is  a power  series  that matches  all derivatives  off (at  the  basepoint).  for  one
variable,  the  powers  were  x"  when  the  basepoint  was  0.  for  two  variables,  the
powers  are  x"  times  y'  when  the  basepoint  is  (0, 0).  chapter  10  multiplied  the  nth
derivative d"f/dx n by xl/n! now  every mixed derivative (d/dx)"(d/8y)mf(x, y) is computed
at the  basepoint (subscript  o).

we multiply  those  numbers  by  x"ym/n!m!  to  match each  derivative  of f(x, y):

13m  when the basepoint is (0, 0),  the taylor series is a double sum  1ya,,mxp.
the  term  anmxnym  has the same mixed  derivative  at (0, 0) asf(x, y).  the series  is

the  derivatives  of this series agree  with the derivatives off(x, y) at the  basepoint.

the  first  three  terms  are  the  linear  approximation  to f(x, y).  they  give  the  tangent
plane  at  the  basepoint.  the  x2  term  has  n = 2  and  m = 0,  so  n!m! = 2.  the  xy  term
has n = m =  1, and  n!m! =  1. the quadratic part -ax 2  + 2bxy + cy 2 ) is in control when
the linear part is zero.

example  10  all  derivatives  of ex+y  equal  one at  the origin.  the  taylor  series  is

this  happens  to  have  ac =  b2, the  special  case  that  was  omitted  in  13m  and  43n.
it is the  two-dimensional version of an  inflection point. the  second  derivatives  fail to
decide  the  concavity.  when  fxxfy,  = (fxy) 2,  the  decision  is  passed  up  to  the  higher
derivatives. but in ordinary practice,  the taylor series  is stopped after the quadratics.
if the basepoint  moves  to (xo, yo),  the powers  become  (x - xo)"(y - yo)m"-and all

derivatives  are computed  at  this new  basepoint.
final question:  how  would you  compute  a minimum  numerically? one  good  way is
to  solve fx  = 0  and fy = 0.  these  are  the  functions  g  and  h  of  newton's  method
(section  13.3).  at  the  current  point  (x,, yn),  the  derivatives  of g =fx  and  h =f, give
linear equations for the steps ax  and  ay.  then  the next  point x,.  1 = x, + ax,  y,, +  =
y,  + ay  comes  from  those  steps.  the  input  is  (x,, y,),  the  output  is  the new  point,
and the  linear equations  are

(gx)ax  + (gy)ay  =  - g(xn,  y,) 
(hx)ax + (hy)ay  =  - h(x,, y,) 

or 

(fxx)ax  + (fxy)ay  =  -fx(xn,  y,,)
(fxy)ax  + (fyy)ay  =  -fy(xn,  y,).

(5)

when  the second  derivatives  of f  are  available,  use newton's  method.

when  the  problem  is  too  complicated  to  go  beyond  first  derivatives,  here  is  an
alternative-steepest descent. the  goal  is  to  move  down  the  graph  of f(x,  y),  like  a
boulder rolling down  a mountain. the steepest  direction at  any point is  given by the
gradient, with a minus sign to go down  instead  of up.  so move in the direction  ax =
- s af/ax and ay  =  - s aflay.

13  partial derivatives 

the  question  is:  how  far  to  move?  like  a  boulder,  a  steep  start  may  not  aim 
directly  toward  the minimum. the stepsize s is monitored, to end the step when the 
function f starts upward  again (problem 54). at  the  end of  each step, compute first 
derivatives and start again in the new  steepest direction.

13.7  constraints and lagrange multipliers 

this section faces up to a practical problem. we often minimize one function f(x, y) 
while another  function g(x, y) is  fixed.  there is a  constraint on x  and  y,  given  by 
g(x, y) = k.  this restricts the material available or the funds available or the energy 
available. with this constraint, the problem is to do the best possible (f,,, 
or fmin). 
at the absolute minimum off(x, y), the requirement g(x, y) = k is probably violated. 

in that  case the minimum point  is not allowed. we  cannot  use f, = 0 and f,,= o-
those equations don't  account for g. 

step 1  find equations for the constrained minimum or constrained maximum. they 
will involve f, andf,, and also g,  and g,,  which give local information about f and g. 
to see the equations, look at two examples. 
example 1  minimizef = x2 + y2 subject to the constraint g = 2x + y = k. 
trial runs  the constraint allows x = 0, y = k,  where f = k2. also ($k, 0) satisfies the 
constraint, and f = $k2 is smaller. also x = y = $k  gives f = $k2 (best so far). 
idea of  solution  look at the level curves of f(x, y) in figure 13.21. they are circles 
x2 + y2 = c.  when c is small, the circles do not touch the line 2x + y = k.  there are 
no points that satisfy the constraint, when c is too small. now  increase c. 
eventually the growing circles x2 + y2 = c will just  touch  the line x + 2y = k.  the 
point  where  they  touch  is  the  winner.  it  gives the  smallest value  of  c that  can  be 
achieved on the line. the touching point is (xmin, ymi,), and the value of  c is fmin. 

what  equation  describes that  point?  when  the  circle touches the  line,  they  are 
tangent. they have the same slope. the perpendiculars to the circle and  he line go in 
the same direction. that is the key fact, which you see in figure 13.21a.the direction 
perpendicular to f = c is given by grad f = (f,, 
f,).  the direction perpendicular to g = 
k is  given  by  grad g = (g,,  g,).  the  key  equation  says  that  those  two  vectors  are 
parallel. one gradient vector is a multiple of  the other gradient vector, with a multi- 
plier a  (called lambda) that is unknown: 

i 13n  at  the  minimum  of f(x, y)  subject  to  gjx, y) = k,  the  gradient  off  is 

an unknown number a as the multiplier: 

parallel to the gradient of g-with 

step 2  there are now three unknowns x, y, a.  there are also three equations: 

in  the  third  equation,  substitute  2a  for  2x  and  fi.  for  y.  then  2x + y  equals 3). 
equals k. knowing  = $k, go back to the first two equations for x, y, and fmin: 

the  winning  point  (xmin, ymin) is  ($k,  f k).  it  minimizes  the  "distance  squared," 
f = x2 + y2 = 3k2, from the origin to the line. 

13.7  constmints and lagrange muliipllen 

question  what is the meaning of the lagrange multiplier a? 
mysterious  answer  the  derivative  of  *k2 is  $k,  which  equals  a.  the  multipler 
a  is the devivative of fmin  with respect to k.  move the line by ak, and fmin  changes by 
about aak.  thus the lagrange multiplier measures the sensitivity to k. 

pronounce his name "lagronge"  or better "lagrongh"  as if you are french. 

if =fmin 


fig. 13.21  circlesf = c tangent to line g = k and ellipse g = 4: parallel gradients. 

example 2  maximize and minimize f = x2+ y2 on the ellipse g = (x -1)' + 44'  = 4. 
idea and equations  the circles x2 + y2 = c grow until they touch the ellipse. the 
touching point is (x,,,,  ymi,) and that smallest value of  c is fmin.  as  the circles grow 
they cut through the ellipse. finally there is a point (x,,,,  y,,,)  where the last circle 
touches. that largest value of  c is f,,,  . 

the minimum and maximum are described by the same rule: the circle is tangent 
to the ellipse (figure 13.21b). the perpendiculars go in the same direction. therefore 
(fx, 4)is a multiple of  (g,,  gy), and the unknown multiplier is a: 

1. 

solution  the second equation allows two possibilities: y = 0 or a  = a. following up 
y = 0,  the  last  equation  gives  (x - 1)'  = 4.  thus  x = 3  or  x = - 1. then  the  first 
equation  gives  a  = 312  or  a  = 112.  the  values  of  f are  x2 + y2 = 3'  + 0'  = 9  and 
~ ~ + ~ ~ = ( - 1 ) ~ + 0 ~ =
now  follow  a = 114. the first equation yields  x = - 113. then  the last  equation 
requires y2 = 5/9. since x2 = 119 we find x2 + y2 = 619 = 213. this is f,,,. 
conclusion  the equations  (3) have four solutions, at which the circle and ellipse 
and (- 113,  -&3).  the 
are tangent. the four points are (3, o),  (- 1, o),  (- 113, &3), 
four values off  are 9,  1,3,3. 
summary  the three equations are fx  = agx and fy  = ag,,  and g = k.  the unknowns 
are x, y, and a.  there is no absolute system for solving the equations (unless they are 
linear; then use elimination or cramer's  rule). often the first two equations yield x 
and y in terms of  a,  and substituting into g = k gives an equation for a. 

at  the  minimum,  the  level  curve f(x, y) = c  is  tangent  to  the  constraint  curve 
g(x, y) = k.  if  that  constraint  curve  is  given  parametrically  by  x(t) and  y(t),  then 

13  partial derlvclthres 

minimizing f(x(t), y(t)) uses the chain rule: 

df  - af  dx 
----  + - - = 0  or  (grad f )   (tangent to curve) = 0. 
dt 
ax dt 

af  dy 
dy  dt 

this is  the  calculus proof  that  grad f is perpendicular  to  the  curve.  thus grad f is 
parallel to grad g. this means ( fx  , f,)  = a(g,  , gy)- 

we have lost f, = 0 and fy  = 0. but a new function l has three zero derivatives: 

i 130  the  lagrange  function  is  y x ,  y, a)  = f(x, y) - i(g(x, y) - k).  its  three 

derivatives are l, = l, = la = 0 at the solution: 

note that dl/aa = 0 automatically produces g = k.  the constraint  is "built in"  to l. 
lagrange has included a term a(g - k), which is destined to be zero-but 
its derivatives 
are  absolutely  needed  in  the  equations!  at  the  solution,  g = k  and  l =  f  and 
a ~ / a k  = a. 
what is important is fx  = ag,  andf, = agy, coming from l,  = ly = 0. in words: the 
constraint g = k forces dg = g,dx  + gydy = 0.  this restricts the movements dx and dy. 
they must keep to the curve. the equations say that df  = fxdx + fydy is equal to adg. 
thus df  is zero in  the aelowed direction-which 

is the key point. 

maximum and  minimum with  two  constraints 

the  whole  subject  of  min(max)imization is  called  optimization.  its  applications  to 
business decisions make up operations research. the special case of  linear functions 
this part of  mathematics it is called id135. a 
is always important -in 
book about those subjects won't  fit inside a calculus book, but we can take one more 
step-to 

allow a second constraint. 

the  function  to  minimize  or  maximize  is  now f(x, y, z).  the  constraints  are 
g(x, y, z) = k,  and h(x, y, z) = k,.  the multipliers are a, and a,.  we need at least three 
variables x, y, z because two constraints would completely determine x and y. 

13p  to minimize f(x, y, z) subject to g(x, y, z)  = k, and h(x, y, z) = k2 , solve five 
equations for x, y,  z,  a,,  2,.  combine g = k,  and h = k2 with 

i 

figure 13.22a  shows  the  geometry  behind  these  equations.  for  convenience f is 
x2 + y2 + z2, so we are minimizing distance (squared). the constraints g = x + y + z = 
9 and h = x + 2y + 32 = 20 are linear-their  graphs are planes. the constraints keep 
therefore on the line where they meet. we  are finding 
(x, y, z) on both planes-and 
the squared distance from  (0, 0, 0) to a line. 
what equation do we  solve? the level surfaces x2 + y2 + z2 = c are spheres. they 
grow as c increases. the first sphere to touch the line is tangent to it. that touching 
point  gives the  solution  (the smallest c). all  three  vectors gradf, grad g, grad h are 
perpendicular  to the line: 

line tangent  to sphere => grad f perpendicular to line 

line in both  planes  grad g and grad  h perpendicular to line.

thus gradf, grad g, grad h are in  the same plane-perpendicular 
three vectors in a plane, grad f is a combination  of grad g  and grad h: 

to the line.  with 

this is the key equation (5). it applies to curved surfaces as well as planes. 
example 3  minimize x2 + y2 + z2 when x + y + z = 9 and x + 2y + 32 = 20. 
in  figure 13.22b,  the  normals  to  those  planes  are  grad g = (1, 1, 1) and  grad h = 
(1, 2, 3). the gradient off  = x2 + y2 + z2 is (2x, 2y, 22). the equations (5)-(6)  are

substitute these x, y, z into the other two equations g = x + y + z = 9 and h = 20:

after  multiplying by  2,  these  simplify to  3a1 + 6a2= 18 and  61, + 14a2= 40.  the 
solutions are a,  = 2 and a,  = 2. now the previous equations give (x, y, z) = (2,3,4). 
y x ,  y, z, a,,  a,)  = 
f - a,(g  - kl) - a2(h- k,).  its five derivatives are zero-those  are our five equations. 
lagrange has increased the number of  unknowns from 3 to 5, by adding a,  and a,. 
the best point (2, 3,4) gives f,,  = 29. the 2 s  give af/ak-the

inequality  constraints 

in  practice,  applications  involve inequalities  as  well  as  equations.  the  constraints 
might be g < k and h 2 0. the first means: it is not required to use the whole resource 
k,  but you cannot use  more. the second means: h measures a quantity that cannot 
be  negative. at  the minimum point,  the multipliers must satisfy  the same inequalities: 
r1  ,< 0 and a2  3 0.there are inequalities on the a's  when there are inequalities in the 
constraints. 
brief reasoning: with g < k the minimum can be on or inside the constraint  curve. 
inside the curve, where g < k, we  are free to move in all directions. the constraint is 
not  really constraining. this brings back f, = 0 and f, = 0 and  3, = 0-an 
ordinary 
minimum. on the curve, where g = k constrains the minimum from going lower, we 
have 1"< 0. we don't  know in advance which to expect. 

13  partial derivatives 

for 100 constraints gi <k,, there are 100 a's.  some a's  are zero (when gi < k,) and 
some are nonzero (when gi = k,). it is those 2''' 
possibilities that make optimization 
interesting. in id135  with two variables, the constraints are x  0, y  0: 

the constraint  g = 4  is  an equation,  h  and  h yield  inequalities.  each  has its  own 
the inequalities require a,  2 0 and a,>  0. the derivatives 
lagrange multiplier-and 
off, g, h, h are no problem  to compute: 

those equations  make  a,  larger  than  a,.  therefore  a,  > 0,  which  means  that  the 
constraint  on h must  be  an equation. (inequality for the multiplier means equality 
for  the  constraint.)  in  other  words  h = y = 0.  then  x + y = 4  leads  to  x = 4.  the 
solution is at (xmin, ymin) = (4, o), where fmin  = 20. 

at  this minimum, h = x = 4 is above zero. the multiplier for the constraint h 2 0 
must  be  a,  = 0. then the first equation gives 2, = 5. as  always, the multiplier mea- 
sures sensitivity. when g = 4 is  increased  by  ak,  the  cost fmin  = 20 is increased by 
5ak.  in  economics 2, = 5 is  called a  shadow price-it 
is  the  cost  of  increasing  the 
constraint. 
behind this example is a nice problem in geometry. the constraint curve x +y =4 
is a line. the inequalities x 2 0 and y 2 0 leave a piece of  that line-from  p  to q in 
figure 13.23.  the  level  curves f = 5x + 6y = c  move  out  as  c  increases,  until  they 
touch the line. thefivst touching point  is q =(4,o),  which is the solution. it  is always 
an endpoint-or  a corner of  the triangle pqr. it gives the smallest cost fmin, which 
is c = 20.

14.1  double integrals 4 

this chapter shows  how  to  integrate functions of  two  or more  variables. first,  a 
double integral is defined as the limit of  sums. second, we find a fast way to compute 
it. the key idea is to replace a double integral by  two ordinary "single"  integrals. 
the double integral sf f(x, y)dy dx starts with 1f(x, y)dy. for each fixed x we integ- 
rate with respect to y. the answer depends on x. now integrate again, this time with 
respect to x. the limits of integration need care and attention! frequently those limits 
on y and x are the hardest part. 

why bother with sums and limits in the first place? two reasons. there has to be 
a definition and a computation to fall back on, when the single integrals are difficult 
or impossible. and  also-this  we emphasize-multiple 
integrals represent more than 
area and volume. those words and the pictures that go with them are the easiest to 
understand. you can almost see the volume as a "sum  of slices" or a "double  sum of 
thin sticks." the true applications are mostly to other things, but the central idea is 
always the same: add up small pieces and take limits. 

we  begin with the area of  r and the volume of 

a limit of  sums 

by  double integrals. 

the graph of  z =f(x, y) is a curved surface above the xy plane. at the point (x, y) in 
the plane, the height of  the surface is z.  (the surface is above the xy plane only when 
z is positive. volumes below the plane come with minus signs, like areas below the 
x axis.) we begin by choosing a positive function-for 
the base of  our solid is  a region r in the xy plane. that region will be  chopped 
into  small  rectangles  (sides ax  and  ay).  when  r  itself  is  the  rectangle 0d x < 1, 
0< y < 2, the small pieces fit perfectly. for a triangle or a circle, the rectangles miss 
part  of  r.  but  they  do fit  in  the  limit,  and  any  region  with  a  piecewise smooth 
boundary will be acceptable. 
question  what is the volume above r and below  the graph of  z =ax, y)? 
answer 
with a sum, as suggested by  figure 14.1. 

integral of  f(x, y) over r. to reach it we  begin 

example z = 1+ x2 + y2. 

it is a double integral-the 

14  multiple integrals 

fig. 14.1  base r  cut into small pieces aa. solid  v cut into thin sticks av  = z a a. 

area aa 

for single integrals,  the interval  [a, b]  is divided into short pieces  of  length  ax. 
for double integrals, r is divided into small rectangles of area aa  = (ax)(ay). above 
the  ith  rectangle is  a  "thin  stick"  with  small volume.  that volume is the base  area 
that this height  z =f(x, y) varies from point to 
aa  times the height above it-except 
point. therefore we select a point (xi, y,) in the ith rectangle, and compute the volume 
from the height  above that point: 

volume of  one stick =f(xi, yi)aa 

this is the crucial step for any integral-to 

volume  of  all sticks = 1f(xi, yi)aa. 
see it as a  sum of  small pieces. 

now take limits: ax  -+ 0 and ay  -+ 0. the height z =f(x, y) is nearly constant over 
each  rectangle. (we assume that f is a continuous function.) the sum approaches a 
limit, which  depends only  on the base  r  and the surface  above it. the limit  is  the 
volume of  the solid, and it is the double integral of f(x, y) over r: 

j jrf(x, y) da = lim  1f(xi, yi)aa. 

a x  -t 0 
ay+o 

to repeat: the limit is the same for all choices of the rectangles and the points (xi, yi). 
the rectangles will not fit exactly into r, if  that base area is curved. the heights are 
not exact, if  the surface z =f(x, y) is also curved. but the errors on the sides and top, 
where the pieces don't  fit and the heights are wrong, approach zero. those errors are 
the volume of the "icing"  around the solid, which gets thinner as ax  -+ 0 and ay  -+ 0. 
a  careful  proof  takes more space than  we  are willing to give.  but  the  properties  of 
the integral need  and deserve attention: 

1.  linearity: jj(f + g)da = jj f d~ + j j g  da 
2.  constant comes outside: jj cf(x,  y)da = c jj f(x, y)da 
3.  r splits into s  and  t(not overlapping): ]jf d~  = jj f d ~+ jj f d ~ .

 

r 

s 

t 

in 1 the volume under f + g has two parts. the "thin  sticks"  of height f + g split into 
thin sticks under f and under g. in 2 the whole volume is stretched  upward  by  c. in 
3  the  volumes  are  side  by  side.  as  with  single  integrals,  these  properties  help  in 
computations. 

by  writing da, we  allow  shapes other than  rectangles.  polar coordinates have an 
extra  factor r  in  da = r dr do.  by  writing  dx dy, we  choose  rectangular  coordinates 
and prepare for the splitting that comes now.

splitting  a double  integral  into  two  single  integrals

the  double  integral  jsf(x, y)dy  dx  will  now  be  reduced  to  single  integrals  in  y  and
then  x. (or vice  versa.  our first  integral  could  equally  well  be  ff(x, y)dx.)  chapter 8
described  the same idea  for solids of revolution.  first came  the area  of a slice,  which
is  a  single  integral.  then  came  a  second  integral  to  add  up  the  slices.  for  solids
formed by revolving a curve, all slices are circular  disks-now we expect other shapes.
figure  14.2  shows  a slice  of area a(x).  it cuts through  the  solid  at a fixed  value  of
x. the cut  starts at  y = c  on  one  side  of r,  and ends  at y =  d on  the other  side.  this
particular  example  goes  from y = 0 to  y = 2 (r  is  a rectangle).  the  area  of a slice  is
the  y  integral  of f(x, y).  remember  that x  is fixed  and y  goes from c  to d:

a(x)  = area of slice = 

f(x, y)dy 

(the answer  is  a  function  of  x).

this  is  the  reverse  of a  partial  derivative!  the  integral  of x 2dy,  with  x  constant,  is
x 2y.  this  "partial  integral"  is actually  called  an inner integral. after substituting  the
limits y = 2  and y  = 0 and  subtracting,  we  have  the area  a(x)  = 2  + 2x 2 + 1.  now  the
outer integral adds  slices  to  find  the volume  f a(x) dx.  the answer  is  a number:

the inner integrals  are  the  cross-sectional  areas  a(x) and  a(y) of the  slices.  the  outer
integrals  add  up  the  volumes  a(x)dx  and  a(y)dy. notice  the  reversing  of  limits.

normally  the  brackets in (2)  are  omitted. when  the y  integral  is first,  dy is  written
inside  dx.  the limits on y  are inside too. i  strongly  recommend  that you  compute  the
inner integral  on  one line  and  the  outer integral  on  a  separate line.

example  2  find  the  volume  below  the  plane  z = x - 2y  and  above  the  base
triangle  r.

the  triangle r has  sides  on  the x  and  y  axes  and the  line x + y  = 1. the  strips  in  the
y  direction have  varying  lengths. (so do  the  strips  in the x direction.)  this is the main
point  of  the  example-the  base  is  not  a  rectangle.  the  upper  limit  on  the  inner
integral  changes  as  x  changes.  the top  of the triangle is at y =  1 - x.

figure  14.3  shows  the  strips.  the  region  should  always  be  drawn  (except  for
rectangles).  without  a  figure  the  limits  are  hard to  find. a  sketch  of r  makes  it easy:

y  goes  from  c = 0  to  d =  1 - x.  then  x  goes  from  a = 0  to  b =  1.

the inner integral  has variable limits and  the  outer  integral  has  constant limits:

x = 0 and x = 2. they stop where 2x equals x2, and the line meets the parabola. 

the problem  is to put the x integral first. it goes along horizontal strips. on each

the 

14.2  change to  better coordinates 

you  don't  go far  with  double integrals before  wanting to change  variables. many 
regions  simply do not  fit with  the x and y axes. two examples are in figure 14.5, 
a  tilted  square and  a  ring. those are excellent shapes-in 

the right coordinates. 

14  multiple integrals 

we have  to be  able to answer  basic questions like these: 

find the area !.i da  and moment 

[.i 

x da  and moment of  inertia ss x2 da. 

the problem  is:  what is da? we are leaving the xy variables where da = dx dy. 

the  reason  for  changing  is  this:  the  limits  of  integration  in  the  y  direction  are 
miserable. i don't  know them and i don't  want to know them. for every x we would 
need  the entry point p of  the line x = constant, and the exit point  q. the heights of 
p and q  are the limits on jdy, the inner  integral.  the geometry of  the  square and 
ring are totally missed, if  we  stick rigidly  to x and y. 

fig. 14.5  unit  square turned  through angle a.  ring with  radii  4 and 5. 

which coordinates are better? any sensible person agrees that the area of the tilted 
square is  1. "just  turn it and the area is obvious."  but  that sensible person  may not 
know the moment or the center of  gravity  or the moment  of  inertia. so we  actually 
have  to do the turning. 

the new coordinates u and v  are in figure 14.6a. the limits of integration on v  are 
0 and  1. so are the limits on u.  but when you  change variables, you  don't just  change 
limits. two other changes come with  new variables: 

1. the small area da = dx dy becomes  da  = 
2.  the integral of  x becomes the integral of 

du dv. 
. 

in a single integral, we make the same changes. limits x = 0 and 
substituting u = 
x = 4 become  u = 0 and u = 2.  since x is  u2, dx is  2u du. the purpose  of  the change 
is to find an antiderivative. for double integrals, the usual purpose is to improve the 
limits-but  we  have  to accept  the  whole  package. 

to turn the square, there are formulas connecting x and y to u and 1.1.  the geometry 

is clear-rotate 

axes by  x-but 
u = s cos  x + j. sin  x 
r  = - s sin x + j9cos  x 

it has to be  converted  into algebra: 

and in  reverse 

x = u  cos x  - c  sin x 
y  = u  sin  x + c cos  x. 

(1) 

figure 14.6 shows the rotation. as points move, the whole square turns. a good way 
to remember  equation (1) is to follow  the corners as they  become (1,o) and (0, 1). 

the change from jj x da  to jl 

du dl: is  partly  decided  by  equation (1). it 
gives x as a function of  u  and v. we also need  da. for a pure rotation the first guess 
is  correct:  the area  dx dy equals the area du dv. for most  changes of  variable  this is 
false.  the general formula for da  comes after the examples.

example i  find jj da  and jj x da  and 2  and also jj x2 da  for the tilted  square. 
solution  the area of  the square is 5;  sa  du dv  = 1. notice  the good limits. then 

j j x d ~ = j a j ; ( ~cos a -   v  sin  a)du d v = &  cos a - &  sin a. 

(2) 
this is  the  moment  around  the y axis. the factors $ come from &u2 and iv2. the x 
coordinate of  the center  of  gravity  is 

. = j!  x d~ ,/ !!d~  = ('  cos r - i sin  r)/l. 

similarly  the integral  of  y leads to j. the answer is no mystery-the 
point (2, j )  is 
at the center of  the square! substituting x = u cos a - v  sin a made x da look worse, 
but  the limits 0 and  1 are much  better. 

the moment  of  inertia i ,   around the y axis is  also simplified: 

= 

cos a sin a +-sin2a
3 .

cos2a 
(u cos a - v  sin aydu dv = -3  -

 (3) 
you  know this next fact but i will write  it anyway: the answers don't  contain u or v. 
those  are  dummy  variables  like  x  and  y.  the  answers  do contain  a,  because  the 
square has turned. (the area is fixed at  1.) the moment of inertia i,  = jj y2 da  is the 
same as equation (3) but  with  all plus  signs. 
question  the sum i ,  + i ,  simplifies to 5 (a constant). why no dependence on a? 
i ,  + i ,   equals  i,.  this  moment  of  inertia  around  (0,o) is  unchanged  by 
answer 
rotation. we are turning the square around one of  its corners.

change to  polar  coordinates 

the next change is to i. and 0. a  small area becomes da  = r dr d0 (definitely not dr do). 
area always comes from multiplying two lengths, and d0 is not a length. figure 14.7 
shows  the  crucial  region-a 
"polar  rectangle"  cut  out  by  rays  and circles. its area 
aa  is found in  two  ways, both  leading to r dr do: 

(approximate) the  straight  sides  have  length  ar.  the circular  arcs are 
ci'ose to ra0. the angles are 90". so aa  is close to (ar)(rao). 
(exact) a  wedge has area ir2ab. the difference between wedges is aa: 

530

14  mumple  integrals

the exact  method  places  r dead center  (see  figure).  the approximation  says:  forget
the change  in  rao  as  you move  outward.  keep  only  the first-order  terms.

a third  method  is  coming,  which  requires  no  picture  and no  geometry.  calculus
always  has  a  third  method!  the  change  of variables  x = r cos  0,  y = r sin 0  will  go
into a general  formula  for  da,  and out will  come  the area  r dr do.

the 0 integral is 27r  (full circle). actually  the ring is  a giant polar  rectangle.  we could
have  used  the exact  formula  r ar ao,  with  ao = 27r  and  ar =  5 - 4.  when  the radius
r is centered  at  4.5, the  product  r ar ao  is (4.5)(1)(27r)  = 97r  as  above.

since  the ring is  symmetric  around  (0, 0),  the integral  of x da  must  be zero:

the  first  mass  7r/2  equals  the  area  (because  p =  1).  the  second  mass  1r/6  is  smaller
(because  p <  1).  integrating  p = 1 is  the same as  finding  a volume  when  the height is
z =  1 (part of a  cylinder).  integrating  p  =  1 - r is  the  same  as  finding  a  volume  when
the  height is  z = 1 - r (part of a cone).  volumes of cones  have  the extra  factor    .

the  center  of gravity  involves  the  moment  mx = jjyp da.  the  distance from  the
x  axis  is  y,  the  mass of a small piece is  p da,  integrate to  add mass times  distance.

question  compare  y for p =  1 and  p = other  positive  constants  and  p =  1 - r.
answer  any constant p gives  3 =  4/37r.  since  1 - r is dense at r = 0, j  drops to  1/in.
question  how  is  y = 4/37t  related  to  the  "average"  of y  in  the semicircle?
answer  they  are  identical.  this  is  the point  of 3. divide  the integral by  the  area:

the average value of a function is jf  f(x, y)da  / jf da. 

(5)

the  integral off is divided by  the integral of 1 (the area). in one  dimension fa v(x)  dx
was  divided  by  fb  1 dx  (the  length  b - a).  that  gave  the  average  value  of  v(x)  in
section  5.6.  equation (5) is  the  same  idea forf(x, y).

a  is the area under a "bell-shaped  curve"-see figure  14.9. this is the most important
definite  integral  in  the  study  of id203.  it is  difficult  because  a factor  2x  is  not
present.  integrating  2xe -

approximately  by  a computer.  how  can  we hope  to  show  that  a  is exactly  /-?

x2  gives  -e -

the  r integral  is  -if  e-udu= -.  the  0  integral  is  21t.  the  double  integral  is  (  )(21t).

change to  other  coordinates 

a third method was promised, to find r dr d0 without a picture and without geometry. 
the  method  works  directly from  x  = r cos 0  and y  = r sin 0. it  also  finds  the  1 in 
du du, after a rotation of axes. most important, this new method finds the factor j  in 
the area d a  = j du dv, for any change of variables. the change is from xy to uv. 

for single integrals, the "stretching factor"  j  between the original dx and the new 
du is (not surprisingly) the ratio dxldu. where we have dx, we write (dx/du)du.where 
we  have (du/dx)dx,we  write du. that was the idea of  substitutions-the  main way 
to simplify integrals. 

for  double  integrals  the  stretching  factor  appears  in  the  area:  dx dy  becomes 
iji  du do. the old and new variables are related by x  = x(u, v) and y  = y(u, 0). the point 
with  coordinates  u and v  comes from the point  with coordinates  x  and y.  a whole 
region s, full of points in the uu plane, comes from the region r full of corresponding 
points in the xy plane. a small piece with area iji  du dv comes from a small piece with 
area d x  dy. the formula for  j  is a  two-dimensional version of dxldu. 

1  148  the stretching factor for area is the 2 by  2 jacobian dktermiccnf  j(u, v): 

i an integral over r in the xy plane becomes an integral over s in the uv plane: 

the determinant j is often written  a(x, y)/d(u, v), as a  reminder that this stretching 
factor is like dxldu. w e  require j  # 0 .  that keeps the stretching and shrinking under 
control. 

you  naturally  ask:  why  take  the  absolute  value  iji 

in  equation (9)?  good 
question-it  wasn't done for single integrals. the reason is in the limits of integration. 
'(- du) after changing x  to  -u. w e  keep the minus sign 
the single integral 
and  allow single  integrals  to run backward. double integrals could too, but normally 
they go left to right and down to up. we use the absolute value iji  and run forward.

' in pralctice, xy rectangles generally  go into uv  rectangles. the sides can be curved 
(as in po~lar rectangles) but the angles are often 90". the change is "orthogonal."  the 
next example has angles that are not 90  , and j  still gives the answer.

the area of  the xy parallelogram  becomes  an integral  over the uv  square: 

the  square  has  area  9,  the  parallelogram  has  area  3.  i  don't  know  if  j  = 3  is  a 
stretching factor or a shrinking factor. the other integral jj exdx dy is 

main point:  the change to u and v  makes the limits easy (just 0 and 3). 

why 1s the stretching factor  j  a determinant? with straight sides, this goes back to 
section  11.3 on vectors.  the area of  a parallelogram  is a determinant.  here the sides 
are curved, but  that only produces ( d ~ ) ~  
which  we  ignore. 
is  (dxldu i + dyldu j)du.  side 2  is 
(dxldvi -t dyldv j)dv.  the curving comes from second derivatives. the area (the cross 
product  of  the sides) is 1 j ldu dv.

final remark 
i  can't  resist looking at the change in the reverse direction. now the 
rectangle is in xy  and the parallelogram  is in  uu. in all formulas, exchange x  for  u 

this  is  exactly  like  duldx = l/(dx/du).it  is  the  derivative  of  the  inverse function. 
the product of  slopes is 1-stretch  out, shrink back.  from xy to uv we have 2 by 2 
matrices, and the identity matrix i takes the place of  1: 

the  first  row  times  the  first  column  is  (ax/a~)(au/ax)+ (ax/av)(av/ax)= axlax = 1. 
the first row times the second column is ( d ~ / a ~ ) ( a ~ / d y )  
= axlay = 0. 
the matrices are inverses of each other. the determinants of  a matrix  and its inverse 
obey our  rule: old  j times new j = 1. those j's  cannot  be  zero, just  as dxldu  and 
duldx were not zero. (inverse functions increase steadily or decrease steadily.) 
in two dimensions, an area dx dy goes to j du dv  and comes back  to dx dy.

14  mumple  integrals

14.3  triple  integrals

at this point in the book,  i feel  i can  speak to  you directly.  you can  guess what triple
integrals  are like.  instead  of a small interval  or a small  rectangle,  there is a small box.
instead  of length  dx or area  dx dy,  the box  has volume  dv=  dx dy  dz.  that is length
times  width  times  height.  the  goal  is  to  put  small  boxes  together  (by  integration).
the main  problem  will  be  to  discover  the  correct  limits on  x, y, z.

we  could  dream  up  more  and  more  complicated  regions  in  three-dimensional
space.  but  i  don't  think  you  can  see  the  method  clearly  without  seeing  the  region
clearly.  in practice  six  shapes  are  the  most  important:

box  prism  cylinder 

cone 

tetrahedron 

sphere.

the  box  is  easiest  and  the  sphere  may  be  the  hardest  (but no  problem  in  spherical
coordinates).  circular  cylinders  and  cones fall  in  the  middle,  where  xyz  coordinates
are possible  but  roz  are the best.  i start with  the box  and  prism  and  xyz.

example  1  by  triple integrals  find  the volume  of a  box  and  a  prism (figure  14.12).

z=0  y=o  x=0

dx dy dz

the inner integral  for both  is s dx = 2. lines  in the x direction  have  length  2, cutting
through  the box  and  the prism.  the middle  integrals  show  the  limits  on  y  (since  dy
comes  second):

3 
f  2dy=6 
y=- 

and 

3-3z

s  2dy=6-6z.
y=-

after  two  integrations  these  are  areas. the first  area  6 is for a plane  section  through
the box.  the second  area  6 - 6z  is  cut  through  the  prism. the  shaded rectangle  goes
from y = 0 to y  = 3 - 3z-we needed  and  used the  equation y  + 3z  = 3 for  the bound-
ary  of the  prism.  at  this point z  is  still constant! but the  area  depends  on  z,  because
the  prism  gets  thinner  going  upwards.  the  base  area  is  6 - 6z = 6,  the  top  area  is
6  - 6z = 0.

the  outer  integral  multiplies  those  areas  by  dz,  to  give  the  volume  of slices.  they
are  horizontal  slices  because  z  came  last.  integration  adds  up  the  slices  to  find  the
total  volume:

box  volume  = 

z=0 

6  dz =  6 

prism  volume= 

z=0

(6-  6z)dz =  6z - 3z2]  =3.

the  box  volume  2  3 - 1 didn't  need  calculus.  the  prism  is  half  of  the  box,  so  its
volume  was  sure  to  be  3-but it  is  satisfying  to  see  how  6z  - 3z2  gives  the  answer.
our  purpose  is  to  see  how  a  triple  integral  works.

question  find the prism volume in the order dz dy d x  (six orders are possible). 

to  find  those  limits  on  the  z  integral,  follow  a  line  in  the  z  direction.  it  enters 
the prism at z = 0 and exits at the sloping face y + 32 = 3. that gives the upper limit 
z = (3 - y)/3. it is the height of a thin stick as in section 14.1. this section writes out 
j dz for the height, but a quicker solution starts at the double integral. 
what is the number 1 in the last integral? it is the area of  a vertical slice, cut by a 

plane x = constant. the outer integral adds up slices. 

x, y, z)  dv  is computed from  three single integrals 

that  step cannot  be  taken  in  silence-some  basic calculus is  involved. the  triple 

integral is the limit of xfiav,  a sum over small boxes of  volume av.  herefi is any 

value of f(x, y, z) in the ith box. (in the limit, the boxes fit a curved region.) now take 
those boxes in a certain order. put them into lines in the x direction and put the lines 
of  boxes into planes. the lines lead to the inner x integral, whose answer depends on 
y  and  z.  the  y  integral  combines the  lines into planes.  finally  the  outer  integral 
accounts for all planes and all boxes. 

example 2 is important because it displays more possibilities than a box or prism. 

example 2  find the volume of  a tetrahedron (4-sided pyramid). locate (2,j,5). 
solution  a  tetrahedron  has  four  flat  faces,  all  triangles.  the  fourth  face  in 
figure 14.13 is  on  the plane x + y + z = 1. a line in  the x  direction enters at x = 0 
and  exits at  x = 1 - y - z.  (the length  depends  on  y  and  z.  the  equation  of  the 
boundary  plane gives x.) then those lines are put into plane slices by the y integral: 

what  is  this number  i(1 - z ) ~ ?it is the area  at height  z.  the  plane  at that  height 
slices out a right triangle, whose legs have length 1 - z. the area is correct, but look 
at the limits of  integration. if x goes to  1 - y - z,  why  does y go to  1 - z?  reason: 
we are assembling lines, not points. the figure shows a line at every y up to  1 - z. 

fig. 14.13  lines  end  at  plane  x + y + z = 1.  triangles  end  at  edge  y + z = 1.  the  average 

height is z = jjjz d v/js~d v. 

14  muthple integrals 

adding  the  slices gives  the  volume: 

with $(base times height), the volume of a pyramid. 

t ( l  - z)ldz = [&z  - i)~];= 9. this  agrees 
the height t of  the centroid is "z,,~,,~."  we compute rjr z dv and divide by the 
volume. each horizontal slice is multiplied by its height z, and the limits of integration 
don't change: 

this  is  quick  because  z is  constant in  the  x  and  y  integrals.  each  triangular  slice 
contributes z times its area i(1 - z ) ~times dz. then the z integral gives the moment 
1/24. to find the average height, divide  1/24 by  the volume: 

jjj z d v  - 1/24 - 1 
z = height of  centroid = -- -- -
jjj dl/ 
4'

by  symmetry 2 = 4 and y' = 4. the centroid is the point (4, $, a). compare that with 
(i,)),  the centroid of  the standard right  triangle.  compare also with f, the center of 
the  unit  interval.  there must  be  a  five-sided region in four  dimensions  centered  at 
1

( 3 9  3 9  3 9  5 ) .

for  area  and volume we  meet  another pattern.  length  of  standard interval is  1, 
area of  standard triangle is 4,volume of  standard tetrahedron is 4,  hypervolume in 
. the interval reaches the point  x = 1, the triangle 
four dimensions must  be 
reaches the line x + y = 1, the tetrahedron reaches the plane x + y + z = 1. the four- 
dimensional region stops at the hyperplane 

= 1. 

example 3  find the volume jjj dx dy dz inside the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. 
first question: what are the limits on x? if  a needle goes through  the sphere in the 
x direction, where does it enter and leave? moving in the x direction, the numbers y 
and z stay constant. the inner integral deals only with x. the smallest and largest x 
are at the boundary where x2 + y2 + z2 = 1.  this equation does the work-we 
solve 
it for x. look  at the limits on the x integral: 

the limits on y are  -d m  and +,/-.

you can use algebra on the boundary 
equation x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. but notice that x is gone! we want the smallest and largest 
y, for each  z.  it  helps very  much  to draw  the plane  at height z,  slicing through  the 
sphere  in  figure 14.14. the  slice  is  a  circle of  radius  r = ,/=. 
so  the  area  is 
xr2, which must  come from the y integral: 

i admit that i didn't  integrate. is it cheating to use the formula xr2? i don't  think so. 
mathematics  is hard  enough,  and  we  don't  have  to work  blindfolded.  the goal is 
understanding,  and  if  you  know  the  area  then  use  it.  of  course  the  integral  of 

jwcan be done if  necessary-use  section 7.2. 

the triple integral is down to a single integral. we went from one needle to a circle 
of  needles  and  now  to a  sphere of  needles. the volume  is a  sum  of  slices of  area 
n(1 - z2). the south pole is at z = -1, the north pole is at z = + 1, and the integral

question  1  a  cone  also  has circular  slices.  how  is  the last  integral  changed?
answer  the  slices  of a  cone  have  radius  1 - z. integrate  (1 - z)2  not 
- z 2 .

question  2  how  does  this compare  with  a  circular  cylinder  (height  1, radius  1)?
answer  now  all  slices  have  radius  1. above  z = 0,  a  cylinder  has  volume  7c and  a
half-sphere  has  volume  2i  and  a  cone  has  volume   i.

introduce  u = x/a  and  v =  y/b  and  w =  z/c.  then  the  outer  boundary  becomes

a  sphere  is fff  du dv  dw = 47r/3.  but  what  volume  dv  in  xyz  space  corresponds  to  a
small  box  with  sides  du and  dv  and  dw?

every  uvw  box  comes  from  an  xyz  box.  the  box  is  stretched  with  no  bending  or
twisting.  since  u  is  x/a, the  length  dx is  a du.  similarly  dy =  b dv  and  dz =  c dw.  the
volume  of the xyz  box (figure  14.14) is dx dy dz = (abc) du dv  dw. the stretching factor

you  realize  that  this  is  special-other  volumes  are  much  more  complicated.  the
sphere  and  ellipsoid are curved,  but the  small xyz  boxes are  straight. the  next section
introduces  spherical  coordinates,  and  we  can  finally  write  "good  limits."  but then  we
need  a different  j.

14.4  cylindrical and  spherical coordinates

cylindrical  coordinates  are  good for  describing  solids  that  are  symmetric  around an
axis. the solid  is  three-dimensional,  so there  are three  coordinates  r, 0, z:
z:  along the  axis.

0:  around the  axis

r:  out from  the  axis

this is  a mixture  of polar  coordinates  ro in a plane,  plus z upward.  you will not find
roz difficult  to  work  with.  start  with  a  cylinder  centered  on the z  axis:

integration  over this half-cylinder  is j. f  jf  ?

sphere: integrate to r2 + z 2 = r 2

i  would  not use  cylindrical  coordinates  for  a box.  or  a tetrahedron.

the  integral  needs  one  thing  more-the  volume  dv.  the  movements  dr and  do

rectangle,  with  area  r dr do.  the new  part is  the  height dz.  the  volume  of the curved
box is r dr do  dz.  then  r goes  in the blank  space in the triple  integral-the  stretching

is  27n  (a  full  rotation).  stop  there  for  a  moment.

we have  reached ff  r dr do =   (1 - z)2 27r.  this is the area of a slice at height z. the
slice  is  a circle,  its  radius is 1 - z, its  area is  7r(1  - z)2. the  z integral  adds  those slices
to  give  7t/3.  that is  correct,  but it  is  not  the  only  way to  compute  the  volume.

second solution  do the z and 8 integrals first. since z goes up to 1 - r, and 8 goes 
around to 2n, those integrals produce jj r dz d8 = r(l - r)2n.  stop again-this  must 
be the area of  something.

after the z and 8 integrals we have a shell at radius r. the height is 1 - r (the outer 
shells are shorter). this height times 2nr gives the area around the shell. the choice 
betweeen  shells and slices is exactly as in  chapter 8. diflerent  orders of integration

the third cone is cut into wedges. the volume of a wedge is & db. it is quite common 
to do the 8 integral last, especially when it just  multiplies by 271.  it is not so common 
to think  of  wedges. 
question  is the volume  d8 equal to an area & times a thickness db? 
answer  no! the triangle  in the third cone has area 9 not &. thickness is never do. 

times 2n. this is the volume n/3-but  what is & db? 

fig. 14.46  a cone cut three ways: slice at height z,  shell at radius r, wedge at angle 0. 

this cone is typical  of  a solid  of revolution. the axis is in  the z  direction. the 8 
integral yields 271,  whether it comes first, second, or third. the r integral goes out to 
a radius f(z), which is 1 for the cylinder and  1 - z for the cone. the integral sj  r dr d8 
is n ( f ( ~ ) ) ~area of  circular  slice. this leaves the z integral  jn(f(z))'dz.  that is our 
old  volume formula 1~ ( f ( x ) ) ~ d xfrom chapter 8, where the slices were cut through 
the x axis.

example 3  the moment of inertia around  the  z  axis is jjj r3dr d8 dz. the extra r2 
is (distance to axis)2. for the cone this triple integral is n/ 10. 

example 4  the moment around the z axis is jjjr2 dr d8 dz. for the cone this is ~ 1 6 .  
the average distance 7 is (moment)/(volume) = (n/6)/(n/3)=f . 
example 5  a  sphere  of  radius  r  has  the  boundary  r2 + z2 = r2, in  cylindrical 
coordinates. the outer limit on the r integral is jm.that is not acceptable in 
difficult problems.  to avoid it we  now change to coordinates that are natural for a 
sphere. 

14.4  cylindrical and spherical coordlnales 

spherical coordinates 

the earth is a solid sphere (or near enough). on its surface we use two coordinates- 
latitude and longitude. to dig inward or fly  outward, there is a third coordinate- 
the distance p from  the center.  this greek  letter  rho replaces  r  to avoid  confusion 
with cylindrical coordinates. where r is measured from the z axis, p is measured from 
the origin. thus r2 = x2 + y2 and p2 = x2 + y2 + z2. 

the angle 8 is the same as before.  it goes from 0 to 211.  it is the longitude, which 

increases as you travel east around the equator. 

the angle 4 is new. it equals 0at the north pole and n (not 2n) at the south pole. 
it is the polar angle, measured down from the z axis. the equator has a latitude of 
0 but a polar angle of  n/2 (halfway down). here are some typical shapes: 

solid sphere (or ball): 0 < p < r 

upper half-sphere: 0 < + f 4 2

the angle 4 is  constant  on a  cone from  the  origin.  it  cuts  the  surface in  a  circle 
(figure 14.17b), but  not  a  great  circle. the  angle 8 is  constant  along a  half-circle 
from pole to pole.  the distance p  is constant on each inner sphere, starting at the 
center p = 0 and moving out to p = r. 
in spherical coordinates the volume integral is jjjp2sin + dp d 4  db. to explain that 
surprising factor j = p2 sin 4, start with x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 0. in spherical coor- 
dinates  r  is  p sin + and  z  is  p cos $--see 
the  triangle  in  the  figure.  so  substitute 
p sin 4 for r: 

x  = p  sin 4 cos 8, y = p  sin + sin 8, z = p  cos 4. 

(1) 

remember those two steps, p 4 9  to r8z to x y z .  we  check that x2 + y2 + z2 = p2: 

the volume integral is explained by  figure 14.17~. that shows a  "spherical  box" 
with  right  angles and curved edges. two edges are  dp and pd4. the third edge is 
horizontal. the usual rd8 becomes p sin 4 do. multiplying those lengths gives d v. 
the volume of  the box is dv = p2 sin + dp d+ do. this is a distance cubed, from p2dp.

notice the limits: 

question  what is the volume above the cone in  figure l4.l7? 
answer  the 4 integral stops at [- cos 41:'~  = i.the volume is (4r3)(+)(2n). 

example 7  the surface  area of  a sphere is a  = 47rr2. forget  the p  integral: 

after  those examples from  geometry,  here  is  the  real  thing from  science.  i  want  to 
compute one of  the most  important  triple integrals in physics-"the 
gravitational 
attraction  of  a solid sphere."  for some reason  isaac newton  had  trouble  with  this 
integral.  he refused to publish  his masterpiece on astronomy  until  he had solved it. 
i think  he didn't  use spherical coordinates-and 
the integral  is not easy even now. 
the answer that newton finally found is beautiful.  the sphere acts as if all its mass 
were concentrated at  the center. at  an outside point  (o,0, d), the force of  gravity  is 
proportional to  1/d2. the force from a uniform solid sphere equals the force from a 
point  mass,  at  every  outside  point  p.  that  is  exactly  what  newton  wanted  and 
needed, to explain the solar system and to prove kepler's  laws. 

here is the difficulty. some parts of  the  sphere are closer than  d,  some parts are 
farther away. the actual distance q, from the outside point p to a typical inside point, 
is shown in  figure 14.18. the average distance q to all points  in the sphere is not d. 
but what  newton needed was a different average, and by  good luck  or some divine 
calculus it works perfectly:  the average of  l/q is 1/d. this gives the potential  energy: 

potential  at point  p  = 1j 1 - d v = 

1
sphere  q 

d 

volume of  sphere 

a  small volume d v at the  distance q contributes  d v/y  to the  potential (section 8.6, 
with density  1). the integral adds the contributions from the whole sphere. equation 
(2) says that  the  potential  at r = d  is  not  changed  when  the  sphere is  squeezed to 
the center. the potential equals the whole volume divided by  the single distance d. 
is 
not  3. smaller  point:  i  wrote  "sphere"  where  i  should  have  written  "ball."  the 
sphere is solid: 0 < p < r, 0 <q5  < n,0 < 8 < 2n. 

important point: the average of  l/q is  1/d and not  l/q. the average of i and 

what about the force? for the small volume it is proportional to d v/q2 (this is the 

inverse square law). but force  is a vector, pulling the outside point toward dv-not 
toward  the center  of  the sphere. the figure shows the geometry  and  the  symmetry. 
we want the z component of the force.  (by symmetry the overall x and y components 
are zero.) the angle between the force vector and the z axis is a, so for the z component 
we multiply by cos a. the total force comes from the integral that newton discovered:

word  seriously. if  you have come this far, you deserve the pleasure of doing what at

one time only isaac newton could  do. problem 26 offers a suggestion (just the law 
of  cosines) but the integral is yours. 
the law of  cosines also helps with (2). for the triangle  in the figure it gives q2 = 
d2 - 2pd cos 4 + p2. call  this  whole  quantity  u.  we  do the  surface  integral  first 
(d)  and db  with p fixed). then q2  = u and q = & and du = 2pd sin 4 d): 

since cos 4 = - 1 at the 
271 came from the 0 integral. the integral of du/& 
upper  limit,  u is  d2 + 2pd + p2. the square  root  of  u is d + p.  at  the  lower  limit 
cos ) = + 1 and u = d2 - 2pd + p2. this is another perfect square-its 
square root 
is d - p. the surface integral (4) with fixed p is 

is 2&. 

last  comes  the  p  integral: 
potential  equals  volume of the sphere divided by d. 

4 n p 2 d p / ~  

=4ar3/d.  this  proves  formula  (2):

note  1  physicists are also happy about equation (5). the average of  l/q is 1/d not 
only over the solid sphere but over each spherical shell of  area 4ap2. the shells can 
have different densities, as they do in the earth, and still newton is correct. this also 
applies to the force integral  (3)-each  separate  shell acts as if its mass  were concen- 
trated at the center. then the final p integral yields this property for the solid sphere. 

note 2  physicists  also  know  that  force is  minus  the  derivative  of  potential.  the 
derivative of (2) with respect to d produces the force integral (3). problem 27 explains 
this shortcut to equation (3). 

example 8  everywhere inside a hollow sphere the force  of gravity  is zero. 
when d is smaller than p, the lower limit & in the integral (4) changes from d - p 
to p - d. that way  the square root stays positive. this changes the answer in (5) to 
4np2/p, so the potential no longer depends on d.  the potential is constant inside the 
hollow  shell. since the force comes from its derivative, the force is zero. 

a more intuitive proof is in the second figure. the infinitesimal areas on the surface 
are proportional to q2 and q ~ .  but  the distances to those areas are q and q, so the 

14  multiple integrals 

forces involve  l/q2 and  l/q2 (the inverse square law). therefore the two areas exert 
equal and opposite forces on the inside point, and they cancel each other. the total 
force from the shell is zero. 

i believe this zero integral is the reason that the inside of a car is safe from lightning. 
of course a car is not a sphere. but electric charge distributes itself to keep the surface 
at constant potential.  the potential  stays constant  inside-therefore  no force. the 
tires help to prevent conduction  of  current (and electrocution of  driver). 

p.s.  don't  just  step out of  the car. let a metal chain conduct the charge to the 

ground. otherwise you could be the conductor. 

change of  coordinates-stretching  factor  j 

once more we look to calculus for a formula. we need the volume of  a small curved 
box  in any uvw  coordinate system. the r8z box and the p4b box have right angles, 
and their volumes were read off from the geometry (stretching factors j = r and j = 
p2 sin 4 in figures 14.15 and  14.17). now we  change from xyz to other coordinates 
uvw-which 

are chosen to fit the problem. 

going from xy  to uv, the  area  da = j  du dv  was  a  2 by  2 determinant.  in three 
dimensions the determinant  is  3  by  3. the matrix is always the "jacobian  matrix," 
containing first derivatives. there were four derivatives from xy to uv, now there are 
nine from xyz to uuw. 

i4c  suppose x, y, z  are given in  terms  of  u, v, w. then a small  faax  in uuw 
space (sides du, dv, dw) comes from a volume d v = j  dtc dv dw in xyz space: 

i the volume integral ijldx d y  dz becomes fljiji  du dv dw, with limits on uvw. 

remember that a 3 by  3 determinant is the sum of six terms (section 11 3 .  one term 
in j is (ax/du)(dy/dv)(dz/i3w), along the main diagonal. this comes from pure stretch- 
ing, and the other five terms allow for rotation. the best way to exhibit the formula 
is for spherical coordinates-where 
the nine derivatives are easy but the determinant 
is not: 

example 9  find  the factor j for x = p sin 4 cos 8, y = p sin 4 sin 8, z = p cos 4. 

sin 4 cos 8  p cos 4 cos 8  - p sin 4 sin  8 

j =   a(x' " ')  =  sin 4 sin  8  p cos 4  sin  8 

p sin 4 cos 8  . 

(6,  8) 

the determinant has six terms, but two are zero-because  of  the zero in the corner. 
terms  are  p2sin 4 cos24 sin28  and  p2sin 4 cos24 cos28  and 
the  other  four 
p2sin34 sin28 and p2sin34 cos28. add the first two (note sin28 + cos28) and separately 
add the second two. then add the sums to reach j  = p2sin (6. 

geometry already gave this answer. for most uvw  variables, use the determinant.

chapter 14introduced double and triple integrals. we went from  dx to jj dx dy and 
jijdx dy dz. all those integrals add up small pieces, and the limit gives area or volume 
or mass. what could be more natural than that? i regret to say, after the success of 
those multiple integrals, that something is missing. it is even more regrettable that 
we  didn't  notice it. the missing piece is nothing less than the fundamental theorem 
of  calculus. 
the  double integral 11dx dy  equals the  area. to  compute it, we  did not  use  an 
antiderivative of  1. at least not consciously. the method was almost trial and error, 
and the hard part was to find the limits of  integration. this chapter goes deeper, to 
show how the step from a double integral to a single integral is really a new form of 
the fundamental theorem-when 

it is done right. 

two new  ideas are needed  early, one pleasant and one not.  you  will like vector 
fields. you may not think so highly of line integrals. those are ordinary single integrals 
like j v(x)dx, but  they  go  along  curves instead of  straight lines. the nice  step dx 
becomes the confusing step ds. where jdx equals the length of  the interval, j ds is 
the length of  the curve. the point is that regions are enclosed by curves, and we have 
to  integrate along them.  the  fundamental theorem  in  its  two-dimensional form 
(green's theorem) connects a double integral over the region to a single integral along 
its boundary curve. 

the great  applications are in science and engineering, where  vector  fields are so 
natural. but there are changes in the language. instead of an antiderivative, we speak 
about  a potential function.  instead  of  the  derivative, we  take  the "divergence"  and 
"curl."  instead of  area, we  compute flux  and circulation and  work. examples come 
first.

for an ordinary scalar function, the input is a number x and the output is a number 
f(x). for a vector field (or vector function), the input is a point (x, y) and the output 
is a two-dimensional vector f(x, y).  there is a "field"  of  vectors, one at every point.

15  vector calculus 

in  three  dimensions  the  input  point  is  (x, y, z) and  the  output  vector  f has  three 
components. 
definition  let r be a region in the xy plane. a vectorfield f assigns to every point 
(x, y) in r  a vector  f(x, y) with two components: 

f(x, y) = m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j. 

a  three-dimensional  vector  field  has  components  m(x, y, z)  and  n(x, y, z)  and 

(1) 
this plane vector  field involves two functions  of  two  variables. they  are the compo- 
nents  m  and  n, which  vary  from point  to point.  a  vector  has fixed components,  a 
vector  field has varying  components. 
p(x, y, 2). then the vectors  are f = mi + nj + pk. 
example 1  the position  vector at  (x, y) is  r = xi + yj.  its  components are m = x 
and  n = y.  the  vectors  grow  larger  as  we  leave  the  origin  (figure 15.la).  their 
direction is outward and their length is iri  = j;i?;i = r, the vector r is boldface, 
the number r is lightface. 

example 2  the vector  field  r/r consists of  unit  vectors u,,  pointing  outward. we 
divide  r = xi + yj by  its  length, at  every  point  except  the  origin.  the components 
of  rlr are  m = xlr and  n = y/r.  figure 15.1 shows a  third field  ~ / r ~ ,
whose length 
is 1 /r. 

 

fig. 15.1  the vector  fields r  and r/r and  r/r2 are radial. lengths  r and  1 and  l/r 

example 3  the spin field  or rotation  field or turning field  goes around the origin 
instead  of  away from  it. the field is  s. its components are m = - y and n  = x: 

s = - yi + xj also has length  is1  = j(-y)2  + x2 = r. 

(2) 
dot  product  is zero: s  r = (-  y)(x) + (x)(y) = 0.  the 

s is  perpendicular  to r-their 
spin fields s/r and s/r2 have lengths  1 and  llr: 

the unit  vector  s/r is u,.  notice  the blank  at (o,o),  where this field is  not defined. 

fig. 15.2  the spin fields s  and s/r and s/r2 go around the origin. lengths  r  and  1 and  l/r. 

15.1  vector fields 

example 4  a gradientfield starts with an ordinary function f(x, y). the components 
m and pj  are the partial derivatives df/dx  and dfldy. then the field f is the gradient 
off: 

f = grad f = vf= dfldx i + dfldy j. 

(3) 

this vector field  grad f is everywhere perpendicular to the level curves f(x, y) = c. the 
length lgrad f 1  tells how fast f is changing (in the direction it changes fastest). invent 
a function like f = x2y, and you  immediately have its  gradient  field  f = 2xyi + x2j. 
to repealt, m is df/dx  and n is  dfldy. 

for every vector field you  should ask two questions: is  it  a gradient field?  if  so, 

what is f? here are answers for the radial  fields and spin fields: 

m a   the radial fields r and r/r and ~ /

are a11 gradient fields. 

r ~  

the spin fields s and s/r are not gradients of any f(x, y), 
the spin field s/r2 is the gradient of the polar angle 0 = tan- '(ylx). 

the derivatives off  = f(x2+ y2) are x and y. thus r is a gradient field. the gradient 
off = r  is  the  unit  vector  r/r pointing  outwards.  both  fields are  perpendicular  to 
circles around the origin. those are the level curves off = f r2 and f = r. 

question  is every r/rn a gradient field? 
answer  yes.  but among the spin fields, the only gradient is s/r2. 

a  ma-jor goal of  this chapter  is to recognize gradient  fields by  a simple test. the 
rejection  of  s and s/r will  be interesting. for some reason  -yi  + xj is rejected and 
yi + xj is  accepted. (it is  the  gradient  of 
.)  the  acceptance  of  s/r2 as  the 
gradient off = 0 contains a surprise at the origin (section 15.3). 

gradient  fields  are  called  conservative.  the  function f is  the potential  function. 

these words, and the next examples, come from physics and engineering. 

example5  the velocity field  is v and the flow field  is pv. 

suppose: fluid moves steadily down a pipe. or a river flows smoothly (no waterfall). 
or the air circulates in a fixed pattern. the velocity can be different at different points, 
but  there is  no  change with  time. the velocity vector v gives the  direction offlow 
and speed of  jow  at every point. 

in reality the velocity field is v(x, y, z), with three components m, n, p. those are 
the  velocities v,, v2, v,  in  the  x, y, z  directions. the  speed  (vi is  the  length: ivi2 = 
v:  + v:  -t v:. 
in  a  "plane  flow"  the  k  component  is  zero,  and  the  velocity  field  is 
v,i+v2j= m i +  nj.

15  vector calculus 

for  a  compact  disc or  a  turning  wheel,  v  is  a  spin  field  (v = us,  co = angular 
velocity). a tornado might be closer to v = s/r2 (except for a dead spot at the center). 
an  explosion could have v = r/r2. a quieter example is flow  in and out of  a  lake 
with steady rain as a source term. 

thejlowjield pv is the density p times the velocity field. while v gives the rate of 
movement, pv gives the rate of movement of mass. a greater density means a greater 
rate ipvjof  "mass transport."  it is like the number of  passengers on a bus times the 
speed of  the bus. 

example 6  force fields from gravity: f is downward in the classroom, f is radial 
in space. 
when gravity pulls downward, it has only one nonzero component: f = - mgk. this 
assumes that vectors to the center of  the earth are parallel-almost 
true in a class- 
room. then f is the gradient  of  -mgz  (note dfldz = - mg). 
in physics  the usual potential is not  -mgz but  +mgz. the force field is minus grad f 
also in  electrical engineering. electrons flow from high  potential  to low  potential. 
the mathematics is the same, but the sign is reversed. 

in space, the force is  radial  inwards: f = - mmgr/r3. its magnitude  is  propor- 
tional  to  l/r2 (newton's  inverse  square  law).  the  masses  are  m and  m,  and  the 
gravitational constant is  g = 6.672 x  10-"--with  distance in meters, mass in kilo- 
grams, and time in seconds. the dimensions of  g are (force)(di~tance)~/(mass)~.this 
is different from the acceleration g =9.8m/sec2, which already accounts for the mass 
and radius  of  the earth. 

like all radial fields, gravity  is a gradient field.  it comes from a potential f: 

example 7 
the spin field s/r2 around the wire, times the strength  of  the current. 

(a short example) current in a wire produces a magnetic field  b.  it is 

streamlines and lines of force 

drawing a vector field is not always easy. even the spin field looks messy  when the 
vectors are too long (they go in circles and fall across each other). the circles give a 
clearer picture than the vectors. in any field, the vectors are tangent to "jield linesw- 
which  in the spin case are circles. 
definition  c is afield line or integral curve if  the vectors f(x, y) are tangent to c. 
the slope dyldx of  the curve c equals the slope n/m of  the vector f = mi + nj: 

we  are  still drawing  the field  of  vectors,  but  now  they  are  infinitesimally short. 
they are connected into curves! what  is lost is their length, because s and s/r and 
s/r2 all have the same field lines (circles). for the position field  r  and gravity field 
r/r3, the field  lines are rays from the  origin. in  this case the  "curves"  are actually 
straight. 
example 8  show that the field lines for the velocity field v =yi + xj are hyperbolas.

fig. 15.4  velocity fields are tangent to streamlines. gradient fields also have equipotentials. 

at  every point  these hyperbolas line up with  the  velocity  v.  each particle  of fluid 
travels on  afield line. in fluid flow  those hyperbolas are called streamlines. drop a 
leaf into a river, and it follows a streamline. figure 15.4 shows the streamlines for a 
river going around a bend. 
don't  forget the essential question about each vector  field. is  it a gradient field? 
for v = yi + xj the answer is yes,  and the potential is f = xy: 

the gradient of  xy is (8flax)i + (8flay)j = yi + xj. 

(7) 
when there is a potential, it has level curves. they connect points of  equal potential, 
so the curves f (x, y) = c  are called equipotentials. here they are the curves xy = c- 
also hyperbolas. since gradients are perpendicular to level curves, the streamlines are 
perpendicular  to the equipotentials. figure 15.4  is sliced one way by streamlines and 
the other way  by  equipotentials. 

a gradient field f = afldx i + afldy j is tangent to the field lines (stream- 
lines) and perpendicular to the equipotentials (level curves off). 

in the gradient direction f changes fastest. in the level direction f doesn't  change at 
all. the chain rule along f (x, y) = c proves these directions to be perpendicular: 

af  dx 
-- +  - = 0  or  (grad f )  (tangent to level curve) = 0.

example 9  the streamlines of  s/r2 are circles around (0,o). the equipotentials are 
rays 0 = c.  add rays to figure 15.2 for the gradient field s/r2. 
for the gravity field those are reversed. a body is pulled in along the field lines (rays). 
the equipotentials are the circles where f = llr is constant. the plane is crisscrossed 
by  "orthogonal trajectories9'-curves 

that meet  everywhere at right angles. 

if  you bring a magnet near a pile of  iron filings, a little shake will display the field

15.2  line integrals  .- 

(c) x2i+x2j  (d)yi. 

a line integral is an integral along a curve. it can equal an area, but that is a special 
case and not typical. instead of area, here are two important line integrals in physics 
and engineering: 

work along a curve =  f  t  ds 

flow across a curve = 

in the first integral, f is a force field. in the second integral, f is a flow field.  work 
is done in the direction of movement, so we integrate f  t. flow is measured through 
the curve  c, so we  integrate f  n. here t is the unit  tangent vector, and f  t is the 
force cornponent along the curve. similarly n is the unit normal vector, at right angles 
with t. then f  n is the component  of  flow perpendicular  to the curve. 

we will  write those integrals in several forms. they may  never be as comfortable 
as j y(x) dx, but  eventually we  get them under  control. i mention  these applications 
early,  so you  can see  where  we  are going. this  section  concentrates  on work,  and 
flow comes later. (it is also calledflux-the 
latin  word for flow.) you  recognize ds 
as the step along the curve, corresponding to dx on the x axis. where f dx gives the 
length  of  an interval (it equals b - a), 5 ds is the length of  the curve. 
example 1  flight from atlanta to los angeles on a straight line and a  semicircle. 

according  to  delta  airlines, the  distance  straight west  is  2000  miles.  atlanta  is  at 
(1000,o) and  los  angeles  is  at  (-1000,  o),  with  the  origin  halfway  between.  the 
semicircle route  c has  radius  1000. this is  not  a great circle route.  it  is  more  of  a 
"flat  circle," which  goes north past  chicago. no plane could fly it (it probably goes 
into space). 
the equation for the semicircle is x2 + y2 = 10002. parametrically this path is x = 
1000 cos t, y = 1000 sin t. for a line integral the parameter is better. the plane leaves 
atlanta at t = 0 and reaches l.a. at t = n, more than three hours later. on the straight 
2000-mile path,  delta  could  almost  do it.  around  the  semicircle c, the  distance  is 
looon  miles and  the speed has  to be  1000 miles per  hour. remember  that  speed is 
distance ds divided  by  time dt: 

dsldt = ,/(dx~dt)~ + (dyldt)'  = l000,/(- 

(1) 
the tangent  vector  to  c is  proportional  to  (dxldt, dyldt) = (-1000  sin t, 1000 cos t). 
but t is a  unit  vector, so we  divide by  1000-which 

is the speed. 

sin t)2 + (cos t)2 = 1000. 

suppose the wind  blows due east  with force f = mi. the components are m  and 

zero. foir  m =constant,  compute the dot product  f * t  and the work  -2000  m: 

f w t =  mi*(-sin  t i+cos t j ) =  m(-sin  t)+o(cos t ) =   - m sin t 

15  vector calculus 

work is force times distance moved. it is negative, because the wind  acts against the 
movement. you  may point  out that the work  could have been found more simply- 
go  2000  miles  and  multiply  by  - m.  i  would  object  that  this  straight  route  is  a 
dzrerent path.  but  you claim that  the path  doesn't  matter-the  work  of  the wind  is 
-2000m  on every path. i concede that this  time you  are right  (but not always). 

most line integrals depend on the path. those that don't  are crucially important. 

for a gradient field, we  only need to know the starting point  p  and the finish  q. 

158  when f is the gradient of a potential function f (x, y), the work j,  f  t ds 
depends only on the endpoints p  and q.  the work is the change in$ 

if  f = afpx i + af/ay j 

then 

f  t ds = f (q) -f(p). 

when f = mi, its components m  and zero  are the partial derivatives  off  = mx. to 
compute the line integral, just  evaluate f at the endpoints. atlanta has x = 1000, los 
angeles has x = - 1000, and the potential function f = mx is like  an antiderivative: 

work = f (q) - f (p) = m(-  1000) - m(1000) = - 2000m.

fig. 15.5  force mi, work  -2000m  on all  paths.  force myi, no work  on straight  path. 

may i give a rough  explanation of  the work  integral 5 f  t ds? it becomes clearer 
when the small movement tds is written  as dx i + dy j. the work  is the dot product 
with  f: 

the infinitesimal work is df: the total work is 5 df= f(q) - f (p). this is the fundamen- 
tal theorem for  a line integral. only one warning: when f is not the gradient of  any 
f (example 2), the theorem  does not  apply. 

example 2  fly these paths against the non-constant force field f = myi. compute 
the work. 

there is no force on the  straight  path  where y = 0.  along the  x  axis the wind  does 
no work. but the semicircle goes up  where y = 1000 sin t and the wind  is  strong: 

f * t = ( m y i ) * ( - s i n t i + c o s t j ) =  -my  sin t =  - looom  sin2t 

this  work  is  enormous  (and  unrealistic).  but  the  calculations  make  an  important 
point-everything 
is converted to the parameter t. the second point is that f = myi 
is  not  a  gradient  field.  first  reason: the  work  was  zero  on  the  straight  path  and 

15.2  line integrals 

nonzero  on the semicircle. second reason: no function has df/ dx = my and df  /dy = 
0. (the first makes f depend on y and the second forbids it. this f is called a shear 
force.)  without  a  potential we  cannot substitute p and  q-and 
the work  depends 
on the path. 

the  definition of line integrals 

we go back to the start, to define  f  t ds. we can think of f  t as a function g(x, y) 
along the path, and define its integral as a limit of  sums: 

ic g ( ~ ,  y) ds = limit of 

n 

i =  1 

&xi, yi)asi  as  (as),,,.,  -i 0. 

(5) 

the points (xi, y,) lie on the curve c. the last point  q is (x,,  y,); 
the first point p is 
(xo, yo). the step asi is the distance to (xi, yi) from the previous point.  as the steps 
get small (as -, 0) the straight pieces follow the curve. exactly as in section 8.2, the 
special case g = 1  gives  the  arc length.  as  long  as g(x, y)  is  piecewise  continuous 
(jumps allowed) and the path is piecewise smooth (corners allowed), the limit exists 
and defines the line integral. 

when g is the density of a wire, the line integral is the total mass. when g is f  t, 
the integral  is the work.  but  nobody  does the calculation  by  formula  (5). we  now 
introduce a parameter t-which 
could be the time, or the arc length s, or the distance 
x along the base. 

the diflerential ds becomes (ds/dt)dt. everything changes over to t: 

the curve starts when t = a, runs through the points (x(t), y(t)), and ends when t = b. 
the square root in the integral is the speed dsldt. in three dimensions the points on 
c are (x(t), y(t), z(t)) and (dz/dt)l is in the square root. 

example 3  the points  on a coil spring are (x, y, z) = (cos t, sin t, t).  find the mass 
of  two complete turns (from t = 0 to t = 4 4  if  the density is p = 4. 
is  ( d ~ / d t ) ~  + ( d ~ / d t ) ~  + ( d ~ l d t ) ~  = sin2t + cos2t + 1 = 2.  thus 
solution  the  key 
dsldt = fi. to find the mass, integrate the mass per unit length which is g = p = 4: 

that is a line integral in three-dimensional space. it shows how to introduce t. but 
it  misses  the main  point  of  this  section, because it contains no vector  field  f. this 
section is about work, not just  mass. 

different forms of the  work  integral 

the work integral i f   t ds can be written in a better way. the force is f = mi + nj. 
a small step along the curve is dx i + dy j.  work is force times distance, but it is only 
the force component along the path that counts. the dot product  f -tds finds that 
component automatically. 

15  vector calculus 

i 15c  the vector  to a point  on c is r = xi + yj. then dr = tds = dx i + dy j: 

i along a space curve the work is j f * ~ d s = f ~ * d ~ = j ~ d x + ~ d ~ +  

~ d z .  

the product  m dx  is (force in x  direction)(movement in x direction). this is zero if 
either factor is zero. when the only force is gravity, pushing a piano takes no work. 
it is friction that hurts. carrying the piano up the stairs brings in pdz, and the total 
work  is the piano weight  p  times the change in z. 
to connect  the new i f  dr with  the  old  i f  * t  ds, remember  the tangent  vector 
t. it is  drlds.  ~herefoie tds is  dr. the best  for computations is  dr, because  the 
unit vector t has a division by dsldt = , / ( d ~ / d t ) ~  + ( d ~ l d t ) ~ .  later we multiply by this 
square root, in  converting ds to (dsldtjdt. it makes no sense to compute the square 
root,  divide  by  it,  and  then  multiply  by  it.  that  is  avoided  in  the  improved form 
~ m ~ x + n ~ y .
example 4  vector field f = - yi + xj, path from (1,o) to (0, 1): find the work. 
note 1  this f is  the spin field s. it goes around the origin, while r = xi + yj goes 
outward.  their  dot  product  is  f  r = - yx + xy = 0.  this  does  not  mean  that 
f  dr = 0. the force is perpendicular  to r, but not to the change in r. the work to 
move from (i, 0) to (0, i),  x  axis to y axis, is not zero. 
note 2  we have not described the path  c. that must be done. the spin field is not 
a  gradient  field, and  the  work  along  a  straight line  does not  equal  the  work  on a 
quarter-circle: 

 

straight  line x = 1 - t, y = t 

quarter-circle x = cos t, y = sin t.

15.2  llne integrals 

for practice, take the path down the x axis to the origin (x = 1 - t, y = 0). then 
go up the y axis (x = 0, y = t - 1). the starting time at (1,o) is t = 0. the turning time 
at the origin is t = 1. the finishing time at (0, 1) is t = 2.  the integral has two parts 
because this new path has two parts: 

bent path:  j-ydx+xdy=o+o 

(y=o on one part, then x=o). 

note 3  the answer depended on the path, for this spin field f = s. the answer did 
not  depend on  the  choice of  parameter.  if  we  follow  the  same path  at  a  different 
speed, the work is the same. we can choose another parameter 2,  since (ds/dt)dt and 
(ds/dz)dz  both  equal  ds.  traveling  twice  as  fast  on  the  straight  path  (x = 1 - 22, 
y = 22) we  finish at t = 4 instead of  t = 1. the work is still  1: 

conservnion of total  energy (kinetic + potential) 

when a force field does work on a mass m, it normally gives that mass a new velocity. 
newton's  law is f =ma = mdvldt. (it is  a vector law. why write out three compo- 
nents?) the work  f  dr is 

j (m dvldt)  (v dt) = *mv  v]:  = $mv(q)12 - $mlv(p)12. 

the work  equals the change in  the kinetic energy 4mlv12. but for a gradient field the 
work is also the change in potential-with 

a minus sign from physics: 

comparing (8) with (9), the combination $m1vl2 + f is the same at p and q.  the total 
energy, kinetic plus potential, is conserved. 

independence of path: gradient fields 

the work  of  the  spin  field  s depends on  the  path.  example 4  took  three  paths- 
straight line, quarter-circle, bent line. the work was  1, 4 2 ,  and 0, different on each 
path. this happens for more than 99.99% of  all vector fields. it does not happen for 
the  most  important  fields.  mathematics  and  physics  concentrate  on  very  special 
fields-for  which  the work  depends only  on the endpoints. we  now  explain what 
happens, when  the integral is independent of  the path. 

suppose you integrate from p to q on one path, and back to p  on another path. 
combined, that is a closed path  from p  to p (figure 15.7). but a backward integral 
is the negative of  a forward integral, since dr switches sign. if the integrals from  p 
to q are equal, the integral around the closed path  is zero: 

closed 

path 1 

back path 2 

path  1 

path 2 

the circle on the first integral indicates a closed path. later we  will drop the p's. 

not  all  closed  path  integrals are  zero!  for  most  fields  f,  different  paths  yield 
different  work.  for "conservative"  fields, all paths  yield  the  same work. then zero 

15  vector  calculus 

work  around  a  closed  path  conserves  energy.  the  big  question  is:  how  to  decide 
which fields  are conservative, without trying all paths?  here is the crucial information 
about conservative fields, in a plane region  r  with  no  holes: 

15d  f  = m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j  is a conservative field if  it has these properties: 
a.  the work j f  dr around every closed path is zero. 
b.  the work  f  d r  depends only  on p and q, not on the path. 
c.  f is a gradient field:  m = df/ax and n  = df/dy for some potential f(x, y). 
d.  the components satisfy dm/ay = (3nldx. 
a field with  one of  these properties  has them all. d is the quick  test. 

these statements a-d  bring everything together for conservative fields (alias gradient 
fields). a closed  path  goes  one  way  to q and  back  the  other  way  to  p. the work 
cancels, and  statements  a and b are equivalent. we  now  connect them  to c. note: 
test d says that  the "curl" of  f  is zero. that can  wait  for green's  theorem  in  the 
next  section-the 

full discussion  of  the curl comes in  15.6. 

first,  a  gradient field  f = grad f  is  conservative.  the  work  is f (q) - f (p), by  the 
fundamental theorem for line integrals. it depends only on the endpoints and not the 
path. therefore statement c leads back  to b. 
our job  is  in  the  other  direction,  to  show  that  conservative  fields  mi + nj  are 
gradients. assume that  the  work  integral depends  only  on the  endpoints.  we  must 
construct a potentialf, so that f is its gradient. in other words, dfldx must be m  and 
dfldy must be  n. 

fix the point  p. define f (q) as the work to reach q. then f equals grad& 

check  the  reasoning. at  the  starting point  p, f  is  zero.  at  every  other point  q, f  is 
the work j m dx + n dy to reach  that point. allpathshsfom  p  to q give the same f(q), 
because  the field  is  assumed conservative.  after  two examples  we  prove  that grad f 
agrees with  f-the 

construction succeeds.

fig. 15.7  conservative fields: $ f  d r  = 0 and j@ f  d r  = f ( q )  - f  (p). here f  ( p )  = 0. 

example 5  find  f ( x ,  y)  when  f = mi + nj = 2xyi + x2j.  we  want  (: f /ax = 2xy 
and  dfldy = x2. 
solution 1  choose p = (0,o). integrate m dx + n dy along to ( x ,  0) and up to (x, y):

0 ,  y )  

s (x, 0 )  

2xy dx = 0 (since y = 0) 

x2dy = x 2 y  (which is f  ). 

certainly f  = x2y meets the requirements: f,  = 2xy and f, = x2. thus f = gradf  note 
that  dy = 0  in  the  first  integral  (on the  x  axis). then  dx = 0 in  the  second  integral 
(x  is  fixed). the integrals add  to f  = x2y. 

15.2  line integrals 

solution 2  integrate 2xydx + x2dy on the straight line (xt, yt) from t = 0 to t = 1: 

iol 

2(xt)(yt)(x dt) + ( ~ t ) ~ ( y

dt) = so13x2yt2dt= x2yt3]: = x2y. 

most  authors use solution 1. i use solution 2. most students use solution 3: 
solution 3  directly solve df/dx = m  = 2xy and then fix up dfldy = n  = x2: 

af/dx = 2xy  gives  f  = x2y  (plus any function  of y). 

in  this  example x2y already  has  the  correct  derivative  dfldy = x2. no  additional 
function  of  y  is  necessary.  when  we  integrate  with  respect  to  x,  the  constant  of 
integration (usually c ) becomes a function  c(y). 

you  will  get  practice in finding f. this is  only possible  for conservative fields! i 

tested m  = 2xy and n  = x2 in advance (using d) to be sure that  dm/dy = dn/dx. 
example 6  look for f (x, y) when  mi + nj is the spin field  -yi + xj. 
attempted solution 1  integrate  -y dx + x dy from (0,o) to (x, 0 )  to (x, y): 

attempted solution 2  integrate  -y dx + x dy on the line (xt, yt) from t = 0 to 1 : 

(0,o) 

- y d x = o  

and  i(x. y) 

i(x, 0) 
so1-(yt)(x dt) + (xt)(y dt) = 0  (a different f, also wrong). 

x dy = x y   (which seems like f). 

(x. 0) 

aitempted solution 3  directly solve dfldx = -y  and try to fix up af/dy = x :  

af/dx = - y  gives 

f  = -x y   (plus any function c(y)). 

the  y  derivative of  this f  is  - x   + dc/dy. that  does  not  agree  with  the  required 
dfldy = x.  conclusion:  the  spin field  -yi + xj  is  not  conservative. there  is  no f. 
test d gives dm/dy = - 1  and dn/dx = + 1. 

to  finish this  section, we  move from examples to  a  proof.  the  potential f(q) is 
defined as the work to reach q. we must show that its partial derivatives are m and 
n.  this  seems  reasonable  from  the  formula f (q) = i m dx + n dy, but  we  have  to 
think it through. 
remember statement a, that  all paths give the same f(q). take a path  that goes 
from  p to the left  of  q.  it  comes in  to q  on a  line y  = constant (so dy = 0). as  the 
path reaches q, we  are only integrating m dx. the derivative of  this integral, at q, is 
df/ax = m. that is the fundamental theorem of  calculus. 

to show that af/ay = n, take a different path. go from p to a point below q. the 
path  comes up  to  q  on a  vertical  line (so dx = 0). near  q  we  are only integrating 
n dy, so i?f/dy= n. 

the requirement that  the region must have no holes will be critical for test d. 
x dx + y dy. test d  is passed: an/ax = 0= dm/dy.

solution 3  afjax = x  gives f  = +x2+ c(y).then af/dy = y  needs c(y)= :y2.

15.3  green's theorem 

this section contains the fundamental theorem of calculus, extended to two dimen- 
sions. that sounds important  and it is. the formula was discovered 150 years after 
newton  and  leibniz,  by  an  ordinary  mortal  named  george  green. his  theorem 
connects a double integral over a region r  to a line integral along its boundary c. 

the integral of  dfldx  equals f(b) - f (a). this connects a one-dimensional integral 
to a zero-dimensional integral. the boundary only contains two points a and b!  the 
answer f (b) - f (a) is some kind of a "point integral." it is this absolutely crucial idea- 
to integrate a derivative from information at the boundary-that  green's  theorem 
extends into two dimensions. 

there are two important integrals around c. the work is i f t ds = i m dx + n dy. 
the flux  is 1 f  n ds =  m dy - n dx (notice the switch). the first is for a force field, 
the second is for a flow field. the tangent vector t turns 90" clockwise to become 
the  normal vector  n.  green's  theorem handles  both,  in  two  dimensions. in  three 
dimensions they split into the divergence theorem (1 5.5) and stokes' theorem (1 5.6). 
green's  theorem  applies  to  "smooth"  functions  m(x, y)  and  n(x, y),  with  con- 
tinuous first derivatives in a region slightly bigger than r. then all integrals are well 
defined. m and n will have a definite and specific meaning in each application-to 
electricity or magnetism or fluid flow or mechanics. the purpose of  a theorem is to 
capture  the  central ideas  once  and  for all. we  do that  now,  and  the  applications 
follow. 

1se  green's  tireorm  suppose  the  region  r  is  bounded  by  the  simple 
closed piecewise smooth curve c. thm an integral over r equals a line integral 
around c: 

a curve is "simple"  if  it doesn't  cross itself (figure 8's  are excluded). it is "closed"  if 
its endpoint q is the same as its starting point p. this is indicated by the closed circle 
on the integral sign. the curve is "smooth" if  its tangent t changes continuously- 
the word "piecewise"  allows a finite number of corners. fractals are not allowed, but 
all reasonable curves are acceptable (later we discuss figure 8's  and rings). first comes 
an understanding of  the formula, by  testing it on special cases.

x dy = ff1 dx dy 

(which is the area  of r). 

(2)

the  integrals  look  equal,  because  the  inner  integral  of dx  is  x.  then  both  integrals
have  x dy-but  we  need  to  go  carefully.  the  area  of a  layer  of r  is  dy  times  the
difference  in x  (the length of  the strip). the  line integral in  figure  15.8  agrees. it  has
an  upward  dy times  x (at  the  right) plus  a downward  -dy 
times x  (at the left).  the
integrals  add up  the  strips, to  give  the total  area.
special case 2:  m = y  and  n = 0 and  fc y dx = fr(-1)  dx dy= -(area  of r).
now  green's  formula  has a minus  sign, because  the line integral  is  counterclockwise.
the  top of each  slice  has dx < 0  (going left) and the bottom  has dx > 0 (going right).

the  cross  derivatives  always  satisfy f,y  =fx,. that is  why  gradient  fields  pass  test  d.
when  the  double integral  is zero,  the  line  integral  is also  zero:  fc m dx +  n dy  = 0.
the  work is  zero.  the field is  conservative!  this last  step in  a =>  b =>  c =>  d  =  a  will
be  complete  when  green's  theorem  is  proved.

conservative  examples  are  fx dx = 0  and  f y dy  = 0.  area  is  not  involved.

remark  the  special  cases  x dy  and  -
ydx  led  to  the  area  of  r.  as  long  as
1 =  an/ax - am/ay, the  double  integral  becomes ff 1 dx dy.  this gives  a  way to  com-
pute  area by  a  line  integral.

the  area  ofr  is

fig.  15.9  green's  theorem:  line  integral  around  triangle,  area  integral  for  ellipse.

two  pieces  are zero:  x dy - y dx = 0  on the  sides where  x = 0 and  y = 0. the sloping
side  x = 2 - y  has  dx =  - dy.  the  line  integral  agrees  with  the  area,  confirming
green's  theorem:

xdy-ydx=  f=(2 - y)dy + ydy = 

2dy = 2.

example  2  the  area of an ellipse  is  nrab  when  the  semiaxes  have  lengths  a and b.

this  is  a  classical  example,  which  all  authors  like.  the  points  on  the  ellipse  are
x = a cos t,  y  = b  sin t,  as  t  goes  from  0  to  21r.  (the  ellipse  has  (x/a)2  + (y/b)2  = 1.)
by  computing  the  boundary  integral,  we  discover  the  area  inside.  note  that  the
differential  x dy - y dx is just  ab dt:

(a cos  t)(b cos  t dt) -

(b  sin  t)(-  a  sin  t dt) = ab(cos2t + sin2 t)dt = ab dt.

the  line  integral  is  _o2  ab dt = 7nab.  this  area  nab is  7rr2, for  a  circle  with  a = b = r.

proof  of green's  theorem:  in our  special  cases,  the  two  sides  of the  formula  were
equal.  we  now  show  that  they  are  always  equal.  the  proof  uses  the  fundamental
theorem  to  integrate  (an/ax)dx  and  (am/dy)dy.  frankly  speaking,  this  one-dimen-
sional  theorem  is  all  we  have  to  work  with-since  we  don't  know  m  and  n.

the  proof is  a  step  up  in mathematics,  to  work  with  symbols  m and  n  instead  of
specific  functions. the  integral  in (6)  below  has  no  numbers.  the  idea  is to  deal  with
m  and  n in  two  separate  parts, which  added  together  give  green's  theorem:

if we  knew  m and f  and g, we  could do the  outer  integral-from  x = a to  x = b.  but
we  have  to  leave  it  and  go  to  the  other  side  of green's  theorem-the  line integral:

m dx =  m(x, y)dx +  bot  m(x,  y)dx 

+= 

f  m(x, f(x))dx  + fa  m(x, g(x))dx.

fig.  15.10  very  simple region  (a-b).  simple region  (c) is  a union  of very  simple  regions.

compare  (7) with  (6).  the  integral  of m(x, g(x)) is  the same for  both. the  integral  of
m(x,f(x))  has  a minus  sign from (6).  in (7) it  has a  plus sign  but  the integral  is  from
b  to  a. so  life  is  good.

the  part  for  n  uses  the  same  idea.  now  the  x  integral  comes  first,  because
(0n/ax)dx is  practically asking to be  integrated-from  x = g(y) at the left to x  = f(y)
at the  right.  we reach  n(f(y), y) - n(g(y), y).  then  the y integral  matches     ndy  and
completes  (5).  adding the  two  parts  of (5) proves  green's  theorem.

finally  we  discuss  the shape  of  r.  the  broken  ring  in  figure  15.10 

is  not  "very
simple,"  because  horizontal  lines  go in  and  out and  in and out.  vertical  lines  do  the
same. the x and  y  strips break into pieces. our reasoning  assumed  no  break between
y =f(x) at  the  top and  y = g(x)  at the  bottom.

there  is  a  nice  idea  that  saves  green's  theorem.  separate  the  broken  ring  into
three  very  simple regions  r 1, r2,  r 3 . the  three double integrals  equal the  three line
integrals  around  the  r's.  now  add  these  separate results, to  produce  the  double
integral  over  all  of r.  when  we  add  the  line integrals,  the crosscuts cc  are covered
twice  and they  cancel. the  cut  between  r1  and  r 2  is  covered  upward  (around r1 )
and  downward  (around r 2). that  leaves  the  integral  around  the boundary  equal  to
the  double  integral  inside-which  is  green's  theorem.

when  r  is  a  complete  ring,  including  the  piece  r 4 , the  theorem  is  still  true.  the
integral  around  the  outside  is  still  counterclockwise.  but  the  integral  is  clockwise
around  the  inner  circle.  keep  the  region r  to  your  left  as you go  around c.  the
complete  ring  is  "doubly"  connected,  not  "simply"  connected.  green's  theorem
allows  any finite  number  of  regions  ri and  crosscuts  cc  and  holes.

example  3  the  area  under  a  curve  is  jb y  dx, as  we  always  believed.

in  computing  area  we  never  noticed  the  whole  boundary.  the  true  area  is  a  line
y dx  around  the  closed curve  in  figure  15.11 a.  but y  = 0  on  the  x  axis.
integral  -
also  dx = 0  on  the  vertical  lines  (up  and  down  at  b  and  a). those  parts  contribute
zero  to  the  integral  of y dx.  the only  nonzero  part  is  back  along  the curve-which
is the  area  -

a y dx  or  i' y dx  that we  know  well.

what  about  signs,  when  the  curve  dips  below  the  x  axis?  that  area  has  been
counted  as  negative  since  chapter  1. i saved  the  proof  for  chapter  15.  the  reason
lies  in  the  arrows  on  c.

the  line  integral  around  that  part  goes the  other way. the  arrows  are  clockwise,
the region  is  on  the right, and  the  area  counts  as  negative.  with  the  correct  rules,  a
figure  8 is  allowed  after  all.

conservative  fields

we  never  leave  gradients  alone!  they  give  conservative  fields-the  work  around  a
closed  path  is f(p) -f(p)  = 0.  but  a  potential  function f(x, y) is  only  available  when
test  d is passed:  if  of/ax = m and af/oy =  n then dm/ly = an/ax. the reason  is that
fxy  =fx .

some  applications  prefer  the  language  of  "differentials."  instead  of  looking  for

f(x,  y),  we  look for  df:
definition  the  expression  m(x, y)dx  + n(x, y)dy  is  a  differential form.  when  it
agrees  with  the  differential  df= (df/ox)dx + (f/aoy)  dy  of  some  function,  the  form
is  called  exact. the  test for an exact differential is d:  on/ox =  om/ay.

nothing  is  new  but  the  language.  is  y dx  an  exact  differential?  no,  because  my  =  1
and  nx = 0.  is  y dx + x dy  an  exact  differential?  yes,  it  is  the  differential  of f= xy.
that  is  the product  rule! now  comes  an important  example,  to  show  why  r  should
be  simply connected (a region  with  no  holes).

example  4  the  spin  field  s/r 2 =  (- yi +  xj)/(x 2 +  y 2) almost passes  test  d.

both  numerators  are  y2-  x2 . test d  looks good.  to  find f,  integrate  m =  of/ax:

f(x, y) = 

- y dx/(x2  + y2) = tan-  (yx) + c(y).

the  extra part  c(y) can  be zero--the  y  derivative  of tan-  '(y/x)  gives n with  no  help
from  c(y).  the potentialf is the angle 0  in  the  usual  x, y, r right  triangle.

test  d  is  passed  and  f  is  grad  0. what  am  i  worried  about?  it  is  only  this,
that  green's  theorem  on  a  circle  seems  to  give  27r  = 0.  the  double  integral  is
ff (nx  - my)dx  dy. according  to  (8) this is  the integral  of zero. but the  line integral  is
27r:

f* dr = 

(- y dx  + x dy)/(x 2 +  y2)=  2(area  of circle)/a 2  = 2ra 2/a 2 = 27. 

(9)

with  x = a cos t and  y  = a sin t we  would find  the  same  answer.  the work  is 27r  (not
zero!)  when  the path goes  around the origin.

we  have  a paradox. if green's  theorem is wrong,  calculus is in deep trouble. some
requirement  must  be  violated to  reach  27t  = 0.  looking  at s/r 2 , the  problem is  at the
origin.  the field  is not defined  when  r = 0 (it blows up).  the derivatives  in  (8) are  not
continuous. test d does  not apply at the  origin, and was  not passed. we  could remove
(0, 0),  but  then the region where test d  is passed would  have a  hole.

15  vector calculus 

it is  amazing  how  one  point  can  change  everything. when  the  path  circles the 
origin, the line integral is not zero. the potential function f = 8 increases by 27r.  that 
agrees with i f  d r = 27r  from (9). it disagrees with i10 dx dy. the 27r  is right, the zero 
is wrong. nx - my must be a "delta function  of  strength 2n." 

the double integral is 27r from an infinite spike over the origin-even 

though n,  = 

my everywhere else. in fluid flow the delta function is a ''vortex." 

flow across a curve:  green's theorem turned  by 90" 

a flow field is easier to visualize than a force field, because something is really there 
and it moves. instead of gravity in empty space, water has velocity m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j. 
at  the  boundary  c it  can  flow  in  or out. the new  form  of  green's  theorem  is a 
fundamental "balance equation"  of  applied mathematics: 

flow  through c (out minus in) = replacement in r  (source minus sink). 

the flow is steady. whatever goes out through c must be replaced in r. when there 
are no  sources or sinks (negative sources), the total  flow through  c must  be  zero. 
this  balance  law  is  green's  theorem  in  its  "normal  form"  (for n)  instead  of  its 
"tangential  form" (for t): 

c 

15f  for a steady flow field f = m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j, the flux 1 f n ds through 
the boundary  c balances the replacement of  fluid inside r: 

figure 15.12 shows the 90" turn.  t becomes  n  and  "circulation"  along  c  becomes 
flux through c. in the original form of green's  theorem, change n and m to m and 
- n to obtain the flux form: 

playing with letters has proved  a new theorem! the two left sides in (1 1) are equal, 
is green's theorem (10) for the flux. the compo- 
so the right sides are equal-which 
nents  m and n can be chosen freely and named freely. 
the change takes mi + nj into its perpendicular field - ni + mj. the field is turned 
at every point (we are not just  turning the plane by  90"). the spin field s = - yi + xj 
changes to the position field r = xi + yj. the position field r changes to  -s.  stream- 
lines of  one field are equipotentials  of  the other field. the new form (10) of  green's

theorem  is  just  as  important  as  the  old  one-in fact  i  like  it  better.  it is  easier to
visualize  flow across  a  curve  than  circulation  along it.

the  change  of letters  was just for  the proof. from  now  on  f = mi + nj.

example  5  compute  both  sides  of the new  form (10)  for f = 2xi + 3yj. the  region
r  is  a  rectangle  with  sides  a and  b.

solution  this field has dm/ax + on/ly = 2 + 3. the  integral over  r is  f,  5 dx dy =
5ab. the line  integral  has four  parts,  because  r  has four  sides.  between  the left  and
right  sides,  m = 2x  increases  by  2a.  down  the  left  and  up  the  right,  fm dy  = 2ab
(those  sides  have  length  b).  similarly  n = 3y  changes  by 3b between  the bottom  and
top. those  sides  have  length  a, so  they contribute  3ab to a total  line integral  of 5ab.
important:  the  "divergence"  of a flow  field is  am/ax + anlay. the  example  has
divergence  = 5. to maintain  this  flow  we must replace  5 units  continually-not just
at the  origin  but everywhere.  (a  one-point  source  is  in example  7.)  the divergence  is
the  source  strength,  because  it  equals  the  outflow.  to  understand green's theorem
for  any vector field mi + nj,  look  at a tiny rectangle (sides  dx  and  dy):

flow  out the  right  side minus  flow  in the  left  side = (change  in  m) times  dy
flow  out the  top minus  flow  in  the bottom = (change  in n)  times  dx
total  flow  out of  rectangle:  dm dy  + dn dx = (am/ax + an/ay)dx dy.

the divergence times the area dx dy  equals the  total flow  out. section  15.5  gives  more
detail  with  more  care  in  three  dimensions.  the divergence  is  mx + n, + pz.

fig.  15.13  mx +  n, = 2 +  3 =  5  yields  flux  = 5(area)  = 5ab.  the  flux  is  dm dy  + dn dx=

(mx + ny)  dx dy. the  spin field  has no  flux.

example  6  find  the flux  through  a closed  curve  c  of  the spin  field  s = - yi + xj.
solution  the field  has  m =  - y  and  n = x and  mx  + n, = 0.  the double integral is
zero. therefore  the total  flow  (out minus in) is  also  zero-through  any closed  curve.
figure  15.13  shows flow entering and leaving a square. no  fluid is  added or removed.
there  is  no  rain  and no  evaporation.  when the  divergence mx  + n,  is zero, there is
no  source or sink.

flow  fields  without  sources

this is  really quite  important. remember  that conservative  fields  do  no work  around
c,  they  have  a  potential  f,  and  they  have  "zero  curl."  now  turn  those  statements
through  90', to  find  their  twins.  source-free fields have no flux  through c, they have
stream functions g, and they  have "zero divergence." the  new statements  e-f-g-h
describe  fields  without  sources.

15  vector calculus 

156  the field f = m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j is source-free if  it has these properties: 
e  the total flux f f  n ds through every closed curve is zero. 
f  across all curves from p to q,  the ff ux r:  f  n ds is the same. 
g  there is a stream function g(x, y),  for which m = ag/dy and n = - agf ax. 
h  the components satisfy am/ax + an/ay = 0 (the divergence is zero). 
a field with one of  these properties has them all. h is the quick test. 

the  spin  field  -yi  + xj  passed  this  test  (example 6  was  source-free). the  field 
2xi + 3yj does not pass (example 5  had m, + n,  = 5). example 7 almost passes. 
example 7  the radial field r/r2 = (xi + yj)/(x2 + y2) has a point source at (0,o). 
the new  test h is divergence = dm/dx + dn/dy = 0. those two derivatives are 
ay a ( x2 + y2 ) -  (x2 +y2)2 
and  - - - x2+y2-y(2y).

(12) 

they add to zero. there seems to be no source (if the calculation is correct). the flow 
through a circle x2 + y2 = a'  should be zero. but it's  not: 

a source is hidden somewhere. looking at r/r2, the problem is at (0,o). the field is 
not defined when r = 0 (it blows up). the derivatives in (12) are not continuous. test 
h  does  not  apply, and  was  not  passed. the  divergence m,  + n,  must  be  a "delta 
function" of  strength  211.  there is' a point source sending flow out through  all circles. 
i hope you see the analogy with example 4,. the field s/r2 is curl-free except at r = 0. 
the field r/r2 is divergence-free except at r = 0. the mathematics is parallel and the 
fields are perpendicular. a potential f and a stream function g require a region without 
holes. 

the  best  fields: conservative and source-free 

what  if  f is conservative and also source-free?  those  are  outstandingly  important 
fields. the curl is zero and the divergence is zero. because the field is conservative, it 
comes from a potential. because it is source-free, there is a stream function: 

those are the cauchy-riemann equations, named after a great mathematician of  his 
time and one of  the greatest of  all time. i can't  end without  an example. 
example 8  show that  yi + xj is both  conservative and  source-free. find f and g. 
solution  with  m = y  and  n = x, check  first  that  i?m/dy = 1 = dn/zx. there must 
be  a  potential  function. it  is f = xy, which  achieves af/ax = y and  i?f/ay = x.  note 
that fxx  +a, = 0. 
check next  that  dm/dx + an/dy = 0 + 0.  there must  be  a  stream function. it  is 
g = f (y2 - x2), which  achieves dg/ay = y aild dg/i?x = - x. note that g,,  + g,,  = 0. 

15.3  green's theorem 

the  curves f = constant  are  the equipotentials. the curves g = constant  are  the 
streamlines (figure 15.4). these are the twin  properties-a 
conservative field  with 
a potential and a source-free field with  a stream function. they come together into 
the  fundamental  partial  differential  equation  of  equilibrium-laplace's 
equation 
fxx +&y  = 0. 

ish  there is a potential and stream function when my = nx and mx = - ny. 
they satisfy laplhcejs e 4 ~ i m :  

f,+f,=m,+ny=o 

and 

g,+gyy=-nx+my=o. 

(15) 

if  we  have f without g, as in f = x2 + y2 and  m = 2x  and  n = 2y,  we  don't  have 
laplace's  equation:  f, + fyy  =4.  this  is  a  gradient  field  that  needs  a  source. 
if  we  have g without f; as in g = x2 + y2 and m = 2y  and n = - 2x, we  don't  have 
laplace's  equation. the field is source-free but it has spin. the first field is 2r  and 
the second field is 2s. 

with no source and no spin, we are with laplace at the center of mathematics and 

science.

15.4  surface integrals 

the double integral  in  green's  theorem  is  over  a  flat  surface r.  now  the  region 
moves out of  the plane. it becomes a curved surface s, part  of  a sphere or cylinder 
or cone. when the surface has only one z for each (x, y), it is the graph of a function 
z(x, y). in other cases s can twist and close up-a 
sphere has an upper z and a lower 
z. in all cases we want to compute area and flux. this is a necessary  step (it is our 
last step) before moving green's theorem to three dimensions. 

first a quick review. the basic integrals are 1 dx and 11 dx dy and 111 dx dy dz. the 
length  of  a  curve.  when  we  go  from  curves  to 
one  that  didn't  fit  was  jds-the 
surfaces, ds  becomes  ds.  area  is ji ds m d  flux  is ij f  n ds,  with  double  integrals 
because the surfaces are two-dimensional. the main  difficulty is in ds. 

all formulas  are summarized in  a table at the end of  the section. 
there are two ways to deal with ds (along curves). the same methods apply to ds 
(on surfaces). the first is in xyz coordinates; the second uses parameters.  before this 
subject gets complicated, i will explain those two methods. 

method  1 is for  the graph of a function: curve y(x) or surface z(x, y). 

a small piece of  the curve is almost straight. it goes across by dx and up by dy: 

length ds = j- 

= ,/i+(dyldx)2  dx. 

(1) 
a small piece of  the surface is practically flat. think of  a tiny sloping rectangle. one 
side goes across by  dx and up by (dz/dx)dx. the neighboring side goes along by  dy 
and  up  by  (az/dy)dy. computing  the  area  is  a  linear  problem  (from  chapter 1 i), 
because the flat piece is in a plane. 
two vectors a and b form a parallelogram.  the length of their cross product  is the 
area. in the present case, the vectors are a = i + (az/ax)k and b = j + (az/ay)k. then 
adx and bdy are the sides of  the small piece, and we  compute a x b: 

this  is  exactly  the  normal  vector  n  to  the  tangent  plane  and  the  surface, from 
chapter 13. please note: the small flat piece is actually a parallelogram  (not always 

574 

15  vector  calculus

a  rectangle).  its  area  ds  is  much  like  ds,  but  the  length  of n = a  x b  involves  two
derivatives:

area  ds  = iadx  x bdyl = inidx dy  = 

1 + (az/ax)2  + (z/aoy)

2 dx dy. 

(3)

example  1  find  the area  on  the  plane  z = x + 2y  above  a base  area  a.
this is the example to visualize. the area  down  in the xy  plane  is  a.  the  area  up  on
the  sloping plane  is  greater  than a.  a roof has more  area  than the  room underneath
it.  if the  roof goes  up at  a 450  angle,  the ratio  is 
2/. formula (3) yields  the correct
ratio  for  any  surface--including  our  plane  z = x + 2y.

x = u cos
y =  u sin v

y  =  sin v

the  derivatives  are  dz/dx = 1 and  az/ay = 2.  they  are  constant  (planes  are easy).
the  square  root  in (3) contains  1 + 12  + 22 = 6. therefore  ds =  6 dx dy. an  area  in
6 up  in the surface (figure  15.14a).  the vectors  a  and
the xy plane  is multiplied  by 
b  are  no  longer  needed-their  work  was  done  when  we  reached  formula  (3)-but
here  they  are:

a=i+(az/ax)k=i+k  b=j+(az/ay)k=j+2k  n= -i-2j+k.

6.  the  angle between  k and  n  has cos 0  = 1/  6.  that
the length  of n = a  x  b  is 
is the angle between  base plane and sloping plane. therefore  the  sloping  area  is 
6
times  the base  area.  for curved  surfaces  the idea  is  the same,  except  that the  square
root  in  ini = 1/cos  0  changes  as  we  move  around  the surface.

method 2 is for curves x(t), y(t) and surfaces x(u, v),  y(u, v),  z(u, v) with parameters.

a  curve  has  one  parameter  t.  a  surface  has  two  parameters  u  and  v  (it  is  two-
dimensional). one  advantage  of parameters  is that x, y, z get equal  treatment, instead
of picking  out  z  as f(x, y).  here  are  the first  two  examples:

cone x = u  cos  v, y = u  sin  v, z = u 

cylinder x = cos  v, y = sin  v, z = u. 

(4)
each  choice  of u and  v gives  a point  on  the  surface.  by  making  all  choices,  we  get
the  complete  surface.  notice  that  a  parameter  can  equal  a  coordinate,  as  in  z = u.
sometimes  both  parameters  are  coordinates,  as  in  x = u  and  y = v and  z =f(u, v).
that is just z =f(x, y) in disguise-the  surface  without  parameters. in other cases  we
find the xyz  equation by  eliminating u  and v:

(u  cos  v)2 +(uin  )2 = 2

2 =z

the cone is the graph off  = ,/-. 
the cylinder is not the graph of any function. 
there is; a line of z's  through each point  on the circle x2 + y2 = 1. that is what  z = 
u tells us: give u all values, and you get the whole line. give u and v  all values, and 
you  get  the  whole  cylinder.  parameters  allow  a  surface  to close  up  and  even  go 
actually  z = jw gives  only  the  top half  of  the  cone. (a  function produces 
through  itself-which 
only one z.) the parametric form gives the bottom  half  also. similarly y = ,/- 
gives only the top of  a circle, while x = cos t, y = sin t goes all the way around. 

the graph of f(x, y) can never  do. 

now  we  find ds, using  parameters. small movements  give a  piece of  the  surface, 
practica.11~ flat. one side comes from the change du, the neighboring side comes from 
dv. the two sides are given by  small vectors adu  and bdv:

example 2  find a and b and n = a x b and ds for the cone and cylinder. 

the cone has x = u cos v,  y = u sin v,  z = u.  the u derivatives produce  a = dr/du = 
cos v i -i- sin v j + k. the v  derivatives produce the other tangent vector b = ar/dv = 
- u s i n v i + u c o s v j .   the  normal  vector  is  a x b =  - u c o s v i - u s i n v j + u k .  
its 
length gives ds: 

~ s = i a  x  bi dudv=j(u  cos v12+(u sin v)* +u2dudv=&ududv. 

the cylinder  is even simpler: ds = du dv.  in these  and many  other examples, a is 
perpendicular  to b.  the small piece  is  a  rectangle.  its  sides  have  length  ial du  and 
ib(dv. (the cone  has  ]a/ = u and  ibi  = &, the cylinder  has  ial=  ibi  = 1). the cross 
product  is hardly  needed  for area, when  we  can just  multiply  ial du  times  ibldv. 

remark  on  the  two  methods  method  1 also  used  parameters,  but  a  very  special 
is  x  and  v  is  y.  the parametric  equations  are x = x,  y = y,  z  = f(x, y).  if 
choice--u 
you  go through the long square root in (7), changing u to x  and v  to y, it  simplifies 
to the s'quare root in (3). (the terms  dy/dx and axlay are zero; axldx and dyldy are 
1.) still it  pays to remember the shorter formula from  method 1. 

don't  forget  that  after  computing  ds,  you  have  to  integrate it.  many  times  the 
is with  polar coordinates. surfaces are often symmetric around an axis or 
good 
a  point. those are the surfaces  of  revolution-which  we  saw in  chapter 8 and will 
come back  to. 

strictly  speaking,  the  integral  starts  with  as  (not ds).  a  flat  piece  has  area 
[a x blaxay  or [a x blauav.  the area  of  a  curved  surface  is  properly  defined  as a 
limit.  the  key  step  of  calculus,  from  sums  of  as  to  the  integral  of  ds,  is  safe for

conclusion:  ini  = 
2  in  the  surface  above  it  (figure 15.15).  the
dx dy  in  the  base  is  multiplied  by 
square  root in  ds  accounts  for  the extra  area due  to slope.  a  horizontal  surface  has
ds =  1 dx dy, as  we  have  known  all  year.

now  for a  key  point. the integration is down in the base plane. the limits on  x  and
x/x2 + y2
y  are  given  by  the  "shadow" of the  cone.  to  locate  that  shadow  set  z = 
equal  to z = a. the  plane cuts the  cone  at  the circle  x2  + y 2 = a2 . we  integrate  over
the inside  of that circle  (where the  shadow  is):

surface  area  of cone  =

shadow

2 dx dy  =  /2 na 2

example  4  find  the  same  area  using  ds = 
with parameters,  ds  looks different  and  the shadow  in the base  looks different.  the
circle  x2  + y2  = a2  becomes  u2  cos 2v + u2  sin2v = a2. in other  words  u = a. (the  cone
has  z  = u,  the  plane  has  z = a, they  meet  when  u = a.)  the  angle  parameter  v  goes
from  0 to 27x.  the  effect  of these  parameters  is  to switch  us "automatically"  to  polar
coordinates,  where  area  is  r dr do:

example 6  find  the surface area of  a sphere of  radius a (known to be 4na2). 

this  is  a  good  example, because  both  methods  almost  work.  the equation of  the 
sphere is x2 + y2 + z2 = a2. method  1 writes z =,,/-.
the x and y deriva- 
tives are  -x/z and  -ylz: 

the square root gives ds = a dxdy/j-. 
notice that z is gone (as it should 
be). nolw integrate ds over  the  shadow  of  the  sphere, which  is  a  circle.  instead  of 
dx dy, switch to polar coordinates and r dr d6:

this calculation is successful but wrong. 2na2 is the area of  the half-sphere above the 
xy  plane.  the lower  half  takes  the  negative  square root  of  z2 = a2 - x2 - y2. this 
shows t'he danger of  method  1, when  the surface is not the graph of  a function. 

example 7 
(same sphere by method 2: use parameters) the natural choice is spheri- 
cal coordinates.  every  point  has an angle  u = #  down from  the north  pole and an 
angle  v = 6  around  the  equator.  the  xyz  coordinates  from  section 14.4  are  x = 
a sin # cos 6, y = a sin # sin 6, z = a cos #. the radius p = a is fixed (not a parameter). 
compute the first term  in equation (6)' noting  dz/d6 = 0: 

(dy/d#)(az/ao) - (az/a#)(ay/a6) = - (-a  sin #)(a sin # cos 6) = a2 sin24 cos 6. 

the other  terms in (6) are a2 sin2# sin 6 and a2 sin # cos #. then ds in equation (7) 
squares these  three components and adds. we factor  out a4 and simplify: 

conclusion: ds = a2 sin # d#  db.  a  spherical person  will  recognize  this immediately. 
it is the volume element  dv = p2 sin # dp d#  db, except dp is missing. the small box 
has area ds and thickness dp and volume dk here we  only want  ds: 

area of  sphere = [[ds

figure  15.16a shows a small surface with  sides a d#  and a sin # d6. their product  is 
ds. figure  15.16b goes back  to  method  1, where  equation  (8) gave ds = (alz) dx dy. 
i doubt that you will like figure  15.16~-and  you don't  need  it. with parameters 
#  and  8,the  shadow of  the  sphere is  a  rectangle. the equator is  the line  down  the 
middle,  where  # = 4 2 .  the height  is  z = a cos #. the area d#  d6 in  the  base  is  the 
shadow  of  ds = a2 sin # d#  db  up  in  the  sphere.  maybe  this  figure  shows  what  we 
don't  halve to know  about parameters.

ds, as  there  was  in ds. areas  are like arc lengths, one dimension  up. the  good  point
about line integrals ijf -nds is that the square root disappears. it is in the denominator
of  n, where  ds  cancels  it:  f * nds  = m dy - n dx.  the  same  good  thing  will  now

this formula  tells what to  integrate, given the  surface and  the vector field (f  and  f).
the  xy  limits  come  from  the  shadow.  formula  (10)  takes  the  normal  vector  from

for  the  unit normal  vector n, divide n by  its length:  n = n/ini.  the square  root is in
the  denominator, and  the same  square  root  is in ds.  see  equation  (3):

(11)

that is formula (10),  with  cancellation of square  roots. the expression  f . nds is often
written as  f . ds, again  relying on boldface to make ds a vector. then ds equals nds,
with direction n and  magnitude ds.

plane makes no difference! theflow through the base alsoflows through the plane. the 
areas are different, but flux is like rain. whether  it hits a  tent  or the ground below,

the zero  comes as a  surprise, but  it  shouldn't.  the cone goes straight  out from  the 
origin, and so does f. the vector n that is perpendicular to the cone is also perpendic- 
ular  to f. there is no flow through the cone, because f  n = 0. the flow travels  out 
along rays. 

jj f  nds for a surface with  parameters 

in  example  10  the  cone  was  z = f(x, y) = jx2  + y2.  we  found  ds  by  method  1. 
parameters were not needed (more exactly, they were x and y). for surfaces that fold 
and twist, the formulas with u and v look complicated  but the actual calculations can 
be simpler. this was certainly  the case for ds = dudv on the cylinder. 
a small piece of  surface has area ds = ia  x  bi  du dv. the vectors along the sides are 
a  = xui + yuj + z,k  and b = xvi + y,j  + zvk. they are tangent  to the surface. now  we 
put their cross product n  = a  x  b  to another use, because f  nds involves not only 
area but  direction. we need  the unit  vector  n  to see how  much flow goes through. 
the direction vector is n = n/ini. equation (7) is ds = lnldu dv, so the square root 
in1  cancels in nds. this leaves a nice formula for the "normal  component"  of  flow:

example i i  find  the  flux  of  f = xi + yj + zk  through  the  cylinder  x2 + y2 = 1, 
o < z < b .  
solution  the surface of the cylinder is x = cos u, y = sin u, z = v. the tangent vectors 
from  (5) are a = (-  sin u) i + (cos u) j  and  b = k.  the normal  vector  in  figure 15.19 
goes straight out through  the cylinder: 

to find f  n, switch f = xi + yj + zk to the parameters  u and v. then  f  n = 1: 

for the flux, integrate  f  n = 1 and  apply the limits on u = 8  and  v = z: 

flux = f b   f i n   1 du dv = 2nb = surface area of  the cylinder.

note that the top and bottom  were not  included! we  can find those fluxes too. the 
outward direction  is  n = k  at the  top and  n = - k  down through  the  bottom. then 
f  n is  + z = b at the top and  -z  = 0 at the bottom. the bottom flux is zero, the top 
flux  is  b times  the area (or nb). the total  flux  is  2nb + nb = 3nb.  hold  that  answer 
for the next  section. 

apology: i made u the angle  and  v  the height. then n  goes outward  not inward. 
example 12  find the flux of  f = k out the top half of  the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = a2. 
solution  use  spherical coordinates.  example 7 had  u = 4  and  v = 8. we found 

n = a  x b = a2 sin2# cos 8 i + a'  sin24 sin 8 j + a2 sin # cos # k. 

flux = 

the dot product with f = k is f *  n = a2 sin # cos #. the integral goes from the pole 
to the equator, # = 0 to # = 4 2 ,  and  around from  8 = 0 to 0 = 2n:

the next  section  will  show that the flux remains at nu2 through  any surfllce  (!) that 
is  bounded  by  the equator.  a special case is a  flat  surface-the  disk  of  radius  a  at 
the  equator. figure 15.18 shows  n = k  pointing  directly  up,  so  f - n  = k  k  = 1. the 
flux is jj 1 ds = area of  disk = nu2. anfluid goes past  the equator and out through the

i have  to mention  one more  problem. it might  not occur to a reasonable  person, but
sometimes  a  surface  has  only  one  side. the famous  example  is  the miibius  strip, for
which  you  take  a strip  of paper, twist it once,  and tape  the ends  together. its special
property  appears  when  you  run  a pen  along  the  "inside."  the  pen  in  figure  15.20
suddenly  goes  "outside."  after  another round  trip it goes back  "inside."  those  words
are  in quotation  marks, because  on  a mdbius  strip  they  have  no  meaning.

suppose  the  pen  represents  the  normal  vector.  on  a  sphere  n points  outward.
alternatively  n could point inward;  we are free  to choose. but the m6bius strip makes
the  choice  impossible.  after  moving  the  pen  continuously,  it  comes  back  in  the
opposite direction. this surface is not orientable. we  cannot integrate f * n to compute
the  flux,  because  we  cannot decide  the direction  of n.

a surface  is  oriented when  we can  and  do  choose  n. this  uses  the final property  of
cross  products,  that  they  have  length  and  direction  and  also  a right-hand rule. we
can  tell a x  b from  b  x a. those  give  the two  orientations  of n. for  an open  surface
(like  a wastebasket)  you can  select  either  one.  for  a closed  surface  (like a  sphere)  it
is  conventional  for  n to  be  outward.  by  making  that  decision  once  and  for  all,  the
sign  of the  flux  is  established:  outward flux  is  positive.

15.5  the  divergence theorem 

this section returns to the fundamental law wow out) - wow in) = (source). in two 
dimensions,  the  flow  was  in  and  out  through  a  closed  curve  c.  the  plane  region 
inside was r. in three dimensions, the flow enters and leaves through a closed surface 
s. the solid region inside is v.  green's theorem in its normal form (for the flux of a 
smooth  vector  field) now  becomes  the great  three-dimensional  balance  equation- 
the divergence  theorem:

i 

in  green's  theorem  the  divergence  was  dm/dx + dn/dy.  the  new  term  dp/dz 
accounts for upward flow. notice that a constant upward component p adds nothing 
to the  divergence (its derivative is zero).  it also adds nothing  to the flux (flow  up 
through  the  top  equals flow  up  through  the  bottom).  when  the  whole  field  f is 
constant, the theorem becomes 0 = 0. 

there are other vector fields with div f = 0.  they are of  the greatest importance. 
the divergence theorem for those fields is again 0 = 0, and there is conservation of 
fluid.  when div f = 0, flow  in  equals flow  out.  we  begin  with  examples  of  these 
"divergence-free"  fields. 
example 1  the spin fields  - yi + xj + ok  and oi  - zj + yk  have zero divergence. 
the first is an old friend, spinning around  the z axis. the second is new,  spinning 
around  the  x  axis.  three-dimensional flow  has  a  great  variety  of  spin  fields. the 
separate terms dm/dx, dn/dy, dp/az are all zero, so div f = 0. the flow goes around 
in circles, and  whatever goes out through  s comes back in. (we might have  put  a 
circle on 11,  as we  did on $c, to emphasize that s is closed.) 
example 2  the position field r = xi + yj + zk has div r = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
this is radial flow, straight out from the origin. mass has to be added at every point 
to  keep  the  flow  going.  on  the  right  side  of  the  divergence theorem  is  [[[ 3 dl/. 
therefore the flux is three times the volume. 

example  11  in  section 15.4 found  the  flux  of  r  through  a  cylinder. the answer 
was 3nb. now we also get 3nb from the divergence theorem, since the volume is nb. 
this is one of many cases in which the triple integral is easier than the double integral. 

example 3  an  electrostatic field  r/p3 or gravity field  - r/p3 almost has div f = 0. 
the vector  r = xi + yj + zk  has length 
= p.  then f has length p/p3 
(inverse square law). gravity from a point mass pulls inward (minus sign). the electric 
field from a point charge repels outward. the three steps almost show that div f = 0: 
step 1.  ap/ax = x/p, dplay = y/p, apldz = z/p-but  do not add those three. f is not 
we need dm/ax, an/ay, ap/dz. 
p or  l/p2 (these are scalars). the vector field is 
step 2.  a ~ / a x  = d/dx(x/p3) is  equal  to  l/p3 - ( 3 ~  
dp/ax)/p4 = 1lp3 - 3x2/p5. for 
dn/dy and  dp/az, replace 3x2 by  3y2 and  3z2. now add those three. 
step 3.  div f = 3lp3 - 3(x2 + y2 + z2)/p5 = 3lp3 - 3lp3 = 0. 
the calculation div f = 0 leaves a puzzle. one side of the divergence theorem seems 
to give jjjo dv= 0.  then the other side should be  jj f * nds = 0. but  the flux is  not 
zero when  all flow is outward: 

the unit normal vector to the sphere p = constant is n = rip. 
the outward flow f  n = ( ~ 1 ~ ~ )  
(rip) = p2/p4 is always positive. 
then jj f  nds = jj ds/p2 = 4np2/p2 = 4n.  we have reached 4n = 0.

15  vector  calculus

this  paradox  in  three  dimensions  is  the  same  as  for  r/r2  in  two  dimensions.
section  15.3  reached  27r  = 0,  and  the  explanation  was  a  point  source  at  the  origin.
same  explanation  here:  m, n, p are  infinite  when  p = 0.  the  divergence  is  a  "delta
function"  times 47r,  from  the point  source.  the  divergence  theorem  does  not  apply
(unless  we  allow  delta functions).  that  single  point  makes  all the  difference.

every surface enclosing the origin has flux  = 47r.  our  calculation  was  for a  sphere.
the surface  integral is much  harder  when s is twisted  (figure  15.21 a).  but the diver-
gence  theorem  takes  care  of everything,  because  div f = 0 in  the volume  v  between
these  surfaces.  therefore  jf f  nds = 0  for  the  two  surfaces  together.  the  flux
if f . nds = - 4n into the sphere must be balanced by if f  nds = 4n7r  out of the twisted
surface.

. the physical constants are  g and go,  the mathematical
constant  is the  relation  between divergence  and flux. equation (1) yields  equation (2),
in  which  the  mass  densities  m(x,  y, z)  and  charge  densities  q(x, y, z)  need  not  be

the  reasoning  behind  the  divergence  theorem

the  general  principle  is  clear:  flow  out minus  flow  in  equals  source.  our  goal  is  to
see  why  the divergence of f measures the source. in  a  small  box  around  each  point,
we  show  that div f dv balances  f * nds  through  the  six sides.

so  consider  a  small  box.  its  center  is  at (x, y, z).  its  edges  have  length  ax,  ay, az.
out  of the top and  bottom,  the normal vectors  are  k  and  -k.  the  dot product  with
f = mi + nj + pk is  + p or  -p.  the  area  as  is  axay.  so  the  two  fluxes  are  close
to  p(x,  y,  z +   az)axay and  - p(x, y,  z -   az)axay. when  the top  is  combined  with
the bottom,  the difference  of those p's is  ap:

net flux  upward ,- apaxay  = (ap/az)axayaz  ,  (op/oz)a v.

15.5  the divergence theorem 

similarly, the combined flux on two side faces is approximately (an/ay)ak on the 
front and back it is (dm/ax)ak adding the six faces, we  reach the key point: 

flux  out of the box x (am/dx + an/dy + dp/az)a k 

(4) 
this is (div f)ak for  a  constant field both  sides are zero-the 
flow goes straight 
through.  for f = xi + yj + zk, a little more goes out than comes in. the divergence 
is 3, so 3av is created inside the box. by  the balance equation the flux is also 3ak 
the approximation  symbol  x  means that  the leading term  is correct  (probably 
not  the next term). the ratio aplaz is not exactly dp/az. the difference is of  order 
az,  so the error in (3) is of higher order avaz. added over many boxes (about 1/av 
boxes), this error disappears as az  + 0. 

the sum  of  (div f)a v over all the boxes  approaches  [sj(div f)dk  on the other 
side of  the equation is a  sum of  fluxes. there is f *nas out of  the top of  one box, 
plus f  nas out of the bottom of  the box above. the first has n = k and the second 
has n = - k.  they cancel each other-the flow goes from  box  to box. this happens 
every time  two  boxes  meet.  the  only  fluxes  that  survive (because nothing cancels 
them) are at the outer surface s. the final step, as ax, ay, az  + 0, is that those outside 
terms approach 11 f  nds. then the local divergence theorem (4) becomes the global 
divergence theorem (1). 
remark  on  the proof  that "final  step"  is not easy, because the box  surfaces don't 
line up with the outer surface s. a formal proof  of  the divergence theorem would 
imitate  the  proof  of  green's  theorem. on a  very  simple region jjj (ap/az)dx dy dz 
equals 11 p dx dy  over the top minus 11 p dx dy  over the bottom.  after checking the 
orientation this is 11 pk  nds. similarly the volume integrals of dm/ax and dn/dy are 
the surface integrals 11 mi  nds and 11 nj  nds.  adding the three integrals gives the 
divergence theorem. since green's  theorem  was  already  proved  in  this way,  the 
reasoning behind (4) is more helpful than repeating a detailed proof. 

the discoverer of  the  divergence theorem  was  probably  gauss.  his notebooks 
only contain the outline of a proof-but 
after all, this is gauss. green and ostrograd- 
sky both  published proofs in  1828, one in england and the other in st. petersburg 
(now leningrad). as the theorem was studied, the requirements came to light (smooth- 
ness of  f  and s, avoidance of  one-sided mobius strips). 

new  applications are discovered all the time-when 

a scientist writes down a bal- 
ance equation in  a small box. the source is known. the equation is div f = source. 
after example 5 we  explain f.

f = (dpldx i + apjdy j + dp/dz k)/p = (xi + yj + zk)/p2. 

this flow is radially outward, of magnitude  lip. the normal vector n is also radially 
outward, of  magnitude  1. the dot product on the sun's  surface is  l/po:

temperature t -+  flowfield  - c grad  t.  then div(-  c grad t) = heat source 
displacement u  4 stressfield + c grad u.  then div(-  c grad u) = outside force. 

you  are studying calculus, not  physics or thermodynamics or elasticity. but please 
notice the main point. the equation to solve is div(-  c grad f )  = known source. the 
divergence and gradient are exactly what the applications need. calculus teaches the 
right things. 

this framework is developed in many books, including my  own text introduction 
to applied  mathematics  (wellesley-cambridge press). it governs equilibrium, in mat- 
rix equations and differential equations. 

product rule  for vectors:  integration by  parts 

may i go back  to basic facts about the divergence? first  the definition: 

f(x, y, z) = mi + nj + ~k  has div f = v  f = a ~ l a x  + a ~ l a y  + aplaz. 

the divergence is  a  scalar (not a vector). at  each point  div f  is a number. in fluid 
"flux per unit volume" or "flux density." 
flow, it is the rate at which mass leaves-the 
the symbol v  stands for a vector whose components are operations  not  numbers: 

(6) 
this vector is illegal but  very  useful. first, apply it to an ordinary function f(x, y, z): 

v = "del"  = i  alax + j alay + k alaz. 

vf ="del f"  = i  aflax+j  af/dy+ k df/az=gradient off. 

(7) 
second, take the dot product  v  f with a vector function f(x, y, z) = mi + nj + pk: 
(8) 
third, take the cross product  v  x f. this produces the vector curl f (next section): 

v  f = "del  dot f" = am/dx + an/dy + ap/az = divergence of f. 

v  x f = "del  cross f" = . . . (to be  defined). . . = curl of f .  

(9) 
the gradient and divergence and curl are v and v  and v  x . the three great opera- 
tions  of  vector calculus use  a  single notation!  you  are free to write  v  or  not-to 
make  equations  shorter  or  to  help  the  memory.  notice  that  laplace's  equation 
shrinks to 

equation (10) gives the potential when the source is zero (very common). f = grad f 
combines with  div f = 0 into laplace's  equation div grad f = 0.  this equation is  so 
important  that  it  shrinks  further  to  v2 f  = 0 and  even  to  a f  = 0.  of  course  a f = 
fxx  + fyy + f,, has nothing to do with a f = f (x + ax) - f (x). above all, remember that 
f is a scalar and f is a vector: gradient  of scalar is vector and divergence of vector is 
scalar. 

15.5  the  divergence theorem 

underlying this chapter is the idea of extending calculus to vectors. so far we have 
emphasized the fundamental theorem. the integral of  df/dx  is now the integral of 
div f. instead of endpoints a and b, we have a curve c or surface s. but it is the rules 
for derivatives and  integrals that make calculus work,  and we  need  them  now  for 
vectors. remember the derivative of  u times v  and the integral (by parts) of  u dvldx: 

15m  scalar functions u(x, y, z) and vector fields v (x, y, z) obey the product rule: 

div(uv) = u div v + v  (grad zr). 

(1 1) 

the reverse of  the product rule is integration by parts (gauss's  formula): 

for a plane field this is green's  fwmurla (and u = 1 gives green's  theorem): 

those look  like heavy formulas. they are  too  much  to memorize,  unless  you  use 
them often. the important point is to connect vector calculus with "scalar calculus," 
which is not heavy. every product  rule yields two terms: 

add those ordinary rules and you have the vector rule (1 1) for the divergence of  uv. 
integrating the two parts of  div(uv) gives i[ uv  nds by the divergence theorem. 
then one part moves to the other side, producing the minus signs in (12) and (13). 
integration by parts leaves a boundary term, in three and two dimensions as it did in 
one dimension:  uvtdx = - j utvdx + [uv]:. 

example 5  find the divergence of  f = r/p2, starting from grad p = r/p. 
solution  take v = r  and  u = llp2 in  the  product  rule (1 1). then  div f = (div r)/ 
p2 + r  (grad l/p2). the divergence of  r = xi + yj + zk is 3. for grad  l/p2 apply the 
chain rule: 

r  (grad llp2) = - 2r  (grad p)/p3 = - 2r  r/p4 = - 2/p2. 

the two parts of  div f combine into 3/p2 - 2/p2 = l/p2-as  claimed in example 4. 

example 6  find the balance equation for flow with velocity v and fluid density p. 
v  is  the  rate  of  movement  of  fluid,  while  pv  is  the  rate  of  movement  of  mass. 
comparing  the  ocean  to  the  atmosphere  shows the  difference.  air  has  a  greater 
velocity than water, but a much lower density. so normally f = pv is larger for the 
ocean. (don't confuse the density p with the radial distance p. the greeks only used 
24 letters.) 

there is another difference between water and air. water is virtually incompressible 
(meaning p = constant). air is certainly compressible (its density varies). the balance 
equation is a fundamental law-the  conservation of mass or the "continuity equation" 
for fluids. this is a mathematical statement about a physical flow without sources or 
sinks: 

continuity equation: div(pv) + 3plat = 0. 

(14) 

15  vector calculus 

explanation:  the mass in a  region  is j j j p  dv. its rate of  decrease is  - j j j  aplat dv. 
the  decrease comes  from  flow  out  through  the  surface (normal vector  n). the dot 
product  f  n = p v   * n  is  the  rate  of  mass  flow  through  the  surface. so  the  integral 
s j f   n d s   is  the  total  rate  that  mass  goes  out.  by  the  divergence  theorem  this  is 
j j j  div f d v. 

to balance  - j j j   d p / d t  d v  in every region, div f must equal  - apldt at every point.

now  the surface is not closed and s has its own boundary-a 
are back  near  the original  setting for green's  theorem  (region bounded  by  curve, 
double  integral  equal to work  integral). but  stokes'  theorem,  also  called  stokes's 
theorem, is in  three-dimensional  space. there  is a  curved surface  s bounded  by  a 
space curve c. this is our first integral around a space curve. 
the move to three dimensions brings a change in the vector field. the plane field 
f(x, y) = mi + nj  becomes  a  space  field  f(x, y, z) = mi + nj + pk.  the  work 
mdx + ndy  now  includes pdz. the critical  quantity  in  the  double integral  (it was 
an/ax - am/dy) must  change  too. we  called  this  scalar  quantity  "curl f,"  but  in 
reality it  is  only the third  component  of  a  vector. stokes'  theorem  needs all  three 
components of  that vector-which 
definition  the curl of  a vector field f(x, y, z) = mi + nj + pk is the vector field 

is curl f. 

590 

15  vector calculus 

the symbol v  x f stands for a determinant  that yields those six derivatives: 

curl f = v  x  f  = i 2ldx  dldy  2l2z i . 

the  three  products  i d/dy p  and j  dldz m  and  k dldx n  have plus signs. the  three 
products like k dldy m, down to the left, have minus signs. there is a cyclic symmetry. 
this determinant helps the memory, even if  it looks and is illegal. a determinant  is 
not supposed to have a row of  vectors, a row of  operators, and a row of  functions. 
example 1  the  plane  field  m(x, y)i + n(x, y)j  has  p = 0  and  dm/az = 0  and 
dn/dz = 0. only two terms survive: curl f = (anldx - dm/ay)k. back  to green. 

example 2  the cross product a x r is a spinfield s. its axis is the fixed vector a = 
ali + a, j  + a3k. the flow in figure 15.23 turns around a, and its components are 

our favorite spin field  -yi + xj  has (a,, a,,  a,)  = (0,0, 1 )  and its axis is a = k. 
the divergence of a spin field is m ,  + n ,  + p, = 0 + 0 + 0. note how the divergence 

uses m,  while the curl uses n ,  and p,.  the curl of s  is the vector 2a: 

this example begins to reveal the meaning of the curl. it measures the spin! the direc- 
this case along a. the magnitude of curl f is 
tion of curl f is the axis of rotation-in 
twice the speed of rotation. in this case lcurl fi  = 2/al and the angular velocity is la]. 

curl s = 2a 

r = x i  + y j  + _-k 

curl r = 0 
div r = 3 

fig. 15.23  spin field s = a x r, position field r, velocity field (shear field) v = zi, any field f. 

example 3 (!!)  every gradient field  f  = sf/?x  i + 2f / f y  j  + ?jli?z k  has curl f  = 0: 

always fyz equals f,, . they cancel. also f,,  =f,, and f,,=f,,  . so curl grad f  = 0. 

15.6  stokes' theorem and the curl of  f 

example 4  (twin of  example 3)  the  divergence  of  curl  f is  also  automatically 
zero: 

again the mixed derivatives give pxy = pyx and nxz = nzx and mzy = myz. the terms 
cancel in pairs. in "curl grad" and "div curl",  everything is arranged to give zero. 

i 456(  the curl of the grackat of  every f(x, y, a) is curl grad f = v x  vf  = 0. 

thx: divergence of tlae curl of every f4x, y, z) is div curl f = v  v x f = 0.  i 

the spin field s has no divergence. the position field r has no curl. r is the gradient 
of  f = &x2 + y2 + z2).  s is  the  curl  of  a  suitable  f.  then  div  s = div curl f  and 
curl r = curl grad f are automatically zero. 
you correctly believe that curl f measures the "spin"  of  the field. you may expect 
that curl (f + g) is curl f + curl g. also correct. finally you may think  that a field 
of  parallel vectors has no spin. that is wrong. example 5 has  parallel  vectors, but 
their different lengths produce spin. 

example 5  the field v = zi in the x direction has curl v = j in the y direction. 

if  you put a wheel in the xz plane, thisfield will turn it. the velocity zi at the top of 
the wheel is greater than zi at the bottom (figure 15.23~). so the top goes faster and 
the wheel rotates. the axis of  rotation is curl v = j.  the turning speed is ), because 
this curl has magnitude  1. 

another velocity field v = - xk produces the same spin: curl v = j.  the flow is in 
the z direction, it varies in  the  x  direction, and the  spin is in  the y  direction. also 
interesting is  v + v.  the  two  "shear  fields"  add  to a  perfect  spin  field  s = zi - xk, 
whose curl is 2j. 

the  meaning of  curl f 

example 5 put a  paddlewheel into the flow. this is possible for any vector field f, 
and it gives insight into curl f. the turning of  the wheel (if it turns) depends on its 
location (x, y, z). the turning also depends on the orientation of the wheel. we could 
put it into a spin field, and if  the wheel axis n is perpendicular to the spin axis a, the 
wheel won't  turn! the general rule for turning speed is this: the angular velocity of 
the  wheel  is  %curl f)  n.  this  is  the  bbdirectional spin,"  just  as (grad f )   o  was  the 
"directional derivative"-and 

n is a unit vector like u. 

there is no spin anywhere in a gradient field. it is irrotational: curl grad f = 0. 
the pure spin field a x r  has curl f = 2a. the angular velocity is a  n (note that 
) cancels 2). this turning is everywhere, not just  at the origin. if  you put a penny on 
a compact disk, it turns once when the disk rotates once. that spin is "around  itself," 
and it is the same whether the penny is at the center or not. 

the turning speed is greatest when the wheel axis n lines up with the spin axis a. 
then a  n is the full length (a(. the gradient gives the direction of fastest growth, and 
the curl gives the direction of fastest turning: 

maximum growth rate off  is  lgrad f 1  in the direction of  grad f 
maximum rotation rate of  f is f lcurl fi  in the direction of  curl f.

15  vector  calculus

stokes'  theorem

finally we  come to  the big theorem. it will  be like  green's theorem-a  line  integral
equals  a surface  integral.  the  line  integral  is  still  the  work  f f* dr  around  a  curve.
the  surface  integral  in  green's  theorem  is  ff (nx - m,) dx dy. the  surface  is  flat  (in
the  xy  plane).  its  normal  direction  is  k,  and  we  now  recognize  nx - my  as  the  k
component  of  the  curl.  green's  theorem  uses  only this  component  because  the  nor-
mal  direction is always  k. for  stokes' theorem  on a curved  surface, we need  all three
components  of curl f.

figure  15.24  shows  a  hat-shaped  surface  s and  its  boundary  c  (a  closed  curve).
walking  in the positive  direction  around  c,  with your  head pointing  in the direction
of  n,  the  surface  is  on your left. you  may  be  standing  straight  up  (n = k  in  green's
theorem).  you may even  be  upside down (n  = - k is allowed).  in that case you  must
go the other way  around  c, to keep the two  sides  of equation (6) equal. the surface  is
still on  the left. a m6bius  strip is not allowed,  because its normal  direction cannot be
established.  the unit vector  n determines the "counterclockwise  direction"  along c.

(stokes'  theorem) 

f* dr = 

(curl f)  nds. 

(6)

the right  side  adds  up  small spins in  the surface. the left  side  is  the total circulation
(or work) around  c.  that  is not  easy  to  visualize-this  may be  the hardest  theorem
in  the  book-but notice  one simple  conclusion. if curl  f = 0 then f f . dr = 0.  this
applies above all to gradient fields-as we  know.

a  gradient field  has no  curl,  by (4).  a  gradient  field  does no  work,  by (6).  in three
dimensions  as  in two  dimensions, gradient fields are conservative fields. they will  be
the focus  of this section,  after we outline  a proof (or two  proofs) of stokes'  theorem.
the  first  proof shows  why  the  theorem  is  true.  the  second  proof  shows  that  it

really is  true  (and how  to compute).  you may  prefer  the first.
first proof  figure  15.24  has a triangle  abc  attached  to a triangle acd.  later  there
can be  more triangles. s will be piecewiseflat, close to  a curved  surface. two triangles
are enough  to make  the point. in  the plane  of each  triangle  (they  have  different  n's)
green's  theorem  is  known:

4  f dr=  ff  curl  f  nds 

~ 

fdr=  if  curl  f  nds.

now  add. the  right  sides  give ff curl f . nds  over  the  two  triangles.  on  the left,  the
integral over  ca  cancels  the integral over  ac.  the "crosscut"  disappears.  that leaves
ab + bc + cd + da.  this  line  integral goes  around  the outer  boundary  c-which
is  the left side  of stokes'  theorem.

second proof  now the surface can be curved. a new proof may seem excessive, but 
it brings formulas you could compute with.  from z = f(x, y) we  have

to prove (7) = (8), change m in green's theorem to m + paflax.  also change n  to 
n + paflay.  then  (7) = (8) is  green's  theorem  down on the  shadow  (problem 47). 
this proves  stokes' theorem  up  on s. notice  how  green's  theorem  (flat surface) 
was the key  to both  proofs of  stokes' theorem (curved surface). 

example 6  stokes' theorem in electricity and magnetism yields faraday's  law. 

stokes' theorem is not heavily used for calculations-equation 
(8) shows why. but 
the spin or curl or vorticity of a flow is absolutely basic in fluid mechanics. the other 
important application, coming now, is to electric fields. faraday's  law is to gauss's 
law as stokes' theorem is to the divergence theorem. 

suppose the curve c is an actual wire. we can produce current along c by varying 
the magnetic field b(t). the flux q  = jj b  nds, passing within c and changing in time, 
creates an electric field e that does work: 

faraday's  law (integral form): work =  e  dr = - dqldt. i 

/. 

that is physics. it may be true, it may be an approximation. now comes mathematics 
(surely true), which turns this integral form into a differential equation. information 
at points  is more  convenient than  information  around  curves. stokes converts  the 
line integral of  e into the surface integral of  curl e: 

$ e m  dr = 11 curl e  nds and also  - &plat = 55  - (ab/at)  nds.

these are equal for any curve c, however small. so the right sides are equal for any 
surface s. we squeeze to a point. the right hand sides give one of maxwell's equations: 

faraday's  law (differential form): curl e = - abldt. 

conservative fields and potential functions 

the  chapter  ends  with  our constant  and  important  question:  which  fields do no 
work  around  closed  curves?  remember test  d  for  plane  curves  and  plane  vector 
fields: 

if  am/dy = dn/dx then  f is conservative and f = grad f and $ f - dr = 0. 

now allow a three-dimensional field like f = 2xy i + (x2 + z)j + yk. does it do work 
around  a  space curve? or  is  it  a gradient field? that will  require  aflax  = 2xy  and 
afjdy  = x2 + z  and  af/az = y.  we  have  three  equations for  one  function  f(x, y, z). 
normally they can't be solved. when test d is passed (now it is the three-dimensional 
test: curl f = 0) they can be solved. this example passes test d, and f is x2y + yz. 

15  v e r  calculus 

isp  f(x, y, z) = mi + nj + pk is a conservative field if it has these properties: 
b.  the work f $f dr depends only on p and q, not on the path in space. 
a.  the work  f  da around every closed path in space is zero. 
c.  f is a graden? fild  m  = a f /ax and n = af/dy  and p = df/az. 
d.  the components satisfy m y  = n,,  m, = p,,  and n, = p,  (curl f is zero). 
a field with one of  these properties has them all. d is the quick test. 

a detailed proof  of  a * b =.> c * d * a  is  not  needed.  only notice  how  c a d: 
curl grad f is always zero. the newest part is d * a. ifcurl f = 0 then f f  dr = 0. 
but that is not news. it is stokes' theorem. 

the interesting problem is to solve the three equations forf, when test d is passed. 

the example above had 

df/dx  = 2xy  f = 5 2xy dx = x2y plus any function c(y, z) 
dfldy = x2 + z = x2 + dc/dy  c = yz  plus any function c(z) 
df/dz = y = y + dcldz 

c(z) can be zero. 

the first step leaves an arbitrary c(y, z) to fix the second step. the second step leaves 
an arbitrary c(z) to fix  the third  step (not needed here). assembling the three steps, 
f = x2y + c = x2y + yz + c = x~~ + yz.  please recognize that the "fix-up"  is only pos- 
sible when  curl f = 0. test d must be passed. 

example 7 

is f = (z - y)i + (x - z)j + (y - x)k the gradient of  any f ?  

test d says no. this f is a spin field a x r. its curl is 2a = (2,2,2), which is not zero. 
a search for f is bound to fail, but we  can try. to match df/dx  = z - y, we  must have 
f = zx - yx + c(y, z). the y derivative is  -x  + dc/dy. that never matches n = x - z, 
so f can't  exist. 
example 8  what choice of  p makes f = yz2i + xz2j + pk conservative? findf: 
solution  we  need  curl f = 0, by  test d. first check  dm/dy = z2 = dnjdx. also 

dp/dx = am/dz = 2yz 

and 

dp/dy = dn/az = ~ x z .  

p = 2xyz passes all tests. to find f we  can solve the three equations, or notice that 
f = xyz2 is  s u c c ~ s s ~ u ~ .  
a third method defines f (x, y, z) as the work to reach (x, y, z) from  (0,0,o). the path 
doesn't  matter.  for  practice  we  integrate  f  dr = m dx + n dy + p dz  along  the 
straight line (xt, yt, zt): 

its gradient is f. 

f ( ~ ,  y,  z)  = so1 (yt)(~t)~(x dt) + (xt)(~t)~(y 

dt) + 2(xt)(yt)(zt)(z dl) = xyz2. 

example 9  why is div curl grad f automatically zero (in two ways)? 
solution  first, curl grad f is zero (always). second, div curl f is zero (always). those 
are the key identities of  vector calculus. we end with a review.

the  first  form  of  green's  theorem  leads  to  stokes'  theorem.  the  second  form 
becomes the divergence theorem. you  may  ask, why not go  to three dimensions in 
the fist  place?  the  last  two  theorems  contain  the  first  two  (take p = 0 and  a  flat 
surface). we could have reduced this chapter to two theorems, not four. i admit that, 
but a fundamental principle is involved: "it  is easier to generalize than to specialize." 

for the same reason  d f l d x  came before partial derivatives and the gradient.

mathematics after calculus 


i would like this book to do more than help you pass calculus. (i hope it does that 
too.) after calculus you will have choices-  which mathematics course to take next?- 
and these pages aim to serve as a guide. part of  the answer depends on where you 
are going-toward 
engineering or management or teaching or  science or another 
career where mathematics plays a part. the rest of  the answer depends on where the 
courses are going. this chapter can be a useful reference, to give a clearer idea than 
course titles can do: 

id202 

differential equations 

discrete mathematics 

advanced  calculus (with  fourier series) 

numerical methods 

statistics 

pure mathematics is often divided into analysis and algebra  and geometry. those 
parts  come  together  in  the  "mathematical  way  of  thinking9'-a  mixture  of  logic 
and ideas. it is a deep and creative subject-here  we  make a start. 

two  main  courses  after  calculus  are  linear  algebra  and  differential  equations. 
i hope you can take both. to help you later, sections 16.1 and  16.2 organize them 
by  examples. first a few words to compare and contrast those two subjects. 

id202 is about systems of equations. there are n variables to solve for. a 
change in  one  affects  the  others. they  can  be  prices  or  velocities or  currents  or 
concentrations-outputs 

from any model with interconnected parts. 

id202 makes only one assumption-the  model  must  be  linear. a change 
in  one  variable  produces  proportional  changes in  all  variables.  practically  every 
subject begins that way. (when it becomes nonlinear, we  solve by a sequence of linear 
equations. id135 is nonlinear because we  require x >, 0.)elsewhere j 
wrote that  "linear  algebra has become as basic and as applicable as calculus, and 
fortunately it is easier."  i recommend taking it. 

a differential equation is  continuous (from calculus), where  a matrix equation is 
discrete (from algebra). the rate dyldt is determined by  the present  state y-which 
changes by  following that rule.  section 16.2 solves y'  = cy + s(t) for economics and 
life sciences, and y" + by' + cy =f(t) for physics and engineering. please keep it and 
refer to it. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

a third key  direction is discrete mathematics.  matrices are a  part,  networks and 
algorithms are a bigger part. derivatives are not a part-this 
is closer to algebra. it 
is needed  in computer science. some people have a knack for counting the ways a 
computer can send ten messages in parallel-and 

for finding the fastest way. 

typical question: can 25 states be  matched with 25 neighbors, so one state in each 
pair has an even number of  letters? new  york can pair with new  jersey, texas with 
oklahoma,  california  with  arizona.  we  need  rules  for  hawaii  and  alaska.  this 
matching question doesn't  sound mathematical, but  it is. 

section 16.3 selects four topics from discrete mathematics, so you can decide if  you 

want more. 

go back for a moment to calculus and differential equations. a completely realistic 
problem is seldom easy, but we can solve models. (developing a good model is a skill 
in itself.) one method of  solution involves complex numbers: 

any function  u(x + iy)  solves 
any function  eik("+") 

uxx+ u,,  = 0  (laplace equation) 
solves  u,,  - c2uxx= 0  (wave equation). 

from those building blocks we  assemble solutions. for the wave equation, a signal 
starts at t = 0.it is  a combination  of  pure  oscillations eikx.the coefficients in  that 
combination make up the fourier transform-to 
tell how much of each frequency is 
in  the  signal. a lot  of  engineers and  scientists would  rather  know  those  fourier 
coefficients than f(x). 

a  fourier  series  breaks  the  signal  into  z a,  cos kx  or  z b, sin kx  or  t. ekeikx. 
these sums can be infinite (like power series). instead of values of f(x), or derivatives 
at the basepoint,  the function is described by  a,,  b,,  c,.  everything is computed by 
the "fast  fourier transform."  this is the greatest algorithm since newton's method. 
a radio signal is near one frequency. a step function has many frequencies. a delta 
function has every frequency in  the  same amount: 6(x) = z cos kx.  channel 4 can't 
broadcast  a perfect step function. you wouldn't  want to hear a delta function. 

we mentioned computing. for nonlinear equations this means newton's method. 
take the place of  formulas.  exact solu- 
for ax = b it means elimination-algorithms 
tions are gone-speed 
and accuracy and stability become essential. it seems right to 
make scientific computing a part  of  applied mathematics, and teach the algorithms 
with  the  theory.  my  text  introduction  to  applied  mathematics is  one  step  in  this 
direction, trying to present advanced calculus as it is actually used. 

we cannot discuss applications and forget statistics. our society produces oceans 
of  data-somebody  has to draw conclusions. to decide if  a new drug works, and if 
oil spills are common or rare, and how often to have a checkup, we  can't just  guess. 
i  am  astounded  that  the  connection  between  smoking and  health  was  hidden  for 
centuries. it was in the data! eventually the statisticians uncovered it. professionals 
can find patterns,  and the rest of  us can understand  (with a little mathematics) what 
has been found. 

one  purpose  in  studying  mathematics  is  to  know  more  about  your  own  life. 
calculus lights up a key  idea: functions. shapes and populations  and heart  signals 
and profits and growth rates, all are given by  functions. they change in time. they 
have  integrals  and  derivatives.  to  understand  and  use  them  is  a  challenge-
mathematics  takes  effort.  a  lot  of  people  have  contributed,  in  whatever way  they 
could-as 
you  and  i  are  doing.  we  may  not  be  newton  or  leibniz  or  gauss  or 
einstein, but we  can share some part  of  what they created. 

16.1  vector spaces and llnear algebra 

599 

16.1  vector spaces and id202 

you have met the idea of  a matrix. an  m by  n matrix a has m rows and n columns 
(it is square if  m = n). it multiplies a vector x that has n components. the result is a 
vector ax  with m components. the central problem of id202 is to go back- 
ward: from ax = bfind x. that is possible when a is square and invertible. otherwise 
there is no solution x-or 
the crucial property  of  id127 is linearity. if  ax = b and  ax = b 
then  a times  x + x  is  b + b.  also  a times  2x  is  2b.  in  general  a  times  cx  is  cb. 
in particular a times 0 is 0 (one vector has n zeros, the other vector has m zeros). the 
.  whole subject develops from linearity. derivatives and integrals obey linearity too. 
question 1  what  are  the  solutions  to  ax = o?  one  solution  is  x = 0.  there 

there are infinitely many. 

may be other solutions and they fill up the "nullspace": 

x = o   011

requires 

when  there are more  unknowns  than  equations-when  a has  more  columns than 
rows-the 
system  ax = 0  has  many  solutions.  they  are  not  scattered  randomly 
around!  another  solution  is  x = 4,  y=  -2,  z  = 6.  this  lies  on  the  same  line  as 
(2,  -1,3) and (0,0,o). always the solutions to ax = 0 form a  "space"  of  vectors- 
which brings us to a central idea of  id202. 
note  these pages are not concentrating on the mechanics of  multiplying or invert- 
ing matrices. those are explained in all courses. my  own teaching emphasizes that 
ax  is  a  combination of  the  columns  of  a.  the  solution  x = a-'b  is  computed  by 
elimination. here we  explain the deeper idea of  a  vector space-and 
especially the 
particular spaces that control ax = 6. i cannot go into the same detail as in my book 
on linear  algebra and its applications, where  examples and  exercises develop the 
new ideas. still these pages can be a useful support. 

all  vectors with  n components lie in n-dimensional space. you  can add them and 
subtract  them  and multiply them  by  any c.  (don't  multiply  two  vectors and  never 
write  llx or  1/a). the results x + x and x - x and cx are still vectors in the space. 
here is the important point: 

the  line of  solutions to  ax = 0 is a  "subspace"-a 

the sum x + x has components 6, -3,9-which 
x - x is a solution, and so is 4x. these operations leave us  in the subspace. 

vector  space in  its  own  right. 
is another solution. the difference 

the  nullspace consists of  all solutions to  ax = 0.  it  may  contain  only  the  zero 
vector  (as in  the  first example). it may  contain  a  line of  vectors (as in  the  second 
example). it may contain a whole plane of  vectors (problem 5). in every case x + x 
and x - x and cx are also in the nullspace. we are assigning a new word to an old 
equation x - 2y = 0 has always been  represented by  a line (its nullspace). 
idea-the 
now  we  have 6-dimensional subspaces of  an %dimensional vector space. 

notice that x2 - y = 0 does not produce a subspace (a parabola instead). even the 
x and y axes together, from xy = 0, do not form a subspace. we go off the axes when 
we  add (1,o) to (0, 1). you might expect the straight line x - 2y = 1 to be a subspace, 
but again it is not so. when x and y are doubled, we  have x - 2y = 2.  then (x, y) 
is on a different line. only ax = 0 is guaranteed to produce a subspace. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

figure  16.1 shows the nullspace  and "row  space."  check dot products  (both zero). 

fig. 16.1  the nullspace  is perpendicular to the rows of  a  (the columns of  at). 

question 2  when  a  multiplies  a  vector  x,  what  subspace  does  ax  lie  in?  the 
the name "column space": 

product ax  is a combination of  the columns of  a-hence 

no choice of x can produce ax = (0,0, 1). for this a, all combinations of the columns 
. the  column  space is like  the  xy  plane  within  xyz  space.  it  is  a 
end  in  a 
subspace of  m-dimensional space, containing every vector b that is a combination of 
the columns: 

the system  ax = b  has a solution exactly  when b is in the column space. 

when  a  has  an  inverse,  the  column  space  is  the  whole  n-dimensional  space.  the 
nullspace  contains only  x = 0.  there  is  exactly  one  solution  x = a 1 b .  this  is  the 
good case-and  we  outline four  more key  topics in id202.

has  dimension  two.  the  nullspace  above contained  all  multiples  of  (2,  - 1, 3)-by 
knowing that "basis  vector"  we know the whole line. the column space was a plane 
containing column  1 and column 2. again those vectors are a "basis"-by  knowing 
the columns we  know the whole column space. 

our 2 by  3 matrix  has three columns: (1,o) and (2, 3) and (0, 1). those are not  a 
basis  for  the  column  space! this  space  is  only  a  plane,  and  three  vectors  are  too 
many.  the dimension is two. by  combining (1,o) and (0, 1) we  can produce the other 
vector (2, 3). there are only two independent columns, and they form a basis for this 
column space. 

in general: when  a subspace contains r  independent  vectors,  and no more, those 
vectors  are a basis and the dimension  is r. "independent"  means that  no vector is a 
combination of the others. in the example, (1,o) and (2, 3) are also a basis. a subspace 
has many bases, just  as a plane has many axes. 

2.  least  squares.  if  ax = b has no solution, we  look for the x that comes closest. 
section  1 1.4 found  the  straight  line nearest  to  a  set  of  points.  we make the  length 
of  ax - b as  small  as possible,  when  zero  length  is  not  possible.  no  vector  solves 

16.1  vector spaces and llnear algebra 

ax = b,  when  b is not in the column space. so b is projected  onto that space. this 
leads to the "normal  equations"  that produce the best x: 

when  a  rectangular  matrix  appears  in  applications,  its  transpose  generally comes 
too. the columns of  a are the  rows of  at. the rows of  a are the columns of  at. 
then   at^  is  square and  symmetric-equal 
to its  transpose and  vital for  applied 
mathematics. 

3.  eigenvalues  (for  square  matrices  only). normally  ax  points  in  a  direction 
different from x. for certain special eigenvectors, ax is parallel to x. here is a 2 by 
2 matrix with two eigenvectors-in  one case ax = 5x and in the other ax = 2x; 

ax=ax: [ 1 4  

3 2   1 
1 

][]=[:]=5[:] 

and  [:  :][-:]=[-:]=2[-:]. 

the multipliers 5 and 2 are the eigenvalues of  a.  an  8 by  8 matrix has eight eigen- 
values, which tell what the matrix is doing (to the eigenvectors). the eigenvectors are 
uncoupled,  and they go their  own way. a system of  equations dyldt = ay  acts like 
one equation-when  y is an eigenvector: 

d ~ i l d t =  3 ~ 1 +  2 ~ 2  
dyddt = yi + 4 ~ 2  

has the solution 

yl = est 
y2 = est 

which is  est [:i. 

the eigenvector is (1, 1). the eigenvalue a = 5 is in the exponent. when you substitute 
y1 and y2 the differential equations become  5est = 5est. the fundamental principle 
for dyldt = cy still works for the system dyldt = ay: look for pure  exponential solu- 
tions. the eigenvalue "lambda"  is the growth rate in the exponent. 

i  have  to  add:  find  the  eigenvectors also.  the  second  eigenvector (2, - 1) has 
eigenvalue i = 2. a second solution is y1 = 2e2', y2 = - e".  substitute those into the 
equation-they 
if  ax = ax 

are even better at displaying the general rule: 

the pure  exponentials are  y = eatx. 

then  d/dt(ehx) = ~ ( e ~ ~ x ) .  

the four entries  of  a pull together  for  the eigenvector. so do the  64 entries  of  an 
8 by  8 matrix-again  e"x  solves the equation. growth or decay is decided by a > 0 
or k  < 0.  when a = k + iw  is a complex number, growth and oscillation combine in 
e ~ t  = e k t e i ~ t  = ekt(cos wt + i sin at). 

subspaces govern  static  problems  ax = b.  eigenvalues and  eigenvectors 
govern  dynamic  problems  dyldt = ay.  look  for  exponentials  y = eux. 

4. determinants and inverse matrices. a 2 by 2 matrix has determinant d = ad - bc. 

this matrix has no inverse if  d = 0. reason:  a-'  divides by d: 

this pattern extends to n by n matrices, but d and a -  l  become more 'complicated. 
for 3 by  3 matrices d has six terms.  section 11.5 identified d as a triple product 
a  (b x c) of  the columns. three events come together in the singular case: d is zero 
and a has no inverse and the columns lie in a plane.  the opposite events produce the 
"nonsingular"  case: d is nonzero and a- ' exists. then ax = b is solved by x = a-  b. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

d  is also the product of  the pivots and the product  of  the eigenvalues. the pivots 
arise in elimination-the  practical way to solve ax = b without a-'.  to find eigen- 
values we turn ax = ax  into ( a - i1)x = 0 .  by a nice twist of  fate, this matrix a - a1 
has d = 0.go back  to the example: 

:]=[j;'  4ia]has  d = ( i - q ( 4 - a ) - 2 = a 2 - 7 a l o .  

[f : ] - a [ :  

the equation a2  - 71.  + 10 = 0 gives 1.  = 5 and a  = 2. the eigenvalues come first, to 
make d = 0.then ( a- 51)x = 0 and (a - 2i)x = 0 yield the eigenvectors. these x's 
go into y = e"x  to solve differential equations-which 

come next.

16.2  differential equations 

we just  solved differential equations by  id202. those were special systems 
dyjdt= ay,  linear  with  constant  coefficients.  the  solutions  were  exponentials, 
involving eu. the eigenvalues of  a  were the "growth  factors"  a. this section solves 
no means all. we  concentrate  on a few  that  have  important 
other equations-by 
applications. 

return for a moment to the beginning-when 

direct integration was king: 

in 1, y(t) is the integral of s(t). in 2, y(t) is the integral of cy(t). that sounds circular- 
it  only made  sense  after the  discovery  of  y = ec'. this exponential  has  the  correct 
derivative cy. to find it by integration instead of inventing it, separate y from t: 

separation and integration also solve 3:j dy/u(y)=5 c(t)dt.the model logistic equation 
has u = y - y2 = quadratic. equation 2 has u = y = linear. equation 1is also a special 
case with u = 1 = constant. but 2 and 1are very different, for the following reason. 
the  compound  interest  equation  y'  = cy  is  growing  from  inside.  the  equation 
y'  = s(t) is growing from outside. where c is a  "growth  rate,"  s is a  "source."  they 
don't  have the same meaning, and they don't  have the same units. the combination 
y'  =cy + s was solved in chapter 6, provided c and s are constant-but 
applications 
force us to go further. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

in three examples we  introduce non-constant source terms. 
example 1  solve dyldt = cy + s with the new source term s = ekt. 
method  substitute y = b@, with an "undetermined coefficient" b to make it right: 

kbek' = cbek' + ekt  yields  b = l/(k - c). 

the source ek'  is the driving term. the solution bekt is the response. the exponent is 
the same! the key idea is to expect ek'  in the response. 
initial condition  to  match  yo  at  t = 0,  the  solution  needs  another  exponential. 
it  is  the free  response  aec',  which  satisfies  dyldt = cy  with  no  source.  to  make 
y = aec' + bek'  agree with yo, choose a = yo - b: 
final solution  y = (yo- b)ec' + bekt = yoect+ (ek' - ec')/(k- c). 
(1) 
exceptional case  b = l/(k - c) grows  larger  as  k  approaches  c.  when  k = c  the 
response  bek'  is  no  longer  correct.  the  solution  (1) 
method  breaks  down-the 
approaches 010, and in the limit we get a derivative. it has an extra factor t: 

ekt  - ect  - change in ect + -
d 
-- 
k - c 
dc 

change in c 

(ect)= tect. 

the correct response is tectwhen k = c. this is the form to substitute, when the driving 
rate k equals the natural  rate c (called resonance). 

add  the free response yoec' to match  the initial condition. 

example 2  solve dyldt = cy + s with the new  source term s = cos kt. 
substitute y = b sin kt + d cos kt. this has two undetermined coefficients b and d: 
(3) 
matching cosines gives kb = cd + 1. the sines give  - kd = cb. algebra gives b, d, y: 

kb cos kt - kd sin kt = c(b sin kt + d cos kt)+ cos kt. 

b=-

c 

k2 + c2 

d=-

k 

k2 + c2 

y= 

c sin kt + k  cos kt

k2+c2 

(4)

question  why  do we  need  both  b sin kt  and  d cos kt  in  the  response to  cos kt? 
first answer  equation (3)is impossible if  we  leave out b or d. 
second answer  cos kt is f eikt+ i e  -"'.  so eiktand e -"' are both  in the response. 
example 3  solve dyldt = cy + s with the new source term s = tekt. 
method  look  for  y = ~ e ~ '+ dtek'.  problem 13 determines  b and  d.  add  aec'  as 
needed, to match the initial value yo. 

second-order equations 

the equation dyldt = cy is jrst-order.  the equation d2y/dt2= - cy is second-order. 
the first is typical of problems in life sciences and economics-the 
rate dyldt depends 
on the present situation y. the second is typical of engineering and physical sciences- 
the acceleration d2y/dt2enters the equation. 

if  you put money in a bank, it starts growing immediately. if  you turn the wheels 
of  a  car,  it  changes direction  gradually.  the  path  is  a  curve, not  a  sharp corner. 
newton's  law is f = ma, not f = mu. 

16.2  differential equations 

a mathematician compares a straight line to a parabola. the straight line crosses 
the  x  axis  no  more  than  once.  the  parabola  can  cross  twice.  the  equation 
ax2+ bx + c = 0 has two solutions, provided we  allow them to be complex or equal. 
these  are  exactly  the  possibilities  we  face  below:  two  real  solutions,  two  complex 
solutions, or one solution that counts twice.  the quadratic could be x2 - 1 or x2 + 1 
or x2. the roots are 1 and  -1, i and  -i, 0 and 0. 

in  solving diflerential equations the roots appear in the exponent, and are called a. 

example 4  y" = +y:  solutions  y = et 
example 5  y" = 0 y:  solutions  y = 1 
example 6  y" = -y: 

a  = 1,  -1 
iz = 0,0 
solutions  y = cos t  and  y = sin t  a =   i,  -i 

and  y = e-' 
and  y = t 

where  are  the  complex  solutions? they  are  hidden  in  example 6,  which  could  be 
written y = eit and y = e-".  these satisfy y" = - y since i2 = - 1. the use of sines and 
cosines avoids the imaginary number i, but it breaks the pattern of  e". 

example 5 also seems to break the pattern-again 

eu is hidden. the solution y = 1 
is eo'. the other solution y = t is teot. the zero exponent is repeated-another  excep-
tional case that needs an extra factor t. 
exponentials solve every equation with constant coeficients  and zero right hand side: 

to solve  ay" + by' + cy = 0  substitute  y = e" 

and find  a. 

this method has three steps, leading to the right exponents a  = r and a =   s: 

1.  with y = eu the equation is aa2ee" + bae"  + ceat= 0. cancel e". 
2.  solve aa2 + ba  + c = 0. factor or use the formula a = (- b f jbi-rlac)/2a. 
3.  call those roots a  = r and a= s. the complete solution is y = aert+ best. 

the pure  exponentials are  y = er'  and  y = e".  depending on  r  and  s,  they  grow  or 
decay  or  oscillate. they  are combined  with  constants  a and  b to  match  the  two 
conditions at  t = 0. the initial state yo equals a + b.  the  initial velocity yb  equals 
ra + sb (the derivative at t = 0). 
example 7  solve y" - 3y' + 2y = 0 with yo = 5 and yb  = 4. 
step 1 substitutes y = e".  the equation becomes i2e" - 3ae"  + 2e"  = 0. cancel e". 
step 2 solves 1.'  - 31. + 2 = 0. factor into (a -1)(a-2) = 0. the exponents r, s are 1,2. 
step 3 produces y = aet + ~ e ~ ' .the initial conditions give a + b = 5 and 1 a + 2b = 4. 
the constants are a = 6 and b = - 1. the solution is y = 6et - elt. 
this solution grows  because  there is  a  positive  a. the equation  is  "unstable."  it 
becomes stable when  the middle term  -3y'  is changed to  + 3y'.  when the damping 
is positive  the solution decays. the 1's are negative: 
example 8  (a2+ 31 + 2) factors into (1 + 1)(1+ 2). the exponents are  -1 and  -2. 
the solution is y = ae-' + be-2t. it decays to zero for any initial condition. 
examples 9-10  solve y" + 2y' + 2y = 0 and y" + 2y' + y = 0. how do they differ? 
key difference  a2 + 2a  + 2 has complex roots, l2 + 23, + 1 has a repeated root: 
( 1 + 1 ) ~ = 0   gives  a=-1,-1. 

a 2 + 2 1 + 2 = 0   gives  a = - 1 + i  

the  -1 in all these r's  means decay. the i means oscillation. the first exponential 
is e(- i+ i)t ,which splits into e-'  (decay) times eit (oscillation). even better, change eit 

16  mathematics after calculus 

and e-"  into cosines and sines: 

= ae(-1 +i)t  + ge(-1-i)t  = e-'(a  cos t + b sin  t). 

(5) 

at  t = 0 this produces yo = a. then matching yb  leads to b. 

example 10 has  r = s = - 1 (repeated root).  one  solution  is  e-'  as  usual.  the 
second solution cannot be another e-'.  problem 21 shows that it is te-'-again 
the 
exceptional case multiplies by  t!  the general solution is y = ae-' + bte-'. 
without the damping term 2yf, these examples are y" + 2y = 0 or y" + y = 0-pure 

oscillation. a small amount of  damping mixes oscillation and decay. large damping 
gives  pure  decay. the  borderline  is  when  a  is  repeated  (r = s).  that  occurs when 
b2 - 4ac in  the  square root  is  zero.  the borderline between  two real roots and  two 
complex roots is two repeated roots. 

the method of solution comes down to one idea: substitute y = eu. the equations 
apply to mechanical vibrations  and  electrical circuits (also other things, but  those 
two are of  prime importance). while describing these applications i will  collect the 
information that comes from a. 

springs and  circuits: mechanical and  electrical engineering 

a mass is hanging from a spring. we pull it down an extra distance yo and give it a 
starting velocity yb. the mass moves up or down, obeying newton's  law: mass times 
acceleration equals spring force p lus damping force: 

my" = - ky - dy' 

or 

my" + dy' + ky = 0. 

(6) 

this  is free  oscillation. the  spring force  -ky  is  proportional  to  the  stretching y 
(hooke's  law). the damping acts like a  shock  absorber  or air resistance-it 
takes 
out energy. whether the system goes directly toward zero or swings back  and forth 
is decided by the three numbers m, d, k.  they were previously called a, b, c. 

16a  the  solutions  e"  to  my" + dy' + ky = 0  are  controlled  by  the  roots  of 
ma2 + d l  + k = 0.  with  d > 0 there  is damping  and  decay. from  j62-4mk 
there may be oscillation: 

overdamping:  d  > 4mk gives real roots and pure decay  (example 8) 
underdamping:  d  < 4mk gives complex roots and oscillation (example 9) 
i  critical damping:  d2 = 4mk gives a real repeated root  -d/2m  (example 10) 
we are using letters when  the examples had numbers, but the results are the same: 

m i 2 + d 1 + k = 0   hasroots 

d

overdamping has no imaginary parts or oscillations: y = ae" + bes'. critical damping 
has r = s and an exceptional solution with an extra t: y = ae"  + bte".  (this is only a 
solution when  r = s.) underdamping has decay from  -d/2m and oscillation from the 
imaginary part.  an  undamped spring (d = 0) has pure oscillation at the natural fre- 
quency wo = jklm. 
an these possibilities are in figure 16.2, created by  alar toomre. at the top is pure 
oscillation (d = 0 and  y = cos 2t).  the equation  is y" + dy' + 4y = 0 and d starts to 
grow. when d  reaches 4, the quadratic is a2 + 41 + 4 or (1 + 2)2. the repeated root

yields  e-2t and te-2t. after that the  oscillation  is gone.  there  is  a smooth  transition
from one case  to the next-as  complex  roots join  in the repeated  root and  split into
real  roots.

at  the  bottom right,  the  final value  y(27n)  increases  with  large  damping.  this  was
'  and  - 8.
a  surprise.  at d = 5  the  roots  are  -1  and  - 4. at  d =  8.5  the  roots  are  -
the  small  root  gives  slow  decay  (like  molasses).  as  d -+  oo  the solution approaches
y=  1.

if we  are serious  about  using mathematics,  we  should take advantage  of anything
that  helps.  for  second-order  equations,  the  formulas look  clumsy  but  the examples
are  quite  neat.  the  idea  of e"' is  absolutely  basic.  the  good  thing is  that  electrical
circuits  satisfy  the  same  eqution.  there  is  a  beautiful  analogy  between  springs  and
circuits:

mass  m  , inductance  l

1/(capacitance  c)

the  resistor  takes  out  energy  as  the  shock  absorber  did-converting  into  heat  by

particular solutions-the  method of undetermined coefficients 

the  forcing  term  is  a  multiple  of  cos wt.  the  "particular solution"  is  a  multiple 
of  cos o t  plus  a  multble  of  sin wt.  to  discover  the  undetermined  coefficients  in 
y = a cos cot + b sin cot, substitute into the differential equation (8): 

-lw2(a cos wt + b sin ot) + rw(-  a sin wt + b cos wt) 

+ (a cos wt + b sin wt)/c = vw  cos wt. 

-a h 2+ brw + a/c = vw 

the terms in cos wt and the terms in sin o t  give two equations for a and b: 
-b ~ w ~- arw + blc = 0. 

(9) 
example 11  solve y" + y = cos ot. the oscillations are forced  at frequency w. the 
oscillations are free  (y" + y = 0) at frequency  1. the solution contains both.

becomes 

and 

- a w 2 + o + a =   1 

and 

-bo2-o+b=o. 

the second equation gives b = 0. no sines are needed because the problem has no 
dyldt. the first equation gives a = 1/(1- w2), which multiplies the cosine: 

y = (cos wt)/(1 - w2)  solves  y" + y = cos wt. 

general solution  add  to this particular  solution any solution to y" + y = 0: 

(10) 

problem of resonance  when  the  driving  frequency  is  o = 1,  the  solution  (1 1) 
becomes  meaningless-its 
denominator is  zero.  reason: the  natural  frequency  in 
cos t and sin t is also  1. a new  particular  solution comes from t cos t and t sin t. 

the key  to success is to know the form for y.  the table displays four right hand 

sides and the correct y's  for any constant-coefficient equation: 

right  hand side 
ekt 
cos wt  or  sin o t  
polynomial in  t 
ektcos wt  or  ekt sin wt 

particular solution 
y = bek' (same exponent) 
y = a cos a t  + b sin wt (include both) 
y = polynomial of  the same degree 
y = aekt cos wt + bekt sin wt 

if  one of  the roots a for free oscillation equals k or ico  or 0 or k + iw, the 
exception 
corresponding y in the table is wrong. the proposed solution would give zero on the 
right hand  side. the correct form for y includes an extra  t. all  particular  solutions 
are computed by  substituting into the differential equation. 

apology  constant-coefficient equations hardly use calculus (only e"). they reduce 
directly to algebra (substitute y, solve for iland a and b). i find the s-curve from the 
logistic equation much more remarkable. the nonlinearity of epidemics or heartbeats 
or earthquakes demands all the calculus we know. the solution is not so predictable. 
the extreme of  unpredictability came when  lorenz studied weather prediction and 
discovered chaos. 

numerical methods 


those four pages explained how to solve linear equations with constant coefficients: 
substitute  y = eat.  the  list  of  special  solutions  becomes  longer  in  a  course  on 
differential equations.  but  for most  nonlinear  problems we  enter  another  world- 
where solutions are numerical and approximate, not exact. 

in actual practice, numerical methods for dyldt =f (t, y) divide in two groups: 
1.  single-step methods like euler and runge-kutta 
2.  multistep methods like adams-bashforth 

the unknown y and the right side f can be vectors with n components. the notation 
stays the  same: the step is at = h,  the time t,  is  nh,  and y,  is the  approximation to 
the true y at that time. we test the first step, to find y,  from yo = 1. the equation is 
dyldt = y,  so the right side is f = y and the true solution is y = et. 

notice how the first value off  (in this case  1) is used inside the second f: 

test 

y,  = 1 + +h[l+ (1 + h)] = 1 + h + $h2 

at  time  h  the  true  solution  equals  eh. its  infinite  series  is  correct  through  h2 
for  improved  euler  (a  second-order  method).  the  ordinary  euler  method 
yn+ = yn+ hf  (t,, y,) 
is  first-order.  test:  y,  = 1+ h.  now  try  runge-kutta 
(a fourth-order  method): 

now the first value off  is used in the second (for k,),  the second is used in the third, 
and then k3 is used in k,.  the programming is easy. check the accuracy with another 
test on dyldt = y: 

=1+ h + -+ -+ -. 
h2  h3  h4 
2 
24

this answer agrees with eh through h4. 

these formulas are included in  the book  so that you can apply them directly- 

for  example  to  see  the  s-shape  from  the  logistic  equation  with  f =  cy - by2. 
multistep formulas are simpler and quicker, but they need a single-step method to 
get  started. here is y,  in a fourth-order  formula that needs yo, y,, y,,  y,.  just  shift 
all indices for y,,  y,,  and y,  + ,: 

multistep  y4 = y3 + -[55yi - 59y;  + 37y;  - 9ybl.

h 
24 

the  advantage  is  that  each  step  needs  only  one  new  evaluation  of  y;  =f(t,,  y,). 
runge-kutta  needs four evaluations for the same accuracy. 

stability is the key requirement for any method. now the good test is y'  = - y. the 
solution should decay and  not  blow  up.  section 6.6  showed  how  a  large  time  step 
makes euler's  method unstable-the 
same will happen  for more accurate formulas. 
the  price  of  total  stability  is  an  "implicit  method"  like  y,  = yo + + h ( ~ b+ y;), 
where the unknown y,  appears also in y; . there is an equation to be solved at every 
step. calculus is ending as it started-with 

the methods of  isaac newton.

discrete mathematics: algorithms 

discrete mathematics is not like calculus. everything  isfinite. i can start with the 50 
states of  the  u.s.  i  ask  if  maine  is  connected to  california,  by  a  path  through 
neighboring states. you  say yes. i ask for the shortest path (fewest states on the way). 
you get a map and try all possibilities (not really all-but  your answer is right). then 
i close all boundaries between  states like illinois and indiana, because one has an 
even number of  letters and the other has an odd number. is new  york still connected 
to washington? you  ask what kind of  game this is-but 

i hope you will read on. 

far from being dumb, or easy, or useless, discrete mathematics asks good questions. 
it is important to know the fastest way  across the country. it is more important to 
know the fastest way through a phone network. when you call long distance, a quick 
connection has to be found. some lines are tied up, like illinois to indiana, and there 
is no way to try every route. 

the example connects new  york  to new  jersey (7 letters and 9). washington is 
'  connected to oregon (10 letters and 6). as  you read those words, your mind jumps 
is no path from new  york with  7 letters to washington with  10. 
to this fact-there 
somewhere you  must  get  stuck. there might  be  a path  between  all states with  an 
odd number of  letters-i  doubt it. id207 gives a way  to find out. 

graphs 

a  model  for  a  large part  of  finite mathematics is  a graph.  it  is  not  the  graph  of 
y =f(x). the word "graph"  is used in a totally different way, for a collection of nodes 
and edges. the nodes are like the 50 states. the edges go  between  two nodes-the 
neighboring states. a network of computers fits this model. so do the airline connec- 
tions between cities. a pair of  cities may or may not have an edge between them- 
depending on flight schedules. the model is determined by  v and e. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

definition  a graph is a set  v of  nodes (or vertices) and a set e  of  edges. 

example 1  how many edges are possible with n nodes, in a complete graph? 

the first node has edges to the n - 1 other nodes. (an edge to itself is not allowed.) 
the second node has n - 2 new edges. the third node has another n - 3.  the total 
count of  edges, when none are missing, is the sum from section 5.3: 

1 + 2 + --- + (n - 1) = in(n - 1)  edges in a complete graph. 

fifty states have 25 -49 = 1225 possible edges. the "neighboring states graph"  has 
less than 200. a line of  6 nodes has 5 edges, out of 4  6  5 = 15 possible. 

example 2  which  states with  an odd  number of  letters are reachable from new 
york? boundaries to states like pennsylvania (12 letters) are closed. 

method of  solution  start from new york (7). there is an edge to connecticut (1 1). 
that touches massachusetts (13), which is a neighbor of  vermont (7). but we missed 
rhode island, and how do we  get back? the order depends on  our search method- 
and two methods are specially important. 

depth fist  search (dfs) "from  the current  state, go to one new  state if  possible." 
but  what  do we  do from vermont, when  new  hampshire (12) is not allowed? the 
answer is: backtrack to massachusetts. that becomes the next current state. 

we label every state as we  reach it, to show which state we  came from. then vt 
has the label ma, and we easily cross back. from ma we go to ri. then backtrack 
to  ma  and  ct and  ny.  at  every step i searched for a  new  state with  no success. 
from ny we  see nj (9). finally we  are in a corner. 

the depth first search is ended, by a barrier of even states. unless we allow ontario 

and  keep  going to  minnesota. 

breadthfist search (bfs) "from  the current state, add all possible new states to the 
bottom of  the list. but take the next current state from the top of  the list."  there is 
no need to backtrack. 

from ny we  reach vt and ma and ct and nj. what comes next? 
where dfs moves  from the  last  possible state, breadth  first  search moves from 
thefirst possible state. no move from vt is possible-so  we  "scan"  from massachu- 
setts. we see rhode island (barely). that ends bfs. 

the same six states are reached both ways. only the order is different. dfs is last 
in-&st  out. bfs is fist  in-fist out. you  have the same choice in drawing a family 
tree-follow 
a path  as far as it goes and backtrack,  or list  all brothers  and sisters 
before their children. the bfs graph in figure 16.3 is a tree. so is the dfs graph, 
using forward edges only.

fig. 16.3  search trees from new  york. the minimum spanning tree. 

16.3  discrete mathematics: algorithms 

definition  a tree is a connected graph with no loops. its n  nodes are connected 
by  n - 1 edges. if  n = n,  so every node is in the tree, it is a spanning tree. 

the path from va  to ky to tn to nc to va  is a loop (or cycle). if  one of  those four 
edges is  removed, we  have  a  tree. if  two edges are removed,  we  have  two  trees (a 
small forest). 

.411ow  an edge between neighboring states only when  one state is even 

example 3 
and the other is odd. are the lower 48 states connected? 
start anywhere-say  california. apply either type  of  search-maybe  dfs. go to 
arizona  (7) then  utah  (4) then  wy  (9) then  co (8) then  nm  then  ok then  tx. 
(i am writing this on an airplane, looking at the map.) we will never get to florida! 
it is blocked by  alabama and georgia. 

the search creates a tree, but not a spanning tree. this graph is not connected. 
an  odd-to-even graph is special and important. it is called "bipartite," meaning 
two parts. the odd states are in one part, the even states are in the other. all  edges 
go between parts. no edges are within a part.? 

example 4  is  there  a  "complete matching"  between  25  even  and  25  odd  states? 
this requires neighboring states to be  paired off  (with no repetition). 
method 1  start pairing them  or ca-az,  ut-wy,  nv-id,  ne-sd,  wa-mt. 
what about oregon? maybe it should have been paired with  idaho. then nevada 
could pair with arizona. trial and error goes nowhere fast. 
method 2  think first. the four states ca-or-wa-nv  are even. this whole group 
is only connected to three odd states (az, id, mt). the matching is impossible. 

this is hall's theorem. in a course on graphs, it would be proved. our purpose here 
is to see the ideas and questions in discrete mathematics, more than the proofs. 

the  greedy algorithm 

put  back  all  edges  between  neighboring states. the  nodes  could  be  provinces  of 
canada or states of  australia. if  they are countries of  europe-asia-africa 
(or the 
americas), we  need a new map. the essential thing is the new problem. 

in  a network each edge has a "length." a positive number cij is assigned to the edge 
from node i to node j. in an economics problem, cij is the cost. in a flow problem it 
is the capacity, in  an electrical circuit it is the conductance. we  look for paths that 
minimize these "lengths." 

problem  find  the  minimum spanning  tree. connect all nodes by  a  tree with  the 
smallest possible total length. 
the six cheapest highways connecting seven cities form a minimum spanning tree. it 
is cheapest to build, not cheapest to drive-you  have to follow the tree. where there 

texactly half the states have an even number of letters (a real trivia question). this is the little- 
known reason for admitting alaska and hawaii. 

16  mathematics after calculus 

is no edge we  set cij = go  (or an extremely large value, in an actual code). then the 
n(n - 1)/2 edges are allowed. how 
algorithm works  with  a  complete network-all 
does it find the minimum spanning tree in figure 16.3c? 
method 1  always add the shortest edge that goes out from  the current tree. 
starting from node s, this rule chooses edges of  length  1,2, 7,4, 3. now  it  skips 5, 
which would close a loop. it chooses 6, for total length 23. 

method 2  add  edges in  order, from  shortest to longest. reject an edge that closes a 
loop. several trees grow together (a forest). at the end we have a minimum spanning 
tree. 
this  variation  chooses edge lengths in  the order  1,2,3,4,6 (rejecting 5), 7.  in our 
network  both methods produce the same tree. when many edges have equal length, 
there can be many shortest trees. 

these methods are examples of  the greedy algorithm: do  the best thing at every 
step. don't look ahead. stick to a decision once it is made. in most network problems 
the greedy algorithm is not optimal-in 

this spanning tree problem it is. 

method 2 looks faster than method  1. sort the edges by  length, and go down the 

list. just  avoid loops. but sorting takes  time!  it is a fascinating problem  in itself- 
bubble  sort  or insertion  sort  or heapsort.  we go on to a  final example of  discrete 
mathematics and its algorithms. 

problem  find the shortest path from  the source node s to each other node. 
the shortest path may not go along the minimum spanning tree. in  the figure, the 
best path going east has length  1 + 8. there is a new shortest path tree, in which the 
source plays a special role as the "root." 

how do we  find shortest paths?  listing all possibilities is more  or less insane.  a 
good  algorithm  builds  out from  the  source,  selecting one  new  edge at every  step. 
after k  steps we know the distances dl, ...,d,  to the k nearest nodes. 
algorithm:  minimize di + cij over all settled nodes i and all remaining nodes j. 
the best new node j is a distance cij from a settled node, which is a distance di from 
the source. in the example network, the first edges are 1,2,7. next is 8. the northeast 
node is closest to the source at this step. the final tree does not use edges 3, 5,6- 
even though they are short. 

these pages were written to show you the algorithmic part of  discrete mathematics. 
the  other  part  is  algebra-permutations, 
partitions,  groups,  counting  problems, 
generating functions. there is no calculus, but that's  fair. the rest of  the book  was 
written  to show what calculus can do-i  hope very much that you enjoyed it. 

thank you for reading, and thinking,  and working.

1  start from one node of  a hexagon (six nodes,  six edges). 
number the other nodes by (a) breadth first search (b) depth 
first search. 
2  draw  two  squares  with  one  node  in  common  (7-node 
graph). from that node number all others by dfs and bfs. 
indicate backtracks. 

3  how many spanning trees in the hexagon graph? 
4  draw a spanning tree in the two-square graph. how many 
spanning trees does it have? 

5  define a connected graph.  if  a graph  has  7 edges and 9 
nodes, prove that it is not connected. 
6  define a  loop.  if  a  connected graph  has  8 edges and  9 
nodes, prove that it has no loops. 
7  find the shortest path (minimum number of  edges) from 
maine to california. 

8  which state is farthest (how many edges are needed) from 
the state you are in? why would it come last in bfs? 

9  list  the  steps  of  bfs  from  your  state  to  georgia  or 
colorado or new jersey. (there are edges hawaii-california 
and alaska- washington.) 

10  with edges between  odd neighboring states and between 
even  neighbors, what  is  the  largest connected set  of  states? 
map required. 

11 with edges only from odd to even neighbors, how many 
states can be matched? (answer unknown to author-please 
advise.) 

12  a matching is  a  forest  of  two-node trees.  give  another 
description. 

13  find the minimum spanning tree for network a. 

14  find the shortest path tree from the center of  network a. 
15  is there a complete matching between left and right nodes 
in  graph  b?  if  not,  which  group  of  nodes  has  too  few 
connections? 

16  find the loop in network b.  then find a minimum span- 
ning tree by  method 1 and method 2. 
17  how many spanning trees in graph b?  it has one loop. 
18  show  that  a  graph  cannot  have  o,1,2,3,  and  4  edges 
going into its five nodes. 
19  if  the only edges into a  node have lengths 6 and  8, can 
they both be in a minimum spanning tree? 
20  in problem 19, prove that a minimum spanning tree con- 
tains edge (6) if  it contains edge (8). 
21  true or false,  with reason or example. 

(a) in  a  complete network,  the  minimum  spanning  tree 
contains the n - 1 shortest edges. 
(b) if  a graph has 9 nodes and 9 edges, it has a loop. 
(c) a graph with a complete matching must be connected. 

22  draw a tree that is perfect for (a) dfs; (b) bfs. 
23  the adjacency matrix has aij = 1 if  there is an edge from 
node i to node j. write down this matrix for graphs a and b. 
24  in a complete network start with  dij =cij. show that the 
dij at the end of  this program  are shortest distances: 

for  i = l  to n d o  
for j = 1 to n do 
for k = 1 to n do 
dij=max(dij, dik +dkj) 
25  how many spanning trees in graph  a? 
26  a  maximum  spanning  tree  has  greatest  possible  length. 
give an algorithm to find it. 
27  write a code that will find a spanning tree (or stop), given 
a list of edges like (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 7), ....
