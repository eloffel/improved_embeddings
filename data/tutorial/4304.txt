this is a book on id202 and matrix theory. while it is self contained, it will work
best for those who have already had some exposure to id202. it is also assumed that
the reader has had calculus. some optional topics require more analysis than this, however.
i think that the subject of id202 is likely the most signi   cant topic discussed in
undergraduate mathematics courses. part of the reason for this is its usefulness in unifying
so many di   erent topics. id202 is essential in analysis, applied math, and even in
theoretical mathematics. this is the point of view of this book, more than a presentation
of id202 for its own sake. this is why there are numerous applications, some fairly
unusual.

this book features an ugly, elementary, and complete treatment of determinants early
in the book. thus it might be considered as id202 done wrong. i have done this
because of the usefulness of determinants. however, all major topics are also presented in
an alternative manner which is independent of determinants.

the book has an introduction to various numerical methods used in id202.
this is done because of the interesting nature of these methods. the presentation here
emphasizes the reasons why they work.
it does not discuss many important numerical
considerations necessary to use the methods e   ectively. these considerations are found in
numerical analysis texts.
in the exercises, you may occasionally see     at the beginning. this means you ought to
have a look at the exercise above it. some exercises develop a topic sequentially. there are
also a few exercises which appear more than once in the book. i have done this deliberately
because i think that these illustrate exceptionally important topics and because some people
don   t read the whole book from start to    nish but instead jump in to the middle somewhere.
there is one on a theorem of sylvester which appears no fewer than 3 times. then it is also
proved in the text. there are multiple proofs of the cayley hamilton theorem, some in the
exercises. some exercises also are included for the sake of emphasizing something which has
been done in the preceding chapter.

1.1 sets and set notation
a set is just a collection of things called elements. for example {1, 2, 3, 8} would be a set
consisting of the elements 1,2,3, and 8. to indicate that 3 is an element of {1, 2, 3, 8} , it is
customary to write 3     {1, 2, 3, 8} . 9 /    {1, 2, 3, 8} means 9 is not an element of {1, 2, 3, 8} .
sometimes a rule speci   es a set. for example you could specify a set as all integers larger
than 2. this would be written as s = {x     z : x > 2} . this notation says: the set of all
integers, x, such that x > 2.
if a and b are sets with the property that every element of a is an element of b, then a is
a subset of b. for example, {1, 2, 3, 8} is a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} , in symbols, {1, 2, 3, 8}    
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} . it is sometimes said that    a is contained in b    or even    b contains a   .
the same statement about the two sets may also be written as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}     {1, 2, 3, 8}.
the union of two sets is the set consisting of everything which is an element of at least
one of the sets, a or b. as an example of the union of two sets {1, 2, 3, 8}     {3, 4, 7, 8} =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} because these numbers are those which are in at least one of the two sets. in
general

a     b     {x : x     a or x     b} .

be sure you understand that something which is in both a and b is in the union. it is not
an exclusive or.
the intersection of two sets, a and b consists of everything which is in both of the sets.
thus {1, 2, 3, 8}     {3, 4, 7, 8} = {3, 8} because 3 and 8 are those elements the two sets have
in common. in general,

a     b     {x : x     a and x     b} .

the symbol [a, b] where a and b are real numbers, denotes the set of real numbers x,
such that a     x     b and [a, b) denotes the set of real numbers such that a     x < b. (a, b)
consists of the set of real numbers x such that a < x < b and (a, b] indicates the set of
numbers x such that a < x     b. [a,   ) means the set of all numbers x such that x     a and
(      , a] means the set of all real numbers which are less than or equal to a. these sorts of
sets of real numbers are called intervals. the two points a and b are called endpoints of the
interval. other intervals such as (      , b) are de   ned by analogy to what was just explained.
in general, the curved parenthesis indicates the end point it sits next to is not included
while the square parenthesis indicates this end point is included. the reason that there
will always be a curved parenthesis next to     or        is that these are not real numbers.
therefore, they cannot be included in any set of real numbers.
a special set which needs to be given a name is the empty set also called the null set,
denoted by    . thus     is de   ned as the set which has no elements in it. mathematicians like
to say the empty set is a subset of every set. the reason they say this is that if it were not

11

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation12
so, there would have to exist a set a, such that     has something in it which is not in a.
however,     has nothing in it and so the least intellectual discomfort is achieved by saying
        a.
if a and b are two sets, a \ b denotes the set of things which are in a but not in b.

preliminaries

thus

a \ b     {x     a : x /    b} .

set notation is used whenever convenient.

1.2 functions

the concept of a function is that of something which gives a unique output for a given input.

de   nition 1.2.1 consider two sets, d and r along with a rule which assigns a unique
element of r to every element of d. this rule is called a function and it is denoted by a
letter such as f. given x     d, f (x) is the name of the thing in r which results from doing
f to x. then d is called the domain of f. in order to specify that d pertains to f , the
notation d (f ) may be used. the set r is sometimes called the range of f. these days it
is referred to as the codomain. the set of all elements of r which are of the form f (x)
for some x     d is therefore, a subset of r. this is sometimes referred to as the image of
f . when this set equals r, the function f is said to be onto, also surjective. if whenever
x   = y it follows f (x)   = f (y), the function is called one to one.
, also injective it is
common notation to write f : d 7    r to denote the situation just described in this de   nition
where f is a function de   ned on a domain d which has values in a codomain r. sometimes
you may also see something like d

f7    r to denote the same thing.

1.3 the number line and algebra of the real num-

bers

next, consider the real numbers, denoted by r, as a line extending in   nitely far in both
directions. in this book, the notation,     indicates something is being de   ned. thus the
integers are de   ned as

z    {           1, 0, 1,      } ,

the natural numbers,

and the rational numbers, de   ned as the numbers which are the quotient of two integers.

n     {1, 2,      }

}
such that m, n     z, n   = 0

13

the following algebra properties, listed here as a collection of assertions called axioms. these
properties will not be proved which is why they are called axioms rather than theorems. in
general, axioms are statements which are regarded as true. often these are things which
are    self evident    either from experience or from some sort of intuition but this does not
have to be the case.

axiom 1.3.1 x + y = y + x, (commutative law for addition)

axiom 1.3.2 x + 0 = x, (additive identity).
axiom 1.3.3 for each x     r, there exists    x     r such that x + (   x) = 0, (existence of
additive inverse).

axiom 1.3.4 (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) , (associative law for addition).

axiom 1.3.5 xy = yx, (commutative law for multiplication).

axiom 1.3.6 (xy) z = x (yz) , (associative law for multiplication).

axiom 1.3.7 1x = x, (multiplicative identity).
axiom 1.3.8 for each x   = 0, there exists x
tive inverse).

axiom 1.3.9 x (y + z) = xy + xz.(distributive law).

(

)

these axioms are known as the    eld axioms and any set (there are many others besides
r) which has two such operations satisfying the above axioms is called a    eld. division and
subtraction are de   ned in the usual way by x     y     x + (   y) and x/y     x

   1

y

.

here is a little proposition which derives some familiar facts.

proposition 1.3.10 0 and 1 are unique. also    x is unique and x
more, 0x = x0 = 0 and    x = (   1) x.

proof: suppose 0

   

is another additive identity. then

   1 is unique. further-

   
thus 0 is unique. say 1

is another multiplicative identity. then

   
0

   

= 0

+ 0 = 0.

   
1 = 1

   
1 = 1

.

now suppose y acts like the additive inverse of x. then

   x = (   x) + 0 = (   x) + (x + y) = (   x + x) + y = y

finally,

and so

0x = (0 + 0) x = 0x + 0x

0 =     (0x) + 0x =     (0x) + (0x + 0x) = (    (0x) + 0x) + 0x = 0x

finally

x + (   1) x = (1 + (   1)) x = 0x = 0
and so by uniqueness of the additive inverse, (   1) x =    x. (cid:4)

preliminaries

1.4 ordered    elds
the real numbers r are an example of an ordered    eld. more generally, here is a de   nition.

de   nition 1.4.1 let f be a    eld. it is an ordered    eld if there exists an order, < which
satis   es

1. for any x   = y, either x < y or y < x.

2. if x < y and either z < w or z = w, then, x + z < y + w.

3. if 0 < x, 0 < y, then xy > 0.

with this de   nition, the familiar properties of order can be proved. the following
proposition lists many of these familiar properties. the relation    a > b    has the same
meaning as    b < a   .

proposition 1.4.2 the following are obtained.

1. if x < y and y < z, then x < z.

2. if x > 0 and y > 0, then x + y > 0.
3. if x > 0, then    x < 0.
4. if x   = 0, either x or    x is > 0.
5. if x < y, then    x >    y.
6. if x   = 0, then x2 > 0.

7. if 0 < x < y then x

   1 > y

   1.

proof: first consider 1, called the transitive law. suppose that x < y and y < z. then

from the axioms, x + y < y + z and so, adding    y to both sides, it follows

x < z

next consider 2. suppose x > 0 and y > 0. then from 2,

0 = 0 + 0 < x + y.

next consider 3. it is assumed x > 0 so

0 =    x + x > 0 + (   x) =    x

now consider 4. if x < 0, then

0 = x + (   x) < 0 + (   x) =    x.

consider the 5. since x < y, it follows from 2

0 = x + (   x) < y + (   x)

and so by 4 and proposition 1.3.10,

(   1) (y + (   x)) < 0

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation1.5. the complex numbers
also from proposition 1.3.10 (   1) (   x) =     (   x) = x and so

15

hence

   y + x < 0.

   y <    x.

consider 6. if x > 0, there is nothing to show. it follows from the de   nition. if x < 0,

then by 4,    x > 0 and so by proposition 1.3.10 and the de   nition of the order,

(   x)2 = (   1) (   1) x2 > 0

by this proposition again, (   1) (   1) =     (   1) = 1 and so x2 > 0 as claimed. note that
1 > 0 because it equals 12.
   1 > 0 and so
x (   1) x

   1 = (   1) 1 =    1 > 0. however, this would require

   1 < 0, it would follow (   1) x

finally, consider 7. first, if x > 0 then if x

from what was just shown. therefore, x
and so multiplying by x

   1,

0 > 1 = 12 > 0
   1 > 0. now the assumption implies y + (   1) x > 0

   1 + (   1) xx

   1 = yx

   1 + (   1) > 0

yx

now multiply by y

   1, which by the above satis   es y

   1 > 0, to obtain

   1 + (   1) y
x

   1 > 0

and so

   1 > y
x

   1. (cid:4)

in an ordered    eld the symbols     and     have the usual meanings. thus a     b means

a < b or else a = b, etc.

1.5 the complex numbers

just as a real number should be considered as a point on the line, a complex number is
considered a point in the plane which can be identi   ed in the usual way using the cartesian
coordinates of the point. thus (a, b) identi   es a point whose x coordinate is a and whose
y coordinate is b. in dealing with complex numbers, such a point is written as a + ib and
multiplication and addition are de   ned in the most obvious way subject to the convention
that i2 =    1. thus,

(a + ib) + (c + id) = (a + c) + i (b + d)

and

(a + ib) (c + id) = ac + iad + ibc + i2bd

= (ac     bd) + i (bc + ad) .

every non zero complex number, a+ib, with a2 +b2   = 0, has a unique multiplicative inverse.

you should prove the following theorem.

preliminaries

theorem 1.5.1 the complex numbers with multiplication and addition de   ned as above

complex number can be written in the form

(

now

this is called the polar form of the complex number.

the    eld of complex numbers is denoted as c. an important construction regarding
complex numbers is the complex conjugate denoted by a horizontal line above the number.
it is de   ned as follows.

what it does is re   ect a given complex number across the x axis. algebraically, the following
formula is easy to obtain.

de   nition 1.5.2 de   ne the absolute value of a complex number as follows.

x + iy = r (cos    + i sin   )

a + ib     a     ib.

(

(a + ib) = a2 + b2.

   

|a + ib|    

a2 + b2.

thus, denoting by z the complex number, z = a + ib,
|z| = (zz)1/2 .

with this de   nition, it is important to note the following. be sure to verify this. it is

   
not too hard but you need to do it.
remark 1.5.3 : let z = a + ib and w = c + id. then |z     w| =
(a     c)2 + (b     d)2. thus
the distance between the point in the plane determined by the ordered pair, (a, b) and the
ordered pair (c, d) equals |z     w| where z and w are as just described.

   
(2     1)2 + (5     8)2 =

   

for example, consider the distance between (2, 5) and (1, 8) . from the distance formula

this distance equals
w = 1 + i8, z     w = 1    i3 and so (z     w) (z     w) = (1     i3) (1 + i3) = 10 so |z     w| =
the same thing obtained with the distance formula.

10. on the other hand, letting z = 2 + i5 and

   
10,

complex numbers, are often written in the so called polar form which is described next.

x + iy =

where    is this angle just described and r =

x2 + y2.

a fundamental identity is the formula of de moivre which follows.

theorem 1.5.4 let r > 0 be given. then if n is a positive integer,

[r (cos t + i sin t)]n = rn (cos nt + i sin nt) .

proof: it is clear the formula holds if n = 1. suppose it is true for n.

[r (cos t + i sin t)]n+1 = [r (cos t + i sin t)]n [r (cos t + i sin t)]

which by induction equals

= rn+1 (cos nt + i sin nt) (cos t + i sin t)

= rn+1 ((cos nt cos t     sin nt sin t) + i (sin nt cos t + cos nt sin t))

by the formulas for the cosine and sine of the sum of two angles. (cid:4)

= rn+1 (cos (n + 1) t + i sin (n + 1) t)

corollary 1.5.5 let z be a non zero complex number. then there are always exactly k kth
roots of z in c.

proof: let z = x + iy and let z = |z| (cos t + i sin t) be the polar form of the complex

number. by de moivre   s theorem, a complex number,

r (cos    + i sin   ) ,

is a kth root of z if and only if

rk (cos k   + i sin k  ) = |z| (cos t + i sin t) .

this requires rk = |z| and so r = |z|1/k and also both cos (k  ) = cos t and sin (k  ) = sin t.
this can only happen if

k   = t + 2l  

for l an integer. thus

and so the kth roots of z are of the form

   =

(

(

|z|1/k

)

, l     z

))

, l     z.

since the cosine and sine are periodic of period 2  , there are exactly k distinct numbers
which result from this formula. (cid:4)

where the quadratic polynomial, x2 + 3x + 9 cannot be factored without using complex

the real and complex numbers both are    elds satisfying the axioms on page 13 and it is
usually one of these two    elds which is used in id202. the numbers are often called
scalars. however, it turns out that all algebraic notions work for any    eld and there are
many others. for this reason, i will often refer to the    eld of scalars as f although f will
usually be either the real or complex numbers. if there is any doubt, assume it is the    eld
of complex numbers which is meant. the reason the complex numbers are so signi   cant in
id202 is that they are algebraically complete. this means that every polynomial

k=0 akzk, n     1, an   = 0, having coe   cients ak in c has a root in in c.

   

later in the book, proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra are given. however, here
is a simple explanation of why you should believe this theorem. the issue is whether there
exists z     c such that p (z) = 0 for p (z) a polynomial having coe   cients in c. dividing by
the leading coe   cient, we can assume that p (z) is of the form

n

p (z) = zn + an   1zn   1 +        + a1z + a0, a0   = 0.

if a0 = 0, there is nothing to prove. denote by cr the circle of radius r in the complex plane
which is centered at 0. then if r is su   ciently large and |z| = r, the term zn is far larger
than the rest of the polynomial. thus, for r large enough, ar = {p (z) : z     cr} describes

a closed curve which misses the inside of some circle having 0 as its center. now shrink r.

19

eventually, for r small enough, the non constant terms are negligible and so ar is a curve
which is contained in some circle centered at a0 which has 0 in its outside.

ar
a0

r small

r large

0

thus it is reasonable to believe that for some r during this shrinking process, the set
ar must hit 0. it follows that p (z) = 0 for some z. this is one of those arguments which
seems all right until you think about it too much. nevertheless, it will su   ce to see that
the fundamental theorem of algebra is at least very plausible. a complete proof is in an
appendix.

that with the lexicographic order just described, each of 1     in is an upper bound to

upper bound with respect to the lexicographic order on c.

1.7 completeness of r

recall the following important de   nition from calculus, completeness of r.
de   nition 1.7.1 a non empty set, s     r is bounded above (below) if there exists x     r
such that x     (   ) s for all s     s. if s is a nonempty set in r which is bounded above,
then a number, l which has the property that l is an upper bound and that every other upper
bound is no smaller than l is called a least upper bound, l.u.b. (s) or often sup (s) . if s is a
nonempty set bounded below, de   ne the greatest lower bound, g.l.b. (s) or inf (s) similarly.
thus g is the g.l.b. (s) means g is a lower bound for s and it is the largest of all lower
bounds. if s is a nonempty subset of r which is not bounded above, this information is
expressed by saying sup (s) = +    and if s is not bounded below, inf (s) =       .

every existence theorem in calculus depends on some form of the completeness axiom.

axiom 1.7.2 (completeness) every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above
has a least upper bound and every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded below has
a greatest lower bound.

it is this axiom which distinguishes calculus from algebra. a fundamental result about

sup and inf is the following.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation1.8. well ordering and archimedean property

21

proposition 1.7.3 let s be a nonempty set and suppose sup (s) exists. then for every
   > 0,

s     (sup (s)       , sup (s)]   =    .

if inf (s) exists, then for every    > 0,

s     [inf (s) , inf (s) +   )   =    .

proof: consider the    rst claim. if the indicated set equals    , then sup (s)        is an
upper bound for s which is smaller than sup (s) , contrary to the de   nition of sup (s) as
the least upper bound. in the second claim, if the indicated set equals    , then inf (s) +   
would be a lower bound which is larger than inf (s) contrary to the de   nition of inf (s). (cid:4)

1.8 well ordering and archimedean property

de   nition 1.8.1 a set is well ordered if every nonempty subset s, contains a smallest
element z having the property that z     x for all x     s.
axiom 1.8.2 any set of integers larger than a given number is well ordered.

in particular, the natural numbers de   ned as

n    {1, 2,      }

is well ordered.

the above axiom implies the principle of mathematical induction.

theorem 1.8.3 (mathematical induction) a set s     z, having the property that a     s
and n + 1     s whenever n     s contains all integers x     z such that x     a.

proof: let t     ([a,   )     z) \ s. thus t consists of all integers larger than or equal
to a which are not in s. the theorem will be proved if t =    . if t   =     then by the well
ordering principle, there would have to exist a smallest element of t, denoted as b. it must
be the case that b > a since by de   nition, a /    t. then the integer, b     1     a and b     1 /    s
because if b     1     s, then b     1 + 1 = b     s by the assumed property of s. therefore,
b     1     ([a,   )     z) \ s = t which contradicts the choice of b as the smallest element of t.
(b     1 is smaller.) since a contradiction is obtained by assuming t   =    , it must be the case
that t =     and this says that everything in [a,   )     z is also in s. (cid:4)

de   nition 1.8.5 the archimedean property states that whenever x     r, and a > 0, there
exists n     n such that na > x.
proposition 1.8.6 r has the archimedean property.

preliminaries

proof: suppose it is not true. then there exists x     r and a > 0 such that na     x
for all n     n. let s = {na : n     n} . by assumption, this is bounded above by x. by
completeness, it has a least upper bound y. by proposition 1.7.3 there exists n     n such
that

y     a < na     y.

then y = y     a + a < na + a = (n + 1) a     y, a contradiction. (cid:4)
theorem 1.8.7 suppose x < y and y     x > 1. then there exists an integer l     z, such
that x < l < y. if x is an integer, there is no integer y satisfying x < y < x + 1.

proof: let x be the smallest positive integer. not surprisingly, x = 1 but this can be
if x < 1 then x2 < x contradicting the assertion that x is the smallest natural
proved.
number. therefore, 1 is the smallest natural number. this shows there is no integer, y,
satisfying x < y < x + 1 since otherwise, you could subtract x and conclude 0 < y     x < 1
for some integer y     x.

now suppose y     x > 1 and let

s     {w     n : w     y} .

the set s is nonempty by the archimedean property. let k be the smallest element of s.
therefore, k     1 < y. either k     1     x or k     1 > x. if k     1     x, then

y     x     y     (k     1) =

   0z}|{
y     k + 1     1

contrary to the assumption that y     x > 1. therefore, x < k     1 < y. let l = k     1. (cid:4)

it is the next theorem which gives the density of the rational numbers. this means that

for any real number, there exists a rational number arbitrarily close to it.

theorem 1.8.8 if x < y then there exists a rational number r such that x < r < y.

proof: let n     n be large enough that

n (y     x) > 1.

thus (y     x) added to itself n times is larger than 1. therefore,
n (y     x) = ny + n (   x) = ny     nx > 1.

it follows from theorem 1.8.7 there exists m     z such that

nx < m < ny

and so take r = m/n. (cid:4)
de   nition 1.8.9 a set, s     r is dense in r if whenever a < b, s     (a, b)   =    .

thus the above theorem says q is    dense    in r.

23
theorem 1.8.10 suppose 0 < a and let b     0. then there exists a unique integer p and
real number r such that 0     r < a and b = pa + r.

proof: let s     {n     n : an > b} . by the archimedean property this set is nonempty.
let p + 1 be the smallest element of s. then pa     b because p + 1 is the smallest in s.
therefore,

r     b     pa     0.

if r     a then b     pa     a and so b     (p + 1) a contradicting p + 1     s. therefore, r < a as
desired.

to verify uniqueness of p and r, suppose pi and ri, i = 1, 2, both work and r2 > r1. then

a little algebra shows

p1     p2 =

r2     r1

a

    (0, 1) .

thus p1     p2 is an integer between 0 and 1, contradicting theorem 1.8.7. the case that
r1 > r2 cannot occur either by similar reasoning. thus r1 = r2 and it follows that p1 = p2.
(cid:4)

this theorem is called the euclidean algorithm when a and b are integers.

1.9 division and numbers

first recall theorem 1.8.10, the euclidean algorithm.
theorem 1.9.1 suppose 0 < a and let b     0. then there exists a unique integer p and real
number r such that 0     r < a and b = pa + r.

the following de   nition describes what is meant by a prime number and also what is

meant by the word    divides   .

de   nition 1.9.2 the number, a divides the number, b if in theorem 1.8.10, r = 0. that
is there is zero remainder. the notation for this is a|b, read a divides b and a is called a
factor of b. a prime number is one which has the property that the only numbers which
divide it are itself and 1. the greatest common divisor of two positive integers, m, n is that
number, p which has the property that p divides both m and n and also if q divides both m
and n, then q divides p. two integers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor
is one. the greatest common divisor of m and n is denoted as (m, n) .

there is a phenomenal and amazing theorem which relates the greatest common divisor
to the smallest number in a certain set. suppose m, n are two positive integers. then if x, y
are integers, so is xm + yn. consider all integers which are of this form. some are positive
such as 1m + 1n and some are not. the set s in the following theorem consists of exactly
those integers of this form which are positive. then the greatest common divisor of m and
n will be the smallest number in s. this is what the following theorem says.

theorem 1.9.3 let m, n be two positive integers and de   ne
s     {xm + yn     n : x, y     z } .

then the smallest number in s is the greatest common divisor, denoted by (m, n) .

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation24

preliminaries

proof: first note that both m and n are in s so it is a nonempty set of positive integers.
by well ordering, there is a smallest element of s, called p = x0m + y0n. either p divides m
or it does not. if p does not divide m, then by theorem 1.8.10,

m = pq + r

where 0 < r < p. thus m = (x0m + y0n) q + r and so, solving for r,

r = m (1     x0) + (   y0q) n     s.

however, this is a contradiction because p was the smallest element of s. thus p|m. similarly
p|n.

now suppose q divides both m and n. then m = qx and n = qy for integers, x and y.

therefore,

showing q|p. therefore, p = (m, n) . (cid:4)

p = mx0 + ny0 = x0qx + y0qy = q (x0x + y0y)

there is a relatively simple algorithm for    nding (m, n) which will be discussed now.
suppose 0 < m < n where m, n are integers. also suppose the greatest common divisor is
(m, n) = d. then by the euclidean algorithm, there exist integers q, r such that

n = qm + r, r < m

(1.1)

now d divides n and m so there are numbers k, l such that dk = m, dl = n. from the above
equation,

r = n     qm = dl     qdk = d (l     qk)

thus d divides both m and r. if k divides both m and r, then from the equation of (1.1)
it follows k also divides n. therefore, k divides d by the de   nition of the greatest common
divisor. thus d is the greatest common divisor of m and r but m + r < m + n. this yields
another pair of positive integers for which d is still the greatest common divisor but the
sum of these integers is strictly smaller than the sum of the    rst two. now you can do the
same thing to these integers. eventually the process must end because the sum gets strictly
smaller each time it is done. it ends when there are not two positive integers produced.
that is, one is a multiple of the other. at this point, the greatest common divisor is the
smaller of the two numbers.

procedure 1.9.4 to    nd the greatest common divisor of m, n where 0 < m < n, replace
the pair {m, n} with {m, r} where n = qm + r for r < m. this new pair of numbers has
the same greatest common divisor. do the process to this pair and continue doing this till
you obtain a pair of numbers where one is a multiple of the other. then the smaller is the
sought for greatest common divisor.

example 1.9.5 find the greatest common divisor of 165 and 385.

use the euclidean algorithm to write

385 = 2 (165) + 55

thus the next two numbers are 55 and 165. then
165 = 3    55

and so the greatest common divisor of the    rst two numbers is 55.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation1.9. division and numbers

25

example 1.9.6 find the greatest common divisor of 1237 and 4322.

use the euclidean algorithm

4322 = 3 (1237) + 611

now the two new numbers are 1237,611. then

1237 = 2 (611) + 15

the two new numbers are 15,611. then

611 = 40 (15) + 11

the two new numbers are 15,11. then

the two new numbers are 11,4

the two new numbers are 4, 3. then

the two new numbers are 3, 1. then

15 = 1 (11) + 4

2 (4) + 3

4 = 1 (3) + 1

3 = 3    1

and so 1 is the greatest common divisor. of course you could see this right away when the
two new numbers were 15 and 11. recall the process delivers numbers which have the same
greatest common divisor.

this amazing theorem will now be used to prove a fundamental property of prime num-
bers which leads to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the major theorem which says
every integer can be factored as a product of primes.
theorem 1.9.7 if p is a prime and p|ab then either p|a or p|b.

proof: suppose p does not divide a. then since p is prime, the only factors of p are 1

and p so follows (p, a) = 1 and therefore, there exists integers, x and y such that

multiplying this equation by b yields

1 = ax + yp.

b = abx + ybp.

since p|ab, ab = pz for some integer z. therefore,

b = abx + ybp = pzx + ybp = p (xz + yb)

and this shows p divides b. (cid:4)
theorem 1.9.8 (fundamental theorem of arithmetic) let a     n\{1}. then a =
n
i=1 pi
where pi are all prime numbers. furthermore, this prime factorization is unique except for
the order of the factors.

   

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation26

preliminaries

proof: if a equals a prime number, the prime factorization clearly exists. in particular
the prime factorization exists for the prime number 2. assume this theorem is true for all
a     n     1. if n is a prime, then it has a prime factorization. on the other hand, if n is not
a prime, then there exist two integers k and m such that n = km where each of k and m
are less than n. therefore, each of these is no larger than n     1 and consequently, each has
a prime factorization. thus so does n. it remains to argue the prime factorization is unique
except for order of the factors.

suppose

n   

m   

pi =

qj

i=1

j=1

where the pi and qj are all prime, there is no way to reorder the qk such that m = n and
pi = qi for all i, and n + m is the smallest positive integer such that this happens. then
by theorem 1.9.7, p1|qj for some j. since these are prime numbers this requires p1 = qj.
reordering if necessary it can be assumed that qj = q1. then dividing both sides by p1 = q1,

n   1   

m   1   

pi+1 =

qj+1.

i=1

j=1

since n + m was as small as possible for the theorem to fail, it follows that n     1 = m     1
and the prime numbers, q2,       , qm can be reordered in such a way that pk = qk for all
k = 2,       , n. hence pi = qi for all i because it was already argued that p1 = q1, and this
results in a contradiction. (cid:4)

1.10 systems of equations

sometimes it is necessary to solve systems of equations. for example the problem could be
to    nd x and y such that

x + y = 7 and 2x     y = 8.

(1.2)

the set of ordered pairs, (x, y) which solve both equations is called the solution set. for
example, you can see that (5, 2) = (x, y) is a solution to the above system. to solve this,
note that the solution set does not change if any equation is replaced by a non zero multiple
of itself. it also does not change if one equation is replaced by itself added to a multiple
of the other equation. for example, x and y solve the above system if and only if x and y
solve the system

{
z
2x     y + (   2) (x + y) = 8 + (   2) (7).

   3y=   6

}|

x + y = 7,

(1.3)
the second equation was replaced by    2 times the    rst equation added to the second. thus
the solution is y = 2, from    3y =    6 and now, knowing y = 2, it follows from the other
equation that x + 2 = 7 and so x = 5.

why exactly does the replacement of one equation with a multiple of another added to

it not change the solution set? the two equations of (1.2) are of the form

e1 = f1, e2 = f2

(1.4)

where e1 and e2 are expressions involving the variables. the claim is that if a is a number,
then (1.4) has the same solution set as

e1 = f1, e2 + ae1 = f2 + af1.

(1.5)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation1.10. systems of equations

27

why is this?

if (x, y) solves (1.4) then it solves the    rst equation in (1.5). also, it satis   es ae1 = af1
and so, since it also solves e2 = f2 it must solve the second equation in (1.5). if (x, y)
solves (1.5) then it solves the    rst equation of (1.4). also ae1 = af1 and it is given that
the second equation of (1.5) is veri   ed. therefore, e2 = f2 and it follows (x, y) is a solution
of the second equation in (1.4). this shows the solutions to (1.4) and (1.5) are exactly the
same which means they have the same solution set. of course the same reasoning applies
with no change if there are many more variables than two and many more equations than
two. it is still the case that when one equation is replaced with a multiple of another one
added to itself, the solution set of the whole system does not change.

the other thing which does not change the solution set of a system of equations consists

of listing the equations in a di   erent order. here is another example.

example 1.10.1 find the solutions to the system,

x + 3y + 6z = 25
2x + 7y + 14z = 58

2y + 5z = 19

(1.6)

to solve this system replace the second equation by (   2) times the    rst equation added

to the second. this yields. the system

x + 3y + 6z = 25

y + 2z = 8
2y + 5z = 19

(1.7)

now take (   2) times the second and add to the third. more precisely, replace the third
equation with (   2) times the second added to the third. this yields the system

x + 3y + 6z = 25

y + 2z = 8

z = 3

(1.8)

at this point, you can tell what the solution is. this system has the same solution as the
original system and in the above, z = 3. then using this in the second equation, it follows
y + 6 = 8 and so y = 2. now using this in the top equation yields x + 6 + 18 = 25 and so
x = 1.
this process is not really much di   erent from what you have always done in solving a
single equation. for example, suppose you wanted to solve 2x + 5 = 3x     6. you did the
same thing to both sides of the equation thus preserving the solution set until you obtained
an equation which was simple enough to give the answer. in this case, you would add    2x
to both sides and then add 6 to both sides. this yields x = 11.
in (1.8) you could have continued as follows. add (   2) times the bottom equation to
the middle and then add (   6) times the bottom to the top. this yields

now add (   3) times the second to the top. this yields

x + 3y = 19

y = 6
z = 3

x = 1
y = 6
z = 3

a system which has the same solution set as the original system.

it is foolish to write the variables every time you do these operations. it is easier to

write the system (1.6) as the following    augmented matrix

       and a z column,

to the equations in the system. thus the top row in the augmented matrix corresponds to
the equation,

x + 3y + 6z = 25.

now when you replace an equation with a multiple of another equation added to itself, you
are just taking a row of this augmented matrix and replacing it with a multiple of another
row added to it. thus the    rst step in solving (1.6) would be to take (   2) times the    rst
row of the augmented matrix above and add it to the second row,

note how this corresponds to (1.7). next take (   2) times the second row and add to the
third,

which is the same as (1.8). you get the idea i hope. write the system as an augmented
matrix and follow the procedure of either switching rows, multiplying a row by a non zero
number, or replacing a row by a multiple of another row added to it. each of these operations
leaves the solution set unchanged. these operations are called row operations.

de   nition 1.10.2 the row operations consist of the following

1. switch two rows.

2. multiply a row by a nonzero number.

3. replace a row by a multiple of another row added to it.

it is important to observe that any row operation can be    undone    by another inverse
   
row operation. for example, if r1, r2 are two rows, and r2 is replaced with r
2 =   r1 + r2
   
using row operation 3, then you could get back to where you started by replacing the row r
with       times r1 and adding to r
   
2
2. in the case of operation 2, you would simply multiply
the row that was changed by the inverse of the scalar which multiplied it in the    rst place,
and in the case of row operation 1, you would just make the same switch again and you
would be back to where you started. in each case, the row operation which undoes what
was done is called the inverse row operation.
example 1.10.3 give the complete solution to the system of equations, 5x+10y   7z =    2,
2x + 4y     3z =    1, and 3x + 6y + 5z = 9.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation1.10. systems of equations

the augmented matrix for this system is

multiply the second row by 2, the    rst row by 5, and then take (   1) times the    rst row and
add to the second. then multiply the    rst row by 1/5. this yields

now, combining some row operations, take (   3) times the    rst row and add this to 2 times
the last row and replace the last row with this. this yields.

putting in the variables, the last two rows say z = 1 and z = 21. this is impossible so
the last system of equations determined by the above augmented matrix has no solution.
however, it has the same solution set as the    rst system of equations. this shows there is no
solution to the three given equations. when this happens, the system is called inconsistent.
this should not be surprising that something like this can take place. it can even happen
for one equation in one variable. consider for example, x = x+1. there is clearly no solution
to this.
example 1.10.4 give the complete solution to the system of equations, 3x     y     5z = 9,
y     10z = 0, and    2x + y =    6.

the augmented matrix of this system is

replace the last row with 2 times the top row added to 3 times the bottom row. this gives

next take    1 times the middle row and add to the bottom.

take the middle row and add to the top and then divide the top row which results by 3.

this says y = 10z and x = 3 + 5z. apparently z can equal any number. therefore, the
solution set of this system is x = 3 + 5t, y = 10t, and z = t where t is completely arbitrary.
the system has an in   nite set of solutions and this is a good description of the solutions.
this is what it is all about,    nding the solutions to the system.

de   nition 1.10.5 since z = t where t is arbitrary, the variable z is called a free variable.

the phenomenon of an in   nite solution set occurs in equations having only one variable

also. for example, consider the equation x = x. it doesn   t matter what x equals.

de   nition 1.10.6 a system of linear equations is a list of equations,

n   

aijxj = fj, i = 1, 2, 3,       , m

where aij are numbers, fj is a number, and it is desired to    nd (x1,       , xn) solving each of

j=1

the equations listed.

as illustrated above, such a system of linear equations may have a unique solution, no
solution, or in   nitely many solutions. it turns out these are the only three cases which can
occur for linear systems. furthermore, you do exactly the same things to solve any linear
system. you write the augmented matrix and do row operations until you get a simpler
system in which it is possible to see the solution. all is based on the observation that the
row operations do not change the solution set. you can have more equations than variables,
fewer equations than variables, etc. it doesn   t matter. you always set up the augmented
matrix and go to work on it. these things are all the same.
example 1.10.7 give the complete solution to the system of equations,    41x + 15y = 168,
109x     40y =    447,    3x + y = 12, and 2x + z =    1.

to solve this multiply the top row by 109, the second row by 41, add the top row to the
second row, and multiply the top row by 1/109. note how this process combined several
row operations. this yields

you should practice solving systems of equations. here are some exercises.

1.11 exercises

1. give the complete solution to the system of equations, 3x     y + 4z = 6, y + 8z = 0,

and    2x + y =    4.

2. give the complete solution to the system of equations, x+3y +3z = 3, 3x+2y +z = 9,

and    4x + z =    9.

3. consider the system    5x + 2y     z = 0 and    5x     2y     z = 0. both equations equal
zero and so    5x + 2y     z =    5x     2y     z which is equivalent to y = 0. thus x and
z can equal anything. but when x = 1, z =    4, and y = 0 are plugged in to the
equations, it doesn   t work. why?

4. give the complete solution to the system of equations, x+2y +6z = 5, 3x+2y +6z = 7

,   4x + 5y + 15z =    7.

5. give the complete solution to the system of equations

x + 2y + 3z = 5, 3x + 2y + z = 7,
   4x + 5y + z =    7, x + 3z = 5.

6. give the complete solution of the system of equations,

x + 2y + 3z = 5, 3x + 2y + 2z = 7

   4x + 5y + 5z =    7, x = 5

7. give the complete solution of the system of equations

x + y + 3z = 2, 3x     y + 5z = 6
   4x + 9y + z =    8, x + 5y + 7z = 2

8. determine a such that there are in   nitely many solutions and then    nd them. next
determine a such that there are no solutions. finally determine which values of a
correspond to a unique solution. the system of equations for the unknown variables
x, y, z is

)     5 = 0

9. find the solutions to the following system of equations for x, y, z, w.
y + z = 2, z + w = 0, y     4z     5w = 2, 2y + z     w = 4

10. find all solutions to the following equations.

1.12 fn
the notation, cn refers to the collection of ordered lists of n complex numbers. since every
real number is also a complex number, this simply generalizes the usual notion of rn, the
collection of all ordered lists of n real numbers. in order to avoid worrying about whether
it is real or complex numbers which are being referred to, the symbol f will be used. if it is
not clear, always pick c. more generally, fn refers to the ordered lists of n elements of fn.
de   nition 1.12.1 de   ne fn     {(x1,       , xn) : xj     f for j = 1,       , n} . (x1,       , xn) =
(y1,       , yn) if and only if for all j = 1,       , n, xj = yj. when (x1,       , xn)     fn, it is
conventional to denote (x1,       , xn) by the single bold face letter x. the numbers xj are

called the coordinates. the set

{(0,       , 0, t, 0,       , 0) : t     f}

for t in the ith slot is called the ith coordinate axis. the point 0     (0,       , 0) is called the
origin.

thus (1, 2, 4i)     f3 and (2, 1, 4i)     f3 but (1, 2, 4i)   = (2, 1, 4i) because, even though the
same numbers are involved, they don   t match up. in particular, the    rst entries are not
equal.

1.13 algebra in fn
there are two algebraic operations done with elements of fn. one is addition and the other
in the case of cn the scalars are complex
is multiplication by numbers, called scalars.
numbers while in the case of rn the only allowed scalars are real numbers. thus, the scalars
always come from f in either case.
de   nition 1.13.1 if x     fn and a     f, also called a scalar, then ax     fn is de   ned by

ax = a (x1,       , xn)     (ax1,       , axn) .

(1.9)

this is known as scalar multiplication. if x, y     fn then x + y     fn and is de   ned by

x + y = (x1,       , xn) + (y1,       , yn)

    (x1 + y1,       , xn + yn)

(1.10)

with this de   nition, the algebraic properties satisfy the conclusions of the following

theorem.
theorem 1.13.2 for v, w     fn and   ,    scalars, (real numbers), the following hold.

the commutative law of addition,

v + w = w + v,

(v + w) + z = v+ (w + z) ,

the associative law for addition,

the existence of an additive identity,

v + 0 = v,

v+ (   v) = 0,

the existence of an additive inverse, also

   (v + w) =   v+  w,

(   +   ) v =  v+  v,

   (  v) =      (v) ,

in the above 0 = (0,       , 0).

(1.15)

(1.16)

(1.17)

(1.18)

you should verify that these properties all hold. as usual subtraction is de   ned as
x     y     x+ (   y) . the conclusions of the above theorem are called the vector space axioms.

1.14 exercises

1. verify all the properties (1.11)-(1.18).
2. compute 5 (1, 2 + 3i, 3,   2) + 6 (2     i, 1,   2, 7) .
3. draw a picture of the points in r2 which are determined by the following ordered

pairs.

(a) (1, 2)
(b) (   2,   2)
(c) (   2, 3)
(d) (2,   5)

4. does it make sense to write (1, 2) + (2, 3, 1)? explain.
5. draw a picture of the points in r3 which are determined by the following ordered

triples. if you have trouble drawing this, describe it in words.

(a) (1, 2, 0)
(b) (   2,   2, 1)
(c) (   2, 3,   2)

1.15 the inner product in fn
when f = r or c, there is something called an inner product. in case of r it is also called
the dot product. this is also often referred to as the scalar product.
de   nition 1.15.1 let a, b     fn de   ne a    b as

a    b     n   

akbk.

with this de   nition, there are several important properties satis   ed by the inner product.
in the statement of these properties,    and    will denote scalars and a, b, c will denote
vectors or in other words, points in fn.

proposition 1.15.2 the inner product satis   es the following properties.

a    b =b    a

a    a     0 and equals zero if and only if a = 0

(  a +   b)    c =   (a    c) +    (b    c)
c    (  a +   b) =    (c    a) +    (c    b)

|a|2 = a    a

(1.19)

(1.20)

(1.21)

(1.22)

(1.23)

you should verify these properties. also be sure you understand that (1.22) follows from

the    rst three and is therefore redundant. it is listed here for the sake of convenience.
example 1.15.3 find (1, 2, 0,   1)    (0, i, 2, 3) .
this equals 0 + 2 (   i) + 0 +    3 =    3     2i
the cauchy schwarz inequality takes the following form in terms of the inner product.

i will prove it using only the above axioms for the inner product.

theorem 1.15.4 the inner product satis   es the inequality

|a    b|     |a||b| .

(1.24)

furthermore equality is obtained if and only if one of a or b is a scalar multiple of the other.

proof: first de   ne        c such that

and de   ne a function of t     r

   (a    b) = |a    b| ,|  | = 1,

f (t) = (a + t  b)    (a + t  b) .

then by (1.20), f (t)     0 for all t     r. also from (1.21),(1.22),(1.19), and (1.23)

f (t) = a    (a + t  b) + t  b    (a + t  b)

= a    a + t   (a    b) + t   (b    a) + t2 |  |2 b    b

= |a|2 + 2t re    (a    b) + |b|2 t2 = |a|2 + 2t|a    b| + |b|2 t2

now if |b|2 = 0 it must be the case that a    b = 0 because otherwise, you could pick large
negative values of t and violate f (t)     0. therefore, in this case, the cauchy schwarz
inequality holds. in the case that |b|   = 0, y = f (t) is a polynomial which opens up and
therefore, if it is always nonnegative, its graph is like that illustrated in the following picture

t

then the quadratic formula requires that

35

since otherwise the function, f (t) would have two real zeros and would necessarily have a
graph which dips below the t axis. this proves (1.24).

it is clear from the axioms of the inner product that equality holds in (1.24) whenever
one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other. it only remains to verify this is the only
way equality can occur. if either vector equals zero, then equality is obtained in (1.24) so
it can be assumed both vectors are non zero. then if equality is achieved, it follows f (t)
has exactly one real zero because the discriminant vanishes. therefore, for some value of
t, a + t  b = 0 showing that a is a multiple of b. (cid:4)

you should note that the entire argument was based only on the properties of the in-
ner product listed in (1.19) - (1.23). this means that whenever something satis   es these
properties, the cauchy schwartz inequality holds. there are many other instances of these
properties besides vectors in fn. also note that (1.24) holds if (1.20) is simpli   ed to a  a     0.
the cauchy schwartz inequality allows a proof of the triangle inequality for distances
in fn in much the same way as the triangle inequality for the absolute value.
theorem 1.15.5 (triangle inequality) for a, b     fn
|a + b|     |a| + |b|

(1.25)

and equality holds if and only if one of the vectors is a nonnegative scalar multiple of the
other. also

||a|     |b||     |a     b|

(1.26)

proof : by properties of the inner product and the cauchy schwartz inequality,

|a + b|2 = (a + b)   (a + b) = (a    a) + (a    b) + (b    a) + (b    b)

= |a|2 + 2 re (a    b) + |b|2     |a|2 + 2|a    b| + |b|2

    |a|2 + 2|a||b| + |b|2 = (|a| + |b|)2 .

taking square roots of both sides you obtain (1.25).

it remains to consider when equality occurs.

if either vector equals zero, then that
vector equals zero times the other vector and the claim about when equality occurs is
veri   ed. therefore, it can be assumed both vectors are nonzero. to get equality in the
second inequality above, theorem 1.15.4 implies one of the vectors must be a multiple of
the other. say b =   a. also, to get equality in the    rst inequality, (a    b) must be a
nonnegative real number. thus

0     (a    b) = (a    a) =   |a|2 .

therefore,    must be a real number which is nonnegative.

to get the other form of the triangle inequality,
a = a     b + b

so

therefore,

similarly,

|a| = |a     b + b|     |a     b| + |b| .

|a|     |b|     |a     b|

(1.27)

(1.28)
it follows from (1.27) and (1.28) that (1.26) holds. this is because ||a|     |b|| equals the left
side of either (1.27) or (1.28) and either way, ||a|     |b||     |a     b| . (cid:4)

|b|     |a|     |b     a| = |a     b| .

1.16 what is id202?

the above preliminary considerations form the necessary sca   olding upon which linear al-
gebra is built. id202 is the study of a certain algebraic structure called a vector
space described in a special case in theorem 1.13.2 and in more generality below along with
special functions known as linear transformations. these linear transformations preserve
certain algebraic properties.

a good argument could be made that id202 is the most useful subject in all
of mathematics and that it exceeds even courses like calculus in its signi   cance. it is used
extensively in applied mathematics and engineering. continuum mechanics, for example,
makes use of topics from id202 in de   ning things like the strain and in determining
appropriate constitutive laws. it is fundamental in the study of statistics. for example,
principal component analysis is really based on the singular value decomposition discussed
in this book. it is also fundamental in pure mathematics areas like number theory, functional
analysis, geometric measure theory, and di   erential geometry. even calculus cannot be
correctly understood without it. for example, the derivative of a function of many variables
is an example of a linear transformation, and this is the way it must be understood as soon
as you consider functions of more than one variable.

you have now solved systems of equations by writing them in terms of an augmented matrix
and then doing row operations on this augmented matrix. it turns out that such rectangular
arrays of numbers are important from many other di   erent points of view. numbers are
also called scalars. in general, scalars are just elements of some    eld. however, in the    rst
part of this book, the    eld will typically be either the real numbers or the complex numbers.
a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. several of them are referred to as matrices.

for example, here is a matrix.

       . the

       1

this matrix is a 3    4 matrix because there are three rows and four columns. the    rst

row is (1 2 3 4) , the second row is (5 2 8 7) and so forth. the    rst column is

convention in dealing with matrices is to always list the rows    rst and then the columns.
also, you can remember the columns are like columns in a greek temple. they stand up
right while the rows just lay there like rows made by a tractor in a plowed    eld. elements of
the matrix are identi   ed according to position in the matrix. for example, 8 is in position
2, 3 because it is in the second row and the third column. you might remember that you
always list the rows before the columns by using the phrase rowman catholic. the symbol,
(aij) refers to a matrix in which the i denotes the row and the j denotes the column. using
this notation on the above matrix, a23 = 8, a32 =    9, a12 = 2, etc.

there are various operations which are done on matrices. they can sometimes be added,
multiplied by a scalar and sometimes multiplied. to illustrate scalar multiplication, consider
the following example.

the new matrix is obtained by multiplying every entry of the original matrix by the given
scalar. if a is an m    n matrix    a is de   ned to equal (   1) a.

two matrices which are the same size can be added. when this is done, the result is the

two matrices are equal exactly when they are the same size and the corresponding entries
are identical. thus

because they are di   erent sizes. as noted above, you write (cij) for the matrix c whose
ijth entry is cij. in doing arithmetic with matrices you must de   ne what happens in terms
of the cij sometimes called the entries of the matrix or the components of the matrix.

the above discussion stated for general matrices is given in the following de   nition.

de   nition 2.1.1 let a = (aij) and b = (bij) be two m    n matrices. then a + b = c

where

for cij = aij + bij. also if x is a scalar,

c = (cij)

xa = (cij)

where cij = xaij. the number aij will typically refer to the ijth entry of the matrix a. the
zero matrix, denoted by 0 will be the matrix consisting of all zeros.

do not be upset by the use of the subscripts, ij. the expression cij = aij + bij is just
saying that you add corresponding entries to get the result of summing two matrices as
discussed above.
note that there are 2    3 zero matrices, 3    4 zero matrices, etc. in fact for every size

there is a zero matrix.
these properties are valid for a, b, and c, m    n matrices and 0 an m    n zero matrix,

with this de   nition, the following properties are all obvious but you should verify all of

the commutative law of addition,

a + b = b + a,

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) ,

the associative law for addition,

the existence of an additive identity,

a + 0 = a,

a + (   a) = 0,

the existence of an additive inverse. also, for   ,    scalars, the following also hold.

   (a + b) =   a +   b,

(   +   ) a =   a +   a,

   (  a) =      (a) ,

the above properties, (2.1) - (2.8) are known as the vector space axioms and the fact
that the m   n matrices satisfy these axioms is what is meant by saying this set of matrices
with addition and scalar multiplication as de   ned above forms a vector space.

1a = a.

more later. motivated by this example, here is the de   nition of how to multiply an m    n
matrix by an n    1 matrix. (vector)
de   nition 2.1.3 let a = aij be an m    n matrix and let v be an n    1 matrix,

with this done, the next task is to multiply an m    n matrix times an n    p matrix.

before doing so, the following may be helpful.

(m    these must match[n) (n    p

) = m    p

if the two middle numbers don   t match, you can   t multiply the matrices!

de   nition 2.1.5 let a be an m    n matrix and let b be an n    p matrix. then b is of
the form

b = (b1,       , bp)

where bk is an n    1 matrix. then an m    p matrix ab is de   ned as follows:

ab     (ab1,       , abp)

(2.10)

where abk is an m   1 matrix. hence ab as just de   ned is an m   p matrix. for example,

first check if it is possible. this is of the form (3    3) (2    3) . the inside numbers do not
match and so you can   t do this multiplication. this means that anything you write will be
absolute nonsense because it is impossible to multiply these matrices in this order. aren   t
they the same two matrices considered in the previous example? yes they are. it is just
that here they are in a di   erent order. this shows something you must always remember
about id127.

order matters!

id127 is not commutative. this is very di   erent than multiplication of
numbers!

2.1.1 the ijth entry of a product

it is important to describe id127 in terms of entries of the matrices. what
is the ijth entry of ab? it would be the ith entry of the jth column of ab. thus it would
be the ith entry of abj. now

and from the above de   nition, the ith entry is

this shows the following de   nition for id127 in terms of the ijth entries of
the product harmonizes with de   nition 2.1.3.

this motivates the de   nition for id127 which identi   es the ijth entries

of the product.

de   nition 2.1.8 let a = (aij) be an m    n matrix and let b = (bij) be an n    p matrix.
then ab is an m    p matrix and

n   

(ab)ij =

k=1

(2.12)

two matrices, a and b are said to be conformable in a particular order if they can be
multiplied in that order. thus if a is an r    s matrix and b is a s    p then a and b are
conformable in the order ab. the above formula for (ab)ij says that it equals the ith row
of a times the jth column of b.

first check to see if this is possible. it is of the form (3    2) (2    3) and since the inside
numbers match, it must be possible to do this and the result should be a 3   3 matrix. the

2.1.2 digraphs

consider the following graph illustrated in the picture.

there are three locations in this graph, labelled 1,2, and 3. the directed lines represent
a way of going from one location to another. thus there is one way to go from location 1
to location 1. there is one way to go from location 1 to location 3. it is not possible to go

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation44

matrices and linear transformations

from location 2 to location 3 although it is possible to go from location 3 to location 2. lets
refer to moving along one of these directed lines as a step. the following 3    3 matrix is
a numerical way of writing the above graph. this is sometimes called a digraph, short for
directed graph.

thus aij, the entry in the ith row and jth column represents the number of ways to go from
location i to location j in one step.

problem: find the number of ways to go from i to j using exactly k steps.
denote the answer to the above problem by ak

ij. we don   t know what it is right now
unless k = 1 when it equals aij described above. however, if we did know what it was, we
could    nd ak+1

as follows.

ij

   

r

ak+1
ij =

ak
irarj

this is because if you go from i to j in k + 1 steps, you    rst go from i to r in k steps and
then for each of these ways there are arj ways to go from there to j. thus ak
irarj gives
the number of ways to go from i to j in k + 1 steps such that the kth step leaves you at
location r. adding these gives the above sum. now you recognize this as the ijth entry of
the product of two matrices. thus

   

   

a2
ij =

airarj, a3

ij =

a2
irarj

r

r

and so forth. from the above de   nition of id127, this shows that if a is the
matrix associated with the directed graph as above, then ak
ij is just the ijth entry of ak
where ak is just what you would think it should be, a multiplied by itself k times.

thus in the above example, to    nd the number of ways of going from 1 to 3 in two steps
you would take that matrix and multiply it by itself and then take the entry in the    rst row
and third column. thus

and you see there is exactly one way to go from 1 to 3 in two steps. you can easily see this
is true from looking at the graph also. note there are three ways to go from 1 to 1 in 2
steps. can you    nd them from the graph? what would you do if you wanted to consider 5

there are 19 ways to go from 1 to 2 in    ve steps. do you think you could list them all by
looking at the graph? i don   t think you could do it without wasting a lot of time.

of course there is nothing sacred about having only three locations. everything works
just as well with any number of locations. in general if you have n locations, you would
need to use a n    n matrix.

there is exactly one way to go from 2 to 4 in three steps.

how many ways would there be of going from 2 to 4 in    ve steps?

there are three ways. note there are 10 ways to go from 3 to 2 in    ve steps.

this is an interesting application of the concept of the ijth entry of the product matrices.

2.1.3 properties of id127

as pointed out above, sometimes it is possible to multiply matrices in one order but not
in the other order. what if it makes sense to multiply them in either order? will they be
equal then?

and you see these are not equal. therefore, you cannot conclude that ab = ba for matrix
multiplication. however, there are some properties which do hold.

matrices and linear transformations

proposition 2.1.15 if all multiplications and additions make sense, the following hold for
matrices, a, b, c and a, b scalars.

a (ab + bc) = a (ab) + b (ac)

(b + c) a = ba + ca

a (bc) = (ab) c

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(a (ab + bc))ij =

k
= a (ab)ij + b (ac)ij
= (a (ab) + b (ac))ij

showing that a (b + c) = ab + ac as claimed. formula (2.14) is entirely similar.

consider (2.15), the associative law of multiplication. before reading this, review the

de   nition of id127 in terms of entries of the matrices.

another important operation on matrices is that of taking the transpose. the following

what happened? the    rst column became the    rst row and the second column became
the second row. thus the 3    2 matrix became a 2    3 matrix. the number 3 was in the
second row and the    rst column and it ended up in the    rst row and second column. this
motivates the following de   nition of the transpose of a matrix.
de   nition 2.1.16 let a be an m    n matrix. then at denotes the n    m matrix which
is de   ned as follows.

the transpose of a matrix has the following important property.

lemma 2.1.17 let a be an m    n matrix and let b be a n    p matrix. then

and if    and    are scalars,

(ab)t = bt at

(  a +   b)t =   at +   bt

(2.17) is left as an exercise. (cid:4)
de   nition 2.1.18 an n    n matrix a is said to be symmetric if a = at . it is said to be
skew symmetric if at =    a.

example 2.1.19 let

then a is symmetric.

then a is skew symmetric.

there is a special matrix called i and de   ned by

where   ij is the kronecker symbol de   ned by

iij =   ij

{

  ij =

1 if i = j
0 if i   = j

it is called the identity matrix because it is a multiplicative identity in the following sense.

lemma 2.1.21 suppose a is an m    n matrix and in is the n    n identity matrix. then
ain = a. if im is the m    m identity matrix, it also follows that ima = a.

proof:

   

(ain)ij =

aik  kj

k
= aij

and so ain = a. the other case is left as an exercise for you.
de   nition 2.1.22 an n    n matrix a has an inverse a
matrix, denoted as a

   1 such that aa

{

   1 = a
  ij    

   1a = i where i = (  ij) for
1 if i = j
0 if i   = j

   1 if and only if there exists a

such a matrix is called invertible.

matrices and linear transformations

if it acts like an inverse, then it is the inverse. this is the message of the following

proposition.

proposition 2.1.23 suppose ab = ba = i. then b = a

   1.

proof: from the de   nition b is an inverse for a. could there be another one b

   

?

   

b

   

= b

i = b

   

(ab) = (b

   

a) b = ib = b.

thus, the inverse, if it exists, is unique. (cid:4)

2.1.4 finding the inverse of a matrix

a little later a formula is given for the inverse of a matrix. however, it is not a good way
to    nd the inverse for a matrix. there is a much easier way and it is this which is presented
here. it is also important to note that not all matrices have inverses.

example 2.1.24 let a =

. does a have an inverse?

one might think a would have an inverse because it does not equal zero. however,

(

)

(

   1 existed, this could not happen because you could multiply on the left by the
and if a
inverse a and conclude the vector (   1, 1)t = (0, 0)t . thus the answer is that a does not
have an inverse.

suppose you want to    nd b such that ab = i. let

(

)

)(    1

)

=

1

1 1
1 1

(

b =

b1

       bn

0

)t

0
0

)

also the ith column of i is

(

ei =

thus, if ab = i, bi, the ith column of b must satisfy the equation abi = ei. the augmented
matrix for    nding bi is (a|ei) . thus, by doing row operations till a becomes i, you end up
with (i|bi) where bi is the solution to abi = ei. now the same sequence of row operations
works regardless of the right side of the agumented matrix (a|ei) and so you can save trouble

by simply doing the following.

and the ith column of b is bi, the solution to abi = ei. thus ab = i.

(a|i)

row operations   

(i|b)

this is the reason for the following simple procedure for    nding the inverse of a matrix.
this procedure is called the gauss jordan procedure. it produces the inverse if the matrix
has one. actually, it produces the right inverse.
procedure 2.1.25 suppose a is an n    n matrix. to    nd a
augmented n    2n matrix,
and then do row operations until you obtain an n    2n matrix of the form

   1 if it exists, form the

(a|i)

if possible. when this has been done, b = a
it is possible to do row operations and end up with one like (2.18).

(i|b)
(2.18)
   1. the matrix a has an inverse exactly when

as described above, the following is a description of what you have just done.

where those ri sympolize row operations. it follows that you could undo what you did by
doing the inverse of these row operations in the opposite order. thus

   1 is the row operation which undoes the row operation r. therefore, if you form
here r
(b|i) and do the inverse of the row operations which produced i from a in the reverse
order, you would obtain (i|a) . by the same reasoning above, it follows that a is a right
   1. thus
inverse of b and so ba = i also. it follows from proposition 2.1.23 that b = a
the procedure produces the inverse whenever it works.

if it is possible to do row operations and end up with a

i, then the above
argument shows that a has an inverse. conversely, if a has an inverse, can it be found by
the above procedure? in this case there exists a unique solution x to the equation ax = y.
   1y. thus in terms of augmented matrices, you would expect
in fact it is just x = ix = a
to obtain

)

(a|y)    (

i|a

   1y

row operations   

that is, you would expect to be able to do row operations to a and end up with i.

the details will be explained fully when a more careful discussion is given which is based
on more fundamental considerations. for now, it su   ces to observe that whenever the above
procedure works, it    nds the inverse.

at this point, you can see there will be no inverse because you have obtained a row of zeros
in the left half of the augmented matrix (a|i) . thus there will be no way to obtain i on
the left. in other words, the three systems of equations you must solve to    nd the inverse
   1 which must
have no solution. in particular, there is no solution for the    rst column of a

(2.19)

de   nition 2.3.1 a function, a : fn     fm is called a linear transformation if for all
u, v     fn and a, b scalars, (2.19) holds.

from (2.19), id127 de   nes a linear transformation as just de   ned.

it
turns out this is the only type of linear transformation available. thus if a is a linear
transformation from fn to fm, there is always a matrix which produces a. before showing
this, here is a simple de   nition.

de   nition 2.3.2 a vector, ei     fn is de   ned as follows:

where the 1 is in the ith position and there are zeros everywhere else. thus

ei = (0,       , 0, 1, 0,       , 0)t .

of course the ei for a particular value of i in fn would be di   erent than the ei for that
same value of i in fm for m   = n. one of them is longer than the other. however, which one
is meant will be determined by the context in which they occur.

these vectors have a signi   cant property.

showing a = b. (cid:4)
corollary 2.3.5 a linear transformation, l : fn     fm is completely determined by the
vectors {le1,       , len} .

proof: this follows immediately from the above theorem. the unique matrix deter-
mining the linear transformation which is given in (2.22) depends only on these vectors.
(cid:4)

this theorem shows that any linear transformation de   ned on fn can always be con-
sidered as a matrix. therefore, the terms    linear transformation    and    matrix    are often
used interchangeably. for example, to say that a matrix is one to one, means the linear
transformation determined by the matrix is one to one.

de   nition 2.3.7 let l : fn     fm be a linear transformation and let its matrix be the
m    n matrix a. then ker (l)     {x     fn : lx = 0} . sometimes people also write this as
n (a) , the null space of a.

then there is a fundamental result in the case where m < n. in this case, the matrix a

of the linear transformation looks like the following.

theorem 2.3.8 let a be an m    n matrix where m < n. then n (a) contains nonzero
vectors.

proof: first consider the case where a is a 1    n matrix for n > 1. say

      
if a1 = 0, consider the vector x = e1. if a1   = 0, let

a =

suppose now that the theorem is true for any m    n matrix with n > m and consider an
(m    1)    n matrix a where n > m + 1. if the    rst column of a is 0, then you could let
x = e1 as above. if the    rst column is not the zero vector, then by doing row operations,
the equation ax = 0 can be reduced to the equivalent system

2.4 subspaces and spans
de   nition 2.4.1 let {x1,       , xp} be vectors in fn. a linear combination is any expression

of the form

p   

cixi

i=1

where the ci are scalars. the set of all
linear combinations of these vectors is called
span (x1,       , xn) . if v     fn, then v is called a subspace if whenever   ,    are scalars
and u and v are vectors of v, it follows   u +   v     v . that is, it is    closed under the
algebraic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication   . a linear combination
of vectors is said to be trivial if all the scalars in the linear combination equal zero. a set
of vectors is said to be linearly independent if the only linear combination of these vectors

which equals the zero vector is the trivial linear combination. thus {x1,       , xn} is called

linearly independent if whenever

it follows that all the scalars ck equal zero. a set of vectors, {x1,       , xp} , is called linearly

proof: suppose    rst that v is a subspace. all algebraic properties involving scalar
multiplication and vector addition hold for v because these things hold for fn. is 0     v ? yes
it is. this is because 0v     v and 0v = 0. by assumption, for    a scalar and v     v,   v     v.
therefore,    v = (   1) v     v . thus v has the additive identity and additive inverse. by
assumption, v is closed with respect to the two operations. thus v is a vector space. if
v     fn is a vector space, then by de   nition, if   ,    are scalars and u, v vectors in v, it
follows that   v +   u     v . (cid:4)
thus, from the above, subspaces of fn are just subsets of fn which are themselves vector

spaces.

lemma 2.4.3 a set of vectors {x1,       , xp} is linearly independent if and only if none of

the vectors can be obtained as a linear combination of the others.

proof: suppose    rst that {x1,       , xp} is linearly independent. if xk =

0 = 1xk +

j  =k

(   cj) xj,

a nontrivial linear combination, contrary to assumption. this shows that if the set is linearly
independent, then none of the vectors is a linear combination of the others.

now suppose no vector is a linear combination of the others. is {x1,       , xp} linearly

independent? if it is not, there exist scalars ci, not all zero such that

p   
   
say ck   = 0. then you can solve for xk as

contrary to assumption. (cid:4)

the following is called the exchange theorem.

theorem 2.4.4 (exchange theorem) let {x1,       , xr} be a linearly independent set of vec-
tors such that each xi is in span(y1,       , ys) . then r     s.

proof 1: suppose not. then r > s. by assumption, there exist scalars aji such that

s   

xi =

the matrix whose jith entry is aji has more columns than rows. therefore, by theorem

not all of these scalars can equal zero because if this were the case, it would follow that

therefore, span{x1, z1,       , zs   1} = v because if v     v, there exist constants c1,       , cs

such that

now replace the yk in the above with a linear combination of the vectors, {x1, z1,       , zs   1}
to obtain v     span{x1, z1,       , zs   1} . the vector yk, in the list {y1,       , ys} , has now been
replaced with the vector x1 and the resulting modi   ed list of vectors has the same span as
the original list of vectors, {y1,       , ys} .
now suppose that r > s and that span{x1,       , xl, z1,       , zp} = v where the vectors,
z1,       , zp are each taken from the set, {y1,       , ys} and l + p = s. this has now been done
for l = 1 above. then since r > s, it follows that l     s < r and so l + 1     r. therefore, xl+1
is a vector not in the list, {x1,       , xl} and since span{x1,       , xl, z1,       , zp} = v, there
exist scalars ci and dj such that

would be a linearly dependent set because one of the vectors would equal a linear combination

continue this way, eventually obtaining

but then xr     span{x1,       , xs} contrary to the assumption that {x1,       , xr} is linearly

proof 3: suppose r > s. let zk denote a vector of {y1,       , ys} . thus there exists j as

small as possible such that

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xm, z1,       , zj)

where m + j = s. it is given that m = 0, corresponding to no vectors of {x1,       , xm} and
j = s, corresponding to all the yk results in the above equation holding. if j > 0 then m < s
and so

not all the bi can equal 0 and so you can solve for one of them in terms of xm+1, xm,       , x1,
and the other zk. therefore, there exists

{z1,       , zj   1}     {y1,       , ys}

such that

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xm+1, z1,       , zj   1)

contradicting the choice of j. hence j = 0 and

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xs)

it follows that

contrary to the assumption the xk are linearly independent. therefore, r     s as claimed. (cid:4)

matrices and linear transformations

de   nition 2.4.8 a    nite set of vectors, {x1,       , xr} is a basis for a subspace v of fn if
span (x1,       , xr) = v and {x1,       , xr} is linearly independent.
corollary 2.4.9 let {x1,       , xr} and {y1,       , ys} be two bases for v . then r = s.

proof: from the exchange theorem, r     s and s     r. (cid:4)

de   nition 2.4.10 let v be a subspace of fn. then dim (v ) read as the dimension of v
is the number of vectors in a basis.

of course you should wonder right now whether an arbitrary subspace even has a basis.

in fact it does and this is in the next theorem. first, here is an interesting lemma.

   

lemma 2.4.11 suppose v /    span (u1,       , uk) and {u1,       , uk} is linearly independent.
then {u1,       , uk, v} is also linearly independent.
(

k
i=1 ciui + dv = 0. it is required to verify that each ci = 0 and
that d = 0. but if d   = 0, then you can solve for v as a linear combination of the vectors,
{u1,       , uk},

proof: suppose

)

v =     k   

i=1

ci
d

ui

   

contrary to assumption. therefore, d = 0. but then

dence of {u1,       , uk} implies each ci = 0 also. (cid:4)
theorem 2.4.12 let v be a nonzero subspace of fn. then v has a basis.

k
i=1 ciui = 0 and the linear indepen-

proof: let v1     v where v1   = 0. if span{v1} = v, stop. {v1} is a basis for v .
otherwise, there exists v2     v which is not in span{v1} . by lemma 2.4.11 {v1, v2} is a
linearly independent set of vectors. if span{v1, v2} = v stop, {v1, v2} is a basis for v. if
span{v1, v2}   = v, then there exists v3 /    span{v1, v2} and {v1, v2, v3} is a larger linearly

independent set of vectors. continuing this way, the process must stop before n + 1 steps
because if not, it would be possible to obtain n + 1 linearly independent vectors contrary to
the exchange theorem. (cid:4)

in words the following corollary states that any linearly independent set of vectors can

be enlarged to form a basis.

corollary 2.4.13 let v be a subspace of fn and let {v1,       , vr} be a linearly independent
set of vectors in v . then either it is a basis for v or there exist vectors, vr+1,       , vs such
that {v1,       , vr, vr+1,       , vs} is a basis for v.

proof: this follows immediately from the proof of theorem 2.4.12. you do exactly the

same argument except you start with {v1,       , vr} rather than {v1}. (cid:4)

it is also true that any spanning set of vectors can be restricted to obtain a basis.

theorem 2.4.14 let v be a subspace of fn and suppose span (u1        , up) = v where
the ui are nonzero vectors. then there exist vectors {v1        , vr} such that {v1        , vr}    
{u1        , up} and {v1        , vr} is a basis for v .

proof: let r be the smallest positive integer with the property that for some set

{v1        , vr}     {u1        , up} ,
then r     p and it must be the case that {v1        , vr} is linearly independent because if it
were not so, one of the vectors, say vk would be a linear combination of the others. but
then you could delete this vector from {v1        , vr} and the resulting list of r     1 vectors
would still span v contrary to the de   nition of r. (cid:4)

span (v1        , vr) = v.

2.5 an application to matrices

the following is a theorem of major signi   cance.
theorem 2.5.1 suppose a is an n    n matrix. then a is one to one (injective) if and
only if a is onto (surjective). also, if b is an n    n matrix and ab = i, then it follows
ba = i.

proof: first suppose a is one to one. consider the vectors, {ae1,       , aen} where ek
is the column vector which is all zeros except for a 1 in the kth position. this set of vectors
is linearly independent because if

then since a is linear,

and since a is one to one, it follows

ckaek = 0,

)

a

ckek

= 0

k=1

n   

ckek = 0

k=1

which implies each ck = 0 because the ek are clearly linearly independent.
therefore, {ae1,       , aen} must be a basis for fn because if not there would exist a
vector, y /    span (ae1,       , aen) and then by lemma 2.4.11, {ae1,       , aen, y} would be

it follows that for y     fn there exist constants, ci such that

showing that, since y was arbitrary, a is onto.

next suppose a is onto. this means the span of the columns of a equals fn. if these
columns are not linearly independent, then by lemma 2.4.3 on page 57, one of the columns
is a linear combination of the others and so the span of the columns of a equals the span of
the n    1 other columns. this violates the exchange theorem because {e1,       , en
} would be
a linearly independent set of vectors contained in the span of only n    1 vectors. therefore,
the columns of a must be independent and this is equivalent to saying that ax = 0 if and
only if x = 0. this implies a is one to one because if ax = ay, then a (x     y) = 0 and so
x     y = 0.
now suppose ab = i. why is ba = i? since ab = i it follows b is one to one since
otherwise, there would exist, x   = 0 such that bx = 0 and then abx = a0 = 0   = ix.
therefore, from what was just shown, b is also onto. in addition to this, a must be one
to one because if ay = 0, then y = bx for some x and then x = abx = ay = 0 showing
y = 0. now from what is given to be so, it follows (ab) a = a and so using the associative
law for id127,

a (ba)     a = a (ba     i) = 0.

but this means (ba     i) x = 0 for all x since otherwise, a would not be one to one. hence
ba = i as claimed. (cid:4)

2.6 matrices and calculus

the study of moving coordinate systems gives a non trivial example of the usefulness of the
ideas involving linear transformations and matrices. to begin with, here is the concept of
the product rule extended to id127.

de   nition 2.6.1 let a (t) be an m    n matrix. say a (t) = (aij (t)) . suppose also that
   
(t)
aij (t) is a di   erentiable function for all i, j. then de   ne a
is the matrix which consists of replacing each entry by its derivative. such an m   n matrix
in which the entries are di   erentiable functions is called a di   erentiable matrix.

   
. that is, a

   
ij (t)
a

(t)    (

)

the next lemma is just a version of the product rule.

lemma 2.6.2 let a (t) be an m    n matrix and let b (t) be an n    p matrix with the
property that all the entries of these matrices are di   erentiable functions. then

(a (t) b (t))

   

   
= a

(t) b (t) + a (t) b

   

(t) .

proof: this is like the usual proof.

(a (t + h) b (t + h)     a (t) b (t)) =

2.6.1 the coriolis acceleration

imagine a point on the surface of the earth. now consider unit vectors, one pointing south,
one pointing east and one pointing directly away from the center of the earth.

(cid:15)i

jj

   
in general, let i

   
, j

   
, k

denote the    rst as i, the second as j, and the third as k. if you are standing on the earth
you will consider these vectors as    xed, but of course they are not. as the earth turns, they
change direction and so each is in reality a function of t. nevertheless, it is with respect
to these apparently    xed vectors that you wish to understand acceleration, velocities, and
displacements.

be the usual    xed vectors in space and let i (t) , j (t) , k (t) be an
orthonormal basis of vectors for each t, like the vectors described in the    rst paragraph.
it is assumed these vectors are c 1 functions of t. letting the positive x axis extend in the
direction of i (t) , the positive y axis extend in the direction of j (t), and the positive z axis
extend in the direction of k (t) , yields a moving coordinate system. now let u be a vector
and let t0 be some reference time. for example you could let t0 = 0. then de   ne the
components of u with respect to these vectors, i, j, k at time t0 as

u     u1i (t0) + u2j (t0) + u3k (t0) .

let u (t) be de   ned as the vector which has the same components with respect to i, j, k but
at time t. thus

u (t)     u1i (t) + u2j (t) + u3k (t) .
and the vector has changed although the components have not.

this is exactly the situation in the case of the apparently    xed basis vectors on the earth
if u is a position vector from the given spot on the earth   s surface to a point regarded as
   xed with the earth due to its keeping the same coordinates relative to the coordinate axes
which are    xed with the earth. now de   ne a linear transformation q (t) mapping r3 to r3
by

where

q (t) (  u +   v)    (

(

(

q (t) u     u1i (t) + u2j (t) + u3k (t)
u     u1i (t0) + u2j (t0) + u3k (t0)
)

this proves the lemma and yields the existence part of the following theorem. (cid:4)

theorem 2.6.4 let i (t) , j (t) , k (t) be as described. then there exists a unique vector     (t)
such that if u (t) is a vector whose components are constant with respect to i (t) , j (t) , k (t) ,
then

   
u

(t) =     (t)    u (t) .

proof: it only remains to prove uniqueness. suppose    1 also works. then u (t) = q (t) u

   

   

and so u

(t) = q

(t) u and

   

(t) u =        q (t) u =    1    q (t) u

q

for all u. therefore,

(           1)    q (t) u = 0

for all u and since q (t) is one to one and onto, this implies (           1)  w = 0 for all w and
thus            1 = 0. (cid:4)

now let r (t) be a position vector and let

r (t) = r (t) + rb (t)

in the example of the earth, r (t) is the position vector of a point p (t) on the earth   s

as the origin. rb (t) is the position vector of a point as perceived by the observer on the
earth with respect to the vectors he thinks of as    xed. similarly, vb (t) and ab (t) will be
   
the velocity and acceleration relative to i (t) , j (t) , k (t), and so vb = x

the acceleration ab is that perceived by an observer who is moving with the moving coor-
dinate system and for whom the moving coordinate system is    xed. the term       (       rb)
is called the centripetal acceleration. solving for ab,

ab = a     r

              

       rb     2       vb           (       rb) .

(2.28)

here the term     (      (       rb)) is called the centrifugal acceleration, it being an acceleration
the term    2       vb is called the coriolis acceleration, an acceleration experienced by the

felt by the observer relative to the moving coordinate system which he regards as    xed, and

observer as he moves relative to the moving coordinate system. the mass multiplied by the
coriolis acceleration de   nes the coriolis force.

there is a ride found in some amusement parks in which the victims stand next to
a circular wall covered with a carpet or some rough material. then the whole circular
room begins to revolve faster and faster. at some point, the bottom drops out and the
victims are held in place by friction. the force they feel is called centrifugal force and it
causes centrifugal acceleration. it is not necessary to move relative to coordinates    xed with
the revolving wall in order to feel this force and it is pretty predictable. however, if the
nauseated victim moves relative to the rotating wall, he will feel the e   ects of the coriolis
force and this force is really strange. the di   erence between these forces is that the coriolis
force is caused by movement relative to the moving coordinate system and the centrifugal
force is not.

2.6.2 the coriolis acceleration on the rotating earth

, be the usual basis vectors    xed in space with k
now consider the earth. let i
pointing in the direction of the north pole from the center of the earth and let i, j, k be the
unit vectors described earlier with i pointing south, j pointing east, and k pointing away
from the center of the earth at some point of the rotating earth   s surface p. letting r (t) be
the position vector of the point p, from the center of the earth, observe the coordinates of
r (t) are constant with respect to i (t) , j (t) , k (t) . also, since the earth rotates from west
to east and the speed of a point on the surface of the earth relative to an observer    xed in
space is    |r| sin    where    is the angular speed of the earth about an axis through the poles
and    is the polar angle measured from the positive z axis down as in spherical coordinates.
it follows from the geometric de   nition of the cross product that

   

   
r

       r

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation2.6. matrices and calculus

therefore, the vector of theorem 2.6.4 is     =   k

since     does not depend on t. formula (2.28) implies

(2.29)

in this formula, you can totally ignore the term       (       rb) because it is so small when-
z
(24) (3600) = 2  , and so    = 7.2722    10

ever you are considering motion near some point on the earth   s surface. to see this, note
   5 in radians per second. if you are using
  
seconds to measure time and feet to measure distance, this term is therefore, no larger than

clearly this is not worth considering in the presence of the acceleration due to gravity which
is approximately 32 feet per second squared near the surface of the earth.

note that

and so g, the acceleration relative to the moving coordinate system on the earth is not
directed exactly toward the center of the earth except at the poles and at the equator,
although the components of acceleration which are in other directions are very small when
compared with the acceleration due to the force of gravity and are often neglected. there-
fore, if the only force acting on an object is due to gravity, the following formula describes
the acceleration relative to a coordinate system moving with the earth   s surface.

ab = g   2 (       vb)

while the vector     is quite small, if the relative velocity, vb is large, the coriolis acceleration
could be signi   cant. this is described in terms of the vectors i (t) , j (t) , k (t) next.

example 2.6.6 in 1851 foucault set a pendulum vibrating and observed the earth rotate
out from under it. it was a very long pendulum with a heavy weight at the end so that it
would vibrate for a long time without stopping2. this is what allowed him to observe the
earth rotate out from under it. clearly such a pendulum will take 24 hours for the plane of
vibration to appear to make one complete revolution at the north pole. it is also reasonable
to expect that no such observed rotation would take place on the equator. is it possible to
predict what will take place at various latitudes?

2there is such a pendulum in the eyring building at byu and to keep people from touching it, there is

a little sign which says warning! 1000 ohms.

it is clear from experiments with the pendulum that the earth does indeed rotate out from
under it causing the plane of vibration of the pendulum to appear to rotate. the purpose
of this discussion is not to establish these self evident facts but to predict how long it takes
for the plane of vibration to make one revolution. therefore, there will be some instant in
time at which the pendulum will be vibrating in a plane determined by k and j. (recall
k points away from the center of the earth and j points east. ) at this instant in time,
de   ned as t = 0, the conditions of (2.34) will hold for some value of c and so the solution
to (2.32) having these initial conditions will be those of (2.33) by uniqueness of the initial
value problem. writing these solutions di   erently,

this is very interesting! the vector, c

always has magnitude equal to |c|
but its direction changes very slowly because b is very small. the plane of vibration is
determined by this vector and the vector k. the term sin
changes relatively fast
and takes values between    1 and 1. this is what describes the actual observed vibrations
of the pendulum. thus the plane of vibration will have made one complete revolution when
t = t for

therefore, the time it takes for the earth to turn out from under the pendulum is

sec   .

since    is the angular speed of the rotating earth, it follows    = 2  
hour. therefore, the above formula implies

24 =   

12 in radians per

t = 24 sec   .

i think this is really amazing. you could actually determine latitude, not by taking readings
with instruments using the north star but by doing an experiment with a big pendulum.
you would set it vibrating, observe t in hours, and then solve the above equation for   .
also note the pendulum would not appear to change its plane of vibration at the equator

because lim       /2 sec    =    .

the coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the phenomenon of the next example.

example 2.6.7 it is known that low pressure areas rotate counterclockwise as seen from
above in the northern hemisphere but clockwise in the southern hemisphere. why?

neglect accelerations other than the coriolis acceleration and the following acceleration
which comes from an assumption that the point p (t) is the location of the lowest pressure.

a =    a (rb) rb

where rb = r will denote the distance from the    xed point p (t) on the earth   s surface which
is also the lowest pressure point. of course the situation could be more complicated but

this will su   ce to explain the above question. then the acceleration observed by a person
on the earth relative to the apparently    xed vectors, i, k, j, is

ab =    a (rb) (xi+yj+zk)     2   [   y

sin (  )) j    (y
      
      
therefore, one obtains some di   erential equations from ab = x

now remember, the vectors, i, j, k are    xed relative to the earth and so are constant vectors.

the    rst term will be negative because it is assumed p (t) is the location of low pressure

its kth component is negative in the upper hemisphere when    <   /2 and positive in the
lower hemisphere when    >   /2. using the right hand and the geometric de   nition of the
cross product, this shows clockwise rotation in the lower hemisphere and counter clockwise
rotation in the upper hemisphere.

note also that as    gets close to   /2 near the equator, the above reasoning tends to
break down because cos (  ) becomes close to zero. therefore, the motion towards the low
pressure has to be more pronounced in comparison with the motion in the k direction in
order to draw this conclusion.

28.    in the situation of problem 27 where v is a subspace of fn, show that there exists

if every v     v can be written in a unique way in the form

v = v1 +        + vm

v1 +        + vm, vj     vj for each j.

show (2.35) is equivalent to saying that if

such that

ak + ak   1ak   1 +        + a1a + a0i = 0

the minimal polynomial of a is the polynomial like the above, for which p (a) = 0
which has smallest degree. i will discuss the uniqueness of this polynomial later. hint:
consider the matrices i, a, a2,       , an2
. there are n2 + 1 of these matrices. can they
be linearly independent? now consider all polynomials and pick one of smallest degree
and then divide by the leading coe   cient.

37.    suppose the    eld of scalars is c and a is an n    n matrix. from the preceding

where rj is the algebraic multiplicity of   j, and the   j are distinct. thus

(a       1i)r1 (a       2i)r2        (a       ki)rk = 0

and so, letting p = (a       1i)r1 (a       2i)r2        (a       ki)rk and lj = (a       ji)rj

apply the result of problem 35 to verify that

3.1 basic techniques and properties
let a be an n    n matrix. the determinant of a, denoted as det (a) is a number. if the
matrix is a 2  2 matrix, this number is very easy to    nd.

example 3.1.2 find det

.

the determinant is also often denoted by enclosing the matrix with two vertical lines. thus

from the de   nition this is just (2) (6)     (   1) (4) = 16.
assuming the determinant has been de   ned for k    k matrices for k     n     1, it is now

time to de   ne it for n    n matrices.
de   nition 3.1.3 let a = (aij) be an n    n matrix. then a new matrix called the cofactor
matrix, cof (a) is de   ned by cof (a) = (cij) where to obtain cij delete the ith row and the
jth column of a, take the determinant of the (n     1)    (n     1) matrix which results, (this
is called the ijth minor of a. ) and then multiply this number by (   1)i+j. to make the
formulas easier to remember, cof (a)ij will denote the ijth entry of the cofactor matrix.

now here is the de   nition of the determinant given recursively.

theorem 3.1.4 let a be an n    n matrix where n     2. then

n

det (a) =

the    rst formula consists of expanding the determinant along the ith row and the second
expands the determinant along the jth column.

determinants

note that for a n    n matrix, you will need n! terms to evaluate the determinant in this

way. if n = 10, this is 10! = 3, 628 , 800 terms. this is a lot of terms.

in addition to the di   culties just discussed, why is the determinant well de   ned? why
should you get the same thing when you expand along any row or column? i think you
should regard this claim that you always get the same answer by picking any row or column
with considerable skepticism. it is incredible and not at all obvious. however, it requires
a little e   ort to establish it. this is done in the section on the theory of the determinant
which follows.

notwithstanding the di   culties involved in using the method of laplace expansion,

certain types of matrices are very easy to deal with.

de   nition 3.1.5 a matrix m , is upper triangular if mij = 0 whenever i > j. thus such
a matrix equals zero below the main diagonal, the entries of the form mii, as shown.

...
0

   
   
. . .
      

      
. . .
. . .
0

   
...
   
   

a lower triangular matrix is de   ned similarly as a matrix for which all entries above the
main diagonal are equal to zero.

you should verify the following using the above theorem on laplace expansion.

corollary 3.1.6 let m be an upper (lower) triangular matrix. then det (m ) is obtained
by taking the product of the entries on the main diagonal.

proof: the corollary is true if the matrix is one to one. suppose it is n    n. then the

matrix is of the form

where m1 is (n     1)  (n     1) . then expanding along the    rst row, you get m11 det (m1)+0.
then use the induction hypothesis to obtain that det (m1) =

i=2 mii. (cid:4)

example 3.1.7 let

a =

find det (a) .

from the above corollary, this is    6.
there are many properties satis   ed by determinants. some of the most important are

listed in the following theorem.
theorem 3.1.8 if two rows or two columns in an n    n matrix a are switched, the deter-
minant of the resulting matrix equals (   1) times the determinant of the original matrix. if
a is an n   n matrix in which two rows are equal or two columns are equal then det (a) = 0.
suppose the ith row of a equals (xa1 + yb1,       , xan + ybn). then

det (a) = x det (a1) + y det (a2)

where the ith row of a1 is (a1,       , an) and the ith row of a2 is (b1,       , bn) , all other rows
of a1 and a2 coinciding with those of a. in other words, det is a linear function of each
row a. the same is true with the word    row    replaced with the word    column   . in addition
to this, if a and b are n    n matrices, then

det (ab) = det (a) det (b) ,

and if a is an n    n matrix, then

det (a) = det

this theorem implies the following corollary which gives a way to    nd determinants. as
i pointed out above, the method of laplace expansion will not be practical for any matrix
of large size.
corollary 3.1.9 let a be an n  n matrix and let b be the matrix obtained by replacing the
ith row (column) of a with the sum of the ith row (column) added to a multiple of another
row (column). then det (a) = det (b) . if b is the matrix obtained from a be replacing the
ith row (column) of a by a times the ith row (column) then a det (a) = det (b) .

here is an example which shows how to use this corollary to    nd a determinant.

example 3.1.10 find the determinant of the matrix

replace the second row by (   5) times the    rst row added to it. then replace the third
row by (   4) times the    rst row added to it. finally, replace the fourth row by (   2) times
the    rst row added to it. this yields the matrix

and from the above corollary, it has the same determinant as a. now using the corollary
some more, det (b) =

det (c) where

(   1

)

the second row was replaced by (   3) times the third row added to the second row and then
the last row was multiplied by (   3) . now replace the last row with 2 times the third added
to it and then switch the third and second rows. then det (c) =     det (d) where

you could do more row operations or you could note that this can be easily expanded along
the    rst column followed by expanding the 3   3 matrix which results along its    rst column.
thus

det (d) = 1 (   3)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 1485

and so det (c) =    1485 and det (a) = det (b) =

(   1485) = 495.

the theorem about expanding a matrix along any row or column also provides a way to
give a formula for the inverse of a matrix. recall the de   nition of the inverse of a matrix
in de   nition 2.1.22 on page 47. the following theorem gives a formula for the inverse of a
matrix. it is proved in the next section.

theorem 3.1.11 says that to    nd the inverse, take the transpose of the cofactor matrix

3.3 the mathematical theory of determinants

it is easiest to give a di   erent de   nition of the determinant which is clearly well de   ned
and then prove the earlier one in terms of laplace expansion. let (i1,       , in) be an ordered
list of numbers from {1,       , n} . this means the order is important so (1, 2, 3) and (2, 1, 3)
are di   erent. there will be some repetition between this section and the earlier section on
determinants. the main purpose is to give all the missing proofs. two books which give
a good introduction to determinants are apostol [1] and rudin [22]. a recent book which
also has a good introduction is baker [3]

determinants

3.3.1 the function sgn

the following lemma will be essential in the de   nition of the determinant.

lemma 3.3.1 there exists a unique function, sgnn which maps each ordered list of num-
bers from {1,       , n} to one of the three numbers, 0, 1, or    1 which also has the following
properties.

sgnn (1,       , n) = 1

sgnn (i1,       , p,       , q,       , in) =     sgnn (i1,       , q,       , p,       , in)

(3.2)

(3.3)

in words, the second property states that if two of the numbers are switched, the value of the

function is multiplied by    1. also, in the case where n > 1 and {i1,       , in} = {1,       , n} so
that every number from {1,       , n} appears in the ordered list, (i1,       , in) ,

sgnn (i1,       , i     1, n, i  +1,       , in)    

where n = i   in the ordered list, (i1,       , in) .

(   1)n      sgnn   1 (i1,       , i     1, i  +1,       , in)

(3.4)

proof: to begin with, it is necessary to show the existence of such a function. this is

clearly true if n = 1. de   ne sgn1 (1)     1 and observe that it works. no switching is possible.
in the case where n = 2, it is also clearly true. let sgn2 (1, 2) = 1 and sgn2 (2, 1) =    1
while sgn2 (2, 2) = sgn2 (1, 1) = 0 and verify it works. assuming such a function exists for n,
sgnn+1 will be de   ned in terms of sgnn . if there are any repeated numbers in (i1,       , in+1) ,
sgnn+1 (i1,       , in+1)     0. if there are no repeats, then n + 1 appears somewhere in the
form (i1,       , i     1, n + 1, i  +1,       , in+1) . from (3.4) it must be that
sgnn+1 (i1,       , i     1, n + 1, i  +1,       , in+1)    
(   1)n+1      sgnn (i1,       , i     1, i  +1,       , in+1) .

ordered list. let    be the position of the number n + 1 in the list. thus, the list is of the

it is necessary to verify this satis   es (3.2) and (3.3) with n replaced with n + 1. the    rst of
these is obviously true because

sgnn+1 (1,       , n, n + 1)     (   1)n+1   (n+1) sgnn (1,       , n) = 1.

if there are repeated numbers in (i1,       , in+1) , then it is obvious (3.3) holds because both
there are no numbers repeated in (i1,       , in+1) . consider

sides would equal zero from the above de   nition. it remains to verify (3.3) in the case where

and so, by induction, a switch of p and q introduces a minus sign in the result. similarly,

   = s. consider the case where    = r and note the other case is entirely similar.

this proves the existence of the desired function. uniqueness follows easily from the follow-
ing lemma.
lemma 3.3.2 every ordered list of {1, 2,       , n} can be obtained from every other ordered
list by a    nite number of switches. also, sgn is unique.

proof: this is obvious if n = 1 or 2. suppose then that it is true for sets of n     1
elements. take two ordered lists of numbers, p1, p2. to get from p1 to p2 using switches,
   rst make a switch to obtain the last element in the list coinciding with the last element of
p2. by induction, there are switches which will arrange the    rst n     1 to the right order.
to see sgnn is unique, if there exist two functions, f and g both satisfying (3.2) and
(3.3), you could start with f (1,       , n) = g (1,       , n) and applying the same sequence of
switches, eventually arrive at f (i1,       , in) = g (i1,       , in) . if any numbers are repeated,
then (3.3) gives both functions are equal to zero for that ordered list. (cid:4)
de   nition 3.3.3 when you have an ordered list of distinct numbers from {1, 2,       , n} , say
(i1,       , in) , this ordered list is called a permutation. the symbol for all such permutations
is sn. the number sgnn (i1,       , in) is called the sign of the permutation.

a permutation can also be considered as a function from the set

{1, 2,       , n} to {1, 2,       , n}

as follows. let f (k) = ik. permutations are of fundamental importance in certain areas
of math. for example, it was by considering permutations that galois was able to give a
criterion for solution of polynomial equations by radicals, but this is a di   erent direction
than what is being attempted here.

in what follows sgn will often be used rather than sgnn because the context supplies the

appropriate n.

3.3.2 the de   nition of the determinant

de   nition 3.3.4 let f be a real valued function which has the set of ordered lists of numbers

from {1,       , n} as its domain. de   ne   

f (k1        kn)

(k1,       ,kn)

to be the sum of all the f (k1        kn) for all possible choices of ordered lists (k1,       , kn) of
numbers of {1,       , n} . for example,

   

f (k1, k2) = f (1, 2) + f (2, 1) + f (1, 1) + f (2, 2) .

(k1,k2)

de   nition 3.3.5 let (aij) = a denote an n    n matrix. the determinant of a, denoted

by det (a) is de   ned by

det (a)    

sgn (k1,       , kn) a1k1

       ankn

   

(k1,       ,kn)

where the sum is taken over all ordered lists of numbers from {1,       , n}. note it su   ces to
take the sum over only those ordered lists in which there are no repeats because if there are,
sgn (k1,       , kn) = 0 and so that term contributes 0 to the sum.

let a be an n    n matrix a = (aij) and let (r1,       , rn) denote an ordered list of n
numbers from {1,       , n}. let a (r1,       , rn) denote the matrix whose kth row is the rk row

of the matrix a. thus

det (a (r1,       , rn)) =

sgn (k1,       , kn) ar1k1

       arnkn

(3.7)

and a (1,       , n) = a.
proposition 3.3.6 let (r1,       , rn) be an ordered list of numbers from {1,       , n}. then

sgn (r1,       , rn) det (a) =

sgn (k1,       , kn) ar1k1

       arnkn

   

(k1,       ,kn)

   

(k1,       ,kn)

= det (a (r1,       , rn)) .
proof: let (1,       , n) = (1,       , r,       s,       , n) so r < s.

det (a (1,       , r,       , s,       , n)) =

(3.11)

=

(k1,       ,kn)

consequently,

det (a (1,       , s,       , r,       , n)) =     det (a (1,       , r,       , s,       , n)) =     det (a)

now letting a (1,       , s,       , r,       , n) play the role of a, and continuing in this way, switch-
ing pairs of numbers,

det (a (r1,       , rn)) = (   1)p det (a)

where it took p switches to obtain(r1,       , rn) from (1,       , n). by lemma 3.3.1, this implies

det (a (r1,       , rn)) = (   1)p det (a) = sgn (r1,       , rn) det (a)

and proves the proposition in the case when there are no repeated numbers in the ordered

list, (r1,       , rn). however, if there is a repeat, say the rth row equals the sth row, then the
reasoning of (3.10) -(3.11) shows that det(a (r1,       , rn)) = 0 and also sgn (r1,       , rn) = 0
so the formula holds in this case also. (cid:4)
observation 3.3.7 there are n! ordered lists of distinct numbers from {1,       , n} .

to see this, consider n slots placed in order. there are n choices for the    rst slot. for
each of these choices, there are n     1 choices for the second. thus there are n (n     1) ways
to    ll the    rst two slots. then for each of these ways there are n    2 choices left for the third
slot. continuing this way, there are n! ordered lists of distinct numbers from {1,       , n} as
stated in the observation.

3.3.3 a symmetric de   nition

(

)

with the above, it is possible to give a more symmetric description of the determinant from
which it will follow that det (a) = det

at

.

corollary 3.3.8 the following formula for det (a) is valid.

sgn (r1,       , rn) sgn (k1,       , kn) ar1k1

       arnkn.

determinants

   

proof: from proposition 3.3.6, if the ri are distinct,

det (a) =

(k1,       ,kn)

summing over all ordered lists, (r1,       , rn) where the ri are distinct, (if the ri are not
distinct, sgn (r1,       , rn) = 0 and so there is no contribution to the sum.)
sgn (r1,       , rn) sgn (k1,       , kn) ar1k1

       arnkn.

   

n! det (a) =

sgn (r1,       , rn) sgn (k1,       , kn) ar1k1
   

       arnkn.

(r1,       ,rn)

(k1,       ,kn)

this proves the corollary since the formula gives the same number for a as it does for at .
(cid:4)
corollary 3.3.9 if two rows or two columns in an n    n matrix a, are switched, the
determinant of the resulting matrix equals (   1) times the determinant of the original matrix.
if a is an n  n matrix in which two rows are equal or two columns are equal then det (a) = 0.
suppose the ith row of a equals (xa1 + yb1,       , xan + ybn). then

det (a) = x det (a1) + y det (a2)

where the ith row of a1 is (a1,       , an) and the ith row of a2 is (b1,       , bn) , all other rows
of a1 and a2 coinciding with those of a. in other words, det is a linear function of each
row a. the same is true with the word    row    replaced with the word    column   .

proof: by proposition 3.3.6 when two rows are switched, the determinant of the re-
sulting matrix is (   1) times the determinant of the original matrix. by corollary 3.3.8 the
same holds for columns because the columns of the matrix equal the rows of the transposed
matrix. thus if a1 is the matrix obtained from a by switching two columns,

(

)

(

)

det (a) = det

at

=     det

at
1

=     det (a1) .

if a has two equal columns or two equal rows, then switching them results in the same
matrix. therefore, det (a) =     det (a) and so det (a) = 0.

it remains to verify the last assertion.

exist scalars c1,       cr such that w =

w     span (v1,       , vr) .

the following corollary is also of great use.

corollary 3.3.11 suppose a is an n    n matrix and some column (row) is a linear com-
bination of r other columns (rows). then det (a) = 0.

(

)

a1

proof: let a =

be the columns of a and suppose the condition that
one column is a linear combination of r of the others is satis   ed. then by using corollary
3.3.9 you may rearrange the columns to have the nth column a linear combination of the
   rst r columns. thus an =

in terms of the theory of determinants, arguably the most important idea is that of
laplace expansion along a row or a column. this will follow from the above de   nition of a
determinant.

de   nition 3.3.16 let a = (aij) be an n  n matrix. then a new matrix called the cofactor
matrix cof (a) is de   ned by cof (a) = (cij) where to obtain cij delete the ith row and the
jth column of a, take the determinant of the (n     1)    (n     1) matrix which results, (this
is called the ijth minor of a. ) and then multiply this number by (   1)i+j. to make the
formulas easier to remember, cof (a)ij will denote the ijth entry of the cofactor matrix.

the following is the main result. earlier this was given as a de   nition and the outrageous
totally unjusti   ed assertion was made that the same number would be obtained by expanding
the determinant along any row or column. the following theorem proves this assertion.
theorem 3.3.17 let a be an n    n matrix where n     2. then

n

det (a) =

the    rst formula consists of expanding the determinant along the ith row and the second
expands the determinant along the jth column.

proof: let (ai1,       , ain) be the ith row of a. let bj be the matrix obtained from a by
leaving every row the same except the ith row which in bj equals (0,       , 0, aij, 0,       , 0) .

then by corollary 3.3.9,

n   

det (a) =

denote by aij the (n     1)   (n     1) matrix obtained by deleting the ith row and the jth

3.3.6, when two rows or two columns in a matrix m, are switched, this results in multiplying
the determinant of the old matrix by    1 to get the determinant of the new matrix. therefore,

a lower triangular matrix is de   ned similarly as a matrix for which all entries above the
main diagonal are equal to zero.

with this de   nition, here is a simple corollary of theorem 3.3.17.

corollary 3.3.21 let m be an upper (lower) triangular matrix. then det (m ) is obtained
by taking the product of the entries on the main diagonal.

3.3.7 rank of a matrix

de   nition 3.3.22 a submatrix of a matrix a is the rectangular array of numbers obtained
by deleting some rows and columns of a. let a be an m    n matrix. the determinant
rank of the matrix equals r where r is the largest number such that some r    r submatrix
of a has a non zero determinant. the row rank is de   ned to be the dimension of the span
of the rows. the column rank is de   ned to be the dimension of the span of the columns.
theorem 3.3.23 if a, an m   n matrix has determinant rank r, then there exist r rows of
the matrix such that every other row is a linear combination of these r rows.

proof: suppose the determinant rank of a = (aij) equals r. thus some r   r submatrix

has non zero determinant and there is no larger square submatrix which has non zero
determinant. suppose such a submatrix is determined by the r columns whose indices are

and the r rows whose indices are

j1 <        < jr

i1 <        < ir

i want to show that every row is a linear combination of these rows. consider the lth row
and let p be an index between 1 and n. form the following (r + 1)    (r + 1) matrix

row is one of the chosen ones. the above matrix has determinant 0. this is because if

of course you can assume l /    {i1,       , ir} because there is nothing to prove if the lth
p /    {j1,       , jr} then the above would be a submatrix of a which is too large to have non
zero determinant. on the other hand, if p     {j1,       , jr} then the above matrix has two

columns which are equal so its determinant is still 0.

expand the determinant of the above matrix along the last column. let ck denote the
cofactor associated with the entry aikp. this is not dependent on the choice of p. remember,
you delete the column and the row the entry is in and take the determinant of what is left
and multiply by    1 raised to an appropriate power. let c denote the cofactor associated
with alp. this is given to be nonzero, it being the determinant of the matrix

which implies

since this is true for every p and since mk does not depend on p, this has shown the lth row
is a linear combination of the i1, i2,       , ir rows. (cid:4)

corollary 3.3.24 the determinant rank equals the row rank.

proof: from theorem 3.3.23, every row is in the span of r rows where r is the deter-
minant rank. therefore, the row rank (dimension of the span of the rows) is no larger than
the determinant rank. could the row rank be smaller than the determinant rank? if so,
it follows from theorem 3.3.23 that there exist p rows for p < r     determinant rank, such
that the span of these p rows equals the row space. but then you could consider the r    r
sub matrix which determines the determinant rank and it would follow that each of these
rows would be in the span of the restrictions of the p rows just mentioned. by theorem
2.4.4, the exchange theorem, the rows of this sub matrix would not be linearly independent
and so some row is a linear combination of the others. by corollary 3.3.11 the determinant
would be 0, a contradiction. (cid:4)

corollary 3.3.25 if a has determinant rank r, then there exist r columns of the matrix
such that every other column is a linear combination of these r columns. also the column
rank equals the determinant rank.

proof: this follows from the above by considering at . the rows of at are the columns
of a and the determinant rank of at and a are the same. therefore, from corollary 3.3.24,
column rank of a = row rank of at = determinant rank of at = determinant rank of a.
the following theorem is of fundamental importance and ties together many of the ideas

presented above.
theorem 3.3.26 let a be an n    n matrix. then the following are equivalent.

1. det (a) = 0.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation96

determinants

2. a, at are not one to one.

3. a is not onto.

proof: suppose det (a) = 0. then the determinant rank of a = r < n. therefore,
there exist r columns such that every other column is a linear combination of these columns
by theorem 3.3.23. in particular, it follows that for some m, the mth column is a linear
      
combination of all the others. thus letting a =
where the
columns are denoted by ai, there exists scalars   i such that

am       

an

(

now consider the column vector, x    (

am =

  kak.

  1
ax =    am +

k  =m
   
          1          n

  kak = 0.

k  =m

)t

. then

since also a0 = 0, it follows a is not one to one. similarly, at is not one to one by the
same argument applied to at . this veri   es that 1.) implies 2.).
now suppose 2.). then since at is not one to one, it follows there exists x   = 0 such that

taking the transpose of both sides yields

at x = 0.

where the 0t is a 1    n matrix or row vector. now if ay = x, then

|x|2 = xt (ay) =

xt a

y = 0y = 0

xt a = 0t

(

)

contrary to x   = 0. consequently there can be no y such that ay = x and so a is not onto.
this shows that 2.) implies 3.).
finally, suppose 3.). if 1.) does not hold, then det (a)   = 0 but then from theorem 3.3.18
   1 exists and so for every y     fn there exists a unique x     fn such that ax = y. in fact
a
   1y. thus a would be onto contrary to 3.). this shows 3.) implies 1.). (cid:4)
x = a
corollary 3.3.27 let a be an n    n matrix. then the following are equivalent.

1. det(a)   = 0.
2. a and at are one to one.

3. a is onto.

proof: this follows immediately from the above theorem.

3.4 the cayley hamilton theorem
de   nition 3.4.1 let a be an n    n matrix. the characteristic polynomial is de   ned as

pa (t)     det (ti     a)

and the solutions to pa (t) = 0 are called eigenvalues. for a a matrix and p (t) = tn +
an   1tn   1 +        + a1t + a0, denote by p (a) the matrix de   ned by

p (a)     an + an   1an   1 +        + a1a + a0i.

the explanation for the last term is that a0 is interpreted as i, the identity matrix.

the cayley hamilton theorem states that every matrix satis   es its characteristic equa-
tion, that equation de   ned by pa (t) = 0. it is one of the most important theorems in linear
algebra1. the following lemma will help with its proof.
lemma 3.4.2 suppose for all |  | large enough,

where the ai are n    n matrices. then each ai = 0.

a0 + a1   +        + am  m = 0,

proof: multiply by   

   1 + am = 0.
now let |  |         to obtain am = 0. with this, multiply by    to obtain

   m+1 +        + am   1  

a0  

   m to obtain
   m + a1  

   m+1 + a1  

   m+2 +        + am   1 = 0.

a0  

now let |  |         to obtain am   1 = 0. continue multiplying by    and letting            to
obtain that all the ai = 0. (cid:4)

with the lemma, here is a simple corollary.

1a special case was    rst proved by hamilton in 1853. the general case was announced by cayley some

time later and a proof was given by frobenius in 1878.

determinants

corollary 3.4.3 let ai and bi be n    n matrices and suppose

a0 + a1   +        + am  m = b0 + b1   +        + bm  m

for all |  | large enough. then ai = bi for all i. consequently if    is replaced by any n    n
matrix, the two sides will be equal. that is, for c any n    n matrix,

a0 + a1c +        + amc m = b0 + b1c +        + bmc m.

proof: subtract and use the result of the lemma. (cid:4)
with this preparation, here is a relatively easy proof of the cayley hamilton theorem.
theorem 3.4.4 let a be an n   n matrix and let p (  )     det (  i     a) be the characteristic
polynomial. then p (a) = 0.

proof: let c (  ) equal the transpose of the cofactor matrix of (  i     a) for |  | large.
(if |  | is large enough, then    cannot be in the    nite list of eigenvalues of a and so for such
  , (  i     a)

   1 exists.) therefore, by theorem 3.3.18

c (  ) = p (  ) (  i     a)

   1 .

note that each entry in c (  ) is a polynomial in    having degree no more than n     1.
therefore, collecting the terms,

c (  ) = c0 + c1   +        + cn   1  n   1
)
(
for cj some n    n matrix. it follows that for all |  | large enough,

and so corollary 3.4.3 may be used. it follows the matrix coe   cients corresponding to equal
powers of    are equal on both sides of this equation. therefore, if    is replaced with a, the
two sides will be equal. thus

(  i     a)
(
c0 + c1a +        + cn   1an   1

c0 + c1   +        + cn   1  n   1
)

0 = (a     a)

= p (a) i = p (a) .(cid:4)

= p (  ) i

now what if instead of numbers, the entries, a, b, c, d, e, f, g are matrices of a size such
that the multiplications and additions needed in the above formula all make sense. would
the formula be true in this case? i will show below that this is true.

suppose a is a matrix of the form

(3.17)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation3.5. block multiplication of matrices

99

such a matrix is called a block matrix, also a partitioned matrix. how do you get the

where aij is a si    pj matrix where si is constant for j = 1,       , m for each i = 1,       , r.
block aij? here is how for a an m    n matrix:

n  pj

(

}|
z
       0

0 isi  si 0

a

ipj  pj

{
      .

(3.18)

in the block column matrix on the right, you need to have cj     1 rows of zeros above the
small pj    pj identity matrix where the columns of a involved in aij are cj,       , cj + pj     1
and in the block row matrix on the left, you need to have ri     1 columns of zeros to the left
of the si    si identity matrix where the rows of a involved in aij are ri,       , ri + si. an

0

important observation to make is that the matrix on the right speci   es columns to use in
the block and the one on the left speci   es the rows used. thus the block aij in this case
is a matrix of size si    pj. there is no overlap between the blocks of a. thus the identity
n    n identity matrix corresponding to multiplication on the right of a is of the form

          ip1  p1

0

. . .

0

ipm  pm

         

where these little identity matrices don   t overlap. a similar conclusion follows from consid-
eration of the matrices isi  si. note that in (3.18) the matrix on the right is a block column
matrix for the above block diagonal matrix and the matrix on the left in (3.18) is a block
row matrix taken from a similar block diagonal matrix consisting of the isi  si .

next consider the question of multiplication of two block matrices. let b be a block

matrix of the form

          b11
and a is a block matrix of the form          a11

...
br1

...
ap1

(3.19)

(3.20)

and that for all i, j, it makes sense to multiply bisasj for all s     {1,       , p}. (that is the
two matrices, bis and asj are conformable.) and that for    xed ij, it follows bisasj is the
same size for each s so that it makes sense to write

s bisasj.

the following theorem says essentially that when you take the product of two matrices,
you can do it two ways. one way is to simply multiply them forming ba. the other way
is to partition both matrices, formally multiply the blocks to get another block matrix and
this one will be ba partitioned. before presenting this theorem, here is a simple lemma
which is really a special case of the theorem.

lemma 3.5.1 consider the following product.

       b1p

where the    rst is n   r and the second is r   n. the small identity matrix i is an r   r matrix
and there are l zero rows above i and l zero columns to the left of i in the right matrix.
then the product of these matrices is a block matrix of the form

which yields the claimed result. in the formula ej refers to the column vector of length r
which has a 1 in the jth position. (cid:4)
theorem 3.5.2 let b be a q   p block matrix as in (3.19) and let a be a p   n block matrix
as in (3.20) such that bis is conformable with asj and each product, bisasj for s = 1,       , p

is of the same size so they can be added. then ba can be obtained as a block matrix such
that the ijth block is of the form

bisasj.

where here it is assumed bis is ri    ps and asj is ps    qj. the product involves the sth
block in the ith row of blocks for b and the sth block in the jth column of a. thus there
are the same number of rows above the ips  ps as there are columns to the left of ips  ps in

the best kept secret in calculus courses is that the linear transformation determined

of the concept of derivative of a function of one variable. suppose the second partial

det (dg)   = 0 to prove the identity in this special case. then explain using problem 10
why there exists a sequence   k     0 such that for g  k (x)     g (x) +   kx, det (dg  k )   = 0
and so the identity holds for g  k . then take a limit to get the desired result in general.
this is an extremely important identity which has surprising implications. one can

4.1 elementary matrices

the elementary matrices result from doing a row operation to the identity matrix.

de   nition 4.1.1 the row operations consist of the following

1. switch two rows.

2. multiply a row by a nonzero number.

3. replace a row by a multiple of another row added to it.

the elementary matrices are given in the following de   nition.

de   nition 4.1.2 the elementary matrices consist of those matrices which result by apply-
ing a row operation to an identity matrix. those which involve switching rows of the identity

are called permutation matrices. more generally, if (i1, i2,       , in) is a permutation, a ma-
trix which has a 1 in the ik position in row k and zero in every other position of that row is
called a permutation matrix. thus each permutation corresponds to a unique permutation
matrix.

as an example of why these elementary matrices are interesting, consider the following.

row operations

the two exceptional rows are shown. the ith row was the jth and the jth row was the ith
in the identity matrix. now consider what this does to a column vector.

now denote by p ij the elementary matrix which comes from the identity from switching
rows i and j. from what was just explained consider multiplication on the left by this
elementary matrix.

from the way you multiply matrices this is a matrix which has the indicated columns.

this has established the following lemma.

lemma 4.1.3 let p ij denote the elementary matrix which involves switching the ith and
the jth rows. then

p ija = b

where b is obtained from a by switching the ith and the jth rows.

as a consequence of the above lemma, if you have any permutation (i1,       , in), it

follows from lemma 3.3.2 that the corresponding permutation matrix can be obtained by
multiplying    nitely many permutation matrices, each of which switch only two rows. now
every such permutation matrix in which only two rows are switched has determinant    1.
therefore, the determinant of the permutation matrix for (i1,       , in) equals (   1)p where

the given permutation can be obtained by making p switches. now p is not unique. there
are many ways to make switches and end up with a given permutation, but what this shows
is that the total number of switches is either always odd or always even. that is, you could
not obtain a given permutation by making 2m switches and 2k + 1 switches. a permutation
is said to be even if p is even and odd if p is odd. this is an interesting result in abstract
algebra which is obtained very easily from a consideration of elementary matrices and of
course the theory of the determinant. also, this shows that the composition of permutations
corresponds to the product of the corresponding permutation matrices.

to see permutations considered more directly in the context of group theory, you should

see a good abstract algebra book such as [17] or [13].

next consider the row operation which involves multiplying the ith row by a nonzero
constant, c. the elementary matrix which results from applying this operation to the ith

row of the identity matrix is of the form

this proves the following lemma.

where b is obtained from a by multiplying the ith row of a by c.

e (c, i) a = b

row operations

the next theorem is the main result.

theorem 4.1.6 to perform any of the three row operations on a matrix a it su   ces to do
the row operation on the identity matrix obtaining an elementary matrix e and then take
the product, ea. furthermore, each elementary matrix is invertible and its inverse is an
elementary matrix.

proof: the    rst part of this theorem has been proved in lemmas 4.1.3 - 4.1.5.

it
only remains to verify the claim about the inverses. consider    rst the elementary matrices
corresponding to row operation of type three.

e (   c    i + j) e (c    i + j) = i

this follows because the    rst matrix takes c times row i in the identity and adds it to row j.
when multiplied on the left by e (   c    i + j) it follows from the    rst part of this theorem
that you take the ith row of e (c    i + j) which coincides with the ith row of i since that
row was not changed, multiply it by    c and add to the jth row of e (c    i + j) which was
the jth row of i added to c times the ith row of i. thus e (   c    i + j) multiplied on the
left, undoes the row operation which resulted in e (c    i + j). the same argument applied
to the product

e (c    i + j) e (   c    i + j)

replacing c with    c in the argument yields that this product is also equal to i. therefore,
e (c    i + j)

   1 = e (   c    i + j) .

similar reasoning shows that for e (c, i) the elementary matrix which comes from mul-

tiplying the ith row by the nonzero constant, c,
   1 = e

e (c, i)

   1, i
c

.

finally, consider p ij which involves switching the ith and the jth rows.

p ijp ij = i

because by the    rst part of this theorem, multiplying on the left by p ij switches the ith
and jth rows of p ij which was obtained from switching the ith and jth rows of the identity.
first you switch them to get p ij and then you multiply on the left by p ij which switches
these rows again and restores the identity matrix. thus

= p ij. (cid:4)

4.2 the rank of a matrix

recall the following de   nition of rank of a matrix.

de   nition 4.2.1 a submatrix of a matrix a is the rectangular array of numbers obtained
by deleting some rows and columns of a. let a be an m    n matrix. the determinant
rank of the matrix equals r where r is the largest number such that some r    r submatrix
of a has a non zero determinant. the row rank is de   ned to be the dimension of the span
of the rows. the column rank is de   ned to be the dimension of the span of the columns.
the rank of a is denoted as rank (a).

the following theorem is proved in the section on the theory of the determinant and is

restated here for convenience.
theorem 4.2.2 let a be an m    n matrix. then the row rank, column rank and determi-
nant rank are all the same.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation4.2. the rank of a matrix

111

so how do you    nd the rank? it turns out that row operations are the key to the practical

computation of the rank of a matrix.

in rough terms, the following lemma states that linear relationships between columns

in a matrix are preserved by row operations.
lemma 4.2.3 let b and a be two m    n matrices and suppose b results from a row
operation applied to a. then the kth column of b is a linear combination of the i1,       , ir
columns of b if and only if the kth column of a is a linear combination of the i1,       , ir
relationship between the kth column of a and the i1,       , ir columns of a is the same as the
linear relationship between the kth column of b and the i1,       , ir columns of b.)

columns of a. furthermore, the scalars in the linear combination are the same. (the linear

proof: let a equal the following matrix in which the ak are the columns

(

an

b1 b2

)
)

       bn
   

crar.

r   s

crear =

   

r   s

and let b equal the following matrix in which the columns are given by the bk

then by theorem 4.1.6 on page 110 bk = eak where e is an elementary matrix. suppose
then that one of the columns of a is a linear combination of some other columns of a. say

then multiplying by e,

ak =

   

bk = eak =

r   s

crbr.(cid:4)

corollary 4.2.4 let a and b be two m    n matrices such that b is obtained by applying
a row operation to a. then the two matrices have the same rank.

proof: lemma 4.2.3 says the linear relationships are the same between the columns of

a and those of b. therefore, the column rank of the two matrices is the same. (cid:4)

this suggests that to    nd the rank of a matrix, one should do row operations until a

matrix is obtained in which its rank is obvious.

example 4.2.5 find the rank of the following matrix and identify columns whose linear

take (   1) times the    rst row and add to the second and then take (   3) times the    rst

by the above corollary, this matrix has the same rank as the    rst matrix. now take (   1)
times the second row and add to the third row yielding

row operations

at this point it is clear the rank is 2. this is because every column is in the span of the
   rst two and these    rst two columns are linearly independent.

now multiply the second row by 1/5 and add 5 times it to the last row.

(4.2)

(4.3)

it is now clear the rank of this matrix is 2 because the    rst and third columns form a

basis for the column space.

the matrix (4.3) is the row reduced echelon form for the matrix (4.2).

4.3 the row reduced echelon form

the following de   nition is for the row reduced echelon form of a matrix.

de   nition 4.3.1 let ei denote the column vector which has all zero entries except for the
ith slot which is one. an m  n matrix is said to be in row reduced echelon form if, in viewing
successive columns from left to right, the    rst nonzero column encountered is e1 and if you
have encountered e1, e2,       , ek, the next column is either ek+1 or is a linear combination
of the vectors, e1, e2,       , ek.

for example, here are some matrices which are in row reduced echelon form.

theorem 4.3.2 let a be an m    n matrix. then a has a row reduced echelon form
determined by a simple process.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation4.3. the row reduced echelon form

113

proof: viewing the columns of a from left to right take the    rst nonzero column. pick
a nonzero entry in this column and switch the row containing this entry with the top row of
a. now divide this new top row by the value of this nonzero entry to get a 1 in this position
and then use row operations to make all entries below this entry equal to zero. thus the
   rst nonzero column is now e1. denote the resulting matrix by a1. consider the submatrix
of a1 to the right of this column and below the    rst row. do exactly the same thing for it
that was done for a. this time the e1 will refer to fm   1. use this 1 and row operations
to zero out every entry above it in the rows of a1. call the resulting matrix a2. thus a2
satis   es the conditions of the above de   nition up to the column just encountered. continue
this way till every column has been dealt with and the result must be in row reduced echelon
form. (cid:4)

and if the    rst column consists of all zeros but the next one is not all zeros, you would get
something like this.

thus, after zeroing out the term in the top row above the 1, you get the following for the
next step in the computation of the row reduced echelon form for the original matrix.

next you look at the lower right matrix below the top two rows and to the right of the    rst
four columns and repeat the process.

de   nition 4.3.3 the    rst pivot column of a is the    rst nonzero column of a. the next
pivot column is the    rst column after this which is not a linear combination of the columns to
its left. the third pivot column is the next column after this which is not a linear combination

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation114

row operations

of those columns to its left, and so forth. thus by lemma 4.2.3 if a pivot column occurs
as the jth column from the left, it follows that in the row reduced echelon form there will be
one of the ek as the jth column.

there are three choices for row operations at each step in the above theorem. a natural
question is whether the same row reduced echelon matrix always results in the end from
following the above algorithm applied in any way. the next corollary says this is the case.

de   nition 4.3.4 two matrices are said to be row equivalent if one can be obtained from
the other by a sequence of row operations.

since every row operation can be obtained by multiplication on the left by an elementary
matrix and since each of these elementary matrices has an inverse which is also an elementary
matrix, it follows that row equivalence is a similarity relation. thus one can classify matrices
according to which similarity class they are in. later in the book, another more profound
way of classifying matrices will be presented.

it has been shown above that every matrix is row equivalent to one which is in row

reduced echelon form. note           x1

          = x1e1 +        + xnen

...
xn

so to say two column vectors are equal is to say they are the same linear combination of the
special vectors ej.

corollary 4.3.5 the row reduced echelon form is unique. that is if b, c are two matrices
in row reduced echelon form and both are row equivalent to a, then b = c.

proof: suppose b and c are both row reduced echelon forms for the matrix a. then
they clearly have the same zero columns since row operations leave zero columns unchanged.

if b has the sequence e1, e2,       , er occurring for the    rst time in the positions, i1, i2,       , ir,

the description of the row reduced echelon form means that each of these columns is not a
linear combination of the preceding columns. therefore, by lemma 4.2.3, the same is true of

the columns in positions i1, i2,       , ir for c. it follows from the description of the row reduced
echelon form, that e1,       , er occur respectively for the    rst time in columns i1, i2,       , ir

for c. thus b, c have the same columns in these positions. by lemma 4.2.3, the other
columns in the two matrices are linear combinations, involving the same scalars, of the
columns in the i1,       , ik position. thus each column of b is identical to the corresponding
column in c. (cid:4)

the above corollary shows that you can determine whether two matrices are row equiv-
alent by simply checking their row reduced echelon forms. the matrices are row equivalent
if and only if they have the same row reduced echelon form.

the following corollary follows.

corollary 4.3.6 let a be an m    n matrix and let r denote the row reduced echelon form
obtained from a by row operations. then there exists a sequence of elementary matrices,
e1,       , ep such that

(epep   1        e1) a = r.

proof: this follows from the fact that row operations are equivalent to multiplication

on the left by an elementary matrix. (cid:4)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation4.3. the row reduced echelon form
115
corollary 4.3.7 let a be an invertible n    n matrix. then a equals a    nite product of
elementary matrices.

proof: since a

   1 is given to exist, it follows a must have rank n because by theorem
3.3.18 det(a)   = 0 which says the determinant rank and hence the column rank of a is n
and so the row reduced echelon form of a is i because the columns of a form a linearly
independent set. therefore, by corollary 4.3.6 there is a sequence of elementary matrices,

e1,       , ep such that

(epep   1        e1) a = i.

   1
but now multiply on the left on both sides by e
p
until you get
       e

a = e

   1

   1
p   1e

   1
p

then by e

   1
p   1 and then by e

   1
p   2 etc.

and by theorem 4.1.6 each of these in this product is an elementary matrix.

corollary 4.3.8 the rank of a matrix equals the number of nonzero pivot columns. fur-
thermore, every column is contained in the span of the pivot columns.

proof: write the row reduced echelon form for the matrix. from corollary 4.2.4 this
row reduced matrix has the same rank as the original matrix. deleting all the zero rows
and all the columns in the row reduced echelon form which do not correspond to a pivot
column, yields an r    r identity submatrix in which r is the number of pivot columns. thus
the rank is at least r.

from lemma 4.2.3 every column of a is a linear combination of the pivot columns since
this is true by de   nition for the row reduced echelon form. therefore, the rank is no more
than r. (cid:4)

here is a fundamental observation related to the above.

corollary 4.3.9 suppose a is an m  n matrix and that m < n. that is, the number of rows
is less than the number of columns. then one of the columns of a is a linear combination
of the preceding columns of a.

proof: since m < n, not all the columns of a can be pivot columns. that is, in the
row reduced echelon form say ei occurs for the    rst time at ri where r1 < r2 <        < rp
where p     m. it follows since m < n, there exists some column in the row reduced echelon
form which is a linear combination of the preceding columns. by lemma 4.2.3 the same is
true of the columns of a. (cid:4)
de   nition 4.3.10 let a be an m  n matrix having rank, r. then the nullity of a is de   ned
to be n     r. also de   ne ker (a)     {x     fn : ax = 0} . this is also denoted as n (a) .

observation 4.3.11 note that ker (a) is a subspace because if a, b are scalars and x, y are
vectors in ker (a), then

a (ax + by) = aax + bay = 0 + 0 = 0

recall that the dimension of the column space of a matrix equals its rank and since the
column space is just a (fn) , the rank is just the dimension of a (fn). the next theorem
shows that the nullity equals the dimension of ker (a).
theorem 4.3.12 let a be an m    n matrix. then rank (a) + dim (ker (a)) = n..

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation116

row operations

proof: since ker (a) is a subspace, there exists a basis for ker (a) ,{x1,       , xk} . also
let {ay1,       , ayl} be a basis for a (fn). let u     fn. then there exist unique scalars ci

such that

it follows that

a

(

au =

i=1

l   
u    l   
l

ciayi

)

k   

ciyi

= 0

and so the vector in parenthesis is in ker (a). thus there exist unique bj such that

u =

ciyi +

bjxj

i=1

j=1

since u was arbitrary, this shows {x1,       , xk, y1,       , yl} spans fn.

if these vectors are
independent, then they will form a basis and the claimed equation will be obtained. suppose
then that

l   

k   

apply a to both sides. this yields

i=1

ciyi +

bjxj = 0

j=1

ciayi = 0

l   

i=1

and so each ci = 0. then the independence of the xj imply each bj = 0. (cid:4)

4.4 rank and existence of solutions to linear sys-

tems

consider the linear system of equations,

(4.4)
where a is an m    n matrix, x is a n    1 column vector, and b is an m    1 column vector.
suppose

ax = b

)

a =

a1

      

an

where the ak denote the columns of a. then x = (x1,       , xn)t is a solution of the system

(4.4), if and only if

x1a1 +        + xnan = b

which says that b is a vector in span (a1,       , an) . this shows that there exists a solution
to the system, (4.4) if and only if b is contained in span (a1,       , an) . in words, there is a

solution to (4.4) if and only if b is in the column space of a. in terms of rank, the following
proposition describes the situation.
proposition 4.4.1 let a be an m    n matrix and let b be an m    1 column vector. then
there exists a solution to (4.4) if and only if
a | b

= rank (a) .

4.5. fredholm alternative

117

proof: place

and a in row reduced echelon form, respectively b and c. if
the above condition on rank is true, then both b and c have the same number of nonzero
rows. in particular, you cannot have a row of the form

)

0    

where       = 0 in b. therefore, there will exist a solution to the system (4.4).

conversely, suppose there exists a solution. this means there cannot be such a row in b
described above. therefore, b and c must have the same number of zero rows and so they
have the same number of nonzero rows. therefore, the rank of the two matrices in (4.5) is
the same. (cid:4)

4.5 fredholm alternative

there is a very useful version of proposition 4.4.1 known as the fredholm alternative.
i will only present this for the case of real matrices here. later a much more elegant and
general approach is presented which allows for the general case of complex matrices.

the following de   nition is used to state the fredholm alternative.

proof: this follows right away from the de   nition of the inner product and matrix

now it is time to state the fredholm alternative. the    rst version of this is the following

theorem.
theorem 4.5.3 let a be a real m    n matrix and let b     rm. there exists a solution, x
to the equation ax = b if and only if b     ker

at

proof: first suppose b     ker

b    x = 0. in other words, taking the transpose, if

at

. then this says that if at x = 0, it follows that

(

)   

xt a = 0, then xt b = 0.

(
)

thus, if p is a product of elementary matrices such that p a is in row reduced echelon form,
then if p a has a row of zeros, in the kth position, then there is also a zero in the kth position
of p b. thus rank
= rank (a) .by proposition 4.4.1, there exists a solution, x
to the system ax = b. it remains to go the other direction.

a | b
and suppose ax = b. i need to verify b    z = 0. by lemma 4.5.2,

let z     ker

(

b    z = ax    z = x    at z = x    0 = 0 (cid:4)

this implies the following corollary which is also called the fredholm alternative. the

   alternative    becomes more clear in this corollary.

corollary 4.5.4 let a be an m    n matrix. then a maps rn onto rm if and only if the
only solution to at x = 0 is x = 0.

row operations

proof: if the only solution to at x = 0 is x = 0, then ker

(
= {0} and so ker
=
rm because every b     rm has the property that b    0 = 0. therefore, ax = b has a solu-
)   
tion for any b     rm because the b for which there is a solution are those in ker
by
theorem 4.5.3. in other words, a maps rn onto rm.
and so if
at x = 0, then b    x = 0 for every b. in particular, this holds for b = x. hence if at x = 0,
then x = 0. (cid:4)

the reason for this is that at is an n   m where m > n and so in the augmented matrix

5.1 lu factorization

(

)

an lu factorization of a matrix involves writing the given matrix as the product of a
lower triangular matrix which has the main diagonal consisting entirely of ones, l, and an
upper triangular matrix u in the indicated order. the l goes with    lower    and the u with
   upper   . it turns out many matrices can be written in this way and when this is possible,
people get excited about slick ways of solving the system of equations, ax = y. the method
lacks generality but is of interest just the same.

example 5.1.1 can you write

in the form lu as just described?

to do so you would need

x 1

a b

c

xa xb + c

)

(

)

.

therefore, b = 1 and a = 0. also, from the bottom rows, xa = 1 which can   t happen and
have a = 0. therefore, you can   t write this matrix in the form lu. it has no lu factorization.
this is what i mean above by saying the method lacks generality.

which matrices have an lu factorization? it turns out it is those whose row reduced
echelon form can be achieved without switching rows and which only involve row operations
of type 3 in which row j is replaced with a multiple of row i added to row j for i < j.

5.2 finding an lu factorization

there is a convenient procedure for    nding an lu factorization.
it turns out that it is
only necessary to keep track of the multipliers which are used to row reduce to upper
triangular form. this procedure is described in the following examples and is called the
multiplier method. it is due to dolittle.

some factorizations

the process involves doing row operations to the matrix on the right while simultaneously
updating successive columns of the matrix on the left. first take    2 times the    rst row and
add to the second in the matrix on the right.

note the method for updating the matrix on the left. the 2 in the second entry of the    rst
column is there because    2 times the    rst row of a added to the second row of a produced
a 0. now replace the third row in the matrix on the right by    1 times the    rst row added

finally, add the second row to the bottom row and make the following changes

at this point, stop because the matrix on the right is upper triangular. an lu factorization
is the above.

the justi   cation for this gimmick will be given later.

this time everything is done at once for a whole column. this saves trouble. first
multiply the    rst row by (   1) and then add to the last row. next take (   2) times the    rst
and add to the second and then (   2) times the    rst and add to the third.

this    nishes the    rst column of l and the    rst column of u. now take     (1/4) times the
second row in the matrix on the right and add to the third followed by     (1/2) times the

second added to the last.             1

this    nishes the second column of l as well as the second column of u . since the matrix
on the right is upper triangular, stop. the lu factorization has now been obtained. this
technique is called dolittle   s method. ii

this process is entirely typical of the general case. the matrix u is just the    rst upper
triangular matrix you come to in your quest for the row reduced echelon form using only

the row operation which involves replacing a row by itself added to a multiple of another
row. the matrix l is what you get by updating the identity matrix as illustrated above.

you should note that for a square matrix, the number of row operations necessary to
reduce to lu form is about half the number needed to place the matrix in row reduced
echelon form. this is why an lu factorization is of interest in solving systems of equations.

5.3 solving linear systems using an lu factorization

the reason people care about the lu factorization is it allows the quick solution of systems
of equations. here is an example.

let u x = y and consider ly = b where in this case, b = (1, 2, 3)t . thus

of course one way is to write the augmented matrix and grind away. however, this
involves more row operations than the computation of an lu factorization and it turns out
that an lu factorization can give the solution quickly. here is how. the following is an lu
factorization for the matrix.

it may seem like a trivial thing but it is used because it cuts down on the number of
operations involved in    nding a solution to a system of equations enough that it makes a
di   erence for large systems.

in this case, there is another factorization which is useful called a p lu factorization. here
p is a permutation matrix.

example 5.4.1 find a p lu factorization for the above matrix in (5.1).

proceed as before trying to    nd the row echelon form of the matrix. first add    1 times

the    rst row to the second row and then add    4 times the    rst to the third. this yields

there is no way to do only row operations involving replacing a row with itself added to a
multiple of another row to the second matrix in such a way as to obtain an upper triangular
matrix. therefore, consider m with the bottom two rows switched.

now try again with this matrix. first take    1 times the    rst row and add to the bottom
row and then take    4 times the    rst row and add to the second row. this yields

using only the row operations which involve replacing a row with itself added to a multiple
of another row. it is not ever necessary to switch rows. thus every row which is replaced
using this row operation in obtaining the echelon form may be modi   ed by using a row
which is above it. furthermore, in the multiplier method for    nding the lu factorization,
we zero out the elements below the pivot entry in    rst column and then the next and so on
when scanning from the left. in terms of elementary matrices, this means the row operations
used to reduce a to upper triangular form correspond to multiplication on the left by lower
triangular matrices having all ones down the main diagonal and the sequence of elementary
matrices which row reduces a has the property that in scanning the list of elementary
matrices from the right to the left, this list consists of several matrices which involve only
changes from the identity in the    rst column, then several which involve only changes from

the identity in the second column and so forth. more precisely, ep        e1a = u where u
is upper triangular, each ei is a lower triangular elementary matrix having all ones down
       e1 di   ers from the identity only in the    rst

now each of the e
is also lower triangular with 1 down the main diagonal. therefore

note that scanning from left to right, the    rst two in the product involve changes in the
identity only in the    rst column while in the third matrix, the change is only in the second.

however, it is important to be working from the left to the right, one column at a time.
a similar observation holds in any dimension. multiplying the elementary matrices which
involve a change only in the jth column you obtain a equal to an upper triangular, n    m
matrix u which is multiplied by a sequence of lower triangular matrices on its left which is
of the following form, in which the aij are negatives of multipliers used in row reducing to
an upper triangular matrix.

notice how the end result of the id127 made no change in the aij. it just
   lled in the empty spaces with the aij which occurred in one of the matrices in the product.
this is why, in computing l, it is su   cient to begin with the left column and work column
by column toward the right, replacing entries with the negative of the multiplier used in the
row operation which produces a zero in that entry.

5.6 existence for the p lu factorization
here i will consider an invertible n    n matrix and show that such a matrix always has
a p lu factorization. more general matrices could also be considered but this is all i will
present.

let a be such an invertible matrix and consider the    rst column of a. if a11   = 0, use
this to zero out everything below it. the entry a11 is called the pivot. thus in this case
there is a lower triangular matrix l1 which has all ones on the diagonal such that

l1p1a =

)

here p1 = i. in case a11 = 0, let r be such that ar1   = 0 and r is the    rst entry for which
this happens. in this case, let p1 be the permutation matrix which switches the    rst row
and the rth row. then as before, there exists a lower triangular matrix l1 which has all
ones on the diagonal such that (5.2) holds in this case also. in the    rst column, this l1 has
zeros between the    rst row and the rth row.

and l2 has all the subdiagonal entries equal to 0 except possibly some nonzero entries in
the second column starting with position r2 where p2 switches rows r2 and 2. continuing
this way, it follows there are lower triangular matrices lj having all ones down the diagonal
and permutation matrices pi which switch only two rows such that
ln   1pn   1ln   2pn   2ln   3        l2p2l1p1a = u

(5.3)

where u is upper triangular. the matrix lj has all zeros below the main diagonal except
for the jth column and even in this column it has zeros between position j and rj where pj
switches rows j and rj. of course in the case where no switching is necessary, you could get
all nonzero entries below the main diagonal in the jth column for lj.
the fact that lj is the identity except for the jth column means that each pk for k > j
almost commutes with lj. say pk switches the kth and the qth rows for q     k > j. when
you place pk on the right of lj it just switches the kth and the qth columns and leaves the
jth column unchanged. therefore, the same result as placing pk on the left of lj can be
obtained by placing pk on the right of lj and modifying lj by switching the kth and the qth
entries in the jth column. (note this could possibly interchange a 0 for something nonzero.)
it follows from (5.3) there exists p, the product of permutation matrices, p = pn   1        p1

each of which switches two rows, and l a lower triangular matrix having all ones on the

it is customary to write this more simply as

a = p lu

where l is an upper triangular matrix having all ones on the diagonal and p is a permutation

matrix consisting of p1        pn   1 as described above. this proves the following theorem.
theorem 5.6.1 let a be any invertible n    n matrix. then there exists a permutation
matrix p and a lower triangular matrix l having all ones on the main diagonal and an
upper triangular matrix u such that

a = p lu

5.7 the qr factorization

as pointed out above, the lu factorization is not a mathematically respectable thing be-
cause it does not always exist. there is another factorization which does always exist.
much more can be said about it than i will say here. at this time, i will only deal with real
matrices and so the inner product will be the usual real dot product.
de   nition 5.7.1 an n    n real matrix q is called an orthogonal matrix if

qqt = qt q = i.

thus an orthogonal matrix is one whose inverse is equal to its transpose.

first note that if a matrix is orthogonal this says

this shows that orthogonal transformations preserve distances. you can show that if you
have a matrix which does preserve distances, then it must be orthogonal also.

example 5.7.2 one of the most important examples of an orthogonal matrix is the so
called householder matrix. you have v a unit vector and you form the matrix

i     2vvt

this is an orthogonal matrix which is also symmetric. to see this, you use the rules of
matrix operations.

= i     2vvt

2vvt

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation5.7. the qr factorization

131

so it is symmetric. now to show it is orthogonal,

(
i     2vvt

)(

i     2vvt

)

= i     2vvt     2vvt + 4vvt vvt
= i     4vvt + 4vvt = i

because vt v = v    v =|v|2 = 1. therefore, this is an example of an orthogonal matrix.

consider the following problem.

problem 5.7.3 given two vectors x, y such that |x| = |y|   = 0 but x   = y and you want an
orthogonal matrix q such that qx = y and qy = x. the thing which works is the house-
holder matrix

q     i     2

x     y
|x     y|2 (x     y)t

here is why this works.

q (x     y) = (x     y)     2
= (x     y)     2

x     y
|x     y|2 (x     y)t (x     y)
x     y
|x     y|2 = y     x
|x     y|2

q (x + y) = (x + y)     2
= (x + y)     2
= (x + y)     2

x     y
|x     y|2 (x     y)t (x + y)
x     y
)
|x     y|2 ((x     y)    (x + y))
x     y
|x     y|2

|x|2     |y|2

(

= x + y

hence

qx + qy = x + y
qx     qy = y     x

adding these equations, 2qx = 2y and subtracting them yields 2qy = 2x.

a picture of the geometric signi   cance follows.

the orthogonal matrix q re   ects across the dotted line taking x to y and y to x.

de   nition 5.7.4 let a be an m   n matrix. then a qr factorization of a consists of two
matrices, q orthogonal and r upper triangular (right triangular) having all the entries on
the main diagonal nonnegative such that a = qr.

some factorizations

with the solution to this simple problem, here is how to obtain a qr factorization for

any matrix a. let

where the ai are the columns. if a1 = 0, let q1 = i. if a1   = 0, let

a = (a1, a2,       , an)

               

                |a1|

and form the householder matrix

as in the above problem q1a1 = b and so

where a2 is a m   1  n   1 matrix. now    nd in the same way as was just done a m   1  m   1

matrix bq2 such that

then

continuing this way until the result is upper triangular, you get a sequence of orthogonal

matrices qpqp   1        q1 such that

qpqp   1        q1a = r

(5.4)

where r is upper triangular.

now if q1 and q2 are orthogonal, then from properties of id127,

q1q2 (q1q2)t = q1q2qt

2 qt

1 = q1iqt

1 = i

and similarly

(q1q2)t q1q2 = i.

thus the product of orthogonal matrices is orthogonal. also the transpose of an orthogonal
matrix is orthogonal directly from the de   nition. therefore, from (5.4)

a = (qpqp   1        q1)t r     qr.

this proves the following theorem.

6.1 simple geometric considerations

one of the most important uses of row operations is in solving linear program problems
which involve maximizing a linear function subject to inequality constraints determined
from linear equations. here is an example. a certain hamburger store has 9000 hamburger
patties to use in one week and a limitless supply of special sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions,
and buns. they sell two types of hamburgers, the big stack and the basic burger. it has also
been determined that the employees cannot prepare more than 9000 of either type in one
week. the big stack, popular with the teenagers from the local high school, involves two
patties, lots of delicious sauce, condiments galore, and a divider between the two patties.
the basic burger, very popular with children, involves only one patty and some pickles
and ketchup. demand for the basic burger is twice what it is for the big stack. what
is the maximum number of hamburgers which could be sold in one week given the above
limitations?

let x be the number of basic burgers and y the number of big stacks which could be sold
in a week. thus it is desired to maximize z = x + y subject to the above constraints. the
total number of patties is 9000 and so the number of patty used is x+2y. this number must
satisfy x + 2y     9000 because there are only 9000 patty available. because of the limitation
on the number the employees can prepare and the demand, it follows 2x + y     9000.
you never sell a negative number of hamburgers and so x, y     0. in simpler terms the
problem reduces to maximizing z = x + y subject to the two constraints, x + 2y     9000 and
2x + y     9000. this problem is pretty easy to solve geometrically. consider the following
picture in which r labels the region described by the above inequalities and the line z = x+y
is shown for a particular value of z.

x + y = z

2x + y = 4

r

x + 2y = 4

as you make z larger this line moves away from the origin, always having the same slope

135

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation136

id135

and the desired solution would consist of a point in the region, r which makes z as large as
possible or equivalently one for which the line is as far as possible from the origin. clearly
this point is the point of intersection of the two lines, (3000, 3000) and so the maximum
value of the given function is 6000. of course this type of procedure is    ne for a situation in
which there are only two variables but what about a similar problem in which there are very
many variables. in reality, this hamburger store makes many more types of burgers than
those two and there are many considerations other than demand and available patty. each
will likely give you a constraint which must be considered in order to solve a more realistic
problem and the end result will likely be a problem in many dimensions, probably many
more than three so your ability to draw a picture will get you nowhere for such a problem.
another method is needed. this method is the topic of this section. i will illustrate with
this particular problem. let x1 = x and y = x2. also let x3 and x4 be nonnegative variables
such that

to say that x3 and x4 are nonnegative is the same as saying x1 + 2x2     9000 and 2x1 + x2    

x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 9000, 2x1 + x2 + x4 = 9000.

9000 and these variables are called slack variables at this point. they are called this because
they    take up the slack   .
i will discuss these more later. first a general situation is
considered.

z0 is the value of z at the point x0. the augmented matrix of (6.9) is called the simplex
tableau and it is the beginning point for the simplex algorithm to be described a little
later. it is very convenient to express the simplex tableau in the above form in which the

)

variables are possibly permuted in order to have

on the left side. however, as far

as the simplex algorithm is concerned it is not necessary to be permuting the variables in
this manner. starting with (6.9) you could permute the variables and columns to obtain an
augmented matrix in which the variables are in their original order. what is really required
for the simplex tableau?
it is an augmented m + 1    m + n + 2 matrix which represents a system of equations

(possibly the variables for x are taken in another order.) there are m linearly independent
columns in the    rst m + n columns for which there is only one nonzero entry, a 1 in one of
the    rst m rows, the    simple columns   , the other    rst m + n columns being the    nonsimple
columns   . as in the above, the variables corresponding to the simple columns are xb,
the basic variables and those corresponding to the nonsimple columns are xf , the free
variables. also, the top m entries of the last column on the right are nonnegative. this is
the description of a simplex tableau.

in a simplex tableau it is easy to spot a basic feasible solution. you can see one quickly
by setting the variables, xf corresponding to the nonsimple columns equal to zero. then
the other variables, corresponding to the simple columns are each equal to a nonnegative
entry in the far right column. lets call this an    obvious basic feasible solution   . if a
solution is obtained by setting the variables corresponding to the nonsimple columns equal
to zero and the variables corresponding to the simple columns equal to zero this will be
referred to as an    obvious    solution. lets also call the    rst m + n entries in the bottom
row the    bottom left row   . in a simplex tableau, the entry in the bottom right corner gives
the value of the variable being maximized or minimized when the obvious basic feasible
solution is chosen.

the following is a special case of the general theory presented above and shows how such
a special case can be    t into the above framework. the following example is rather typical
of the sorts of problems considered. it involves inequality constraints instead of ax = b.
this is handled by adding in    slack variables    as explained below.

the idea is to obtain an augmented matrix for the constraints such that obvious solutions
are also feasible. then there is an algorithm, to be presented later, which takes you from
one obvious feasible solution to another until you obtain the maximum.

example 6.2.2 consider z = x1   x2 subject to the constraints, x1+2x2     10, x1+2x2     2,
and 2x1 + x2     6, xi     0. find a simplex tableau for a problem of the form x     0,ax = b

which is equivalent to the above problem.

you add in slack variables. these are positive variables, one for each of the    rst three con-
straints, which change the    rst three inequalities into equations. thus the    rst three inequal-

ities become x1 +2x2 +x3 = 10, x1 +2x2   x4 = 2, and 2x1 +x2 +x5 = 6, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5     0.

now it is necessary to    nd a basic feasible solution. you mainly need to    nd a positive so-

139

lution to the equations,

x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 10
x1 + 2x2     x4 = 2
2x1 + x2 + x5 = 6

the solution set for the above system is given by

an easy way to get a basic feasible solution is to let x4 = 8 and x5 = 1. then a feasible
solution is

next, as described above, take the row reduced echelon form of the top three lines of the
above matrix. this yields

and this is a simplex tableau. the variables are x2, x4, x5, x1, x3, z.

it isn   t as hard as it may appear from the above. lets not permute the variables and

simply    nd an acceptable simplex tableau as described above.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation140

id135

example 6.2.3 consider z = x1   x2 subject to the constraints, x1+2x2     10, x1+2x2     2,
and 2x1 + x2     6, xi     0. find a simplex tableau.

adding in slack variables, an augmented matrix which is descriptive of the constraints

is

the obvious solution is not feasible because of that -1 in the fourth column. when you let

x1, x2 = 0, you end up having x4 =    6 which is negative. consider the second column and

select the 2 as a pivot to zero out that which is above and below the 2.

this one is good. when you let x1 = x4 = 0, you    nd that x2 = 3, x3 = 4, x5 = 3. the
obvious solution is now feasible. you can now assemble the simplex tableau. the    rst step
is to include a column and row for z. this yields

now you need to get zeros in the right places so the simple columns will be preserved as
simple columns in this larger matrix. this means you need to zero out the 1 in the third
column on the bottom. a simplex tableau is now

note it is not the same one obtained earlier. there is no reason a simplex tableau should
be unique. in fact, it follows from the above general description that you have one for each
basic feasible point of the region determined by the constraints.

6.3 the simplex algorithm

6.3.1 maximums

the simplex algorithm takes you from one basic feasible solution to another while maxi-
mizing or minimizing the function you are trying to maximize or minimize. algebraically,
it takes you from one simplex tableau to another in which the lower right corner either
increases in the case of maximization or decreases in the case of minimization.

i will continue writing the simplex tableau in such a way that the simple columns having
only one entry nonzero are on the left. as explained above, this amounts to permuting the
variables. i will do this because it is possible to describe what is going on without onerous
notation. however, in the examples, i won   t worry so much about it. thus, from a basic
feasible solution, a simplex tableau of the following form has been obtained in which the

columns for the basic variables, xb are listed    rst and b     0.

i = 0 for i > m. then

is a basic feasible solution.

is a solution to the above

if ci < 0 for some i, and if fji     0 so that a whole column of

is     0 with the
bottom entry < 0, then letting xi be the variable corresponding to that column, you could
leave all the other entries of xf equal to zero but change xi to be positive. let the new
vector be denoted by x

   
f and letting x

   
f it follows

b = b     f x

now this shows (x
b, x
arbitrarily large and positive and conclude there is no maximum for z because

   
f ) is feasible whenever xi > 0 and so you could let xi become

z = (   ci) xi + z0

(6.11)

if this happens in a simplex tableau, you can say there is no maximum and stop.

what if c     0? then z = z0     cxf and to satisfy the constraints, you need xf     0.
therefore, in this case, z0 is the largest possible value of z and so the maximum has been
(
found. you stop when this occurs. next i explain what to do if neither of the above stopping
conditions hold.

the only case which remains is that some ci < 0 and some fji > 0. you pick a column

in

in which ci < 0, usually the one for which ci is the largest in absolute value.

f
c

you pick fji > 0 as a pivot element, divide the jth row by fji and then use to obtain
zeros above fji and below fji, thus obtaining a new simple column. this row operation
also makes exactly one of the other simple columns into a nonsimple column. (in terms of
variables, it is said that a free variable becomes a basic variable and a basic variable becomes
a free variable.) now permuting the columns and variables, yields

you don   t pick just any fji when you do these row operations. you pick the positive one
        0. otherwise the obvious basic feasible
for which the row operation results in b
f = 0 will fail to satisfy the constraint that x     0.

now if fki     0 the above holds. therefore, you only need to check fpi for fpi > 0. the
pivot, fji is the one which makes the quotients of the form

having gotten a new simplex tableau, you do the same thing to it which was just done
and continue. as long as b > 0, so you don   t encounter the degenerate case, the values
for z associated with setting xf = 0 keep getting strictly larger every time the process is
repeated. you keep going until you    nd c     0. then you stop. you are at a maximum.
problems can occur in the process in the so called degenerate case when at some stage of
the process some bj = 0. in this case you can cycle through di   erent values for x with no
improvement in z. this case will not be discussed here.

example 6.3.1 maximize 2x1 + 3x2 subject to the constraints x1 + x2     1, 2x1 + x2    
6, x1 + 2x2     6, x1, x2     0.

the constraints are of the form

where the x3, x4, x5 are the slack variables. an augmented matrix for these equations is of
the form

obviously the obvious solution is not feasible. it results in x3 < 0. we need to exchange
basic variables. lets just try something.

now this one is all right because the obvious solution is feasible. letting x2 = x3 = 0,
it follows that the obvious solution is feasible. now we add in the objective function as
described above.

then do row operations to leave the simple columns the same. then

x1 + x2     x3 = 1
2x1 + x2 + x4 = 6
x1 + 2x2 + x5 = 6

the lower right corner nonnegative. thus the next tableau is

there is still a negative number there to the left of the 1 in the bottom row. the new ratios
are 4/2, 5/1 so the new pivot is the 2 in the third column. thus the next tableau is

still, there is a negative number in the bottom row to the left of the 1 so the process does
not stop yet. the ratios are 3/ (3/2) and 3/ (1/2) and so the new pivot is that 3/2 in the
   rst column. thus the new tableau is

now stop. the maximum value is 10. this is an easy enough problem to do geometrically
and so you can easily verify that this is the right answer. it occurs when x4 = x5 = 0, x1 =
2, x2 = 2, x3 = 3.

6.3.2 minimums

how does it di   er if you are    nding a minimum? from a basic feasible solution, a simplex
tableau of the following form has been obtained in which the simple columns for the basic

variables, xb are listed    rst and b     0.(

i = bi for i = 1,       , m and x0

suppose    rst that some ci > 0 and fji     0 for each j. then let x

   
f consist of changing xi
by making it positive but leaving the other entries of xf equal to 0. then from the bottom
row,

z =    cixi + z0

b = b     f x
   
   
and you let x

    0. thus the constraints continue to hold when xi is made

next suppose c     0. then in this case, z = z0     cxf and from the constraints, xf     0
and so    cxf     0 and so z0 is the minimum value and you stop since this is what you are

looking for.

what do you do in the case where some ci > 0 and some fji > 0? in this case, you use
the simplex algorithm as in the case of maximums to obtain a new simplex tableau in which

z0

as in the case of maximums no problem can occur and the process will converge unless
you have the degenerate case in which some bj = 0. as in the earlier case, this is most
unfortunate when it occurs. you see what happens of course. z0 does not change and the
algorithm just delivers di   erent values of the variables forever with no improvement.

to summarize the geometrical signi   cance of the simplex algorithm, it takes you from one
corner of the feasible region to another. you go in one direction to    nd the maximum and
in another to    nd the minimum. for the maximum you try to get rid of negative entries of c
and for minimums you try to eliminate positive entries of c, where the method of elimination
involves the auspicious use of an appropriate pivot element and row operations.

now return to example 6.2.2. it will be modi   ed to be a maximization problem.

example 6.3.2 maximize z = x1     x2 subject to the constraints,

x1 + 2x2     10, x1 + 2x2     2,

and 2x1 + x2     6, xi     0.

recall this is the same as maximizing z = x1     x2 subject to

the variables, x3, x4, x5 being slack variables. recall the simplex tableau was

with the variables ordered as x2, x4, x5, x1, x3 and so xb = (x2, x4, x5) and

xf = (x1, x3) .

apply the simplex algorithm to the fourth column because     3

2 < 0 and this is the most
negative entry in the bottom row. the pivot is 3/2 because 1/(3/2) = 2/3 < 5/ (1/2) .
dividing this row by 3/2 and then using this to zero out the other elements in that column,

the new simplex tableau is              1 0     1

now there is still a negative number in the bottom left row. therefore, the process should
be continued. this time the pivot is the 2/3 in the top of the column. dividing the top row

now all the numbers on the bottom left row are nonnegative so the process stops. now
recall the variables and columns were ordered as x2, x4, x5, x1, x3. the solution in terms of
x1 and x2 is x2 = 0 and x1 = 3 and z = 3. note that in the above, i did not worry about
permuting the columns to keep those which go with the basic variables on the left.

here is a bucolic example.

this information is available to a pig farmer and fi denotes a particular feed. the numbers
in the table contain the number of units of a particular nutrient contained in one pound of
the given feed. thus f2 has 2 units of iron in one pound. now suppose the cost of each feed
in cents per pound is given in the following table.

f1 f2 f3 f4

a typical pig needs 5 units of iron, 8 of protein, 6 of folic acid, 7 of copper and 4 of calcium.
(the units may change from nutrient to nutrient.) how many pounds of each feed per pig
should the pig farmer use in order to minimize his cost?

his problem is to minimize c     2x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 subject to the constraints

x1 + 2x2 + x3 + 3x4     5,
5x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + x4     8,
x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 + x4     6,
2x1 + x2 + x3 + x4     7,
x1 + x2 + x3 + x4     4.

where each xi     0. add in the slack variables,

x1 + 2x2 + x3 + 3x4     x5 = 5
5x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + x4     x6 = 8
x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 + x4     x7 = 6
2x1 + x2 + x3 + x4     x8 = 7
x1 + x2 + x3 + x4     x9 = 4

how in the world can you    nd a basic feasible solution? remember the simplex algorithm
is designed to keep the entries in the right column nonnegative so you use this algorithm a
few times till the obvious solution is a basic feasible solution.

consider the    rst column. the pivot is the 5. using the row operations described in the

now go to the second column. the pivot in this column is the 7/5. this is in a di   erent
row than the pivot in the    rst column so i will use it to zero out everything below it. this
will get rid of the zeros in the    fth column and introduce zeros in the second. this yields

now consider another column, this time the fourth.
i will pick this one because it has
some negative numbers in it so there are fewer entries to check in looking for a pivot.
unfortunately, the pivot is the top 2 and i don   t want to pivot on this because it would
destroy the zeros in the second column. consider the    fth column. it is also not a good
choice because the pivot is the second element from the top and this would destroy the zeros
in the    rst column. consider the sixth column. i can use either of the two bottom entries

as the pivot. the matrix is                   0 1

next consider the third column. the pivot is the 1 in the third row. this yields

there are still 5 columns which consist entirely of zeros except for one entry. four of them
have that entry equal to 1 but one still has a -1 in it, the -1 being in the fourth column.

now the obvious basic solution is feasible. you let x4 = 0 = x5 = x7 = x8 and x1 =
8/3, x2 = 2/3, x3 = 1, and x6 = 28/3. you don   t need to worry too much about this. it is
the above matrix which is desired. now you can assemble the simplex tableau and begin
the algorithm. remember c     2x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + 3x4. first add the row and column which

now you do row operations to keep the simple columns of (6.15) simple in (6.16). of course
you could permute the columns if you wanted but this is not necessary.

this yields the following for a simplex tableau. now it is a matter of getting rid of the

positive entries in the bottom row because you are trying to minimize.

x1 = 18/7, x2 = 0, x3 = 11/7, x4 = 2/7.

there is a column consisting of all negative entries. there is therefore, no maximum. note
also how there is no way to pick the pivot in that column.

example 6.3.4 minimize z = x1     3x2 + x3 subject to the constraints x1 + x2 + x3    
10, x1 + x2 + x3     2, x1 + x2 + 3x3     8 and x1 + 2x2 + x3     7 with all variables nonnegative.

there exists an answer because the region de   ned by the constraints is closed and
bounded. adding in slack variables you get the following augmented matrix corresponding
to the constraints.

   1 in it. therefore, i will use the simplex algorithm to make this column non simple. the
third column has the 1 in the second row as the pivot so i will use this column. this yields

the desire is to minimize this so you need to get rid of the positive entries in the left bottom

row of this column. thus the next tableau is

now consider the same problem but change the word, minimize to the word, maximize.

row. there is a    1. use this column. the pivot is the 3. the next tableau is

there is still a negative entry, the    2/3. this will be the new pivot column. the pivot is
the 2/3 on the fourth row. this yields

and the process stops. the maximum for z is 7 and it occurs when x1 = 13/2, x2 = 0, x3 =
1/2.

6.4 finding a basic feasible solution

by now it should be fairly clear that    nding a basic feasible solution can create considerable
di   culty. indeed, given a system of linear inequalities along with the requirement that each
variable be nonnegative, do there even exist points satisfying all these inequalities? if you
have many variables, you can   t answer this by drawing a picture. is there some other way
to do this which is more systematic than what was presented above? the answer is yes. it
is called the method of arti   cial variables. i will illustrate this method with an example.

example 6.4.1 find a basic feasible solution to the system 2x1 +x2   x3     3, x1 +x2 +x3    
2, x1 + x2 + x3     7 and x     0.

(6.18)

the obvious solution is not feasible. this is why it would be hard to get started with
the simplex method. what is the problem? it is those    1 entries in the fourth and    fth
columns. to get around this, you add in arti   cial variables to get an augmented matrix of
the form

performing the row operation, this yields an initial simplex tableau,

6.4. finding a basic feasible solution

151

thus the variables are x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8. suppose you can    nd a feasible solution
to the system of equations represented by the above augmented matrix. thus all variables
are nonnegative. suppose also that it can be done in such a way that x8 and x7 happen
to be 0. then it will follow that x1,       , x6 is a feasible solution for (6.18). conversely, if
you can    nd a feasible solution for (6.18), then letting x7 and x8 both equal zero, you have
obtained a feasible solution to (6.19). since all variables are nonnegative, x7 and x8 both
equalling zero is equivalent to saying the minimum of z = x7 + x8 subject to the constraints
represented by the above augmented matrix equals zero. this has proved the following
simple observation.

observation 6.4.2 there exists a feasible solution to the constraints represented by the
augmented matrix of (6.18) and x     0 if and only if the minimum of x7 + x8 subject to the
constraints of (6.19) and x     0 exists and equals 0.

of course a similar observation would hold in other similar situations. now the point of
all this is that it is trivial to see a feasible solution to (6.19), namely x6 = 7, x7 = 3, x8 = 2
and all the other variables may be set to equal zero. therefore, it is easy to    nd an initial
simplex tableau for the minimization problem just described. first add the column and row
for z

and you see there are only nonpositive numbers on the bottom left column so the process
stops and yields 0 for the minimum of z = x7 +x8. as for the other variables, x1 = 5/3, x2 =
0, x3 = 1/3, x4 = 0, x5 = 0, x6 = 5. now as explained in the above observation, this is a
basic feasible solution for the original system (6.18).

now consider a maximization problem associated with the above constraints.

now the algorithm involves getting rid of the positive entries on the left bottom row. begin
with the    rst column. the pivot is the 2. an application of the simplex algorithm yields
the new tableau

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationand you    rst do row operations to make the    rst and third columns simple columns. thus

you are trying to get rid of negative entries in the bottom left row. there is only one, the
   5/3. the pivot is the 1. the next simplex tableau is then

and so the maximum value of z is 32/3 and it occurs when x1 = 10/3, x2 = 0 and x3 = 11/3.

6.5 duality

you can solve minimization problems by solving maximization problems. you can also go
the other direction and solve maximization problems by minimization problems. sometimes
this makes things much easier. to be more speci   c, the two problems to be considered are

a.) minimize z = cx subject to x     0 and ax     b and
b.) maximize w = yb such that y     0 and ya     c,

(
equivalently at yt     ct and w = bt yt

)

.

in these problems it is assumed a is an m    p matrix.
i will show how a solution of the    rst yields a solution of the second and then show how
a solution of the second yields a solution of the    rst. the problems, a.) and b.) are called
id78.

lemma 6.5.1 let x be a solution of the inequalities of a.) and let y be a solution of the
inequalities of b.). then

cx     yb.

and if equality holds in the above, then x is the solution to a.) and y is a solution to b.).

proof: this follows immediately. since c     ya, cx     yax     yb.
it follows from this lemma that if y satis   es the inequalities of b.) and x satis   es the
inequalities of a.) then if equality holds in the above lemma, it must be that x is a solution
of a.) and y is a solution of b.). (cid:4)

now recall that to solve either of these problems using the simplex method, you    rst

similar considerations apply to the second problem. thus as just described, a basic feasible
solution is one which determines a simplex tableau like the above in which you get a feasible
solution by setting all but the    rst m variables equal to zero. the simplex algorithm takes
you from one basic feasible solution to another till eventually, if there is no degeneracy, you
obtain a basic feasible solution which yields the solution of the problem of interest.

theorem 6.5.2 suppose there exists a solution x to a.) where x is a basic feasible solution
of the inequalities of a.). then there exists a solution y to b.) and cx = by. it is also
possible to    nd y from x using a simple formula.

how all the di   culties disappear.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationspectral theory

spectral theory refers to the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
it is of
fundamental importance in many areas. row operations will no longer be such a useful tool
in this subject.

7.1 eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix
the    eld of scalars in spectral theory is best taken to equal c although i will sometimes
refer to it as f when it could be either c or r.
de   nition 7.1.1 let m be an n    n matrix and let x     cn be a nonzero vector for which

m x =   x

(7.1)

for some scalar,   . then x is called an eigenvector and    is called an eigenvalue (charac-
teristic value) of the matrix m.

eigenvectors are never equal to zero!

the set of all eigenvalues of an n    n matrix m, is denoted by    (m ) and is referred to as
the spectrum of m.

eigenvectors are vectors which are shrunk, stretched or re   ected upon multiplication by

a matrix. how can they be identi   ed? suppose x satis   es (7.1). then

(  i     m ) x = 0

det (  i     m ) = 0.

for some x   = 0. therefore, the matrix m       i cannot have an inverse and so by theorem
3.3.18

(7.2)
in other words,    must be a zero of the characteristic polynomial. since m is an n  n matrix,
it follows from the theorem on expanding a matrix by its cofactor that this is a polynomial
equation of degree n. as such, it has a solution,        c. is it actually an eigenvalue? the
answer is yes and this follows from theorem 3.3.26 on page 95. since det (  i     m ) = 0
the matrix   i     m cannot be one to one and so there exists a nonzero vector, x such that
(  i     m ) x = 0. this proves the following corollary.
corollary 7.1.2 let m be an n  n matrix and det (m       i) = 0. then there exists x     cn
such that (m       i) x = 0.

and so the eigenvalues are

5, 10, 10.

i have listed 10 twice because it is a zero of multiplicity two due to

  2     20   + 100 = (       10)2 .

having found the eigenvalues, it only remains to    nd the eigenvectors. first    nd the

eigenvectors for    = 5. as explained above, this requires you to solve the equation,

by now this is an old problem. you set up the augmented matrix and row reduce to get the
solution. thus the matrix you must row reduce is

where z     f. you would obtain the same collection of vectors if you replaced z with 4z.
thus a simpler description for the solutions to this system of equations whose augmented
matrix is in (7.3) is

(7.4)

where z     f. now you need to remember that you can   t take z = 0 because this would
result in the zero vector and

4

eigenvectors are never equal to zero!

other than this value, every other choice of z in (7.4) results in an eigenvector. it is a good
idea to check your work! to do so, i will take the original matrix and multiply by this vector
and see if i get 5 times this vector.

so it appears this is correct. always check your work on these problems if you care about
getting the answer right.
the variable, z is called a free variable or sometimes a parameter. the set of vectors in
(7.4) is called the eigenspace and it equals ker (  i     a) . you should observe that in this case
the eigenspace has dimension 1 because there is one vector which spans the eigenspace. in
general, you obtain the solution from the row echelon form and the number of di   erent free
variables gives you the dimension of the eigenspace. just remember that not every vector
in the eigenspace is an eigenvector. the vector, 0 is not an eigenvector although it is in the
eigenspace because

next consider the eigenvectors for    = 10. these vectors are solutions to the equation,

that is you must    nd the solutions to

which reduces to consideration of the augmented matrix

the row reduced echelon form for this matrix is

and so the eigenvectors are of the form

       .

you can   t pick z and y both equal to zero because this would result in the zero vector and

eigenvectors are never equal to zero!

however, every other choice of z and y does result in an eigenvector for the eigenvalue
   = 10. as in the case for    = 5 you should check your work if you care about getting it
right.

so it worked. the other vector will also work. check it.

the above example shows how to    nd eigenvectors and eigenvalues algebraically. you
may have noticed it is a bit long. sometimes students try to    rst row reduce the matrix
before looking for eigenvalues. this is a terrible idea because row operations destroy the
value of the eigenvalues. the eigenvalue problem is really not about row operations. a
general rule to remember about the eigenvalue problem is this.

if it is not long and hard it is usually wrong!

the eigenvalue problem is the hardest problem in algebra and people still do research on
ways to    nd eigenvalues. now if you are so fortunate as to    nd the eigenvalues as in the
above example, then    nding the eigenvectors does reduce to row operations and this part
of the problem is easy. however,    nding the eigenvalues is anything but easy because for
an n    n matrix, it involves solving a polynomial equation of degree n and none of us are
very good at doing this. if you only    nd a good approximation to the eigenvalue, it won   t
work. it either is or is not an eigenvalue and if it is not, the only solution to the equation,
(  i     m ) x = 0 will be the zero solution as explained above and

eigenvectors are never equal to zero!

find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

in this case the eigenvalues are 3, 6, 6 where i have listed 6 twice because it is a zero of

algebraic multiplicity two, the characteristic equation being

and using the usual procedures yields the eigenvectors for    = 6 are of the form

note that in this example the eigenspace for the eigenvalue    = 6 is of dimension 1
because there is only one parameter which can be chosen. however, this eigenvalue is of
multiplicity two as a root to the characteristic equation.
de   nition 7.1.6 if a is an n    n matrix with the property that some eigenvalue has alge-
braic multiplicity as a root of the characteristic equation which is greater than the dimension
of the eigenspace associated with this eigenvalue, then the matrix is called defective.

there may be repeated roots to the characteristic equation, (7.2) and it is not known
whether the dimension of the eigenspace equals the multiplicity of the eigenvalue. however,
the following theorem is available.

theorem 7.1.7 suppose m vi =   ivi, i = 1,       , r , vi   = 0, and that if i   = j, then   i   =   j.
then the set of eigenvectors, {v1,       , vr} is linearly independent.

proof. suppose the claim of the lemma is not true. then there exists a subset of this

set of vectors

such that

{w1,       , wr}     {v1,       , vk}

r   

cjwj = 0

(7.5)

where each cj   = 0. say m wj =   jwj where
{  1,       ,   r

j=1

}     {  1,       ,   k} ,

the   j being distinct eigenvalues of m . out of all such subsets, let this one be such that r
is as small as possible. then necessarily, r > 1 because otherwise, c1w1 = 0 which would
imply w1 = 0, which is not allowed for eigenvectors.

now apply m to both sides of (7.5).

r   

cj  jwj = 0.

j=1

(7.6)

next pick   k
thus

  = 0 and multiply both sides of (7.5) by   k. such a   k exists because r > 1.

r   

cj  kwj = 0

j=1

(7.7)

subtract the sum in (7.7) from the sum in (7.6) to obtain

in words, this theorem says that eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are

linearly independent.

sometimes you have to consider eigenvalues which are complex numbers. this occurs in
di   erential equations for example. you do these problems exactly the same way as you do
the ones in which the eigenvalues are real. here is an example.

there is nothing new about    nding the eigenvectors for    = 1 so consider the eigenvalue

7.2 some applications of eigenvalues and eigenvec-

tors

recall that n    n matrices can be considered as linear transformations. if f is a 3    3 real
matrix having positive determinant, it can be shown that f = ru where r is a rotation
matrix and u is a symmetric real matrix having positive eigenvalues. an application of
this wonderful result, known to mathematicians as the right polar decomposition, is to
continuum mechanics where a chunk of material is identi   ed with a set of points in three
dimensional space.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation7.2. some applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors

165

the linear transformation, f in this context is called the deformation gradient and
it describes the local deformation of the material. thus it is possible to consider this
deformation in terms of two processes, one which distorts the material and the other which
just rotates it. it is the matrix u which is responsible for stretching and compressing. this
is why in continuum mechanics, the stress is often taken to depend on u which is known in
this context as the right cauchy green strain tensor. this process of writing a matrix as a
product of two such matrices, one of which preserves distance and the other which distorts
is also important in applications to geometric measure theory an interesting    eld of study
in mathematics and to the study of quadratic forms which occur in many applications such
as statistics. here i am emphasizing the application to mechanics in which the eigenvectors
of u determine the principle directions, those directions in which the material is stretched
or compressed to the maximum extent.

the eigenvalues are 3, 1, and 1
2 .

it is nice to be given the eigenvalues. the largest eigenvalue is 3 which means that in
the direction determined by the eigenvector associated with 3 the stretch is three times as
large. the smallest eigenvalue is 1/2 and so in the direction determined by the eigenvector
for 1/2 the material is compressed, becoming locally half as long. it remains to    nd these
directions. first consider the eigenvector for 3. it is necessary to solve

thus the augmented matrix for this system of equations is

note this is meaningful information which you would have a hard time    nding without

the theory of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

another application is to the problem of    nding solutions to systems of di   erential
equations. it turns out that vibrating systems involving masses and springs can be studied
in the form

(7.8)
where a is a real symmetric n    n matrix which has nonpositive eigenvalues. this is
      
+   2x = 0. the
analogous to the case of the scalar equation for undamped oscillation, x
main di   erence is that here the scalar   2 is replaced with the matrix    a. consider the
problem of    nding solutions to (7.8). you look for a solution which is in the form

= ax

x

      

x (t) = ve  t

(7.9)

and substitute this into (7.8). thus

and so

      

x

= v  2e  t = e  tav

  2v = av.

therefore,   2 needs to be an eigenvalue of a and v needs to be an eigenvector. since a
has nonpositive eigenvalues,   2 =    a2 and so    =   ia where    a2 is an eigenvalue of a.
corresponding to this you obtain solutions of the form

x (t) = v cos (at) , v sin (at) .

note these solutions oscillate because of the cos (at) and sin (at) in the solutions. here is
an example.

example 7.2.2 find oscillatory solutions to the system of di   erential equations, x
where

      

= ax

the eigenvalues are    1,   2, and    3.

according to the above, you can    nd solutions by looking for the eigenvectors. consider

the eigenvectors for    3. the augmented matrix for    nding the eigenvectors is

are both solutions to the system of di   erential equations. you can    nd other oscillatory
solutions in the same way by considering the other eigenvalues. you might try checking
these answers to verify they work.

this is just a special case of a procedure used in di   erential equations to obtain closed
form solutions to systems of di   erential equations using id202. the overall philos-
ophy is to take one of the easiest problems in analysis and change it into the eigenvalue
problem which is the most di   cult problem in algebra. however, when it works, it gives
precise solutions in terms of known functions.

173

7.4 schur   s theorem

every matrix is related to an upper triangular matrix in a particularly signi   cant way. this
is schur   s theorem and it is the most important theorem in the spectral theory of matrices.

lemma 7.4.1 let {x1,       , xn} be a basis for fn. then there exists an orthonormal ba-
sis for fn, {u1,       , un} which has the property that for each k     n, span(x1,       , xk) =
span (u1,       , uk) .

proof: let {x1,       , xn} be a basis for fn. let u1     x1/|x1| . thus for k = 1,
span (u1) = span (x1) and {u1} is an orthonormal set. now suppose for some k < n, u1,        ,
uk have been chosen such that (uj    ul) =   jl and span (x1,       , xk) = span (u1,       , uk).

then de   ne

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(7.10)

where the denominator is not equal to zero because the xj form a basis and so

xk+1 /    span (x1,       , xk) = span (u1,       , uk)

thus by induction,

uk+1     span (u1,       , uk, xk+1) = span (x1,       , xk, xk+1) .

also, xk+1     span (u1,       , uk, uk+1) which is seen easily by solving (7.10) for xk+1 and it

follows

if l     k,

c

span (x1,       , xk, xk+1) = span (u1,       , uk, uk+1) .

the vectors, {uj}n

j=1 , generated in this way are therefore an orthonormal basis because

the process by which these vectors were generated is called the gram schmidt process.

here is a fundamental de   nition.
de   nition 7.4.2 an n    n matrix u, is unitary if u u

u where u

proof: this follows right away from the way we multiply matrices. if u is an n    n

complex matrix, then

   

   
i uj = (ui, uj)
u )ij = u

(u

and the matrix is unitary if and only if this equals   ij if and only if the columns are
orthonormal. (cid:4)

theorem 7.4.4 let a be an n   n matrix. then there exists a unitary matrix u such that

u

au = t,

(7.11)

where t is an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of a on the main diagonal
listed according to multiplicity as roots of the characteristic equation.

proof: the theorem is clearly true if a is a 1    1 matrix. just let u = 1 the 1    1
matrix which has 1 down the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. suppose it is true for
(n     1)    (n     1) matrices and let a be an n    n matrix. then let v1 be a unit eigenvector
for a . then there exists   1 such that

av1 =   1v1, |v1| = 1.

extend {v1} to a basis and then use lemma 7.4.1 to obtain {v1,       , vn}, an orthonormal
basis in fn. let u0 be a matrix whose ith column is vi. then from the above, it follows u0
is unitary. then u

where t is upper triangular. then let u = u0u1. since (u0u1)

as a simple consequence of the above theorem, here is an interesting lemma.

therefore, since the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal
entries,

det (a) =

det (tk) =

from the above formula, the eigenvalues of a consist of the eigenvalues of the upper trian-
gular matrices tk, and each tk has the same eigenvalues as pk. (cid:4)

what if a is a real matrix and you only want to consider real unitary matrices?

theorem 7.4.6 let a be a real n    n matrix. then there exists a real unitary matrix q
and a matrix t of the form

          p1

t =

where pi equals either a real 1    1 matrix or pi equals a real 2    2 matrix having as its
eigenvalues a conjugate pair of eigenvalues of a such that qt aq = t. the matrix t is
called the real schur form of the matrix a. recall that a real unitary matrix is also called
an orthogonal matrix.

proof: suppose

av1 =   1v1, |v1| = 1

where   1 is real. then let {v1,       , vn} be an orthonormal basis of vectors in rn. let q0
   
be a matrix whose ith column is vi. then q
0aq0 is of the form

a1

where a1 is a real n     1    n     1 matrix. this is just like the proof of theorem 7.4.4 up to

this point.

now consider the case where   1 =    + i   where      = 0.

v1 = z1 + iw1 and that v1 = z1     iw1 is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue        i  . here
z1 and w1 are real vectors. since v1 and v1 are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct
eigenvalues, they form a linearly independent set. from this it follows that {z1, w1} is an

it follows since a is real that

spectral theory

independent set of vectors in cn, hence in rn. indeed,{v1, v1} is an independent set and
also span (v1, v1) = span (z1, w1) . now using the gram schmidt theorem in rn, there exists
{u1, u2} , an orthonormal set of real vectors such that span (u1, u2) = span (v1, v1). for

example,

u1 = z1/|z1| , u2 =

let {u1, u2,       , un} be an orthonormal basis in rn and let q0 be a unitary matrix whose
ith column is ui so q0 is a real orthogonal matrix. then auj are both in span (u1, u2) for
j = 1, 2 and so ut

k auj = 0 whenever k     3. it follows that q
   
0aq0 is of the form

now    nd eq1 an n     2    n     2 matrix to put a1 in an appropriate form as above and

where a1 is now an n     2    n     2 matrix and p1 is a 2    2 matrix. now this is similar to a
and so two of its eigenvalues are    + i   and        i  .
come up with a2 either an n     4    n     4 matrix or an n     3    n     3 matrix. then the only

other di   erence is to let

eq1

thus putting a 2  2 identity matrix in the upper left corner rather than a one. repeating this
process with the above modi   cation for the case of a complex eigenvalue leads eventually
to (7.12) where q is the product of real unitary matrices qi above. when the block pi is
2    2, its eigenvalues are a conjugate pair of eigenvalues of a and if it is 1    1 it is a real
eigenvalue of a.

here is why this last claim is true

  i     t =

det (  i     t ) =

det (  ik     pk) .

where ik is the 2    2 identity matrix in the case that pk is 2    2 and is the number 1 in the
case where pk is a 1    1 matrix. now by lemma 7.4.5,

k=1

therefore,    is an eigenvalue of t if and only if it is an eigenvalue of some pk. this proves
the theorem since the eigenvalues of t are the same as those of a including multiplicity
because they have the same characteristic polynomial due to the similarity of a and t. (cid:4)
corollary 7.4.7 let a be a real n    n matrix having only real eigenvalues. then there
exists a real orthogonal matrix q and an upper triangular matrix t such that

qt aq = t

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation7.4. schur   s theorem

177

and furthermore, if the eigenvalues of a are listed in decreasing order,

q can be chosen such that t is of the form

proof: most of this follows right away from theorem 7.4.6. it remains to verify the
claim that the diagonal entries can be arranged in the desired order. however, this follows
from a simple modi   cation of the above argument. when you    nd v1 the eigenvalue of   1,
just be sure   1 is chosen to be the largest eigenvalue. then observe that from lemma 7.4.5
applied to the characteristic equation, the eigenvalues of the (n     1)    (n     1) matrix a1
are {  1,       ,   n}. then pick   2 to continue the process of construction with a1. (cid:4)

of course there is a similar conclusion which can be proved exactly the same way in the

case where a has complex eigenvalues.
corollary 7.4.8 let a be a real n    n matrix. then there exists a real orthogonal matrix
q and an upper triangular matrix t such that

de   nition 7.4.9 when a linear transformation, a, mapping a linear space, v to v has a
basis of eigenvectors, the linear transformation is called non defective. otherwise it is called
defective. an n   n matrix a, is called normal if aa
   
a. an important class of normal
matrices is that of the hermitian or self adjoint matrices. an n   n matrix a is self adjoint
   
or hermitian if a = a

   
= a

.

the next lemma is the basis for concluding that every normal matrix is unitarily similar

to a diagonal matrix.

lemma 7.4.10 if t is upper triangular and normal, then t is a diagonal matrix.

proof:this is obviously true if t is 1    1. in fact, it can   t help being diagonal in this
case. suppose then that the lemma is true for (n     1)    (n     1) matrices and let t be an
upper triangular normal n    n matrix. thus t is of the form

since these two matrices are equal, it follows a = 0. but now it follows that t
and so by induction t1 is a diagonal matrix d1. therefore,

t =

a diagonal matrix.

   

now here is a proof which doesn   t involve block multiplication. since t is normal,
t = t t

as the transpose of the conjugate, yields the following for the ikth entry of t

next let i = k = 3 and obtain that t looks like a diagonal matrix in so far as the    rst 3
rows and columns are concerned. continuing in this way it follows t is a diagonal matrix.

that u

au is a diagonal matrix.

proof: from theorem 7.4.4 there exists a unitary matrix u such that u

au equals
an upper triangular matrix. the theorem is now proved if it is shown that the property of
being normal is preserved under unitary similarity transformations. that is, verify that if
a is normal and if b = u
   

au, then b is also normal. but this is easy.

.

   

   

therefore, u
a diagonal matrix. (cid:4)

au is a normal and upper triangular matrix and by lemma 7.4.10 it must be

corollary 7.4.12 if a is hermitian, then all the eigenvalues of a are real and there exists
an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

proof: since a is normal, there exists unitary, u such that u
   
matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of a. therefore, d
d showing d is real.

finally, let

u =

u1 u2

       un

where the ui denote the columns of u and

   

au = d, a diagonal
= u
au =

u = u

   
a

   

   

the equation, u

   

au = d implies

(

au =

au1 au2

= u d =

  1u1   2u2

       aun
      

)

)

  nun

where the entries denote the columns of au and u d respectively. therefore, aui =   iui
and since the matrix is unitary, the ijth entry of u

u equals   ij and so

   

this proves the corollary because it shows the vectors {ui} are orthonormal. therefore,
they form a basis because every orthonormal set of vectors is linearly independent. (cid:4)

corollary 7.4.13 if a is a real symmetric matrix, then a is hermitian and there exists a
real unitary matrix u such that u t au = d where d is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal
entries are the eigenvalues of a. by arranging the columns of u the diagonal entries of d
can be made to appear in any order.

proof: this follows from theorem 7.4.6 and corollary 7.4.12. let

then au = u d so

au =

hence each column of u is an eigenvector of a. it follows that by rearranging these columns,
the entries of d on the main diagonal can be made to appear in any order. to see this,
consider such a rearrangement resulting in an orthogonal matrix u

7.6 quadratic forms

de   nition 7.6.1 a quadratic form in three dimensions is an expression of the form

x y

z

a

(7.13)

where a is a 3    3 symmetric matrix. in higher dimensions the idea is the same except you
use a larger symmetric matrix in place of a. in two dimensions a is a 2    2 matrix.
for example, consider(

which equals 3x2     8xy + 2xz     8yz + 3z2. this is very awkward because of the mixed terms
such as    8xy. the idea is to pick di   erent axes such that if x, y, z are taken with respect
to these axes, the quadratic form is much simpler. in other words, look for new variables,
   
x

and a unitary matrix u such that

, and z

       =

(7.15)

and if you write the quadratic form in terms of the primed variables, there will be no mixed
terms. any symmetric real matrix is hermitian and is therefore normal. from corollary
7.4.13, it follows there exists a real unitary matrix u, (an orthogonal matrix) such that
u t au = d a diagonal matrix. thus in the quadratic form, (7.13)

7.7 second derivative test

under certain conditions the mixed partial derivatives will always be equal. this aston-
ishing fact was    rst observed by euler around 1734. it is also called clairaut   s theorem.

theorem 7.7.1 suppose f : u     f2     r where u is an open set on which fx, fy, fxy and
fyx exist. then if fxy and fyx are continuous at the point (x, y)     u , it follows

proof: since u is open, there exists r > 0 such that b ((x, y) , r)     u. now let |t| ,|s| <

where   ,        (0, 1).
and the above argument shows there exist   ,        (0, 1) such that

if the terms f (x + t, y) and f (x, y + s) are interchanged in (7.16),     (s, t) is unchanged

letting (s, t)     (0, 0) and using the continuity of fxy and fyx at (x, y) ,

    (s, t) = fyx (x +   t, y +   s) .

lim

(s,t)   (0,0)

    (s, t) = fxy (x, y) = fyx (x, y) . (cid:4)

the following is obtained from the above by simply    xing all the variables except for the

two of interest.

corollary 7.7.2 suppose u is an open subset of fn and f : u     r has the property
that for two indices, k, l, fxk , fxl, fxlxk , and fxkxl exist on u and fxkxl and fxlxk are both
continuous at x     u. then fxkxl (x) = fxlxk (x) .

thus the theorem asserts that the mixed partial derivatives are equal at x if they are

de   ned near x and continuous at x.

now recall the taylor formula with the lagrange form of the remainder. what follows

is a proof of this important result based on the mean value theorem or rolle   s theorem.

185

theorem 7.7.7 in the above situation, suppose fxj (x) = 0 for each xj. then if h (x) has
all positive eigenvalues, x is a local minimum for f . if h (x) has all negative eigenvalues,
then x is a local maximum. if h (x) has a positive eigenvalue, then there exists a direction
in which f has a local minimum at x, while if h (x) has a negative eigenvalue, there exists
a direction in which h (x) has a local maximum at x.

proof: since fxj (x) = 0 for each xj, formula (7.19) implies

f (x + v) = f (x) +

vt h (x) v+

(

where h (x) is a symmetric matrix. thus, by corollary 7.4.12 h (x) has all real eigenvalues.
suppose    rst that h (x) has all positive eigenvalues and that all are larger than   2 > 0.
then h (x) has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, {vi}n

this shows the    rst claim of the theorem. the second claim follows from similar reasoning.
suppose h (x) has a positive eigenvalue   2. then let v be an eigenvector for this eigenvalue.
from (7.19),

f (x+tv) = f (x) +

whenever t is small enough. thus in the direction v the function has a local minimum at
x. the assertion about the local maximum in some direction follows similarly. (cid:4)

this theorem is an analogue of the second derivative test for higher dimensions. as in
one dimension, when there is a zero eigenvalue, it may be impossible to determine from the
hessian matrix what the local qualitative behavior of the function is. for example, consider

f1 (x, y) = x4 + y2, f2 (x, y) =    x4 + y2.

then dfi (0, 0) = 0 and for both functions, the hessian matrix evaluated at (0, 0) equals

(

)

0 0
0 2

but the behavior of the two functions is very di   erent near the origin. the second has a
saddle point while the    rst has a minimum there.

7.8 the estimation of eigenvalues

there are ways to estimate the eigenvalues for matrices. the most famous is known as
gerschgorin   s theorem. this theorem gives a rough idea where the eigenvalues are just from
looking at the matrix.
theorem 7.8.1 let a be an n    n matrix. consider the n gerschgorin discs de   ned as

                c : |       aii|    

          .

|aij|

   

j  =i

di    

then every eigenvalue is contained in some gerschgorin disc.

this theorem says to add up the absolute values of the entries of the ith row which are
o    the main diagonal and form the disc centered at aii having this radius. the union of
these discs contains    (a) .

proof: suppose ax =   x where x   = 0. then for a = (aij)

therefore, picking k such that |xk|     |xj| for all xj, it follows that |xk|   = 0 since |x|   = 0

and

|xk|

|aij|    

|aij||xj|     |       aii||xk| .

now dividing by |xk|, it follows    is contained in the kth gerschgorin disc. (cid:4)

according to gerschgorin   s theorem the eigenvalues are contained in the disks

d1 = {       c : |       2|     2} , d2 = {       c : |       5|     3} ,

d3 = {       c : |       9|     1}

it is important to observe that these disks are in the complex plane. in general this is the
case. if you want to    nd eigenvalues they will be complex numbers.

so what are the values of the eigenvalues? in this case they are real. you can compute
them by graphing the characteristic polynomial,   3     16  2 + 70       66 and then zoom-
ing in on the zeros. if you do this you    nd the solution is {   = 1. 295 3} ,{   = 5. 590 5} ,
{   = 9. 114 2} . of course these are only approximations and so this information is useless

for    nding eigenvectors. however, in many applications, it is the size of the eigenvalues
which is important and so these numerical values would be helpful for such applications. in
this case, you might think there is no real reason for gerschgorin   s theorem. why not just
compute the characteristic equation and graph and zoom? this is    ne up to a point, but
what if the matrix was huge? then it might be hard to    nd the characteristic polynomial.
remember the di   culties in expanding a big matrix along a row or column. also, what if
the eigenvalues were complex? you don   t see these by following this procedure. however,
gerschgorin   s theorem will at least estimate them.

theorem 7.9.1 let u be a region and let    : [a, b]     u be closed, continuous, bounded
variation, and the winding number, n (  , z) = 0 for all z /    u. suppose also that f is
analytic on u having zeros a1,       , am where the zeros are repeated according to multiplicity,

now let a be an n    n matrix. recall that the eigenvalues of a are given by the zeros
of the polynomial, pa (z) = det (zi     a) where i is the n    n identity. you can argue
   
that small changes in a will produce small changes in pa (z) and p
a (z) . let   k denote a
very small closed circle which winds around zk, one of the eigenvalues of a, in the counter
clockwise direction so that n (  k, zk) = 1. this circle is to enclose only zk and is to have no
other eigenvalue on it. then apply theorem 7.9.1. according to this theorem

is always an integer equal to the multiplicity of zk as a root of pa (t) . therefore, small
changes in a result in no change to the above contour integral because it must be an integer
and small changes in a result in small changes in the integral. therefore whenever b is close
enough to a, the two matrices have the same number of zeros inside   k, the zeros being
counted according to multiplicity. by making the radius of the small circle equal to    where
   is less than the minimum distance between any two distinct eigenvalues of a, this shows
that if b is close enough to a, every eigenvalue of b is closer than    to some eigenvalue of
a. (cid:4)

theorem 7.9.2 if    is an eigenvalue of a, then if all the entries of b are close enough to
the corresponding entries of a, some eigenvalue of b will be within    of   .

consider the situation that a (t) is an n    n matrix and that t     a (t) is continuous for

t     [0, 1] .
lemma 7.9.3 let    (t)        (a (t)) for t < 1 and let   t =    s   t   (a (s)) . also let kt be the
connected component of    (t) in   t. then there exists    > 0 such that kt        (a (s))   =     for
all s     [t, t +   ] .

proof: denote by d (   (t) ,   ) the disc centered at    (t) having radius    > 0, with other

occurrences of this notation being de   ned similarly. thus

d (   (t) ,   )     {z     c : |   (t)     z|       } .

suppose    > 0 is small enough that    (t) is the only element of    (a (t)) contained in
d (   (t) ,   ) and that pa(t) has no zeroes on the boundary of this disc. then by continuity, and
the above discussion and theorem, there exists    > 0, t +    < 1, such that for s     [t, t +   ] ,
pa(s) also has no zeroes on the boundary of this disc and a (s) has the same number
of eigenvalues, counted according to multiplicity, in the disc as a (t) . thus    (a (s))    
d (   (t) ,   )   =     for all s     [t, t +   ] . now let

   

h =

s   [t,t+  ]

   (a (s))     d (   (t) ,   ) .

it will be shown that h is connected. suppose not. then h = p     q where p, q are
separated and    (t)     p. let s0     inf {s :    (s)     q for some    (s)        (a (s))} . there exists
   (s0)        (a (s0))     d (   (t) ,   ) . if    (s0) /    q, then from the above discussion there are
   (s)        (a (s))    q for s > s0 arbitrarily close to    (s0) . therefore,    (s0)     q which shows
that s0 > t because    (t) is the only element of    (a (t)) in d (   (t) ,   ) and    (t)     p. now
let sn     s0. then    (sn)     p for any    (sn)        (a (sn))    d (   (t) ,   ) and also it follows from
the above discussion that for some choice of sn     s0,    (sn)        (s0) which contradicts p
and q separated and nonempty. since p is nonempty, this shows q =    . therefore, h is
connected as claimed. but kt     h and so kt        (a (s))   =     for all s     [t, t +   ] . (cid:4)
theorem 7.9.4 suppose a (t) is an n    n matrix and that t     a (t) is continuous for
t     [0, 1] . let    (0)        (a (0)) and de   ne           t   [0,1]   (a (t)) . let k  (0) = k0 denote the
connected component of    (0) in   . then k0        (a (t))   =     for all t     [0, 1] .

proof: let s     {t     [0, 1] : k0        (a (s))   =     for all s     [0, t]} . then 0     s. let t0 =

sup (s) . say    (a (t0)) =   1 (t0) ,       ,   r (t0) .
claim: at least one of these is a limit point of k0 and consequently must be in k0
which shows that s has a last point. why is this claim true? let sn     t0 so sn     s.
now let the discs, d (  i (t0) ,   ) , i = 1,       , r be disjoint with pa(t0) having no zeroes on   i
the boundary of d (  i (t0) ,   ) . then for n large enough it follows from theorem 7.9.1 and
the discussion following it that    (a (sn)) is contained in    r
i=1d (  i (t0) ,   ). it follows that
k0     (   (a (t0)) + d (0,   ))   =     for all    small enough. this requires at least one of the
  i (t0) to be in k0. therefore, t0     s and s has a last point.
now by lemma 7.9.3, if t0 < 1, then k0     kt would be a strictly larger connected set
containing    (0) . (the reason this would be strictly larger is that k0        (a (s)) =     for
some s     (t, t +   ) while kt        (a (s))   =     for all s     [t, t +   ].) therefore, t0 = 1. (cid:4)
corollary 7.9.5 suppose one of the gerschgorin discs, di is disjoint from the union of
the others. then di contains an eigenvalue of a. also, if there are n disjoint gerschgorin
discs, then each one contains an eigenvalue of a.

proof: denote by a (t) the matrix

ii = aii. thus to
get a (t) multiply all non diagonal terms by t. let t     [0, 1] . then a (0) = diag (a11,       , ann)
and a (1) = a. furthermore, the map, t     a (t) is continuous. denote by dt
j the ger-
    dj
schgorin disc obtained from the jth row for the matrix a (t). then it is clear that dt
j
the jth gerschgorin disc for a. it follows aii is the eigenvalue for a (0) which is contained
in the disc, consisting of the single point aii which is contained in di. letting k be the
connected component in    for    de   ned in theorem 7.9.4 which is determined by aii, ger-
schgorin   s theorem implies that k        (a (t))        n
j=1dj = di     (   j  =idj) and
also, since k is connected, there are not points of k in both di and (   j  =idj) . since at least
one point of k is in di,(aii), it follows all of k must be contained in di. now by theorem
7.9.4 this shows there are points of k        (a) in di. the last assertion follows immediately.

this can be improved even more. this involves the following lemma.

lemma 7.9.6 in the situation of theorem 7.9.4 suppose    (0) = k0        (a (0)) and that
   (0) is a simple root of the characteristic equation of a (0). then for all t     [0, 1] ,

   (a (t))     k0 =    (t)

where    (t) is a simple root of the characteristic equation of a (t) .

proof: let s     {t     [0, 1] : k0        (a (s)) =    (s) , a simple eigenvalue for all s     [0, t]} .
then 0     s so it is nonempty. let t0 = sup (s) and suppose   1   =   2 are two elements of
   (a (t0))   k0. then choosing    > 0 small enough, and letting di be disjoint discs containing
  i respectively, similar arguments to those of lemma 7.9.3 can be used to conclude

hi        s   [t0     ,t0]   (a (s))     di

is a connected and nonempty set for i = 1, 2 which would require that hi     k0. but
then there would be two di   erent eigenvalues of a (s) contained in k0, contrary to the
de   nition of t0. therefore, there is at most one eigenvalue    (t0)     k0        (a (t0)) . could
it be a repeated root of the characteristic equation? suppose    (t0) is a repeated root of
the characteristic equation. as before, choose a small disc, d centered at    (t0) and    small
enough that

h        s   [t0     ,t0]   (a (s))     d

is a nonempty connected set containing either multiple eigenvalues of a (s) or else a single
repeated root to the characteristic equation of a (s) . but since h is connected and contains

   (t0) it must be contained in k0 which contradicts the condition for s     s for all these
s     [t0       , t0] . therefore, t0     s as hoped. if t0 < 1, there exists a small disc centered
at    (t0) and    > 0 such that for all s     [t0, t0 +   ] , a (s) has only simple eigenvalues in
d and the only eigenvalues of a (s) which could be in k0 are in d. (this last assertion
follows from noting that    (t0) is the only eigenvalue of a (t0) in k0 and so the others are
at a positive distance from k0. for s close enough to t0, the eigenvalues of a (s) are either
close to these eigenvalues of a (t0) at a positive distance from k0 or they are close to the
eigenvalue    (t0) in which case it can be assumed they are in d.) but this shows that t0 is
not really an upper bound to s. therefore, t0 = 1 and the lemma is proved. (cid:4)
with this lemma, the conclusion of the above corollary can be sharpened.

corollary 7.9.7 suppose one of the gerschgorin discs, di is disjoint from the union of
the others. then di contains exactly one eigenvalue of a and this eigenvalue is a simple
root to the characteristic polynomial of a.

proof:

in the proof of corollary 7.9.5, note that aii is a simple root of a (0) since
otherwise the ith gerschgorin disc would not be disjoint from the others. also, k, the
connected component determined by aii must be contained in di because it is connected
and by gerschgorin   s theorem above, k        (a (t)) must be contained in the union of the
gerschgorin discs. since all the other eigenvalues of a (0) , the ajj, are outside di, it follows
that k        (a (0)) = aii. therefore, by lemma 7.9.6, k        (a (1)) = k        (a) consists of
a single simple eigenvalue. (cid:4)

the gerschgorin discs are d (5, 1) , d (1, 2) , and d (0, 1) . observe d (5, 1) is disjoint
from the other discs. therefore, there should be an eigenvalue in d (5, 1) . the actual
eigenvalues are not easy to    nd. they are the roots of the characteristic equation, t3     6t2 +
3t + 5 = 0. the numerical values of these are    . 669 66, 1. 423 1, and 5. 246 55, verifying the

1. explain why it is typically impossible to compute the upper triangular matrix whose

existence is guaranteed by schur   s theorem.

2. now recall the qr factorization of theorem 5.7.5 on page 133. the qr algorithm
is a technique which does compute the upper triangular matrix in schur   s theorem.
there is much more to the qr algorithm than will be presented here. in fact, what
i am about to show you is not the way it is done in practice. one    rst obtains what
is called a hessenburg matrix for which the algorithm will work better. however,
the idea is as follows. start with a an n    n matrix having real eigenvalues. form
a = qr where q is orthogonal and r is upper triangular. (right triangular.) this
can be done using the technique of theorem 5.7.5 using householder matrices. next

take a1     rq. show that a = qa1qt . in other words these two matrices, a, a1 are
similar. explain why they have the same eigenvalues. continue by letting a1 play the
role of a. thus the algorithm is of the form an = qrn and an+1 = rn+1q. explain
why a = qnanqt
n for some qn orthogonal. thus an is a sequence of matrices each
similar to a. the remarkable thing is that often these matrices converge to an upper
triangular matrix t and a = qt qt for some orthogonal matrix, the limit of the qn
where the limit means the entries converge. then the process computes the upper
triangular schur form of the matrix a. thus the eigenvalues of a appear on the
diagonal of t. you will see approximately what these are as the process continues.

now you    nish the argument. to show uniqueness in the second part, suppose

   

y

(7.24)

are obtained in the form    (t) c for some choice of c     fn.
in other words, is the
general solution to this equation    (t) c for c     fn? prove the following theorem using
id202.
theorem 7.10.1 suppose    (t) is an n    n matrix which satis   es   
then the general solution to (7.24) is    (t) c if and only if    (t)
   
furthermore, if   
exists for any t.

(det (   (t)) is called the wronskian and this theorem is sometimes called the wronskian
alternative.)

hint: suppose    rst the general solution is of the form    (t) c where c is an arbitrary
constant vector in fn. you need to verify    (t)

the existence part of problem 38 there exists a solution to

   

x

but this cannot be in the form    (t) c. thus for every t,    (t)
for some t0,    (t0)

   1 exists. let z
   

= az and choose c such that

   1 exists. next suppose

then both z (t) ,    (t) c solve

z (t0) =    (t0) c

   
x

= ax, x (t0) = z (t0)

apply uniqueness to conclude z =    (t) c. finally, consider that    (t) c for c     fn
   1
either is the general solution or it is not the general solution. if it is, then    (t)
   1 cannot exist for any t from what was just
exists for all t. if it is not, then    (t)
shown.
   
41. let

now these few problems have done virtually everything of signi   cance in an entire un-

the above formula is called the variation of constants formula.

hint: uniquenss is easy. if x1, x2 are two solutions then let u (t) = x1 (t)    x2 (t) and

could just di   erentiate the above formula using the fundamental theorem of calculus
and verify it works. another way is to assume the solution in the form

x (t) =    (t) c (t)

and    nd c (t) to make it all work out. this is called the method of variation of

inertia matrix. hint: let a = sbs
where s is invertible. show that a, b have the
same rank and this implies that they are each unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix
which has the same number of zero entries on the main diagonal. therefore, letting
va be the span of the eigenvectors associated with positive eigenvalues of a and vb
being de   ned similarly, it su   ces to show that these have the same dimensions. show
that (ax, x) > 0 for all x     va. next consider s

va is a subspace of vb and so the dimension of vb
is at least as large as the dimension of va. hence there are at least as many positive
eigenvalues for b as there are for a. switching a, b you can turn the inequality
around. thus the two have the same inertia matrix.

45. let a be an m    n matrix. then if you unraveled it, you could consider it as a vector

show that this really does satisfy the axioms of an inner product space and that it
also amounts to nothing more than considering m    n matrices as vectors in cnm.

min{|         | :           (b)}

explain why dist (   (a) ,    (b)) is small if and only if every eigenvalue of a is close
to some eigenvalue of b. now prove the following theorem using the above problem
and schur   s theorem. this theorem says roughly that if a is close to b then the
eigenvalues of a are close to those of b in the sense that every eigenvalue of a is close
to an eigenvalue of b.

8.1 vector space axioms

it is time to consider the idea of a vector space.

de   nition 8.1.1 a vector space is an abelian group of    vectors    satisfying the axioms of
an abelian group,

v + w = w + v,

the commutative law of addition,

(v + w) + z = v+ (w + z) ,

the associative law for addition,

the existence of an additive identity,

v + 0 = v,

v+ (   v) = 0,

the existence of an additive inverse, along with a    eld of    scalars   , f which are allowed to
multiply the vectors according to the following rules. (the greek letters denote scalars.)

   (v + w) =   v+  w,

(   +   ) v =  v+  v,

   (  v) =      (v) ,

(8.1)

(8.2)

(8.3)

(8.4)
the    eld of scalars is usually r or c and the vector space will be called real or complex
depending on whether the    eld is r or c. however, other    elds are also possible. for
example, one could use the    eld of rational numbers or even the    eld of the integers mod p
for p a prime. a vector space is also called a linear space.

1v = v.

for example, rn with the usual conventions is an example of a real vector space and cn
is an example of a complex vector space. up to now, the discussion has been for rn or cn
and all that is taking place is an increase in generality and abstraction.

there are many examples of vector spaces.

199

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation200

vector spaces and fields

example 8.1.2 let     be a nonempty set and let v consist of all functions de   ned on    
which have values in some    eld f. the vector operations are de   ned as follows.

(f + g) (x) = f (x) + g (x)

(  f ) (x) =   f (x)

then it is routine to verify that v with these operations is a vector space.

note that fn actually    ts in to this framework. you consider the set     to be {1, 2,       , n}
and then the mappings from     to f give the elements of fn. thus a typical vector can be
considered as a function.

example 8.1.3 generalize the above example by letting v denote all functions de   ned on
    which have values in a vector space w which has    eld of scalars f. the de   nitions of
scalar multiplication and vector addition are identical to those of the above example.

8.2 subspaces and bases

8.2.1 basic de   nitions
de   nition 8.2.1 if {v1,       , vn}     v, a vector space, then

{
n   

}

.

span (v1,       , vn)    

  ivi :   i     f

a subset, w     v is said to be a subspace if it is also a vector space with the same    eld of
scalars. thus w     v is a subspace if ax + by     w whenever a, b     f and x, y     w. the
span of a set of vectors as just described is an example of a subspace.

i=1

example 8.2.2 consider the real valued functions de   ned on an interval [a, b]. a subspace
is the set of continuous real valued functions de   ned on the interval. another subspace is
the set of polynomials of degree no more than 4.

de   nition 8.2.3 if {v1,       , vn}     v, the set of vectors is linearly independent if

n   

  ivi = 0

i=1

implies

and {v1,       , vn} is called a basis for v if

  1 =        =   n = 0

span (v1,       , vn) = v

and {v1,       , vn} is linearly independent. the set of vectors is linearly dependent if it is not

linearly independent.

201

8.2.2 a fundamental theorem

the next theorem is called the exchange theorem. it is very important that you understand
this theorem. it is so important that i have given several proofs of it. some amount to the
same thing, just worded di   erently.

theorem 8.2.4 let {x1,       , xr} be a linearly independent set of vectors such that each xi
is in the span{y1,       , ys} . then r     s.

proof 1: de   ne span{y1,       , ys}     v, it follows there exist scalars c1,       , cs such

that

s   

x1 =

ciyi.

(8.5)

not all of these scalars can equal zero because if this were the case, it would follow that

   
x1 = 0 and so {x1,       , xr} would not be linearly independent. indeed, if x1 = 0, 1x1 +
r
i=2 0xi = x1 = 0 and so there would exist a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors
{x1,       , xr} which equals zero.
say ck   = 0. then solve (8.5) for yk and obtain

i=1

      x1,

{
z
y1,       , yk   1, yk+1,       , ys

s-1 vectors here

}|

       .

yk     span

de   ne {z1,       , zs   1} by

{z1,       , zs   1}     {y1,       , yk   1, yk+1,       , ys}

therefore, span{x1, z1,       , zs   1} = v because if v     v, there exist constants c1,       , cs

such that

s   1   

i=1

v =

cizi + csyk.

now replace the yk in the above with a linear combination of the vectors, {x1, z1,       , zs   1}
to obtain v     span{x1, z1,       , zs   1} . the vector yk, in the list {y1,       , ys} , has now been
replaced with the vector x1 and the resulting modi   ed list of vectors has the same span as
the original list of vectors, {y1,       , ys} .
now suppose that r > s and that span{x1,       , xl, z1,       , zp} = v where the vectors,
z1,       , zp are each taken from the set, {y1,       , ys} and l + p = s. this has now been done
for l = 1 above. then since r > s, it follows that l     s < r and so l + 1     r. therefore, xl+1
is a vector not in the list, {x1,       , xl} and since span{x1,       , xl, z1,       , zp} = v there
exist scalars ci and dj such that

l   

p   

now not all the dj can equal zero because if this were so, it would follow that {x1,       , xr}

xl+1 =

cixi +

djzj.

i=1

j=1

(8.6)

would be a linearly dependent set because one of the vectors would equal a linear combination
of the others. therefore, ((8.6)) can be solved for one of the zi, say zk, in terms of xl+1 and
the other zi and just as in the above argument, replace that zi with xl+1 to obtain

      x1,       xl, xl+1,

span

z
{
z1,       zk   1, zk+1,       , zp

p-1 vectors here

}|

       = v.

continue this way, eventually obtaining

span (x1,       , xs) = v.

but then xr     span{x1,       , xs} contrary to the assumption that {x1,       , xr} is linearly
independent. therefore, r     s as claimed.

proof 2: let

s   

xk =

ajkyj

j=1

if r > s, then the matrix a = (ajk) has more columns than rows. by corollary 4.3.9
one of these columns is a linear combination of the others. this implies there exist scalars
r   
c1,       , cr, not all zero such that
r   

ajkck = 0, j = 1,       , r

k=1

which contradicts the assumption that {x1,       , xr} is linearly independent. hence r     s.
proof 3: suppose r > s. let zk denote a vector of {y1,       , ys} . thus there exists j as

small as possible such that

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xm, z1,       , zj)

where m + j = s. it is given that m = 0, corresponding to no vectors of {x1,       , xm} and
j = s, corresponding to all the yk results in the above equation holding. if j > 0 then m < s
and so

m   

k=1

j   

i=1

xm+1 =

akxk +

bizi

not all the bi can equal 0 and so you can solve for one of them in terms of xm+1, xm,       , x1,
and the other zk. therefore, there exists

{z1,       , zj   1}     {y1,       , ys}

such that

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xm+1, z1,       , zj   1)

contradicting the choice of j. hence j = 0 and

span (y1,       , ys) = span (x1,       , xs)

it follows that

xs+1     span (x1,       , xs)

contrary to the assumption the xk are linearly independent. therefore, r     s as claimed. (cid:4)
corollary 8.2.5 if {u1,       , um} and {v1,       , vn} are two bases for v, then m = n.

proof: by theorem 8.2.4, m     n and n     m. (cid:4)

de   nition 8.2.6 a vector space v is of dimension n if it has a basis consisting of n vectors.
this is well de   ned thanks to corollary 8.2.5. it is always assumed here that n <     and in
this case, such a vector space is said to be    nite dimensional.
example 8.2.7 consider the polynomials de   ned on r of degree no more than 3, denoted
. here xk symbolizes the function
here as p3. then show that a basis for p3 is
x 7    xk.

1, x, x2, x3

{

}

it is obvious that the span of the given vectors yields p3. why is this set of vectors

linearly independent? suppose

c0 + c1x + c2x2 + c3x3 = 0

where 0 is the zero function which maps everything to 0. then you could di   erentiate three
times and obtain the following equations

c1 + 2c2x + 3c3x2 = 0
2c2 + 6c3x = 0
6c3 = 0

now this implies c3 = 0. then from the equations above the bottom one, you    nd in
succession that c2 = 0, c1 = 0, c0 = 0.

there is a somewhat interesting theorem about linear independence of smooth functions
(those having plenty of derivatives) which i will show now. it is often used in di   erential
equations.

de   nition 8.2.8 let f1,       , fn be smooth functions de   ned on an interval [a, b] . the

wronskian of these functions is de   ned as follows.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

note that to get from one row to the next, you just di   erentiate everything in that row. the
notation f (k) (x) denotes the kth derivative.

with this de   nition, the following is the theorem. the interesting theorem involving the
wronskian has to do with the situation where the functions are solutions of a di   erential
equation. then much more can be said and it is much more interesting than the following
theorem.

theorem 8.2.9 let {f1,       , fn} be smooth functions de   ned on [a, b] . then they are lin-
early independent if there exists some point t     [a, b] where w (f1,       , fn) (t)   = 0.

proof: form the linear combination of these vectors (functions) and suppose it equals

0. thus

a1f1 + a2f2 +        + anfn = 0

the question you must answer is whether this requires each aj to equal zero. if they all
must equal 0, then this means these vectors (functions) are independent. this is what it
means to be linearly independent.

since the determinant of the matrix on the left is assumed to be nonzero, it follows this
matrix has an inverse and so the only solution to the above system of equations is to have
each ak = 0. (cid:4)

here is a useful lemma.

   

lemma 8.2.10 suppose v /    span (u1,       , uk) and {u1,       , uk} is linearly independent.
then {u1,       , uk, v} is also linearly independent.
(

k
i=1 ciui + dv = 0. it is required to verify that each ci = 0 and that
d = 0. but if d   = 0, then you can solve for v as a linear combination of the vectors,
{u1,       , uk},

proof: suppose

contrary to assumption. therefore, d = 0. but then

given a spanning set, you can delete vectors till you end up with a basis. given a linearly
independent set, you can add vectors till you get a basis. this is what the following theorem
is about, weeding and planting.

theorem 8.2.11 if v = span (u1,       , un) then some subset of {u1,       , un} is a basis for
v. also, if {u1,       , uk}     v is linearly independent and the vector space is    nite dimen-
sional, then the set, {u1,       , uk}, can be enlarged to obtain a basis of v.

proof: let

s = {e     {u1,       , un} such that span (e) = v }.

for e     s, let |e| denote the number of elements of e. let
m     min{|e| such that e     s}.

thus there exist vectors

such that

{v1,       , vm}     {u1,       , un}

span (v1,       , vm) = v

and m is as small as possible for this to happen. if this set is linearly independent, it follows
it is a basis for v and the theorem is proved. on the other hand, if the set is not linearly
independent, then there exist scalars

c1,       , cm

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation8.3. lots of fields

such that

m   

0 =

civi

205

and not all the ci are equal to zero. suppose ck   = 0. then the vector, vk may be solved for

i=1

in terms of the other vectors. consequently,

v = span (v1,       , vk   1, vk+1,       , vm)

contradicting the de   nition of m. this proves the    rst part of the theorem.

to obtain the second part, begin with {u1,       , uk} and suppose a basis for v is

if

{v1,       , vn} .

span (u1,       , uk) = v,

then k = n. if not, there exists a vector,

uk+1 /    span (u1,       , uk) .

then by lemma 8.2.10, {u1,       , uk, uk+1} is also linearly independent. continue adding

vectors in this way until n linearly independent vectors have been obtained. then

span (u1,       , un) = v

because if it did not do so, there would exist un+1 as just described and {u1,       , un+1}
would be a linearly independent set of vectors having n+1 elements even though {v1,       , vn}
is a basis. this would contradict theorem 8.2.4. therefore, this list is a basis. (cid:4)

8.2.3 the basis of a subspace

every subspace of a    nite dimensional vector space is a span of some vectors and in fact it
has a basis. this is the content of the next theorem.

theorem 8.2.12 let v be a nonzero subspace of a    nite dimensional vector space, w of
dimension, n. then v has a basis with no more than n vectors.

proof: let v1     v where v1   = 0. if span{v1} = v, stop. {v1} is a basis for v .
otherwise, there exists v2     v which is not in span{v1} . by lemma 8.2.10 {v1, v2} is a
linearly independent set of vectors. if span{v1, v2} = v stop, {v1, v2} is a basis for v. if
span{v1, v2}   = v, then there exists v3 /    span{v1, v2} and {v1, v2, v3} is a larger linearly

independent set of vectors. continuing this way, the process must stop before n + 1 steps
because if not, it would be possible to obtain n + 1 linearly independent vectors contrary to
the exchange theorem, theorem 8.2.4. (cid:4)

i mentioned earlier that most things hold for arbitrary    elds. however, i have not bothered
to give any examples of other    elds. this is the point of this section. it also turns out that
showing the algebraic numbers are a    eld can be understood using vector space concepts

vector spaces and fields

and it gives a very convincing application of the abstract theory presented earlier in this
chapter.

here i will give some basic algebra relating to polynomials. this is interesting for its
own sake but also provides the basis for constructing many di   erent kinds of    elds. the
   rst is the euclidean algorithm for polynomials.

n

k=0 ak  k where as
de   nition 8.3.1 a polynomial is an expression of the form p (  ) =
usual   0 is de   ned to equal 1. two polynomials are said to be equal if their corresponding
coe   cients are the same. thus, in particular, p (  ) = 0 means each of the ak = 0. an
element of the    eld    is said to be a root of the polynomial if p (  ) = 0 in the sense that
when you plug in    into the formula and do the indicated operations, you get 0. the degree
of a nonzero polynomial is the highest exponent appearing on   . the degree of the zero
polynomial p (  ) = 0 is not de   ned.
example 8.3.2 consider the polynomial p (  ) =   2 +    where the coe   cients are in z2. is
this polynomial equal to 0? not according to the above de   nition, because its coe   cients are
not all equal to 0. however, p (1) = p (0) = 0 so it sends every element of z2 to 0. note the
distinction between saying it sends everything in the    eld to 0 with having the polynomial be
the zero polynomial.
lemma 8.3.3 let f (  ) and g (  )   = 0 be polynomials. then there exists a polynomial, q (  )
such that

f (  ) = q (  ) g (  ) + r (  )

where the degree of r (  ) is less than the degree of g (  ) or r (  ) = 0.

proof: consider the polynomials of the form f (  )     g (  ) l (  ) and out of all these
polynomials, pick one which has the smallest degree. this can be done because of the well
ordering of the natural numbers. let this take place when l (  ) = q1 (  ) and let

r (  ) = f (  )     g (  ) q1 (  ) .

it is required to show degree of r (  ) < degree of g (  ) or else r (  ) = 0.

suppose f (  )     g (  ) l (  ) is never equal to zero for any l (  ). then r (  )   = 0. it is
required to show the degree of r (  ) is smaller than the degree of g (  ) . if this doesn   t
happen, then the degree of r     the degree of g. let

r (  ) = bm  m +        + b1   + b0
g (  ) = an  n +        + a1   + a0

where m     n and bm and an are nonzero. then let r1 (  ) be given by

r1 (  ) = r (  )       m   nbm

an

g (  )

which has smaller degree than m, the degree of r (  ). but

and this is not zero by the assumption that f (  )     g (  ) l (  ) is never equal to zero for any
l (  ) yet has smaller degree than r (  ) which is a contradiction to the choice of r (  ). (cid:4)

now with this lemma, here is another one which is very fundamental. first here is a

de   nition. a polynomial is monic means it is of the form

  n + cn   1  n   1 +        + c1   + c0.

that is, the leading coe   cient is 1. in what follows, the coe   cients of polynomials are in
f, a    eld of scalars which is completely arbitrary. think r if you need an example.

de   nition 8.3.4 a polynomial f is said to divide a polynomial g if g (  ) = f (  ) r (  ) for

some polynomial r (  ). let {  i (  )} be a    nite set of polynomials. the greatest common
divisor will be the monic polynomial q such that q (  ) divides each   i (  ) and if p (  ) divides
each   i (  ) , then p (  ) divides q (  ) . the    nite set of polynomials {  i
} is said to be relatively
prime if their greatest common divisor is 1. a polynomial f (  ) is irreducible if there is no
polynomial with coe   cients in f which divides it except nonzero scalar multiples of f (  )
and constants.

proposition 8.3.5 the greatest common divisor is unique.

proof: suppose both q (  ) and q

   

(  ) work. then q (  ) divides q

   

(  ) and the other way

around and so

   

(  ) q
   
therefore, the two must have the same degree. hence l
   
ever, this constant must be 1 because both q (  ) and q

(  ) = q (  ) l (  ) , q (  ) = l

q

   

   

(  )

(  ) , l (  ) are both constants. how-
(  ) are monic. (cid:4)

theorem 8.3.6 let    (  ) be the greatest common divisor of {  i (  )} , not all of which are
zero polynomials. then there exist polynomials ri (  ) such that

p   

   (  ) =

ri (  )   i (  ) .

i=1

furthermore,    (  ) is the monic polynomial of smallest degree which can be written in the
above form.

proof: let s denote the set of monic polynomials which are of the form

where ri (  ) is a polynomial. then s   =     because some   i (  )   = 0. then let the ri be chosen
p
such that the degree of the expression
i=1 ri (  )   i (  ) is as small as possible. letting    (  )
equal this sum, it remains to verify it is the greatest common divisor. first, does it divide
each   i (  )? suppose it fails to divide   1 (  ) . then by lemma 8.3.3

  1 (  ) =    (  ) l (  ) + r (  )

where degree of r (  ) is less than that of    (  ). then dividing r (  ) by the leading coe   cient
if necessary and denoting the result by   1 (  ) , it follows the degree of   1 (  ) is less than
the degree of    (  ) and   1 (  ) equals

  1 (  ) = (  1 (  )        (  ) l (  )) a

for a suitable a     f. this is one of the polynomials in s. therefore,    (  ) does not have
the smallest degree after all because the degree of   1 (  ) is smaller. this is a contradiction.
therefore,    (  ) divides   1 (  ) . similarly it divides all the other   i (  ).

if p (  ) divides all the   i (  ) , then it divides    (  ) because of the formula for    (  ) which

   

equals

p

i=1 ri (  )   i (  ) . (cid:4)

lemma 8.3.7 suppose    (  ) and    (  ) are monic polynomials which are irreducible and
not equal. then they are relatively prime.

proof: suppose    (  ) is a nonconstant polynomial.

if    (  ) divides    (  ) , then since
   (  ) is irreducible,    (  ) equals a   (  ) for some a     f. if    (  ) divides    (  ) then it must
be of the form b   (  ) for some b     f and so it follows

   (  ) =

a
b

   (  )

but both    (  ) and    (  ) are monic polynomials which implies a = b and so    (  ) =    (  ).
this is assumed not to happen. it follows the only polynomials which divide both    (  )
and    (  ) are constants and so the two polynomials are relatively prime. thus a polynomial
which divides them both must be a constant, and if it is monic, then it must be 1. thus 1
is the greatest common divisor. (cid:4)
lemma 8.3.8 let    (  ) be an irreducible monic polynomial not equal to 1 which divides

p   

  i (  )ki , ki a positive integer,

i=1

where each   i (  ) is an irreducible monic polynomial. then    (  ) equals some   i (  ) .

proof : suppose    (  )   =   i (  ) for all i. then by lemma 8.3.7, there exist polynomials

mi (  ) , ni (  ) such that

hence

then, letting eg (  ) =
p   
eg (  )

polynomial h (  ) such that

i=1

1 =    (  ) mi (  ) +   i (  ) ni (  ) .

p

(  i (  ) ni (  ))ki = (1        (  ) mi (  ))ki
i=1 ni (  )ki , and applying the binomial theorem, there exists a

   
  i (  )ki     p   
p   
(1        (  ) mi (  ))ki = 1 +    (  ) h (  )
   

p   

  i (  )ki

ni (  )ki

i=1

i=1

i=1

=

p

i=1   i (  )ki , for a suitable polynomial g (  ) ,

thus, using the fact that    (  ) divides

g (  )    (  ) = 1 +    (  ) h (  )
1 =    (  ) (h (  )     g (  ))
which is impossible if    (  ) is non constant, as assumed. (cid:4)

now here is a simple lemma about canceling monic polynomials.

209

lemma 8.3.9 suppose p (  ) is a monic polynomial and q (  ) is a polynomial such that

then q (  ) = 0. also if

then q1 (  ) = q2 (  ) .

proof: let

then the product equals

k   

j=1

p (  ) =

p (  ) q (  ) = 0.

p (  ) q1 (  ) = p (  ) q2 (  )

n

k   

n   

j=1

i=1

k   

n   1   

pjqi  i+j.

pjqi  i+j = 0.

then look at those terms involving   k+n. this is pkqn  k+n and is given to be 0. since
pk = 1, it follows qn = 0. thus

then consider the term involving   n   1+k and conclude that since pk = 1, it follows qn   1 = 0.
continuing this way, each qi = 0. this proves the    rst part. the second follows from

j=1

i=1

p (  ) (q1 (  )     q2 (  )) = 0. (cid:4)

the following is the analog of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for polynomials.
theorem 8.3.10 let f (  ) be a nonconstant polynomial with coe   cients in f. then there
is some a     f such that f (  ) = a
n
i=1   i (  ) where   i (  ) is an irreducible nonconstant
monic polynomial and repeats are allowed. furthermore, this factorization is unique in the
sense that any two of these factorizations have the same nonconstant factors in the product,
possibly in di   erent order and the same constant a.

   

proof: that such a factorization exists is obvious. if f (  ) is irreducible, you are done.
factor out the leading coe   cient. if not, then f (  ) = a  1 (  )   2 (  ) where these are monic
polynomials. continue doing this with the   i and eventually arrive at a factorization of the
desired form.

it remains to argue the factorization is unique except for order of the factors. suppose

n   

m   

a

  i (  ) = b

  i (  )

i=1

i=1

where the   i (  ) and the   i (  ) are all irreducible monic nonconstant polynomials and a, b    
f.
if n > m, then by lemma 8.3.8, each   i (  ) equals one of the   j (  ) . by the above
cancellation lemma, lemma 8.3.9, you can cancel all these   i (  ) with appropriate   j (  )
and obtain a contradiction because the resulting polynomials on either side would have
di   erent degrees. similarly, it cannot happen that n < m. it follows n = m and the two
products consist of the same polynomials. then it follows a = b. (cid:4)

the following corollary will be well used. this corollary seems rather believable but does

require a proof.

8.3.2 polynomials and fields
when you have a polynomial like x2     3 which has no rational roots, it turns out you can
enlarge the    eld of rational numbers to obtain a larger    eld such that this polynomial does
have roots in this larger    eld. i am going to discuss a systematic way to do this. it will
turn out that for any polynomial with coe   cients in any    eld, there always exists a possibly
larger    eld such that the polynomial has roots in this larger    eld. this book has mainly
featured the    eld of real or complex numbers but this procedure will show how to obtain
many other    elds which could be used in most of what was presented earlier in the book.
here is an important idea concerning equivalence relations which i hope is familiar.
de   nition 8.3.12 let s be a set. the symbol,     is called an equivalence relation on s if
it satis   es the following axioms.

1. x     x for all x     s. (re   exive)
2. if x     y then y     x. (symmetric)
3. if x     y and y     z, then x     z. (transitive)

de   nition 8.3.13 [x] denotes the set of all elements of s which are equivalent to x and
[x] is called the equivalence class determined by x or just the equivalence class of x.

also recall the notion of equivalence classes.

theorem 8.3.14 let     be an equivalence class de   ned on a set, s and let h denote the
set of equivalence classes. then if [x] and [y] are two of these equivalence classes, either
x     y and [x] = [y] or it is not true that x     y and [x]     [y] =    .

de   nition 8.3.15 let f be a    eld, for example the rational numbers, and denote by f [x]
the polynomials having coe   cients in f. suppose p (x) is a polynomial. let a (x)     b (x)
(a (x) is similar to b (x)) when

a (x)     b (x) = k (x) p (x)

for some polynomial k (x) .
proposition 8.3.16 in the above de   nition,     is an equivalence relation.

proof: first of all, note that a (x)     a (x) because their di   erence equals 0p (x) . if
a (x)     b (x) , then a (x)     b (x) = k (x) p (x) for some k (x) . but then b (x)     a (x) =
   k (x) p (x) and so b (x)     a (x). next suppose a (x)     b (x) and b (x)     c (x) . then
a (x)     b (x) = k (x) p (x) for some polynomial k (x) and also b (x)     c (x) = l (x) p (x) for
some polynomial l (x) . then

a (x)     c (x) = a (x)     b (x) + b (x)     c (x)

and so a (x)     c (x) and this shows the transitive law. (cid:4)

= k (x) p (x) + l (x) p (x) = (l (x) + k (x)) p (x)

with this proposition, here is another de   nition which essentially describes the elements
of the new    eld. it will eventually be necessary to assume the polynomial p (x) in the above
de   nition is irreducible so i will begin assuming this.
de   nition 8.3.17 let f be a    eld and let p (x)     f [x] be a monic irreducible polynomial.
this means there is no polynomial having coe   cients in f which divides p (x) except for itself
and constants. for the similarity relation de   ned in de   nition 8.3.15, de   ne the following
operations on the equivalence classes. [a (x)] is an equivalence class means that it is the set
of all polynomials which are similar to a (x).

[a (x)] + [b (x)]     [a (x) + b (x)]

[a (x)] [b (x)]     [a (x) b (x)]

this collection of equivalence classes is sometimes denoted by f [x] / (p (x)).

proposition 8.3.18 in the situation of de   nition 8.3.17, p (x) and q (x) are relatively
prime for any q (x)     f [x] which is not a multiple of p (x). also the de   nitions of addition
and multiplication are well de   ned. in addition, if a, b     f and [a] = [b] , then a = b.

proof: first consider the claim about p (x) , q (x) being relatively prime. if    (x) is the
greatest common divisor, it follows    (x) is either equal to p (x) or 1. if it is p (x) , then
q (x) is a multiple of p (x) . if it is 1, then by de   nition, the two polynomials are relatively
prime.

to show the operations are well de   ned, suppose

[a (x)] = [a

   

(x)] , [b (x)] = [b

it is necessary to show

[a (x) + b (x)] = [a

now suppose [a] = [b] . this means a     b = k (x) p (x) for some polynomial k (x) . then
k (x) must equal 0 since otherwise the two polynomials a     b and k (x) p (x) could not be
equal because they would have di   erent degree. (cid:4)

(8.7)

with the above preparation, here is a de   nition of a    eld in which the irreducible poly-

nomial p (x) has a root.
de   nition 8.3.19 let p (x)     f [x] be irreducible and let a (x)     b (x) when a (x)     b (x) is
a multiple of p (x) . let g denote the set of equivalence classes as described above with the
operations also described in de   nition 8.3.17.

also here is another useful de   nition and a simple proposition which comes from it.

de   nition 8.3.20 let f     k be two    elds. then clearly k is also a vector space over
f. then also, k is called a    nite    eld extension of f if the dimension of this vector space,
denoted by [k : f ] is    nite.

there are some easy things to observe about this.

proposition 8.3.21 let f     k     l be    elds. then [l : f ] = [l : k] [k : f ].

proof: let {li}n

if l     l, there exist unique scalars xi in k such that

i=1 be a basis for l over k and let {kj}m

j=1 be a basis of k over f . then

l =

xili

n   

i=1

m   
n   
m   

j=1

xi =

fjikj

now xi     k so there exist fji such that

then it follows that

l =

fjikjli

m   
n   
it follows that {kjli} is a spanning set. if

i=1

j=1

fjikjli = 0

i=1

j=1

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation8.3. lots of fields

213

then, since the li are independent, it follows that

m   

fjikj = 0

j=1

and since {kj} is independent, each fji = 0 for each j for a given arbitrary i. therefore,
{kjli} is a basis. (cid:4)
theorem 8.3.22 the set of all equivalence classes g     f/ (p (x)) described above with
the multiplicative identity given by [1] and the additive identity given by [0] along with the
operations of de   nition 8.3.17, is a    eld and p ([x]) = [0] . (thus p has a root in this new
   eld.) in addition to this, [g : f] = n, the degree of p (x) .

proof: everything is obvious except for the existence of the multiplicative inverse and
the assertion that p ([x]) = 0. suppose then that [a (x)]   = [0] . that is, a (x) is not a multiple
   1 exist? by theorem 8.3.6, a (x) , p (x) are relatively prime and
of p (x). why does [a (x)]
so there exist polynomials    (x) ,    (x) such that

and so

which, by de   nition implies

1 =    (x) p (x) + a (x)    (x)

1     a (x)    (x) =    (x) p (x)

[1     a (x)    (x)] = [1]     [a (x)    (x)] = [1]     [a (x)] [   (x)] = [0]

[

,       ,

and so [   (x)] = [a (x)]

which says [p (x)] = [0].

   1. this shows g is a    eld.
[

consider the claim about the dimension. it was just shown that [1] , [x] ,

now if p (x) = anxn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0, p ([x]) = 0 by (8.7) and the de   nition
,       , [xn]
is linearly dependent. also [1] , [x] ,
is independent because if not, there
would exist a polynomial q (x) of degree n   1 which is a multiple of p (x) which is impossible.
now for [q (x)]     g, you can write
[

where the degree of r (x) is less than n or else it equals 0. either way, [q (x)] = [r (x)] which
is a linear combination of [1] , [x] ,
[g : f]     n. you could do this by working with an irreducible factor of p (x).

note that if p (x) were not irreducible, then you could    nd a    eld extension g such that
usually, people simply write b rather than [b] if b     f. then with this convention,

. thus [g : f] = n as claimed. (cid:4)

this shows how to enlarge a    eld to get a new one in which the polynomial has a root.
by using a succession of such enlargements, called    eld extensions, there will exist a    eld
in which the given polynomial can be factored into a product of polynomials having degree
one. the    eld you obtain in this process of enlarging in which the given polynomial factors
in terms of linear factors is called a splitting    eld.

theorem 8.3.23 let p (x) = xn+an   1xn   1+      +a1x+a0 be a polynomial with coe   cients
in a    eld of scalars f. there exists a larger    eld g such that there exist {z1,       , zn} listed

according to multiplicity such that

n   

(x     zi)

p (x) =

i=1

this larger    eld is called a splitting    eld. furthermore,

[g : f]     n!

proof: from theorem 8.3.22, there exists a    eld f1 such that p (x) has a root, z1 (= [x]

if p is irreducible.) then by the euclidean algorithm

where r     f1. since p (z1) = 0, this requires r = 0. now do the same for q1 (x) that was
done for p (x) , enlarging the    eld to f2 if necessary, such that in this new    eld

p (x) = (x     z1) q1 (x) + r

q1 (x) = (x     z2) q2 (x) .

and so

p (x) = (x     z1) (x     z2) q2 (x)

after n such extensions, you will have obtained the necessary    eld g.
g1 such that p (x) has a root a1 in g1 and [g : f]     n. then

finally consider the claim about dimension. by theorem 8.3.22, there is a larger    eld

p (x) = (x     a1) q (x)

continue this way until the polynomial equals the product of linear factors. then by
proposition 8.3.21 applied multiple times, [g : f]     n!. (cid:4)
example 8.3.24 the polynomial x2 + 1 is irreducible in r (x) , polynomials having real
coe   cients. to see this is the case, suppose    (x) divides x2 + 1. then

x2 + 1 =    (x) q (x)

if the degree of    (x) is less than 2, then it must be either a constant or of the form ax + b.
in the latter case,    b/a must be a zero of the right side, hence of the left but x2 + 1 has no
real zeros. therefore, the degree of    (x) must be two and q (x) must be a constant. thus
the only polynomial which divides x2 + 1 are constants and multiples of x2 + 1. therefore,
this shows x2 + 1 is irreducible. find the inverse of

classes, r/

the following proposition is interesting. it was essentially proved above but to emphasize

it, here it is again.

proposition 8.3.25 suppose p (x)     f [x] is irreducible and has degree n. then every
element of g = f [x] / (p (x)) is of the form [0] or [r (x)] where the degree of r (x) is less
than n.

proof: this follows right away from the euclidean algorithm for polynomials. if k (x)

has degree larger than n     1, then

k (x) = q (x) p (x) + r (x)

where r (x) is either equal to 0 or has degree less than n. hence

[k (x)] = [r (x)] . (cid:4)

8.3.3 the algebraic numbers
each polynomial having coe   cients in a    eld f has a splitting    eld. consider the case of all
polynomials p (x) having coe   cients in a    eld f     g and consider all roots which are also
in g. the theory of vector spaces is very useful in the study of these algebraic numbers.
here is a de   nition.
de   nition 8.3.27 the algebraic numbers a are those numbers which are in g and also
roots of some polynomial p (x) having coe   cients in f.
theorem 8.3.28 let a     a. then there exists a unique monic irreducible polynomial p (x)
having coe   cients in f such that p (a) = 0. this is called the minimal polynomial for a.

proof: by de   nition, there exists a polynomial q (x) having coe   cients in f such that
q (a) = 0. if q (x) is irreducible, divide by the leading coe   cient and this proves the existence.
if q (x) is not irreducible, then there exist nonconstant polynomials r (x) and k (x) such that
q (x) = r (x) k (x). then one of r (a) , k (a) equals 0. pick the one which equals zero and let it
play the role of q (x). continuing this way, in    nitely many steps one obtains an irreducible
polynomial p (x) such that p (a) = 0. now divide by the leading coe   cient and this proves
existence. suppose pi, i = 1, 2 both work and they are not equal. then by lemma 8.3.7

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation216

vector spaces and fields

they must be relatively prime because they are both assumed to be irreducible and so there
exist polynomials l (x) , k (x) such that

1 = l (x) p1 (x) + k (x) p2 (x)

but now when a is substituted for x, this yields 0 = 1, a contradiction. the polynomials
are equal after all. (cid:4)

de   nition 8.3.29 for a an algebraic number, let deg (a) denote the degree of the minimal
polynomial of a.

also, here is another de   nition.

de   nition 8.3.30 let a1,       , am be in a. a polynomial in {a1,       , am} will be an ex-

pression of the form

   

k1      kn

ak1      kn ak1

1

       akn

n

where the ak1      kn are in f, each kj is a nonnegative integer, and all but    nitely many of the
ak1      kn equal zero. the collection of such polynomials will be denoted by

f [a1,       , am] .

now notice that for a an algebraic number, f [a] is a vector space with    eld of scalars f.
similarly, for {a1,       , am} algebraic numbers, f [a1,       , am] is a vector space with    eld of
scalars f. the following fundamental proposition is important.
proposition 8.3.31 let {a1,       , am} be algebraic numbers. then

dim f [a1,       , am]     m   

deg (aj)

j=1

and for an algebraic number a,

dim f [a] = deg (a)

every element of f [a1,       , am] is in a and f [a1,       , am] is a    eld.

proof: first consider the second assertion. let the minimal polynomial of a be

{
p (x) = xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0.
1, a, a2,       , an

}

is linearly dependent. however, if the degree
since p (a) = 0, it follows
of q (x) is less than the degree of p (x) , then if q (x) is not a constant, the two must be
relatively prime because p (x) is irreducible and so there exist polynomials k (x) , l (x) such
that

1 = l (x) q (x) + k (x) p (x)

and this is a contradiction if q (a) = 0 because it would imply upon replacing x with a that
1 = 0. therefore, no polynomial having degree less than n can have a as a root. it follows

{
1, a, a2,       , an   1

}

is linearly independent. thus dim f [a] = deg (a) = n. here is why this is. if q (a) is any
element of f [a] ,

q (x) = p (x) k (x) + r (x)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation{

ak1
1 , ak2
where the ki are nonnegative integers. from the    rst
part, it su   ces to consider only kj     deg (aj). therefore, there exists a spanning set for
f [a1,       , am] which has

entries. by theorem 8.2.4 this proves the    rst claim.

finally consider the last claim. let g (a1,       , am) be a polynomial in {a1,       , am} in

f [a1,       , am]. since

dim f [a1,       , am]     p     m   

deg (aj) <    ,

j=1

it follows

1, g (a1,       , am) , g (a1,       , am)2 ,       , g (a1,       , am)p

are dependent. it follows g (a1,       , am) is the root of some polynomial having coe   cients
in f. thus everything in f [a1,       , am] is algebraic. why is f [a1,       , am] a    eld? let
g (a1,       , am) be as just mentioned. then it has a minimal polynomial,

p (x) = xp + ap   1xp   1 +        + a1x + a0

(

)

where the ai     f. then a0   = 0 or else the polynomial would not be minimal. therefore,

g (a1,       , am)

g (a1,       , am)p   1 + ap   1g (a1,       , am)p   2 +        + a1

=    a0

and so the multiplicative inverse for g (a1,       , am) is

g (a1,       , am)p   1 + ap   1g (a1,       , am)p   2 +        + a1

   a0

    f [a1,       , am] .

the other axioms of a    eld are obvious. (cid:4)

now from this proposition, it is easy to obtain the following interesting result about the

algebraic numbers.
theorem 8.3.32 the algebraic numbers a, those roots of polynomials in f [x] which are
in g, are a    eld.

proof: let a be an algebraic number and let p (x) be its minimal polynomial. then

p (x) is of the form

where a0   = 0. then plugging in a yields

xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0

= 1.

   1 =

    f [a]. by the proposition, every element of f [a]
and so a
is in a and this shows that for every element of a, its inverse is also in a. what about
products and sums of things in a? are they still in a? yes. if a, b     a, then both a + b
and ab     f [a, b] and from the proposition, each element of f [a, b] is in a. (cid:4)

a typical example of what is of interest here is when the    eld f of scalars is q, the
rational numbers and the    eld g is r. however, you can certainly conceive of many other
examples by considering the integers mod a prime, for example (see problem 34 on page
222 for example.) or any of the    elds which occur as    eld extensions in the above.

there is a very interesting thing about f [a1        an] in the case where f is in   nite which
says that there exists a single algebraic    such that f [a1        an] = f [  ]. in other words,

every    eld extension of this sort is a simple    eld extension. i found this fact in an early
version of [5].

proposition 8.3.33 there exists    such that f [a1        an] = f [  ].

proof: to begin with, consider f [  ,   ]. let    =    +     . then by proposition 8.3.31   

is an algebraic number and it is also clear

f [  ]     f [  ,   ]

i need to show the other inclusion. this will be done for a suitable choice of   . to do this,
it su   ces to verify that both    and    are in f [  ].
let the minimal polynomials of    and    be f (x) and g (x) respectively. let the distinct
roots of f (x) and g (x) be {  1,   2,       ,   n} and {  1,   2,       ,   m
} respectively. these roots
are in a    eld which contains splitting    elds of both f (x) and g (x). let    =   1 and    =   1.
now de   ne
h (x)     f (   +            x)     f (         x)
(
)

so that h (  ) = f (  ) = 0. it follows (x       ) divides both h (x) and g (x). if (x       ) is a
di   erent linear factor of both g (x) and h (x) then it must be
for some   j for some
j > 1 because these are the only factors of g (x) . therefore, this would require

x       j

)

(

)

0 = h

  j

= f

and so it would be the case that   1 +     1

  1 +     1

        j

(
        j =   k for some k. hence
  k       1
      j
  1

   =

now there are    nitely many quotients of the above form and if    is chosen to not be any of
them, then the above cannot happen and so in this case, the only linear factor of both g (x)
and h (x) will be (x       ). choose such a   .

let    (x) be the minimal polynomial of    with respect to the    eld f [  ]. then this
minimal polynomial must divide both h (x) and g (x) because h (  ) = g (  ) = 0. however,
the only factor these two have in common is x        and so    (x) = x        which requires
       f [  ] . now also    =             and so        f [  ] also. therefore, both   ,        f [  ] which
forces f [  ,   ]     f [  ] . this proves the proposition in the case that n = 2. the general result
follows right away by observing that

f [a1        an] = f [a1        an   1] [an]

and using induction. (cid:4)

when you have a    eld f, f (a) denotes the smallest    eld which contains both f and a.
when a is algebraic over f, it follows that f (a) = f [a] . the latter is easier to think about
because it just involves polynomials.

as another application of the abstract concept of vector spaces, there is an amazing theorem
due to weierstrass and lindemannn.

theorem 8.3.34 suppose a1,       , an are algebraic numbers and suppose   1,       ,   n are

distinct algebraic numbers. then

n   

aie  i   = 0

in other words, the {e  1 ,       , e  n} are independent as vectors with    eld of scalars equal to
the algebraic numbers.

i=1

there is a proof of this in the appendix.

it is long and hard but only depends on
elementary considerations other than some algebra involving symmetric polynomials. see
theorem f.3.5.

a number is transcendental if it is not a root of a polynomial which has integer co-
e   cients. most numbers are this way but it is hard to verify that speci   c numbers are
transcendental. that    is transcendental follows from

e0 + ei   = 0.

by the above theorem, this could not happen if    were algebraic because then i   would also
be algebraic. recall these algebraic numbers form a    eld and i is clearly algebraic, being
a root of x2 + 1. this fact about    was    rst proved by lindemannn in 1882 and then the
general theorem above was proved by weierstrass in 1885. this fact that    is transcendental
solved an old problem called squaring the circle which was to construct a square with the
same area as a circle using a straight edge and compass. it can be shown that the fact    is
transcendental implies this problem is impossible.1

way. show there must be in   nitely many primes. hint: show that if you have any
   nite set of primes and you multiply them and then add 1, the result cannot be
divisible by any of the primes in your    nite set. this idea in the hint is due to euclid
who lived about 300 b.c.

34. there are lots of    elds. this will give an example of a    nite    eld. let z denote the set
of integers. thus z = {       ,   3,   2,   1, 0, 1, 2, 3,      }. also let p be a prime number.
we will say that two integers, a, b are equivalent and write a     b if a     b is divisible
by p. thus they are equivalent if a     b = px for some integer x. first show that
a     a. next show that if a     b then b     a. finally show that if a     b and b     c
then a     c. for a an integer, denote by [a] the set of all integers which is equivalent
to a, the equivalence class of a. show    rst that is su   ces to consider only [a] for
a = 0, 1, 2,       , p     1 and that for 0     a < b     p     1, [a]   = [b]. that is, [a] = [r] where
r     {0, 1, 2,       , p     1}. thus there are exactly p of these equivalence classes. hint:
recall the euclidean algorithm. for a > 0, a = mp + r where r < p. next de   ne the
following operations.

[a] + [b]     [a + b]

] and [b] = [b

show these operations are well de   ned. that is, if [a] = [a

[a] + [b] = [a

addition you need to verify [a + b] = [a
] and for multiplication you need to verify
]. for example, if p = 5 you have [3] = [8] and [2] = [7] . is [2    3] = [8    7]?
[ab] = [a
is [2 + 3] = [8 + 7]? clearly so in this example because when you subtract, the result
is divisible by 5. so why is this so in general? now verify that {[0] , [1] ,       , [p     1]}
with these operations is a field. this is called the integers modulo a prime and is
written zp. since there are in   nitely many primes p, it follows there are in   nitely
many of these    nite    elds. hint: most of the axioms are easy once you have shown
the operations are well de   ned. the only two which are tricky are the ones which
give the existence of the additive inverse and the multiplicative inverse. of these, the

   rst is not hard.     [x] = [   x]. since p is prime, there exist integers x, y such that
1 = px+ky and so 1   ky = px which says 1     ky and so [1] = [ky] . now you    nish the
argument. what is the multiplicative identity in this collection of equivalence classes?
of course you could now consider    eld extensions based on these    elds.

where the polynomials qi (x) are relatively prime and all the polynomials p (x) and

expansion of calculus must be true. you can use the fact that every polynomial having
real coe   cients factors into a product of irreducible quadratic polynomials and linear
polynomials having real coe   cients. this follows from the fundamental theorem of
algebra in the appendix.

which maps v to w is called a linear transformation and written l     l (v, w ) if for all

you should verify that all the axioms of a vector space hold for l (v, w ) with the

of l (v, w )?

before answering this question, here is a useful lemma. it gives a way to de   ne linear

transformations and a way to tell when two of them are equal.

way to write a given vector of v as a linear combination. next, observe that l is obviously

the message is that when you de   ne a linear transformation, it su   ces to tell what it

does to a basis.

theorem 9.2.3 let v and w be    nite dimensional linear spaces of dimension n and m
respectively then dim (l (v, w )) = mn.

proof: let two sets of bases be

{v1,       , vn} and {w1,       , wm}

for v and w respectively. using lemma 9.2.2, let wivj     l (v, w ) be the linear transfor-

wivk (vj)     wi  jk

where   ik = 1 if i = k and 0 if i   = k. i will show that l     l (v, w ) is a linear combination

and so, since {w1,       , wm} is a basis, dil = 0 for each i = 1,       , m. since l is arbitrary,
this shows dil = 0 for all i and l. thus these linear transformations form a basis and this
shows that the dimension of l (v, w ) is mn as claimed because there are m choices for the
wi and n choices for the vj. (cid:4)

of v by [l]     gives the components of lv.

proof: this happens because by de   nition, if v =

   
   

   

i xivi, then

[l]ji xiwj =

[l]ji xiwj

j

j

i

   

xilvi    

lv =

i

   

   
   

i

and so the jth component of lv is
i [l]ji xi, the jth component of the matrix times the
component vector of v. could there be some other matrix which will do this? no, because if
such a matrix is m, then for any x , it follows from what was just shown that [l] x = m x.
hence [l] = m . (cid:4)

the above proposition shows that the following diagram determines the matrix of a
linear transformation. here q   and q   are the maps de   ned above with reference to the
ordered bases, {v1,       , vn} and {w1,       , wm} respectively.

with the understanding that you do the multiplications in a formal manner just as you
would if everything were numbers. if this helps, use it. if it does not help, ignore it.

example 9.3.3 let

v     { polynomials of degree 3 or less},
w     { polynomials of degree 2 or less},

and l     d where d is the di   erentiation operator. a basis for v is    =
a basis for w is    = {1, x, x2}.

and

what is the matrix of this linear transformation with respect to this basis? using (9.2),

it follows from this that the    rst column of [d]     is

and so

now consider the important case where v = fn, w = fm, and the basis chosen is the

standard basis of vectors ei described above.

   = {e1,       , en} ,    = {e1,       , em}

let l be a linear transformation from fn to fm and let a be the matrix of the transformation
with respect to these bases.
in this case the coordinate maps q   and q   are simply the
identity maps on fn and fm respectively, and can be accomplished by simply multiplying

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation9.3. the matrix of a linear transformation

229

by the appropriate sized identity matrix. the requirement that a is the matrix of the
transformation amounts to

lb = ab

what about the situation where di   erent pairs of bases are chosen for v and w ? how
are the two matrices with respect to these choices related? consider the following diagram
which illustrates the situation.

fn a2       fm

by multiplication by a square matrix. thus there exist matrices p, q such that p : fn     fn
and q : fm     fm are invertible and

p a2q = a1.

example 9.3.4 let        {v1,       , vn} and        {w1,       , wn} be two bases for v . let l
be the linear transformation which maps vi to wi. find [l]     . in case v = fn and letting
   = {e1,       , en} , the usual basis for fn,    nd [l]  .
   
(
)   1(

letting   ij be the symbol which equals 1 if i = j and 0 if i   = j, it follows that l =

de   nition 9.3.7 [x] denotes the set of all elements of s which are equivalent to x and [x]
is called the equivalence class determined by x or just the equivalence class of x.

also recall the notion of equivalence classes.

theorem 9.3.8 let     be an equivalence class de   ned on a set s and let h denote the set
of equivalence classes. then if [x] and [y] are two of these equivalence classes, either x     y
and [x] = [y] or it is not true that x     y and [x]     [y] =    .
theorem 9.3.9 in the vector space of n    n matrices, de   ne

a = s

then     is an equivalence relation and a     b if and only if whenever v is an n dimensional

a is the matrix of l with respect to {v1,       , vn} and b is the matrix of l with respect to
{w1,       , wn}.

proof: a     a because s = i works in the de   nition. if a     b , then b     a, because

implies b = sas

a = s

then it follows that b is the matrix of l with respect to the basis

that is, a and b are matrices of the same linear transformation l. conversely, if a     b,

what if the linear transformation consists of multiplication by a matrix a and you want
to    nd the matrix of this linear transformation with respect to another basis? is there an

in simple language, to    nd lx, you multiply on the left of x by a. (a is the matrix of l

the following theorem is of great signi   cance.

theorem 9.3.12 let a be an n   n matrix. then a is diagonalizable if and only if fn has
a basis of eigenvectors of a. in this case, s of de   nition 9.3.11 consists of the n   n matrix
whose columns are the eigenvectors of a and d = diag (  1,       ,   n) .

proof: suppose    rst that fn has a basis of eigenvectors, {v1,       , vn} where avi =   ivi.

the following result is a summary of many concepts.

theorem 9.3.16 let l     l (v, v ) where v is a    nite dimensional vector space. then the
following are equivalent.

1. l is one to one.

2. l maps a basis to a basis.

3. l is onto.
4. det (l)   = 0
   

5. if lv = 0 then v = 0.

   

proof: suppose    rst l is one to one and let    = {vi}n

been shown that 2.) implies 3.).

now suppose 3.). then the operation consisting of multiplication by the matrix of l, [l],
must be onto. however, the vectors in fn so obtained, consist of linear combinations of the
columns of [l] . therefore, the column rank of [l] is n. by theorem 3.3.23 this equals the
determinant rank and so det ([l])     det (l)   = 0.
now assume 4.) if lv = 0 for some v   = 0, it follows that [l] x = 0 for some x   = 0.
therefore, the columns of [l] are linearly dependent and so by theorem 3.3.23, det ([l]) =
det (l) = 0 contrary to 4.). therefore, 4.) implies 5.).

now suppose 5.) and suppose lv = lw. then l (v     w) = 0 and so by 5.), v     w = 0

showing that l is one to one. (cid:4)

also it is important to note that composition of linear transformations corresponds to
multiplication of the matrices. consider the following diagram in which [a]     denotes the
matrix of a relative to the bases    on y and    on x, [b]     de   ned similarly.

where a and b are two linear transformations, a     l (x, y ) and b     l (y, z) . then
b     a     l (x, z) and so it has a matrix with respect to bases given on x and z, the
coordinate maps for these bases being q   and q   respectively. then

but this shows that [b]     [a]     plays the role of [b     a]     , the matrix of b     a. hence the
matrix of b     a equals the product of the two matrices [a]     and [b]     . of course it is
interesting to note that although [b     a]     must be unique, the matrices, [a]     and [b]    

are not unique because they depend on   , the basis chosen for y .

theorem 9.3.17 the matrix of the composition of linear transformations equals the prod-
uct of the matrices of these linear transformations.

9.3.1 some geometrically de   ned linear transformations
if t is any linear transformation which maps fn to fm, there is always an m    n matrix
a     [t ] with the property that
(9.4)
for all x     fn. you simply take the matrix of the linear transformation with respect to the
standard basis. what is the form of a? suppose t : fn     fm is a linear transformation
and you want to    nd the matrix de   ned by this linear transformation as described in (9.4).
then if x     fn it follows

ax = t x

n   

x =

where ei is the vector which has zeros in every slot but the ith and a 1 in this slot. then
since t is linear,

and so you see that the matrix desired is obtained from letting the ith column equal t (ei) .
this proves the following theorem.

in this case, t e3 = e3, t e1 =
(cos   , sin   , 0)t , and t e2 = (    sin   , cos   , 0)t . therefore, the matrix of this transformation

is just

in physics it is important to consider the work done by a force    eld on an object. this
involves the concept of projection onto a vector. suppose you want to    nd the projection
of a vector, v onto the given vector, u, denoted by proju (v) this is done using the dot
product as follows.

proju (v) =

u

(
because of properties of the dot product, the map v     proju (v) is linear,
w    u
u    u

v    u
u    u
=    proju (v) +    proju (w) .

proju (  v+  w) =

example 9.3.22 let the projection map be de   ned above and let u = (1, 2, 3)t . find the
matrix of this linear transformation with respect to the usual basis.

you can    nd this matrix in the same way as in earlier examples. proju (ei) gives the ith

column of the desired matrix. therefore, it is only necessary to    nd

for the given vector in the example, this implies the columns of the desired matrix are

9.3.2 rotations about a given vector

as an application, i will consider the problem of rotating counter clockwise about a given
unit vector which is possibly not one of the unit vectors in coordinate directions. first
consider a pair of perpendicular unit vectors, u1 and u2 and the problem of rotating in the
counterclockwise direction about u3 where u3 = u1    u2 so that u1, u2, u3 forms a right
handed orthogonal coordinate system. thus the vector u3 is coming out of the page.

let t denote the desired rotation. then

t (au1 + bu2 + cu3) = at u1 + bt u2 + ct u3

= (a cos        b sin   ) u1 + (a sin    + b cos   ) u2 + cu3.

thus in terms of the basis        {u1, u2, u3} , the matrix of this transformation is

i want to obtain the matrix of the transformation in terms of the usual basis        {e1, e2, e3}

because it is in terms of this basis that we usually deal with vectors. from proposition 9.3.10,
if [t ]   is this matrix,

suppose the unit vector u3 about which the counterclockwise rotation takes place is
(a, b, c). then i obtain vectors, u1 and u2 such that {u1, u2, u3} is a right handed orthonor-
mal system with u3 = (a, b, c) and then use the above result.
it is of course somewhat
arbitrary how this is accomplished. i will assume however, that |c|   = 1 since otherwise you
are looking at either clockwise or counter clockwise rotation about the positive z axis and
this is a problem which has been dealt with earlier. (if c =    1, it amounts to clockwise
rotation about the positive z axis while if c = 1, it is counter clockwise rotation about the
positive z axis.)

now recall that u3 is a unit vector and so the above equals

of course the matrix is an orthogonal matrix so it is easy to take the inverse by simply
taking the transpose. then doing the computation and then some simpli   cation yields

with this, it is clear how to rotate clockwise about the unit vector, (a, b, c) . just rotate
counter clockwise through an angle of      . thus the matrix for this clockwise rotation is just

cos   
ab (1     cos   )     c sin   
ac (1     cos   ) + b sin

bc (1     cos   )     a sin   
c2 +
cos   

1     c2

1     b2

(

)

in deriving (9.6) it was assumed that c   =   1 but even in this case, it gives the correct
answer. suppose for example that c = 1 so you are rotating in the counter clockwise
direction about the positive z axis. then a, b are both equal to zero and (9.6) reduces to
(9.5).

9.3.3 the euler angles

mechanics of rotating bodies. lagrange studied these things back in the 1700   s. to describe

the euler angles consider the following picture in which x1, x2 and x3 are the usual coordinate
axes    xed in space and the axes labeled with a superscript denote other coordinate axes.
here is the picture.

we obtain    by rotating counter clockwise about the    xed x3 axis. thus this rotation

has the matrix

next rotate counter clockwise about the x1

an angle of   . thus it is desired to rotate counter clockwise through an angle    about the
unit vector

therefore, in (9.6), a = cos   , b = sin   , and c = 0. it follows the matrix of this transforma-
tion with respect to the usual basis is

finally, we rotate counter clockwise about the positive x2

cos    sin    (1     cos   )

       =

      

cos   

    sin    sin   

and it is desired to rotate counter clockwise through an angle of    about this vector. thus,
in this case,

a = cos2    + sin2    cos   , b = cos    sin    (1     cos   ) , c =     sin    sin   .

and you could substitute in to the formula of theorem (9.6) and obtain a matrix which rep-
resents the linear transformation obtained by rotating counter clockwise about the positive
x2
3 axis, m3 (  ,   ,   ) . then what would be the matrix with respect to the usual basis for the

linear transformation which is obtained as a composition of the three just described? by
theorem 9.3.17, this matrix equals the product of these three,

m3 (  ,   ,   ) m2 (  ,   ) m1 (  ) .

i leave the details to you. there are procedures due to lagrange which will allow you to
write di   erential equations for the euler angles in a rotating body. to give an idea how
these angles apply, consider the following picture.

a composition of linear transformations. you see from the picture it is possible to describe
the motion of the spinning top shown in terms of these euler angles.

9.4 eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear transfor-

mations

let v be a    nite dimensional vector space. for example, it could be a subspace of cnor rn.
also suppose a     l (v, v ) .
de   nition 9.4.1 the characteristic polynomial of a is de   ned as q (  )     det (  i     a) .
the zeros of q (  ) in c are called the eigenvalues of a.
lemma 9.4.2 when    is an eigenvalue of a which is also in f, the    eld of scalars, then
there exists v   = 0 such that av =   v.

proof: this follows from theorem 9.3.16. since        f,

  i     a     l (v, v )

and since it has zero determinant, it is not one to one. (cid:4)

the following lemma gives the existence of something called the minimal polynomial.
lemma 9.4.3 let a     l (v, v ) where v is a    nite dimensional vector space of dimension
n with arbitrary    eld of scalars. then there exists a unique polynomial of the form

p (  ) =   m + cm   1  m   1 +        + c1   + c0

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation9.4. eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear transformations

241

such that p (a) = 0 and m is as small as possible for this to occur.
proof: consider the linear transformations, i, a, a2,       , an2

. there are n2 + 1 of these
transformations and so by theorem 9.2.3 the set is linearly dependent. thus there exist

constants, ci     f such that

n2   

c0i +

k=1

ckak = 0.

   

this implies there exists a polynomial, q (  ) which has the property that q (a) = 0. in fact,
one example is q (  )     c0 +
n2
k=1 ck  k. dividing by the leading term, it can be assumed
this polynomial is of the form   m + cm   1  m   1 +        + c1   + c0, a monic polynomial. now

consider all such monic polynomials, q such that q (a) = 0 and pick the one which has the
smallest degree m. this is called the minimal polynomial and will be denoted here by p (  ) .
if there were two minimal polynomials, the one just found and another,

  m + dm   1  m   1 +        + d1   + d0.

then subtracting these would give the following polynomial,

   

q

(  ) = (dm   1     cm   1)   m   1 +        + (d1     c1)    + d0     c0

   

(a) = 0, this requires each dk = ck since otherwise you could divide by dk     ck
since q
where k is the largest one which is nonzero. thus the choice of m would be contradicted. (cid:4)

theorem 9.4.4 let v be a nonzero    nite dimensional vector space of dimension n with
the    eld of scalars equal to f. suppose a     l (v, v ) and for p (  ) the minimal polynomial
de   ned above, let        f be a zero of this polynomial. then there exists v   = 0,v     v such
that

if f = c, then a always has an eigenvector and eigenvalue. furthermore, if {  1,       ,   m}
are the zeros of p (  ) in f, these are exactly the eigenvalues of a for which there exists an
eigenvector in v.

av =   v.

proof: suppose    rst    is a zero of p (  ) . since p (  ) = 0, it follows

p (  ) = (         ) k (  )

where k (  ) is a polynomial having coe   cients in f. since p has minimal degree, k (a)   = 0
and so there exists a vector, u   = 0 such that k (a) u     v   = 0. but then

(a       i) v = (a       i) k (a) (u) = 0.

the next claim about the existence of an eigenvalue follows from the fundamental theo-

rem of algebra and what was just shown.

it has been shown that every zero of p (  ) is an eigenvalue which has an eigenvector in
v . now suppose    is an eigenvalue which has an eigenvector in v so that av =   v for some
v     v, v   = 0. does it follow    is a zero of p (  )?

and so    is indeed a zero of p (  ). (cid:4)

0 = p (a) v = p (  ) v

in summary, the theorem says that the eigenvalues which have eigenvectors in v are

exactly the zeros of the minimal polynomial which are in the    eld of scalars f.

f contains a splitting    eld of pa (  ) so that p (  ) factors into a product of linear
polynomials having coe   cients in f. it is the second case which is of interest here
where pa (  ) does not factor into linear factors having coe   cients in f. let g be a
splitting    eld of pa (  ) and let qa (  ) be the minimal polynomial of a with respect
to the    eld g. explain why qa (  ) must divide pa (  ). now why must qa (  ) factor
completely into linear factors?

10.1 a theorem of sylvester, direct sums

the notation is de   ned as follows.
de   nition 10.1.1 let l     l (v, w ) . then ker (l)     {v     v : lv = 0} .
lemma 10.1.2 whenever l     l (v, w ) , ker (l) is a subspace.

proof: if a, b are scalars and v,w are in ker (l) , then

l (av + bw) = al (v) + bl (w) = 0 + 0 = 0 (cid:4)

suppose now that a     l (v, w ) and b     l (w, u ) where v, w, u are all    nite dimen-
sional vector spaces. then it is interesting to consider ker (ba). the following theorem of
sylvester is a very useful and important result.
theorem 10.1.3 let a     l (v, w ) and b     l (w, u ) where v, w, u are all vector spaces
over a    eld f. suppose also that ker (a) and a (ker (ba)) are    nite dimensional subspaces.
then

dim (ker (ba))     dim (ker (b)) + dim (ker (a)) .

proof: if x     ker (ba) , then ax     ker (b) and so a (ker (ba))     ker (b) . the following

picture may help.

now let {x1,       , xn} be a basis of ker (a) and let {ay1,       , aym} be a basis for

therefore, by sylvester   s theorem and the above,

now in general, if w is a subspace of v, a    nite dimensional vector space and the two have
the same dimension, then w = v . this is because w has a basis and if v is not in the span
of this basis, then v adjoined to the basis of w would be a linearly independent set, yielding
a linearly independent set which has more vectors in it than a basis, a contradiction.

10.2 direct sums, block diagonal matrices
let v be a    nite dimensional vector space with    eld of scalars f. here i will make no
assumption on f. also suppose a     l (v, v ) .

recall lemma 9.4.3 which gives the existence of the minimal polynomial for a linear
transformation a. this is the monic polynomial p which has smallest possible degree such
that p(a) = 0. it is stated again for convenience.
lemma 10.2.1 let a     l (v, v ) where v is a    nite dimensional vector space of dimension
n with    eld of scalars f. then there exists a unique monic polynomial of the form

p (  ) =   m + cm   1  m   1 +        + c1   + c0

such that p (a) = 0 and m is as small as possible for this to occur.

now here is a useful lemma which will be used below.

lemma 10.2.2 let l     l (v, v ) where v is an n dimensional vector space. then if l
is one to one, it follows that l is also onto. in fact, if {v1,       , vn} is a basis, then so is
{lv1,       , lvn}.

proof: let {v1,       , vn} be a basis for v . then i claim that {lv1,       , lvn} is also a

basis for v . first of all, i show {lv1,       , lvn} is linearly independent. suppose

which implies each ck = 0. therefore, {lv1,       , lvn} is linearly independent.
exists w not in the span of these vectors, then by lemma 8.2.10, {lv1,       , lvn, w} would
be a linearly independent set having more vectors than the spanning set {v1,       , vn} . (cid:4)

now it is time to consider the notion of a direct sum of subspaces. recall you can
always assert the existence of a factorization of the minimal polynomial into a product of
irreducible polynomials. this fact will now be used to show how to obtain such a direct
sum of subspaces.

proof: it is clear vk is a subspace which is a invariant because a commutes with

  k (a)mk . it is clear the operators   k (a)rk commute. thus if v     vk,

  k (a)rk   l (a)rl v =   l (a)rl   k (a)rk v =   l (a)rl 0 = 0

and so   l (a)rl : vk     vk.
  k (  )rk are relatively prime so there exist polynomials m (  ) , n (  ) such that

i claim   l (a) is one to one on vk whenever k   = l. the two polynomials   l (  ) and

m (  )   l (  ) + n (  )   k (  )rk = 1

it follows that the sum of all coe   cients of    raised to a positive power are zero and the
constant term on the left is 1. therefore, using the convention a0 = i it follows

if v     vk, then from the above,

m (a)   l (a) + n (a)   k (a)rk = i

m (a)   l (a) v + n (a)   k (a)rk v = v

since v is in vk, it follows by de   nition,

m (a)   l (a) v = v

   

and so   l (a) v   = 0 unless v = 0. thus   l (a) and hence   l (a)rl is one to one on vk for
every k   = l. by lemma 10.1.6 and the fact that ker (
k=1   k (  )rk ) = v, (10.2) is obtained.
the claim about the bases follows from lemma 10.1.5. (cid:4)

q

and letting ak denote the restriction of a to vk, it follows the minimal polynomial of ak is
  k (  )mk .

   
proof: recall the direct sum, v1                vq = v where vk = ker (  k (a)mk ) for p (  ) =
k=1   k (  )mk the minimal polynomial for a where the   k (  ) are all irreducible. thus each
vk is invariant with respect to a. what is the minimal polynomial of ak, the restriction of
a to vk? first note that   k (ak)mk (vk) = {0} by de   nition. thus if    (  ) is the minimal
polynomial for ak then it must divide   k (  )mk and so by corollary 8.3.11    (  ) =   k (  )rk
where rk     mk. could rk < mk? no, this is not possible because then p (  ) would fail
to be the minimal polynomial for a. you could substitute for the term   k (  )mk in the
   
factorization of p (  ) with   k (  )rk and the resulting polynomial p
(a) = 0.
here is why. from theorem 10.2.4, a typical x     v is of the form

corollary 10.2.7 if any   k in the above consists of eigenvectors, then m k is a diagonal
matrix having the corresponding eigenvalues down the diagonal.

it follows that it would be interesting to consider special bases for the vector spaces in
the direct sum. this leads to the jordan form or more generally other canonical forms such
as the rational canonical form.

10.3 cyclic sets
it was shown above that for a     l (v, v ) for v a    nite dimensional vector space over the

proof: consider the    rst claim. if    (a) x = 0, then writing

   (  )m =    (  ) g (  ) + r (  )

where either r (  ) = 0 or the degree of r (  ) is less than that of    (  ) , the latter possibility
cannot occur because if it did, r (a) x = 0 and this would contradict the de   nition of    (  ).
therefore r (  ) = 0 and so    (  ) divides    (  )m . from corollary 8.3.11,

   (  ) =    (  )k

for some integer, k     m. since x   = 0, it follows k > 0. in particular, the degree of    (  )
equals kd.
now consider x   = 0, x     ker (   (a)m) and the vectors   x. do these vectors yield a

and r is as small as possible for this to happen. suppose then that there are scalars dj, not
all zero such that

suppose m is the largest nonzero scalar in the above linear combination. dm   = 0, m     r    1.
then amx is a linear combination of the preceeding vectors in the list, which contradicts
the de   nition of r. thus from the    rst part, r = kd for some positive integer k.

it remains to verify that {v1,       , vr, w1,       , ws} is linearly independent. suppose then that

do b to both sides. this yields
then independence of the wi yields each bj = 0. (cid:4)

i aibvi = 0 and by assumption, this requires each ai = 0.

with this preparation, here is the main result about a basis for ker (   (a)m) for    (  )

{
z is some vector space containing v, and    (  ) is an irreducible monic polynomial over

suppose v = ker (   (a)m). then    (a)m   1 maps v to v and so by lemma 10.3.3,

(
v = ker (   (a)). then by this lemma, there exist v1, v2,       , vs such that

because if y     v = ker (   (a)m) , then    (a)m   1 y is a typical thing in    (a)m   1 (v ) . but

10.4 nilpotent transformations
de   nition 10.4.1 let v be a vector space over the    eld of scalars f. then n     l (v, v )
is called nilpotent if for some m, it follows that n m = 0.

   

the following lemma contains some signi   cant observations about nilpotent transforma-

tions.
lemma 10.4.2 suppose n kx   = 0. then
the minimal polynomial of n is   m where m is the    rst such that n m = 0.

}

is linearly independent. also,

k

proof: suppose

i=0 cin ix = 0. there exists l such that k     l < m and n l+1x = 0
but n lx   = 0. then multiply both sides by n l to conclude that c0 = 0. next multiply both
sides by n l   1 to conclude that c1 = 0 and continue this way to obtain that all the ci = 0.
if p (  ) is the minimal

next consider the claim that   m is the minimal polynomial.

polynomial, then

p (  ) =   ml (  ) + r (  )

where the degree of r (  ) is less than m or else r (  ) = 0. suppose the degree of r (  ) is less
than m. then you would have

if r (  ) = a0 + a1   +        + as  s for s     m     1, as   = 0, then for any x     v,

0 = 0 + r (n ) .

0 = a0x + a1n x +        + asn sx

if for some x, n sx   = 0, then from the    rst part of the argument, the above equation could
not hold. hence n sx = 0 for all x and so n s = 0 for some s < m, a contradiction to the
choice of m. it follows that r (  ) = 0 and so p (  ) cannot be the minimal polynomial unless
l (  ) = 1. hence p (  ) =   m as claimed. (cid:4)
for such a nilpotent transformation, let

be a basis for ker (n m) = v

where these   xi are cyclic. this basis exists thanks to theorem 10.3.4. thus

consider   x given by

where n rx is in the span of the above vectors. then by the above lemma, n rx = 0.

also the cyclic sets   x1 ,   x2 ,       ,   xq will be ordered according to length, the length of
  xi being at least as large as the length of   xi+1 . then since n rk xk = 0, it is now easy
to    nd m k. using the procedure mentioned above for determining the matrix of a linear

then with this de   nition and the above discussion, the following proposition has been

proved.

n m = 0

for some m     n. here w is a p dimensional vector space with    eld of scalars f. then there

. in fact, if

the rank of j k equals the rank of j

10.5 the jordan canonical form
the jordan canonical form has to do with the case where the minimal polynomial of a    
l (v, v ) splits. thus there exist   k in the    eld of scalars such that the minimal polynomial

of a is of the form

r   

(         k)mk

p (  ) =

k=1

recall the following which follows from theorem 9.4.4.

proposition 10.5.1 let the minimal polynomial of a     l (v, v ) be given by

linear transformations canonical forms

r   

(         k)mk

p (  ) =

k=1

then the eigenvalues of a are {  1,       ,   r}.

it follows from corollary 10.2.4 that

v = ker (a       1i)m1                ker (a       ri)mr

    v1                vr

where i denotes the identity linear transformation. without loss of generality, let the
dimensions of the vk be decreasing from left to right. these vk are called the generalized
eigenspaces.
it follows from the de   nition of vk that (a       ki) is nilpotent on vk and clearly each
vk is a invariant. therefore from proposition 10.4.4, and letting ak denote the restriction
of a to vk, there exists an ordered basis for vk,   k such that with respect to this basis, the
matrix of (ak       ki) is of the form given in that proposition, denoted here by j k. what is
the matrix of ak with respect to   k? letting {b1,       , br} =   k,

)

akbj = (ak       ki) bj +   kibj

and so the matrix of ak with respect to this basis is

j k +   ki

where i is the identity matrix. therefore, with respect to the ordered basis {  1,       ,   r

}

the matrix of a is in jordan canonical form. this means the matrix is of the form

which has rank 1 and

which has no rank. you see, discrepancies occur in the rank upon raising to higher powers
if the blocks are not the same. now with this preparation, here is the main theorem.
theorem 10.5.2 let v be an n dimensional vector space with    eld of scalars c or some
other    eld such that the minimal polynomial of a     l (v, v ) completely factors into powers
of linear factors. then there exists a unique jordan canonical form for a as described in
(10.5) - (10.7), where uniqueness is in the sense that any two have the same number and
size of jordan blocks.

proof: it only remains to verify uniqueness. suppose there are two, j and j

. then these
are matrices of a with respect to possibly di   erent bases and so they are similar. therefore,
they have the same minimal polynomials and the generalized eigenspaces have the same
dimension. thus the size of the matrices j (  k) and j
(  k) de   ned by the dimension of
these generalized eigenspaces, also corresponding to the algebraic multiplicity of   k, must
be the same. therefore, they comprise the same set of positive integers. thus listing the
eigenvalues in the same order, corresponding blocks j (  k) , j

(  k) are the same size.

   

   

it remains to show that j (  k) and j

(  k) are not just the same size but also are the
same up to order of the jordan blocks running down their respective diagonals. it is only
necessary to worry about the number and size of the jordan blocks making up j (  k) and
         ki. thus the following two matrices
j
are similar

are similar, so are j       ki and j

(  k) . since j, j

note that if any of the generalized eigenspaces ker (a       ki)mk has a basis of eigen-

vectors, then it would be possible to use this basis and obtain a diagonal matrix in the
block corresponding to   k. by uniqueness, this is the block corresponding to the eigenvalue

is just the diagonal matrix having   k down the diagonal and there are no generalized

equation for n is just   ms = 0. (you could also verify this directly.) now since d is just a
multiple of the identity, it follows that dn = n d. therefore, the usual binomial theorem

1. in the discussion of nilpotent transformations, it was asserted that if two n  n matrices
a, b are similar, then ak is also similar to bk. why is this so? if two matrices are
similar, why must they have the same rank?

that if this minimal polynomial is of the form

p (  ) =

  i (  )ri

where the   i (  ) are irreducible, then ker (  i (a)ri ) and ker (  i (b)ri ) have the same

q

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation10.7. the rational canonical form

267

be partly why it is called the rational canonical form. as you know, the rational numbers
are notorious for not having roots to polynomial equations which have integer or rational
coe   cients.

this canonical form is due to frobenius. i am following the presentation given in [9] and
there are more details given in this reference. another good source which has many of the
same ideas is [14].

here is a de   nition of the concept of a companion matrix.

de   nition 10.7.1 let

be a monic polynomial. the companion matrix of q (  ) , denoted as c (q (  )) is the matrix

q (  ) = a0 + a1   +        + an   1  n   1 +   n

proposition 10.7.2 let q (  ) be a polynomial and let c (q (  )) be its companion matrix.
then q (c (q (  ))) = 0.

proof: write c instead of c (q (  )) for short. note that

(10.11)

thus

and so it follows

ce1 = e2, ce2 = e3,       , cen   1 = en
ek = c k   1e1, k = 1,       , n
}
{
e1, ce1, c 2e1,       , c n   1e1

(10.12)
are linearly independent. hence these form a basis for fn. now note that cen is given by

cen =    a0e1     a1e2                an   1en

and from (10.11) this implies

c ne1 =    a0e1     a1ce1                an   1c n   1e1

and so

q (c) e1 = 0.

now since (10.12) is a basis, every vector of fn is of the form k (c) e1 for some polynomial
k (  ). therefore, if v     fn,

q (c) v = q (c) k (c) e1 = k (c) q (c) e1 = 0

which shows q (c) = 0. (cid:4)

the following theorem is on the existence of the rational canonical form.

theorem 10.8.4 let v be a vector space having    eld of scalars f and let a     l (v, v ).
then the rational canonical form of a is unique up to order of the blocks.

10.2.4

   
v = v1                vq

where vk = ker (  k (a)mk ) . also recall from corollary 10.2.5 that the minimal polynomial
of the restriction of a to vk is   k (  )mk . now apply lemma 10.8.3 to a restricted to vk. (cid:4)
in the case where two n    n matrices m, n are similar, recall this is equivalent to the
two being matrices of the same linear transformation taken with respect to two di   erent
bases. hence each are similar to the same rational canonical form.

obtain the cycle

because the next vector involving a2 yields a vector which is in the span of the above two.
you check this by making the vectors the columns of a matrix and    nding the row reduced

for the polynomial   2   8  +32 and the 1  1 block being a companion matrix for      4. note
that you could have written this without    nding a similarity transformation to produce it.
this follows from the above theory which gave the existence of the rational canonical form.
obviously there is a lot more which could be considered about rational canonical forms.
just begin with a strange    eld and start investigating what can be said. it is as far as i
feel like going on this subject at this time. one can also derive more systematic methods
for    nding the rational canonical form. the advantage of this is you don   t need to    nd the
eigenvalues in order to compute the rational canonical form and it can often be computed
for this reason, unlike the jordan form. the uniqueness of this rational canonical form can
be used to determine whether two matrices consisting of entries in some    eld are similar.

11.1 regular markov matrices

the existence of the jordan form is the basis for the proof of limit theorems for certain
kinds of matrices called markov matrices.

de   nition 11.1.1 an n    n matrix a = (aij) , is a markov matrix if aij     0 for all i, j

and

it may also be called a stochastic matrix. a matrix which has nonnegative entries such that

aij = 1

j

will also be called a stochastic matrix. a markov or stochastic matrix is called regular if
some power of a has all entries strictly positive. a vector, v     rn, is a steady state if
av = v.

lemma 11.1.2 the property of being a stochastic matrix is preserved by taking products.

proof: suppose the sum over a row equals 1 for a and b. then letting the entries be

denoted by (aij) and (bij) respectively,

a similar argument yields the same result in the case where it is the sum over a column

which is equal to 1. it is obvious that when the product is taken, if each aij, bij     0, then

the same will be true of sums of products of these numbers.

the following theorem is convenient for showing the existence of limits.

are there examples which will cause the eigenvalue condition of this theorem to hold?

the following lemma gives such a condition. it turns out that if aij > 0, not just     0, then

the eigenvalue condition of the above theorem is valid.

lemma 11.1.4 suppose a = (aij) is a stochastic matrix. then    = 1 is an eigenvalue. if
aij > 0 for all i, j, then if    is an eigenvalue of a, either |  | < 1 or    = 1. in addition to
this, if av = v for a nonzero vector, v     rn, then vjvi     0 for all i, j so the components of

then if v =

lemma 11.1.5 let a be any markov matrix and let v be a vector having all its components

the following theorem about limits is now easy to obtain.

theorem 11.1.6 suppose a is a markov matrix (the sum over a column equals 1) in
which aij > 0 for all i, j and suppose w is a vector. then for each i,

where av = v.

the vector, w satis   es wi     0 for all i and
conditions, vi     0,

in words, akw always converges to a steady state. in addition to this, if
i wi = c, then the vector v will also satisfy the

i vi = c.

proof: by lemma 11.1.4, since each aij > 0, the eigenvalues are either 1 or have absolute
value less than 1. therefore, the claimed limit exists by theorem 11.1.3. the assertion that
the components are nonnegative and sum to c follows from lemma 11.1.5. that av = v
follows from

v = lim

n       anw = lim

n       an+1w = a lim

n       anw = av. (cid:4)

it is not hard to generalize the conclusion of this theorem to regular markov processes.

corollary 11.1.7 suppose a is a regular markov matrix, on for which the entries of ak
are all positive for some k, and suppose w is a vector. then for each i,

n       (anw)i = vi
lim

   

where av = v.

the vector w satis   es wi     0 for all i and
conditions vi     0,

in words, anw always converges to a steady state. in addition to this, if
i wi = c, then the vector v will also satisfy the

i vi = c.

proof: let the entries of ak be all positive. now suppose that aij     0 for all i, j and
a = (aij) is a transition matrix. then if b = (bij) is a transition matrix with bij > 0 for
all ij, it follows that ba is a transition matrix which has strictly positive entries. the ijth
entry of ba is

   

bikakj > 0,

k

thus, from lemma 11.1.4, ak has an eigenvalue equal to 1 for all k su   ciently large, and
all the other eigenvalues have absolute value strictly less than 1. the same must be true of
a, for if    is an eigenvalue of a with |  | = 1, then   k is an eigenvalue for ak and so, for
all k large enough,   k = 1 which is absurd unless    = 1. by theorem 11.1.3, limn       anw
exists. the rest follows as in theorem 11.1.6. (cid:4)

11.2 migration matrices
de   nition 11.2.1 let n locations be denoted by the numbers 1, 2,        , n. also suppose it is
the case that each year aij denotes the proportion of residents in location j which move to
location i. also suppose no one escapes or emigrates from without these n locations. this last
assumption requires
i aij = 1. thus (aij) is a markov matrix referred to as a migration
matrix.

   

if v = (x1,       , xn)t where xi is the population of location i at a given instant, you obtain
j aijxj = (av)i . therefore, the
the population of location i one year later by computing
i . furthermore, corollary 11.1.7 can be used
population of location i after k years is
to predict in the case where a is regular what the long time population will be for the given
locations.

and so the markov matrix is regular. therefore,
of a steady state.

it follows the steady state can be obtained from solving the system

i will converge to the ith component

. 6x + . 1z = x
. 2x + . 8y = y

. 2x + . 2y + . 9z = z

along with the stipulation that the sum of x, y, and z must equal the constant value present
at the beginning of the process. the solution to this system is

{y = x, z = 4x, x = x} .

if the total population at the beginning is 150,000, then you solve the following system

y = x
z = 4x

x + y + z = 150000

whose solution is easily seen to be {x = 25 000, z = 100 000, y = 25 000} . thus, after a long
time there would be about four times as many people in the third location as in either of
the other two.

11.3 markov chains

a random variable is just a function which can have certain values which have probabilities
associated with them. thus it makes sense to consider the id203 that the random
variable has a certain value or is in some set. the idea of a markov chain is a sequence of

random variables, {xn} which can be in any of a collection of states which can be labeled
with nonnegative integers. thus you can speak of the id203 the random variable, xn

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation280

markov chains and migration processes

is in state i. the id203 that xn+1 is in state j given that xn is in state i is called
a one step transition id203. when this id203 does not depend on n it is called
stationary and this is the case of interest here. since this id203 does not depend on n
it can be denoted by pij. here is a simple example called a random walk.

example 11.3.1 let there be n points, xi, and consider a process of something moving
randomly from one point to another. suppose xn is a sequence of random variables which
has values {1, 2,       , n} where xn = i indicates the process has arrived at the ith point. let
pij be the id203 that xn+1 has the value j given that xn has the value i. since xn+1
must have some value, it must be the case that
j aij = 1. note this says that the sum over
a row equals 1 and so the situation is a little di   erent than the above in which the sum was
over a column.

   

as an example, let x1, x2, x3, x4 be four points taken in order on r and suppose x1
and x4 are absorbing. this means that p4k = 0 for all k   = 4 and p1k = 0 for all k   = 1.
otherwise, you can move either to the left or to the right with id203 1
2 . the markov

matrix associated with this situation is             1

             .

de   nition 11.3.2 let the stationary transition probabilities, pij be de   ned above. the
resulting matrix having pij as its ijth entry is called the matrix of transition probabilities.
the sequence of random variables for which these pij are the transition probabilities is called
a markov chain. the matrix of transition probabilities is called a stochastic matrix.

the next proposition is fundamental and shows the signi   cance of the powers of the

matrix of transition probabilities.

proposition 11.3.3 let pn
in state i. then pn

ij denote the id203 that xn is in state j given that x0 was

ij is the ijth entry of the matrix p n where p = (pij) .

proof: this is clearly true if n = 1 and follows from the de   nition of the pij. suppose
ikpkj
true for n. then the id203 that xn+1 is at j given that x0 was at i equals
because xn must have some value, k, and so this represents all possible ways to go from i
to j. you can go from i to 1 in n steps with id203 pi1 and then from 1 to j in one step
with id203 p1j and so the id203 of this is pn
i1p1j but you can also go from i to 2
and then from 2 to j and from i to 3 and then from 3 to j etc. thus the sum of these is
just what is given and represents the id203 of xn+1 having the value j given x0 has
the value i. (cid:4)

after many iterations of the process, if you start at 2 you will end up at 1 with id203
2/3 and at 4 with id203 1/3. this makes good intuitive sense because it is twice as far
from 2 to 4 as it is from 2 to 1.

proof: by gerschgorin   s theorem, if    is an eigenvalue, then |  |     1. now suppose v

suppose |  | = 1. then the top row shows p|v2| = |v1| so |v1| < |v2| . suppose |v1| < |v2| <
       < |vk| for some k < n. then

|  vk| = |vk|     q |vk   1| + p|vk+1| < q |vk| + p|vk+1|

and so subtracting q |vk| from both sides,

p|vk| < p|vk+1|

showing {|vk|}n
k=1 is an increasing sequence. now a contradiction results on the last line
which requires |vn   1| > |vn|. therefore, |  | < 1 for any eigenvalue of the above matrix. (cid:4)

it follows

and so from the above theorem,

example 11.3.6 in the gambler   s ruin problem a gambler plays a game with someone, say
a casino, until he either wins all the other   s money or loses all of his own. a simple version
of this is as follows. let xk denote the amount of money the gambler has. each time the
game is played he wins with id203 p     (0, 1) or loses with id203 (1     p)     q. in
case he wins, his money increases to xk + 1 and if he loses, his money decreases to xk     1.

the transition id203 matrix p, describing this situation is as follows.

p =

(11.2)

here the matrix is b + 1    b + 1 because the possible values of xk are all integers from 0 up
to b. the 1 in the upper left corner corresponds to the gambler   s ruin. it involves xk = 0
so he has no money left. once this state has been reached, it is not possible to ever leave
it. this is indicated by the row of zeros to the right of this entry the kth of which gives the
id203 of going from state 1 corresponding to no money to state k1.

in this case 1 is a repeated root of the characteristic equation of multiplicity 2 and all
the other eigenvalues have absolute value less than 1. to see that this is the case, note that
the characteristic polynomial is of the form

and the factor after (1       )2 has zeros which are in absolute value less than 1. its zeros are
the eigenvalues of the matrix

and by corollary 11.3.5 these all have absolute value less than 1.

therefore, by theorem 11.1.3 limn       p n exists. the case of limn       pn

j0 is particularly
interesting because it gives the id203 that, starting with an amount j, the gambler
eventually ends up at 0 and is ruined. from the matrix, it follows

(j   1)0 + ppn   1
b0 = 0.
to simplify the notation, de   ne pj     limn       pn

j0 = qpn   1
pn
pn
00 = 1, and pn

(j+1)0 for j     [1, b     1] ,

j0 as the id203 of ruin given the initial

fortune of the gambler equals j. then the above simpli   es to

pj = qpj   1 + ppj+1 for j     [1, b     1] ,
p0 = 1, and pb = 0.

(11.3)

now, knowing that pj exists, it is not too hard to    nd it from (11.3). this equation is
called a di   erence equation and there is a standard procedure for    nding solutions of these.
you try a solution of the form pj = xj and then try to    nd x such that things work out.
therefore, substitute this in to the    rst equation of (11.3) and obtain

xj = qxj   1 + pxj+1.

therefore,

)
   
and so in case p   = q, you can use the fact that p + q = 1 to obtain

thus as the game becomes more fair in the sense the probabilities of winning become closer
to 1/2, the id203 of ruin given an initial amount j is b   j

alternatively, you could consider the di   erence equation directly in the case where p =

q = 1/2. in this case, you can see that two solutions to the di   erence equation

(11.7)

this last case is pretty interesting because it shows, for example that if the gambler
starts with a fortune of 1 so that he starts at state j = 1, then his id203 of losing all
is b   1
b which might be quite large, especially if the other player has a lot of money to begin
with. as the gambler starts with more and more money, his id203 of losing everything
does decrease.

12.1 general theory
it is assumed here that the    eld of scalars is either r or c. the usual example of an inner
product space is cn or rn as described earlier. however, there are many other inner product
spaces and the topic is of such importance that it seems appropriate to discuss the general
theory of these spaces.

de   nition 12.1.1 a vector space x is said to be a normed linear space if there exists a
function, denoted by |  | : x     [0,   ) which satis   es the following axioms.

1. |x|     0 for all x     x, and |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0.
2. |ax| = |a||x| for all a     f.
3. |x + y|     |x| + |y| .
this function |  | is called a norm.
the notation ||x|| is also often used. not all norms are created equal. there are many
geometric properties which they may or may not possess. there is also a concept called an
inner product which is discussed next. it turns out that the best norms come from an inner
product.
de   nition 12.1.2 a mapping (  ,  ) : v    v     f is called an inner product if it satis   es
the following axioms.

1. (x, y) = (y, x).
2. (x, x)     0 for all x     v and equals zero if and only if x = 0.
3. (ax + by, z) = a (x, z) + b (y, z) whenever a, b     f.

note that 2 and 3 imply (x, ay + bz) = a(x, y) + b(x, z).
then a norm is given by

(x, x)1/2     |x| .

it remains to verify this really is a norm.

de   nition 12.1.3 a normed linear space in which the norm comes from an inner product
as just described is called an inner product space.

inner product spaces

example 12.1.4 let v = cn with the inner product given by

(x, y)     n   

xkyk.

k=1

this is an example of a complex inner product space already discussed.
example 12.1.5 let v = rn,

(x, y) = x    y     n   

xjyj.

j=1

this is an example of a real inner product space.

example 12.1.6 let v be any    nite dimensional vector space and let {v1,       , vn} be a

basis. decree that

(vi, vj)       ij    

1 if i = j
0 if i   = j

{
(x, y)     n   
n   

i=1

xiyi

n   

xivi, y =

yivi.

and de   ne the inner product by

where

x =

i=1

i=1

the above is well de   ned because {v1,       , vn} is a basis. thus the components xi

associated with any given x     v are uniquely determined.
this example shows there is no loss of generality when studying    nite dimensional vector
spaces with    eld of scalars r or c in assuming the vector space is actually an inner product
space. the following theorem was presented earlier with slightly di   erent notation.

theorem 12.1.7 (cauchy schwarz) in any inner product space

|(x, y)|     |x||y|.

where |x|     (x, x)1/2.

proof: let        c, |  | = 1, and   (x, y) = |(x, y)| = re(x, y  ). let

f (t) = (x + ty  , x + t  y).

then from the axioms of the inner product,

f (t) = |x|2 + 2t re(x,   y) + t2|y|2     0.

this yields

|x|2 + 2t|(x, y)| + t2|y|2     0.

if |y| = 0, then the inequality requires that |(x, y)| = 0 since otherwise, you could pick large
negative t and contradict the inequality. if |y| > 0, it follows from the quadratic formula
that

4|(x, y)|2     4|x|2|y|2     0. (cid:4)

earlier it was claimed that the inner product de   nes a norm. in this next proposition

this claim is proved.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation12.2. the gram schmidt process
proposition 12.1.8 for an inner product space, |x|     (x, x)1/2 does specify a norm.

289

proof: all the axioms are obvious except the triangle inequality. to verify this,

|x + y|2     (x + y, x + y)     |x|2 + |y|2 + 2 re (x, y)

    |x|2 + |y|2 + 2|(x, y)|
    |x|2 + |y|2 + 2|x||y| = (|x| + |y|)2. (cid:4)

the best norms of all are those which come from an inner product because of the following
identity which is known as the parallelogram identity.
proposition 12.1.9 if (v, (  ,  )) is an inner product space then for |x|     (x, x)1/2, the
following identity holds.

|x + y|2 + |x     y|2 = 2|x|2 + 2|y|2 .

it turns out that the validity of this identity is equivalent to the existence of an inner
product which determines the norm as described above. these sorts of considerations are
topics for more advanced courses on functional analysis.

de   nition 12.1.10 a basis for an inner product space, {u1,       , un} is an orthonormal

basis if

{

1 if k = j
0 if k   = j

.

note that if a list of vectors satis   es the above condition for being an orthonormal set,

then the list of vectors is automatically linearly independent. to see this, suppose

(uk, uj) =   kj    
n   

cjuj = 0

j=1

n   

n   

then taking the inner product of both sides with uk,

0 =

cj (uj, uk) =

cj  jk = ck.

j=1

12.2 the gram schmidt process

lemma 12.2.1 let x be a    nite dimensional inner product space of dimension n whose

basis is {x1,       , xn} . then there exists an orthonormal basis for x, {u1,       , un} which has
the property that for each k     n, span(x1,       , xk) = span (u1,       , uk) .

proof: let {x1,       , xn} be a basis for x. let u1     x1/|x1| . thus for k = 1, span (u1) =
span (x1) and {u1} is an orthonormal set. now suppose for some k < n, u1,        , uk have
been chosen such that (uj, ul) =   jl and span (x1,       , xk) = span (u1,       , uk). then de   ne

uk+1     xk+1       
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xk+1       

k
j=1 (xk+1, uj) uj
k
j=1 (xk+1, uj) uj

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(12.1)

where the denominator is not equal to zero because the xj form a basis and so

xk+1 /    span (x1,       , xk) = span (u1,       , uk)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation290

thus by induction,

inner product spaces

uk+1     span (u1,       , uk, xk+1) = span (x1,       , xk, xk+1) .

also, xk+1     span (u1,       , uk, uk+1) which is seen easily by solving (12.1) for xk+1 and it

span (x1,       , xk, xk+1) = span (u1,       , uk, uk+1) .

follows
if l     k,

(uk+1, ul) = c

(xk+1, uj) (uj, ul)

      (xk+1, ul)     k   
      (xk+1, ul)     k   

j=1

      

      

= c

(xk+1, uj)   lj
= c ((xk+1, ul)     (xk+1, ul)) = 0.

j=1

the vectors, {uj}n
each vector has unit length. (cid:4)

j=1 , generated in this way are therefore an orthonormal basis because

the process by which these vectors were generated is called the gram schmidt process.
the following corollary is obtained from the above process.

corollary 12.2.2 let x be a    nite dimensional inner product space of dimension n whose

basis is {u1,       , uk, xk+1,       , xn} . then if {u1,       , uk} is orthonormal, then the gram
schmidt process applied to the given list of vectors in order leaves {u1,       , uk} unchanged.
lemma 12.2.3 suppose {uj}n
j=1 is an orthonormal basis for an inner product space x.
then for all x     x,

n   

x =

(x, uj) uj.

j=1

proof: by assumption that this is an orthonormal basis,

   

letting y =

n
k=1 (x, uk) uk, it follows

(uj, ul) = (x, ul) .

  jl

j=1

(x, uj)

n

(x     y, uj) = (x, uj)     n

n   

k=1

cjuj

= (x, uj)     (x, uj) = 0

(x, uk) (uk, uj)

for all j. hence, for any choice of scalars c1,        , cn,

j=1

and so (x     y, z) = 0 for all z     x. thus this holds in particular for z = x     y. therefore, x
= y. (cid:4)

the following theorem is of fundamental importance. first note that a subspace of an
inner product space is also an inner product space because you can use the same inner
product.

(12.4)

12.2. the gram schmidt process

291

theorem 12.2.4 let m be a subspace of x, a    nite dimensional inner product space and

i=1 be an orthonormal basis for m . then if y     x and w     m,

let {xi}m

{

}

|y     w|2 = inf

|y     z|2 : z     m

if and only if

for all z     m. furthermore,

(y     w, z) = 0
m   

w =

(y, xi) xi

i=1

is the unique element of m which has this property. it is called the orthogonal projection.

proof: let t     r. then from the properties of the inner product,

|y     (w + t (z     w))|2 = |y     w|2 + 2t re (y     w, w     z) + t2 |z     w|2 .

(12.5)
if (y     w, z) = 0 for all z     m, then letting t = 1, the middle term in the above expression
vanishes and so |y     z|2 is minimized when z = w.

conversely, if (12.2) holds, then the middle term of (12.5) must also vanish since other-

wise, you could choose small real t such that

|y     w|2 > |y     (w + t (z     w))|2 .

here is why. if re (y     w, w     z) < 0, then let t be very small and positive. the middle
term in (12.5) will then be more negative than the last term is positive and the right side
of this formula will then be less than |y     w|2. if re (y     w, w     z) > 0 then choose t small
and negative to achieve the same result.

it follows, letting z1 = w     z that

re (y     w, z1) = 0

for all z1     m. now letting        c be such that    (y     w, z1) = |(y     w, z1)| ,

|(y     w, z1)| = (y     w,   z1) = re (y     w,   z1) = 0,

which proves the    rst part of the theorem since z1 is arbitrary.

it only remains to verify that w given in (12.4) satis   es (12.3) and is the only point of
m which does so. to do this, note that if ci, di are scalars, then the properties of the inner
product and the fact the {xi} are orthonormal implies

this shows w given in (12.4) does minimize the function, z     |y     z|2 for z     m. it only
remains to verify uniqueness. suppose than that wi, i = 1, 2 minimizes this function of z
for z     m. then from what was shown above,

|y     w1|2 = |y     w2 + w2     w1|2

= |y     w2|2 + 2 re (y     w2, w2     w1) + |w2     w1|2
= |y     w2|2 + |w2     w1|2     |y     w2|2 ,

the last equal sign holding because w2 is a minimizer and the last inequality holding because
w1 minimizes. (cid:4)

12.3 riesz representation theorem

the next theorem is one of the most important results in the theory of inner product spaces.
it is called the riesz representation theorem.

then there exists a unique z     x such that for all x     x,

proof: first i will verify uniqueness. suppose zj works for j = 1, 2. then for all x     x,

0 = f (x)     f (x) = (x, z1     z2)

f (x) = (x, z) .

and so z1 = z2.

it remains to verify existence. by lemma 12.2.1, there exists an orthonormal basis,

then by the riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique element of x, a
that

(y) such

the next theorem is interesting. you have a p dimensional subspace of fn where f = r
or c. of course this might be    slanted   . however, there is a linear transformation q which
preserves distances which maps this subspace to fp.

12.4 the tensor product of two vectors
de   nition 12.4.1 let x and y be inner product spaces and let x     x and y     y. de   ne
the tensor product of these two vectors, y     x, an element of l (x, y ) by

y     x (u)     y (u, x)x .

this is also called a rank one transformation because the image of this transformation is
contained in the span of the vector, y.

the veri   cation that this is a linear map is left to you. be sure to verify this! the

following lemma has some of the most important properties of this linear transformation.

lemma 12.4.2 let x, y, z be inner product spaces. then for    a scalar,

(   (y     x))

   

=   x     y

(z     y1) (y2     x) = (y2, y1) z     x

(12.8)

(12.9)

proof: let u     x and v     y. then

(   (y     x) u, v) = (   (u, x) y, v) =    (u, x) (y, v)

and

(u,   x     y (v)) = (u,    (v, y) x) =    (y, v) (u, x) .

therefore, this veri   es (12.8).
to verify (12.9), let u     x.

(z     y1) (y2     x) (u) = (u, x) (z     y1) (y2) = (u, x) (y2, y1) z

and

(y2, y1) z     x (u) = (y2, y1) (u, x) z.

since the two linear transformations on both sides of (12.9) give the same answer for every
u     x, it follows the two transformations are the same. (cid:4)
de   nition 12.4.3 let x, y be two vector spaces. then de   ne for a, b     l (x, y ) and
       f, new elements of l (x, y ) denoted by a + b and   a as follows.

(a + b) (x)     ax + bx, (  a) x        (ax) .

theorem 12.4.4 let x and y be    nite dimensional inner product spaces. then l (x, y )
is a vector space with the above de   nition of what it means to multiply by a scalar and add.
let {v1,       , vn} be an orthonormal basis for x and {w1,       , wm} be an orthonormal basis
for y. then a basis for l (x, y ) is

proof: it is obvious that l (x, y ) is a vector space. it remains to verify the given set

is a basis. consider the following:

{wj     vi : i = 1,       , n, j = 1,       , m} .
   

       vp, wr

(avk, wl) wl     vk

       = (avp, wr)   

            a    

k,l

k,l

(avk, wl) (vp, vk) (wl, wr)

k,l

= (avp, wr)    

(avk, wl)   pk  rl

= (avp, wr)     (avp, wr) = 0.

letting a       

k,l (avk, wl) wl     vk = b, this shows that bvp = 0 since wr is an arbitrary
element of the basis for y. since vp is an arbitrary element of the basis for x, it follows
b = 0 as hoped. this has shown {wj     vi : i = 1,       , n, j = 1,       , m} spans l (x, y ) .

it only remains to verify the wj     vi are linearly independent. suppose then that

   

i,j

cijwj     vi = 0

   

i,j

   

j

   

i,j

0 =

cijwj (vs, vi) =

cijwj  si =

csjwj

then do both sides to vs. by de   nition this gives

now the vectors {w1,       , wm} are independent because it is an orthonormal set and so the
above requires csj = 0 for each j. since s was arbitrary, this shows the linear transformations,
{wj     vi} form a linearly independent set. (cid:4)
note this shows the dimension of l (x, y ) = nm. the theorem is also of enormous
importance because it shows you can always consider an arbitrary linear transformation as
a sum of rank one transformations whose properties are easily understood. the following
theorem is also of great interest.

   
i,j cijwi     vj     l (x, y ) where as before, the vectors, {wi} are
an orthonormal basis for y and the vectors, {vj} are an orthonormal basis for x. then if
the matrix of a has entries mij, it follows that mij = cij.

12.5 least squares

well as possible a collection of points in the plane {(xi, yi)}p

a common problem in experimental work is to    nd a straight line which approximates as
i=1. the usual way of dealing
with these problems is by the method of least squares and it turns out that all these sorts
of approximation problems can be reduced to ax = b where the problem is to    nd the best
x for solving this equation even when there is no solution.

297
lemma 12.5.1 let v and w be    nite dimensional inner product spaces and let a : v     w
be linear. for each y     w there exists x     v such that
|ax     y|     |ax1     y|

for all x1     v. also, x     v is a solution to this minimization problem if and only if x is a

   
solution to the equation, a

   
ax = a

y.

proof: by theorem 12.2.4 on page 291 there exists a point, ax0, in the    nite dimen-
sional subspace, a (v ) , of w such that for all x     v,|ax     y|2     |ax0     y|2 . also, from
this theorem, this happens if and only if ax0     y is perpendicular to every ax     a (v ) .
therefore, the solution is characterized by (ax0     y, ax) = 0 for all x     v which is the
y, x) = 0 for all x     v. in other words the solution is obtained

ax0     a

inner product spaces

12.6 fredholm alternative again

the best context in which to study the fredholm alternative is in inner product spaces.
this is done here.

de   nition 12.6.1 let s be a subset of an inner product space, x. de   ne

        {x     x : (x, s) = 0 for all s     s} .

the following theorem also follows from the above lemma. it is sometimes called the

fredholm alternative.
theorem 12.6.2 let a : v     w where a is linear and v and w are inner product spaces.
then a (v ) = ker (a

proof: let y = ax so y     a (v ) . then if a

not be immediately clear, take the least squares solution to the problem. thus let x be a
   
solution to a
) which implies
from the assumption about y that (y     ax, y) = 0. also, since ax is the closest point to
z
y in a (v ) , theorem 12.2.4 on page 291 implies that (y     ax, ax1) = 0 for all x1     v.
in particular this is true for x1 = x and so 0 = (y     ax, y)    
(y     ax, ax) = |y     ax|2 ,
showing that y = ax. thus a (v )     ker (a
   

(y     ax) = 0 and so y     ax     ker (a

corollary 12.6.3 let a, v, and w be as described above. if the only solution to a
is y = 0, then a is onto w.

y = 0

proof: if the only solution to a

   
from w is contained in ker (a

y = 0 is y = 0, then ker (a

de   nition 12.8.1 let u1,       , up be vectors in rm , m     p. the parallelepiped determined
by these vectors will be denoted by p (u1,       , up) and it is de   ned as

          p   

j=1

          .

p (u1,       , up)    

sjuj : sj     [0, 1]

the volume of this parallelepiped is de   ned as

volume of p (u1,       , up)     v (p (u1,       , up))     (det (ui    uj))1/2 .

if the vectors are dependent, this de   nition will give the volume to be 0.

   

first lets observe the last assertion is true. say ui =

j  =i   juj. then the ith row is
a linear combination of the other rows and so from the properties of the determinant, the
determinant of this matrix is indeed zero as it should be.

a parallelepiped is a sort of a squashed box. here is a picture which shows the relation-

ship between p (u1,       , up   1) and p (u1,       , up).

p (u1,       , up   1)

-

in a sense, we can de   ne the volume any way we want but if it is to be reasonable, the

following relationship must hold. the appropriate de   nition of the volume of p (u1,       , up)
in terms of p (u1,       , up   1) is

v (p (u1,       , up)) = |up||cos (  )| v (p (u1,       , up   1))

(12.11)

in the case where p = 1, the parallelepiped p (v) consists of the single vector and the one
dimensional volume should be |v| =
. now having made this de   nition, i will show
that this is the appropriate de   nition of p dimensional volume for every p.

as just pointed out, this is the only reasonable de   nition of volume in the case of one
vector. the next theorem shows that it is the only reasonable de   nition of volume of a
parallelepiped in the case of p vectors because (12.11) holds.

theorem 12.8.3 with the above de   nition of volume, (12.11) holds.

proof: to check whether this is so, it is necessary to    nd |cos (  )| . this involves    nding
the vector perpendicular to p (u1,       , up   1) . let {w1,       , wp} be an orthonormal basis
for span (u1,       , up) such that span (w1,       , wk) = span (u1,       , uk) for each k     p. such
{wk} is an orthonormal basis for span (u1,       , up) ,

an orthonormal basis exists because of the gram schmidt procedure. first note that since

uj =

(uj    wk) wk

and if i, j     k

therefore, for each k     p

which results from formally expanding along the top row. note that from what was just
discussed,

now it follows from the formula for expansion of a determinant along the top row that for
each j     p     1

v (p (u1,       , up   1)) =   a1p
p   
p   
                (uj    w1)

(uj    wk) a1k
where a1k is the 1kth cofactor of the above matrix. thus if j     p     1

(uj    wk) (n    wk) =

(up   1    w2)

      

(up   1    wp)

                = 0

because the matrix has two equal rows while if j = p, the above discussion shows n    up
equals   v (p (u1,       , up)). therefore, n points in the direction of the normal vector in the

above picture or else it points in the opposite direction to this vector. from the geometric
description of the dot product,

|cos (  )| =

|n    up|
|up||n|

and it follows

|up||cos (  )| v (p (u1,       , up   1)) = |up| |n    up|

|up||n| v (p (u1,       , up   1))

v (p (u1,       , up))

=

|n|

v (p (u1,       , up   1))

now at this point, note that from the construction, wp    uk = 0 whenever k     p    1 because
uk     span (w1,       , wp   1). therefore, |n| = |a1p| = v (p (u1,       , up   1)) and so the above

reduces to

|up||cos (  )| v (p (u1,       , up   1)) = v (p (u1,       , up)) . (cid:4)

the theorem shows that the only reasonable de   nition of p dimensional volume of a

parallelepiped is the one given in the above de   nition.

13.1 simultaneous diagonalization

recall the following de   nition of what it means for a matrix to be diagonalizable.
de   nition 13.1.1 let a be an n    n matrix. it is said to be diagonalizable if there exists
an invertible matrix s such that

where d is a diagonal matrix.

also, here is a useful observation.

s

   1as = d

observation 13.1.2 if a is an n   n matrix and as = sd for d a diagonal matrix, then
each column of s is an eigenvector or else it is the zero vector. this follows from observing
that for sk the kth column of s and from the way we multiply matrices,

it is sometimes interesting to consider the problem of    nding a single similarity trans-

ask =   ksk

formation which will diagonalize all the matrices in some set.
lemma 13.1.3 let a be an n   n matrix and let b be an m   m matrix. denote by c the
matrix

(

)

c    

a 0
0 b

.

then c is diagonalizable if and only if both a and b are diagonalizable.

proof: suppose s

   1
a asa = da and s

matrices. you should use block multiplication to verify that s    
   1cs = dc, a diagonal matrix.
s
conversely, suppose c is diagonalized by s = (s1,       , sn+m) . thus s has columns si.

where s11 is an n    n matrix and s22 is an m    m matrix. then there is a diagonal matrix

such that

hence by block multiplication

as11 = s11d1, bs22 = s22d2

bs21 = s21d1, as12 = s12d2

it follows each of the xi is an eigenvector of a or else is the zero vector and that each of the
yi is an eigenvector of b or is the zero vector. if there are n linearly independent xi, then
a is diagonalizable by theorem 9.3.12 on page 9.3.12.
the row rank of the matrix (x1,       , xn+m) must be n because if this is not so, the rank
   1 does not exist. therefore, since the
of s would be less than n + m which would mean s
column rank equals the row rank, this matrix has column rank equal to n and this means
there are n linearly independent eigenvectors of a implying that a is diagonalizable. similar
reasoning applies to b. (cid:4)

the following corollary follows from the same type of argument as the above.

corollary 13.1.4 let ak be an nk    nk matrix and let c denote the block diagonal

matrix given below.

then c is diagonalizable if and only if each ak is diagonalizable.
de   nition 13.1.5 a set, f of n   n matrices is said to be simultaneously diagonalizable if
and only if there exists a single invertible matrix s such that for every a     f , s
   1as = da
where da is a diagonal matrix.
lemma 13.1.6 if f is a set of n   n matrices which is simultaneously diagonalizable, then
f is a commuting family of matrices.

proof: let a, b     f and let s be a matrix which has the property that s

diagonal matrix for all a     f. then s
   1as = da and s
are diagonal matrices. since diagonal matrices commute,

   1as is a

therefore, if i   = j, bij = 0. (cid:4)
lemma 13.1.8 let f denote a commuting family of n    n matrices such that each a     f
is diagonalizable. then f is simultaneously diagonalizable.

proof: first note that if every matrix in f has only one eigenvalue, there is nothing to

prove. this is because for a such a matrix,

   1as =   i

s

and so

a =   i

thus all the matrices in f are diagonal matrices and you could pick any s to diagonalize
them all. therefore, without loss of generality, assume some matrix in f has more than one
eigenvalue.
the signi   cant part of the lemma is proved by induction on n. if n = 1, there is nothing
to prove because all the 1    1 matrices are already diagonal matrices. suppose then that
the theorem is true for all k     n     1 where n     2 and let f be a commuting family of
diagonalizable n    n matrices. pick a     f which has more than one eigenvalue and let
   1as = d where d is of the form given in (13.1).
s be an invertible matrix such that s
by permuting the columns of s there is no loss of generality in assuming d has this form.

now denote by ef the collection of matrices,

with d described above as s

   1as and so by block multiplication, the diagonal blocks bi

it follows easily that ef is also a commuting family of diagonalizable matrices. by
lemma 13.1.7 every b     ef is of the form given in (13.2) because each of these commutes
corresponding to di   erent b     ef commute.
                  

by corollary 13.1.4 each of these blocks is diagonalizable. this is because b is known to
be so. therefore, by induction, since all the blocks are no larger than n    1   n    1 thanks to
the assumption that a has more than one eigenvalue, there exist invertible ni    ni matrices,

l =

ij

where {v1,       , vn} is an orthonormal basis. of course di   erent bases will yield di   erent
matrices, (lij) . schur   s theorem gives the existence of a basis in an inner product space such
that (lij) is particularly simple.
de   nition 13.2.1 let l     l (v, v ) where v is vector space. then a subspace u of v is l
invariant if l (u )     u.

in what follows, f will be the    eld of scalars, usually c but maybe something else.

theorem 13.2.2 let l     l (h, h) for h a    nite dimensional inner product space such

311
proof: if dim (h) = 1, let h = span (w) where |w| = 1. then lw = kw for some k.

then
because by de   nition, w     w (w) = w. therefore, the theorem holds if h is 1 dimensional.
now suppose the theorem holds for n     1 = dim (h) . let wn be an eigenvector for l
   
.
dividing by its length, it can be assumed |wn| = 1. say l
   
wn =   wn. using the gram
schmidt process, there exists an orthonormal basis for h of the form {v1,       , vn   1, wn} .

l = kw     w

then

   
(lvk, wn) = (vk, l

wn) = (vk,   wn) = 0,

which shows

l : h1     span (v1,       , vn   1)     span (v1,       , vn   1) .
denote by l1 the restriction of l to h1. since h1 has dimension n     1, the induction
hypothesis yields an orthonormal basis, {w1,       , wn   1} for h1 such that

l1 =

cijwi   wj.

(13.3)

then {w1,       , wn} is an orthonormal basis for h because every vector in

span (v1,       , vn   1)

has the property that its inner product with wn is 0 so in particular, this is true for the
vectors {w1,       , wn   1}. now de   ne cin to be the scalars satisfying

it remains to verify the constants, ckk are the eigenvalues of l, solutions of the equation,

13.3 spectral theory of self adjoint operators

the following theorem is about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a self adjoint operator.
such operators are also called hermitian as in the case of matrices. the proof given gen-
eralizes to the situation of a compact self adjoint operator on a hilbert space and leads to
many very useful results.
it is also a very elementary proof because it does not use the
fundamental theorem of algebra and it contains a way, very important in applications, of
   nding the eigenvalues. this proof depends more directly on the methods of analysis than
the preceding material. the    eld of scalars will be r or c. the following is useful notation.
de   nition 13.3.1 let x be an inner product space and let s     x. then

        {x     x : (x, s) = 0 for all s     s} .

note that even if s is not a subspace, s

   

is.

de   nition 13.3.2 a hilbert space is a complete inner product space. recall this means

that every cauchy sequence,{xn} , one which satis   es

n,m      |xn     xm| = 0,

lim

converges. it can be shown, although i will not do so here, that for the    eld of scalars either
r or c, any    nite dimensional inner product space is automatically complete.
theorem 13.3.3 let a     l (x, x) be self adjoint (hermitian) where x is a    nite dimen-
   
. then there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors,
sional hilbert space. thus a = a
{uj}n

j=1 .

proof: consider (ax, x) . this quantity is always a real number because

(ax, x) = (x, ax) = (x, a

   

x) = (ax, x)

thanks to the assumption that a is self adjoint. now de   ne

  1     inf {(ax, x) : |x| = 1, x     x1     x} .

claim:   1 is    nite and there exists v1     x with |v1| = 1 such that (av1, v1) =   1.

proof of claim: let {uj}n

j=1 be an orthonormal basis for x and for x     x, let (x1,        ,

xn) be de   ned as the components of the vector x. thus,

n   

x =

xjuj.

j=1

since this is an orthonormal basis, it follows from the axioms of the inner product that

n   
|x|2 =
   

j=1

   

k,j

|xj|2 .

       =
n   

j=1

thus

       n   

(ax, x) =

a real valued continuous function of (x1,        , xn) which is de   ned on the compact set

xjuj

xkxj (auk, uj) ,

k=1

j=1

k     {(x1,       , xn)     fn :

|xj|2 = 1}.

therefore, it achieves its minimum from the extreme value theorem. then de   ne

v1     n   

xjuj

where (x1,       , xn) is the point of k at which the above function achieves its minimum.

j=1

this proves the claim.

continuing with the proof of the theorem, let x2     {v1}   
  2     inf {(ax, x) : |x| = 1, x     x2}

x. let

. this is a closed subspace of

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation314

self adjoint operators

as before, there exists v2     x2 such that (av2, v2) =   2,   1       2. now let x3     {v1, v2}   
and continue in this way. this leads to an increasing sequence of real numbers, {  k}n
k=1 and
an orthonormal set of vectors, {v1,        , vn}. it only remains to show these are eigenvectors
and that the   j are eigenvalues.
consider the    rst of these vectors. letting w     x1     x, the function of the real variable,

t, given by

f (t)     (a (v1 + tw) , v1 + tw)

|v1 + tw|2

=

(av1, v1) + 2t re (av1, w) + t2 (aw, w)

|v1|2 + 2t re (v1, w) + t2 |w|2

achieves its minimum when t = 0. therefore, the derivative of this function evaluated at

t = 0 must equal zero. using the quotient rule, this implies, since |v1| = 1 that

2 re (av1, w)|v1|2     2 re (v1, w) (av1, v1)
= 2 (re (av1, w)     re (v1, w)   1) = 0.

thus re (av1       1v1, w) = 0 for all w     x. this implies av1 =   1v1. to see this, let w     x
be arbitrary and let    be a complex number with |  | = 1 and

then

|(av1       1v1, w)| =    (av1       1v1, w) .
)

(
av1       1v1,   w

|(av1       1v1, w)| = re

= 0.

since this holds for all w, av1 =   1v1.

now suppose avk =   kvk for all k < m. observe that a : xm     xm because if y     xm

and k < m,

(ay, vk) = (y, avk) = (y,   kvk) = 0,

showing that ay     {v1,       , vm   1}        xm. thus the same argument just given shows that
for all w     xm,
since avm     xm, i can let w = avm       mvm in the above and thereby conclude avm =
  mvm. (cid:4)

(avm       mvm, w) = 0.

(13.5)

contained in the proof of this theorem is the following important corollary.

corollary 13.3.4 let a     l (x, x) be self adjoint where x is a    nite dimensional hilbert
space. then all the eigenvalues are real and for   1       2                  n the eigenvalues of a,
there exists an orthonormal set of vectors {u1,       , un} for which

corollary 13.3.5 let a     l (x, x) be self adjoint (hermitian) where x is a    nite dimen-

and the minimum eigenvalue of a is given by

min{(ax, x) : |x| = 1} .

the reason this is so is that the in   mum is taken over a smaller set. therefore, the in   mum

317

13.4 positive and negative linear transformations

the notion of a positive de   nite or negative de   nite linear transformation is very important
in many applications. in particular it is used in versions of the second derivative test for
functions of many variables. here the main interest is the case of a linear transformation
which is an n  n matrix but the theorem is stated and proved using a more general notation
because all these issues discussed here have interesting generalizations to functional analysis.
lemma 13.4.1 let x be a    nite dimensional hilbert space and let a     l (x, x) . then
if {v1,       , vn} is an orthonormal basis for x and m (a) denotes the matrix of the linear

   

) = (m (a))

. in particular, a is self adjoint, if and only if

   
transformation a then m (a
m (a) is.

proof: consider the following picture

a

q    
    q
fn     fn

where q is the coordinate map which satis   es q (x)       

is orthonormal, it is clear that |x| = |q (x)| . therefore,

m (a)

i xivi. therefore, since {v1,       , vn}

|x|2 + |y|2 + 2 re (x, y) = |x + y|2 = |q (x + y)|2

= |q (x)|2 + |q (y)|2 + 2 re (q (x) , q (y))

(13.13)

now in any inner product space,

(x, iy) = re (x, iy) + i im (x, iy) .

also

(x, iy) = (   i) (x, y) = (   i) re (x, y) + im (x, y) .

therefore, equating the real parts, im (x, y) = re (x, iy) and so

(x, y) = re (x, y) + i re (x, iy)

(13.14)

now from (13.13), since q preserves distances, . re (q (x) , q (y)) = re (x, y) which implies
from (13.14) that

(x, y) = (q (x) , q (y)) .

(13.15)

now consulting the diagram which gives the meaning for the matrix of a linear transforma-
tion, observe that q     m (a) = a     q and q     m (a

) = a

   

(a (q (x)) , q (y)) = (q (x) , a

   

but also

   
q (y)) = (q (x) , q (m (a

(a (q (x)) , q (y)) = (q (m (a) (x)) , q (y)) = (m (a) (x) , y) =

since x, y are arbitrary, this shows that m (a

then m (a) = m (a

and so m (a) is also self adjoint. if m (a) = m (a)

de   nition 13.4.3 a self adjoint a     l (x, x) , is positive de   nite if whenever x   = 0,
(ax, x) > 0 and a is negative de   nite if for all x   = 0, (ax, x) < 0. a is positive semidef-
inite or just nonnegative for short if for all x, (ax, x)     0. a is negative semide   nite or
nonpositive for short if for all x, (ax, x)     0.

the following lemma is of fundamental importance in determining which linear trans-

formations are positive or negative de   nite.
lemma 13.4.4 let x be a    nite dimensional hilbert space. a self adjoint a     l (x, x)
is positive de   nite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive and negative de   nite if and
only if all its eigenvalues are negative. it is positive semide   nite if all the eigenvalues are
nonnegative and it is negative semide   nite if all the eigenvalues are nonpositive.

proof: suppose    rst that a is positive de   nite and let    be an eigenvalue. then for x
an eigenvector corresponding to   ,    (x, x) = (  x, x) = (ax, x) > 0. therefore,    > 0 as
claimed.

now suppose all the eigenvalues of a are positive. from theorem 13.3.3 and corollary

because, since {ui} is an orthonormal basis, |x|2 =
to establish the claim about negative de   nite, it su   ces to note that a is negative
de   nite if and only if    a is positive de   nite and the eigenvalues of a are (   1) times the
eigenvalues of    a. the claims about positive semide   nite and negative semide   nite are
obtained similarly. (cid:4)
the next theorem is about a way to recognize whether a self adjoint a     l (x, x) is
positive or negative de   nite without having to    nd the eigenvalues. in order to state this
theorem, here is some notation.

deleting the k + 1,       , n columns and the k + 1,       , n rows from a. thus an = a and ak
is the k    k submatrix of a which occupies the upper left corner of a. the determinants of
these submatrices are called the principle minors.

the following theorem is proved in [8]

theorem 13.4.6 let x be a    nite dimensional hilbert space and let a     l (x, x) be self

319

proof: this theorem is proved by induction on n. it is clearly true if n = 1. suppose then
that it is true for n   1 where n     2. since det (m (a)) > 0, it follows that all the eigenvalues
are nonzero. are they all positive? suppose not. then there is some even number of them
which are negative, even because the product of all the eigenvalues is known to be positive,

equaling det (m (a)). pick two,   1 and   2 and let m (a) ui =   iui where ui   = 0 for i = 1, 2
and (u1, u2) = 0. now if y       1u1 +   2u2 is an element of span (u1, u2) , then since these
are eigenvalues and (u1, u2) = 0, a short computation shows

now letting x     cn   1, the induction hypothesis implies

(m (a) (  1u1 +   2u2) ,   1u1 +   2u2)
= |  1|2   1 |u1|2 + |  2|2   2 |u2|2 < 0.

m (a)n   1 x = (m (a) x, x) > 0.

now the dimension of {z     cn : zn = 0} is n    1 and the dimension of span (u1, u2) = 2 and
so there must be some nonzero x     cn which is in both of these subspaces of cn. however,
the    rst computation would require that (m (a) x, x) < 0 while the second would require
that (m (a) x, x) > 0. this contradiction shows that all the eigenvalues must be positive.
this proves the if part of the theorem. the only if part is left to the reader.
corollary 13.4.7 let x be a    nite dimensional hilbert space and let a     l (x, x) be
self adjoint. then a is negative de   nite if and only if det (m (a)k) (   1)k > 0 for every
k = 1,       , n. here m (a) denotes the matrix of a with respect to some    xed orthonormal
basis of x.

proof: this is immediate from the above theorem by noting that, as in the proof of
lemma 13.4.4, a is negative de   nite if and only if    a is positive de   nite. therefore, if
det (   m (a)k) > 0 for all k = 1,       , n, it follows that a is negative de   nite. however,
det (   m (a)k) = (   1)k det (m (a)k) . (cid:4)

13.5 fractional powers
with the above theory, it is possible to take fractional powers of certain elements of l (x, x)
where x is a    nite dimensional hilbert space. to begin with, consider the square root of a
nonnegative self adjoint operator. this is easier than the general theory and it is the square
root which is of most importance.
theorem 13.5.1 let a     l (x, x) be self adjoint and nonnegative. then there exists a
unique self adjoint nonnegative b     l (x, x) such that b2 = a and b commutes with every
element of l (x, x) which commutes with a.

suppose b1 is another square root which is self adjoint, nonnegative and commutes with

every matrix which commutes with a. since both b, b1 are nonnegative,

now, adding these together, and using the fact that the two commute,

(13.16)

it follows that both inner products in (13.16) equal 0. next use the existence part of this
to take the square root of b and b1 which is denoted by

   
b1 respectively. then

(b (b     b1) x, (b     b1) x)     0,

and so, since x is arbitrary, b1 = b. (cid:4)

the main result is the following theorem.

therefore, {b, c} is a commuting family of linear transformations which are both self

with respect to some    xed orthonormal basis, {v1,       , vn}, it follows that m (b) and m (c)

13.6 polar decompositions

an application of theorem 13.3.3, is the following fundamental result, important in geo-
metric measure theory and continuum mechanics.
it is sometimes called the right polar
decomposition. the notation used is that which is seen in continuum mechanics, see for
example gurtin [11]. don   t confuse the u in this theorem with a unitary transformation.
it is not so. when the following theorem is applied in continuum mechanics, f is normally
the deformation gradient, the derivative of a nonlinear map from some subset of three di-
mensional space to three dimensional space. in this context, u is called the right cauchy
green strain tensor. it is a measure of how a body is stretched independent of rigid motions.
first, here is a simple lemma.
lemma 13.6.1 suppose r     l (x, y ) where x, y are hilbert spaces and r preserves dis-
tances. then r

r = i.

   

proof: since r preserves distances, |rx| = |x| for every x. therefore from the axioms

of the inner product,

|x|2 + |y|2 + (x, y) + (y, x) = |x + y|2 = (r (x + y) , r (x + y))

= (rx,rx) + (ry,ry) + (rx, ry) + (ry, rx)

= |x|2 + |y|2 + (r

   

rx, y) + (y, r

   

rx)

and so for all x, y,

   

rx     x, y) + (y,r

   

rx     x) = 0

(r

hence for all x, y,

   
now for x, y given, choose        c such that

re (r

rx     x, y) = 0

   

rx     x, y) = |(r

   

rx     x, y)|

   (r

then

0 = re (r

= |(r

   

   
rx     x, y)|

rx     x,  y) = re    (r

   

rx     x, y)

thus |(r
   
r

rx     x to conclude that for all x,

   

rx     x, y)| = 0 for all x, y because the given x, y were arbitrary. let y =

   

rx     x = 0

r

which says r

   

r = i since x is arbitrary. (cid:4)

the decomposition in the following is called the right polar decomposition.

theorem 13.6.2 let x be a hilbert space of dimension n and let y be a hilbert space of
dimension m     n and let f     l (x, y ). then there exists r     l (x, y ) and u     l (x, x)
such that

   

, (u is hermitian),

all eigenvalues of u are non negative,

f = ru, u = u

and |rx| = |x| .

u 2 = f

it is also clear that   i     0 because

then u 2 = f

f, u = u

, and the eigenvalues of u,

are all non negative.

let {u x1,       , u xr} be an orthonormal basis for u (x) . by the gram schmidt procedure

i=1

there exists an extension to an orthonormal basis for x,

next note that {f x1,       , f xr} is also an orthonormal set of vectors in y because

(f xk, f xj) = (f

   

f xk, xj) =

u 2xk, xj

= (u xk, u xj) =   jk.

{u x1,       , u xr, yr+1,       , yn} .

(

)

by the gram schmidt procedure, there exists an extension of {f x1,       , f xr} to an or-

thonormal basis for y,

{f x1,       , f xr, zr+1,       , zm} .

since m     n, there are at least as many zk as there are yk. now for x     x, since

{u x1,       , u xr, yr+1,       , yn}

is an orthonormal basis for x, there exist unique scalars

such that

the following corollary follows as a simple consequence of this theorem. it is called the

left polar decomposition.
corollary 13.6.3 let f     l (x, y ) and suppose n     m where x is a hilbert space of
dimension n and y is a hilbert space of dimension m. then there exists a hermitian u    
l (x, x) , and an element of l (x, y ) , r, such that
   

f = u r, rr

= i.

proof: recall that l
        l (y, x). thus,

      

f

   
= l and (m l)

   
= l
   

   

f

= r

u

   

m

. now apply theorem 13.6.2 to

   

where r

and u satisfy the conditions of that theorem. then

f = u r

and rr

= r

   

      

   

r

= i. (cid:4)

the following existence theorem for the polar decomposition of an element of l (x, x)

is a corollary.
corollary 13.6.4 let f     l (x, x). then there exists a hermitian w     l (x, x) , and
a unitary matrix q such that f = w q, and there exists a hermitian u     l (x, x) and a
unitary r, such that f = ru.

this corollary has a fascinating relation to the question whether a given linear transfor-
a. retain the same

mation is normal. recall that an n   n matrix a, is normal if aa
   
de   nition for an element of l (x, x) .
theorem 13.6.5 let f     l (x, x) . then f is normal if and only if in corollary 13.6.4
ru = u r and qw = w q.

   
= a

325

proof:

i will prove the statement about ru = u r and leave the other part as an

exercise. first suppose that ru = u r and show f is normal. to begin with,

   

u r

= (ru )

   

   
= (u r)

   

u.

= r

therefore,

   

f

   

ru = u 2

f = u r
   

   

f f

= ru u r

= u rr

   

u = u 2

which shows f is normal.

now suppose f is normal. is ru = u r? since f is normal,

and

   

   

f f

= ru u r

   

= ru 2r

   

   

f

f = u r

   

ru = u 2.

therefore, ru 2r
= u 2, and both are nonnegative and self adjoint. therefore, the square
roots of both sides must be equal by the uniqueness part of the theorem on fractional powers.
it follows that the square root of the    rst, ru r
must equal the square root of the second,
= u and so ru = u r. this proves the theorem in one case. the other
u. therefore, ru r
case in which w and q commute is left as an exercise. (cid:4)

   

   

13.7 an application to statistics
a random vector is a function x :         rp where     is a id203 space. this means
that there exists a    algebra of measurable sets f and a id203 measure p : f     [0, 1].
in practice, people often don   t worry too much about the underlying id203 space and
instead pay more attention to the distribution measure of the random variable. for e a
suitable subset of rp, this measure gives the id203 that x has values in e. there
)
are often excellent reasons for believing that a random vector is normally distributed. this
means that the id203 that x has values in a set e is given by

the expression in the integral is called the normal id203 density function. there are
two parameters, m and    where m is called the mean and    is called the covariance matrix.
it is a symmetric matrix which has all real eigenvalues which are all positive. while it may
be reasonable to assume this is the distribution, in general, you won   t know m and    and
in order to use this formula to predict anything, you would need to know these quantities.

what people do to estimate these is to take n independent observations x1,       , xn and

try to predict what m and    should be based on these observations. one criterion used for
making this determination is the method of maximum likelihood. in this method, you seek
to choose the two parameters in such a way as to maximize the likelihood which is given as

above. i am following a nice discussion given in wikipedia. it will make use of theorem
7.5.3 on the trace as well as the theorem about the square root of a linear transformation

and the bottom row of zero matrices in the partitioned matrix, as well as the right columns
of zero matrices are each of the right size so that the resulting matrix is m    n. either
could vanish completely. however, i will write it in the above form. it is easy to make the
necessary adjustments in the other two cases.

13.9 approximation in the frobenius norm

the frobenius norm is one of many norms for a matrix. it is arguably the most obvious of
all norms. here is its de   nition.
de   nition 13.9.1 let a be a complex m    n matrix. then

||a||

f

    (trace (aa
   

))1/2

also this norm comes from the inner product

   

(a, b)f

    trace (ab

   

)

f is easily seen to equal

thus ||a||2
in fm  n.
lemma 13.9.2 let a be an m    n complex matrix with singular matrix

|aij|2 so essentially, it treats the matrix as a vector
(

)

ij

   =

   0

0

with    as de   ned above. then

||  ||2

f = ||a||2

f

(13.20)

and the following hold for the frobenius norm. if u, v are unitary and of the right size,

||u a||

f = ||a||

f , ||u av ||

f = ||a||

f .

(13.21)

proof: from the de   nition and letting u, v be unitary and of the right size,

also,

it follows

||u a||2

f

    trace (u aa

   

u

   

) = trace (aa

   

) = ||a||2

f

||av ||2

f

    trace (av v

   

   
a

) = trace (aa

   

) = ||a||2
f .

||u av ||2

f = ||av ||2

f = ||a||2
f .

now consider (13.20). from what was just shown,

||a||2

f = ||u   v

f = ||  ||2

f . (cid:4)

13.10 least squares and singular value decomposition

the singular value decomposition also has a very interesting connection to the problem of
least squares solutions. recall that it was desired to    nd x such that |ax     y| is as small as
possible. lemma 12.5.1 shows that there is a solution to this problem which can be found by
   
solving the system a
y. each x which solves this system solves the minimization
problem as was shown in the lemma just mentioned. now consider this equation for the
solutions of the minimization problem in terms of the singular value decomposition.

13.11 the moore penrose inverse

the particular solution of the least squares problem given in (13.23) is important enough
that it motivates the following de   nition.
de   nition 13.11.1 let a be an m    n matrix. then the moore penrose inverse of a,
denoted by a+ is de   ned as

thus a+y is a solution to the minimization problem to    nd x which minimizes |ax     y| .

lemma 13.11.3 the matrix a+ satis   es the following conditions.

a much more interesting observation is that a+ is characterized as being the unique
matrix which satis   es (13.24). this is the content of the following theorem. the conditions
are sometimes called the penrose conditions.

theorem 13.11.4 let a be an m    n matrix. then a matrix a0, is the moore penrose
inverse of a if and only if a0 satis   es

aa0a = a, a0aa0 = a0, a0a and aa0 are hermitian.

(13.25)

proof: from the above lemma, the moore penrose inverse satis   es (13.25). suppose
then that a0 satis   es (13.25). it is necessary to verify that a0 = a+. recall that from the
singular value decomposition, there exist unitary matrices, u and v such that

vector spaces

in this chapter, x and y are    nite dimensional vector spaces which have a norm. the
following is a de   nition.

de   nition 14.0.1 a linear space x is a normed linear space if there is a norm de   ned on
x, ||  || satisfying

||x||     0,

||x|| = 0 if and only if x = 0,
||x + y||     ||x|| + ||y|| ,

||cx|| = |c|||x||

whenever c is a scalar. a set, u     x, a normed linear space is open if for every p     u,
there exists    > 0 such that

b (p,   )     {x : ||x     p|| <   }     u.

thus, a set is open if every point of the set is an interior point.

to begin with recall the cauchy schwarz inequality which is stated here for convenience

in terms of the inner product space, cn.
theorem 14.0.2 the following inequality holds for ai and bi     c.

vectors. then this is called a cauchy sequence if for all    > 0 there exists n such that if
m, n     n, then

||xn     xm|| <   .

this is written more brie   y as

m,n      ||xn     xm|| = 0.

||a||     sup{|ax| : |x|     1}.

the conclusion of the following theorem holds.
theorem 14.0.6 let (x,||  ||) be a    nite dimensional normed linear space and let |  | be

corollary 14.0.7 if (x,||  ||) is a    nite dimensional normed linear space with the    eld of

proof: let {xk} be a cauchy sequence. then letting the components of xk with respect

corollary 14.0.8 suppose x is a    nite dimensional linear space with the    eld of scalars

and    , independent of x     x such that

   |||x|||     ||x||        |||x||| .

thus any two norms are equivalent.

norms for finite dimensional vector spaces

this is very important because it shows that all questions of convergence can be consid-

ered relative to any norm with the same outcome.

proof: let {v1,       , vn} be a basis for x and let |  | be the norm taken with respect to

this basis which was described earlier. then by theorem 14.0.6, there are positive constants

  1,    1,   2,    2, all independent of x    x such that

  2 |||x|||     |x|        2 |||x||| ,
  1 ||x||     |x|        1 ||x|| .

de   nition 14.0.9 let x and y be normed linear spaces with norms ||  ||
y re-
spectively. then l (x, y ) denotes the space of linear transformations, called bounded linear
transformations, mapping x to y which have the property that
    1} <    .

||a||     sup{||ax||

x and ||  ||

y : ||x||

x

then ||a|| is referred to as the operator norm of the bounded linear transformation a.

it is an easy exercise to verify that ||  || is a norm on l (x, y ) and it is always the case

that

||ax||

y

    ||a||||x||

x .

furthermore, you should verify that you can replace     1 with = 1 in the de   nition. thus

||a||     sup{||ax||

y : ||x||

x = 1} .

theorem 14.0.10 let x and y be    nite dimensional normed linear spaces of dimension
n and m respectively and denote by ||  || the norm on either x or y . then if a is any linear
function mapping x to y, then a     l (x, y ) and (l (x, y ) ,||  ||) is a complete normed
linear space of dimension nm with

||ax||     ||a||||x|| .

proof: it is necessary to show the norm de   ned on linear transformations really is a
norm. again the    rst and third properties listed above for norms are obvious. it remains to

show the second and verify ||a|| <    . letting {v1,       , vn} be a basis and |  | de   ned with

respect to this basis as above, there exist constants   ,     > 0 such that

   ||x||     |x|        ||x|| .

then,

||a + b||     sup{||(a + b) (x)|| : ||x||     1}

    sup{||ax|| : ||x||     1} + sup{||bx|| : ||x||     1}
    ||a|| + ||b|| .

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationnext consider the claim that ||a|| <    . this follows from

note by corollary 14.0.8 you can de   ne a norm any way desired on any    nite dimensional
linear space which has the    eld of scalars r or c and any other way of de   ning a norm on
this space yields an equivalent norm. thus, it doesn   t much matter as far as notions of
convergence are concerned which norm is used for a    nite dimensional space. in particular
in the space of m    n matrices, you can use the operator norm de   ned above, or some
other way of giving this space a norm. a popular choice for a norm is the frobenius norm
discussed earlier but reviewed here.
de   nition 14.0.11 make the space of m    n matrices into a hilbert space by de   ning

14.2 the condition number
let a     l (x, x) be a linear transformation where x is a    nite dimensional vector space
and consider the problem ax = b where it is assumed there is a unique solution to this
problem. how does the solution change if a is changed a little bit and if b is changed a

little bit? this is clearly an interesting question because you often do not know a and b
exactly. if a small change in these quantities results in a large change in the solution, x,
then it seems clear this would be undesirable. in what follows ||  || when applied to a linear
transformation will always refer to the operator norm.

this shows that the number,

the solution of ax = b is to small changes in a and b. this number is called the condition
number. it is bad when it is large because a small relative change in b, for example could
yield a large relative change in x.

recall that for a an n   n matrix, ||a||

2 =   1 where   1 is the largest singular value. the
   1 is therefore, 1/  n where   n is the smallest singular value of a.
largest singular value of a
therefore, the condition number reduces to   1/  n, the ratio of the largest to the smallest
singular value of a.

14.3 the spectral radius

even though it is in general impractical to compute the jordan form, its existence is all that
is needed in order to prove an important theorem about something which is relatively easy
to compute. this is the spectral radius of a matrix.

de   nition 14.3.1 de   ne    (a) to be the eigenvalues of a. also,

   (a)     max (|  | :           (a))

the number,    (a) is known as the spectral radius of a.

recall the following symbols and their meaning.

lim sup

n       an, lim inf

n       an

they are respectively the largest and smallest limit points of the sequence {an} where      

is allowed in the case where the sequence is unbounded. they are also de   ned as

lim sup

n       an     lim
n       an     lim

n       (sup{ak : k     n}) ,
n       (inf {ak : k     n}) .

lim inf

thus, the limit of the sequence exists if and only if these are both equal to the same real
number.
lemma 14.3.2 let j be a p    p jordan matrix

          j1

j =

js

where each jk is of the form

jk =   ki + nk

in which nk is a nilpotent matrix having zeros down the main diagonal and ones down the
super diagonal. then

n      ||j n||1/n =   

lim

where    = max{|  k| , k = 1, . . . , n}. here the norm is de   ned to equal

proof: suppose    rst that      = 0. first note that for this norm, if b, c are p   p matrices,

||b|| = max{|bij| , i, j} .

from the de   nition of   , at least one of the   k/   has absolute value equal to 1. therefore,

because each nk has only zero terms on the main diagonal. therefore, some term in the
matrix has absolute value at least as large as 1. now also, since n p
k = 0, the norm of
the matrix in the above is dominated by an expression of the form cnp where c is some
constant which does not depend on n. this is because a typical block in the above matrix
is of the form

therefore, limn       en = 0. it follows from (14.8) that the expression in the norms in this

lim

in case    = 0 so that all the eigenvalues equal zero, it follows that j n = 0 for all n > p.
therefore, the limit still exists and equals   . (cid:4)

the following theorem is due to gelfand around 1941.

value of its largest eigenvalue,

here ||  || is any norm on l (cn, cn).

a laborious computation reveals the eigenvalues are 5, and 10. therefore, the right
where the norm is obtained by taking the

answer in this case is 10. consider
maximum of all the absolute values of the entries. thus

and taking the seventh root of the largest entry gives

   (a)     8015 6251/7 = 9. 688 951 236 71.

of course the interest lies primarily in matrices for which the exact roots to the characteristic
equation are not known and in the theoretical signi   cance.

k=1 be a sequence in l (x, y ) where x, y are    nite dimen-
sional normed linear spaces. then limn       ak = a if for every    > 0 there exists n such
that if n > n, then

here the norm refers to any of the norms de   ned on l (x, y ) . by corollary 14.0.8 and
theorem 9.2.3 it doesn   t matter which one is used. de   ne the symbol for an in   nite sum in

de   nition 14.4.4 the function in corollary 14.4.3 given by that power series is denoted
as

exp (  t) or e  t.

the next lemma is normally discussed in advanced calculus courses but is proved here

for the convenience of the reader. it is known as the root test.

de   nition 14.4.5 for {an} any sequence of real numbers

similarly

lim sup

n       an     lim
n       an     lim

lim inf

n       (sup{ak : k     n})

n       (inf {ak : k     n})

in case anis an increasing (decreasing) sequence which is unbounded above (below) then it
is understood that limn       an =    (      ) respectively. thus either of lim sup or lim inf can
equal +    or       . however, the important thing about these is that unlike the limit, these
always exist.

it is convenient to think of these as the largest point which is the limit of some sub-

sequence of {an} and the smallest point which is the limit of some subsequence of {an}
respectively. thus limn       an exists and equals some point of [      ,   ] if and only if the

two are equal.

lemma 14.4.6 let {ap} be a sequence of nonnegative terms and let

r = lim sup

p       a1/p

p

.

      

then if r < 1, it follows the series,
to 0 so the series diverges. if a is an n    n matrix and
||ap||1/p ,

1 < lim sup
p      

      

then

k=0 ak fails to converge.

k=1 ak converges and if r > 1, then ap fails to converge

(14.10)

proof: suppose r < 1. then there exists n such that if p > n,

where r < r < 1. therefore,
geometric series,

rp, it follows

for all such p, ap < rp and so by comparison with the

   

a1/p
p < r

      

p=1 ap converges.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation354

next suppose r > 1. then letting 1 < r < r, it follows there are in   nitely many values

of p at which

r < a1/p

p

which implies rp < ap, showing that ap cannot converge to 0 and so the series cannot
      
converge either.
to see the last claim, if (14.10) holds, then from the    rst part of this lemma, ||ap||
k=0 ak    

m=0 is not a cauchy sequence. hence

{   
k=0 ak cannot exist. (cid:4)

lemma 14.4.7    (ap) =    (a)p

proof: in dealing with    (ap) , is su   ces to deal with    (j p) where j is the jordan form
of a because j p and ap are similar. thus if           (ap) , then           (j p) and so    =   
where    is one of the entries on the main diagonal of j p. these entries are of the form   p
where           (a). thus           (a)p and this shows    (ap)        (a)p .

now take           (a) and consider   p.

  pi     ap =

  p   1i +        +   ap   2 + ap   1

(  i     a)

and so   pi     ap fails to be one to one which shows that   p        (ap) which shows that
   (a)p        (ap) . (cid:4)

14.5 iterative methods for linear systems

consider the problem of solving the equation

ax = b

(14.11)
where a is an n    n matrix. in many applications, the matrix a is huge and composed
mainly of zeros. for such matrices, the method of gauss elimination (row operations) is
not a good way to solve the system because the row operations can destroy the zeros and
storing all those zeros takes a lot of room in a computer. these systems are called sparse.
to solve them, it is common to use an iterative technique. i am following the treatment
given to this subject by nobel and daniel [20].

(

)

de   nition 14.5.1 the jacobi iterative technique, also called the method of simultaneous
corrections is de   ned as follows. let x1 be an initial vector, say the zero vector or some
other vector. the method generates a succession of vectors, x2, x3, x4,       and hopefully this
sequence of vectors will converge to the solution to (14.11). the vectors in this list are called
iterates and they are obtained according to the following procedure. letting a = (aij) ,

i =    

aiixr+1

j + bi.

(14.13)

the matrix on the left in (14.13) is obtained by retaining the main diagonal of a and
setting every other entry equal to zero. the matrix on the right in (14.13) is obtained from
a by setting every diagonal entry equal to zero and retaining all the other entries unchanged.

when the matrix is 1000  1000 or larger. this example is just to illustrate how the method

you can keep going like this. recall the solution is approximately equal to

so you see that with no care at all and only 6 iterations, an approximate solution has been
obtained which is not too far o    from the actual solution.

it is important to realize that a computer would use (14.12) directly. indeed, writing
the problem in terms of matrices as i have done above destroys every bene   t of the method.
however, it makes it a little easier to see what is happening and so this is why i have
presented it in this way.

tions is given as follows. for a = (aij) , the iterates for the problem ax = b are obtained
according to the formula

1you certainly would not compute the invese in solving a large system. this is just to show you how the

in words, you set every entry in the original matrix which is strictly above the main
diagonal equal to zero to obtain the matrix on the left. to get the matrix on the right,
you set every entry of a which is on or below the main diagonal equal to zero. using the
iteration procedure of (14.15) directly, the gauss seidel method makes use of the very latest
information which is available at that stage of the computation.

procedure in terms of the entries of the matrix directly. otherwise all bene   t to using this method is lost.

you can   t expect to be real close after only one iteration. lets do another.

the iterates seem to be getting farther from the actual solution. why is the process which
worked so well in the other examples not working here? a better question might be: why
does either process ever work at all?

both iterative procedures for solving

ax = b

(14.17)

are of the form

bxr+1 =    cxr + b

where a = b + c. in the jacobi procedure, the matrix c was obtained by setting the
diagonal of a equal to zero and leaving all other entries the same while the matrix b was
obtained by making every entry of a equal to zero other than the diagonal entries which are
left unchanged. in the gauss seidel procedure, the matrix b was obtained from a by making
every entry strictly above the main diagonal equal to zero and leaving the others unchanged
and c was obtained from a by making every entry on or below the main diagonal equal to
zero and leaving the others unchanged. thus in the jacobi procedure, b is a diagonal matrix
while in the gauss seidel procedure, b is lower triangular. using matrices to explicitly solve
for the iterates, yields

xr+1 =    b

   1cxr + b

   1b.

(14.18)

this is what you would never have the computer do but this is what will allow the statement
of a theorem which gives the condition for convergence of these and all other similar methods.
recall the de   nition of the spectral radius of m,    (m ) , in de   nition 14.3.1 on page 348.

which shows the partial sums form a cauchy sequence. therefore,   
case.

you might try a similar argument in the case of the gauss seidel method.

14.6 theory of convergence
de   nition 14.6.1 a normed vector space, e with norm ||  || is called a banach space if it
is also complete. this means that every cauchy sequence converges. recall that a sequence
{xn}   
n=1 is a cauchy sequence if for every    > 0 there exists n such that whenever m, n > n,

||xn     xm|| <   .

thus whenever {xn} is a cauchy sequence, there exists x such that

n      ||x     xn|| = 0.

lim

example 14.6.2 let     be a nonempty subset of a normed linear space, f. denote by
bc (   ; e) the set of bounded continuous functions having values in e where e is a banach
space. then de   ne the norm on bc (   ; e) by

||f||     sup{||f (x)||

e : x        } .

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation14.6. theory of convergence

361

lemma 14.6.3 the space bc (   ; e) with the given norm is a banach space.

proof: it is obvious ||  || is a norm. it only remains to verify bc (   ; e) is complete. let

{fn} be a cauchy sequence. then pick x        .
||fn (x)     fm (x)||

e

    ||fn     fm|| <   

whenever m, n are large enough. thus, for each x,{fn (x)} is a cauchy sequence in e.

since e is complete, it follows there exists a function, f de   ned on     such that f (x) =
limn       fn (x).

it remains to verify that f     bc (   ; e) and that ||f     fn||     0. i will    rst show that

(

)

lim
n      

sup
x      

{||f (x)     fn (x)||

e

}

= 0.

(14.19)

from this it will follow that f is bounded. then i will show that f is continuous and

||f     fn||     0. let    > 0 be given and let n be such that for m, n > n

||fn     fm|| <   /3.

then it follows that for all x,

||f (x)     fm (x)||

e = lim

n      ||fn (x)     fm (x)||

e

      /3

therefore, for m > n,

{||f (x)     fm (x)||

}       
3

sup
x      
this proves (14.19). then by the triangle inequality and letting n be as just described,
pick m > n. then for any x        
||f (x)||

e +        ||fm|| +   .

    ||fm (x)||

<   .

e

e

hence f is bounded. now pick x         and let    > 0 be given and n be as above. then
e + ||fm (y)     f (y)||

e + ||fm (x)     fm (y)||

||f (x)     f (y)||

e

e

    ||f (x)     fm (x)||
      
3

+ ||fm (x)     fm (y)||

e +

  
3

.

now by continuity of fm, the middle term is less than   /3 whenever ||x     y|| is su   ciently

small. therefore, f is also continuous. finally, from the above,

||f     fn||       

3

whenever n > n and so limn       ||f     fn|| = 0 as claimed. (cid:4)

the most familiar example of a banach space is fn. the following lemma is of great

importance so it is stated in general.
lemma 14.6.4 suppose t : e     e where e is a banach space with norm |  |. also suppose

for some r     (0, 1). then there exists a unique    xed point, x     e such that

|t x     t y|     r |x     y|

t x = x.

letting x1     e, this    xed point, x, is the limit of the sequence of iterates,

by induction, this shows that for all k     2, (14.24) is valid. now let k > l     n.

which converges to 0 as n        . therefore, this is a cauchy sequence so it must converge
to x     e. then

x = lim

k       t kx1 = lim

k       t k+1x1 = t lim

k       t kx1 = t x.

this shows the existence of the    xed point. to show it is unique, suppose there were

another one, y. then

and so x = y.

it remains to verify the estimate.

proof: from lemma 14.6.4 there exists a unique    xed point for t n denoted here as x.

therefore, t n x = x. now doing t to both sides,

t n t x = t x.

by uniqueness, t x = x because the above equation shows t x is a    xed point of t n and
there is only one    xed point of t n . in fact, there is only one    xed point of t because a
   xed point of t is automatically a    xed point of t n .
it remains to show t kx1     x, the unique    xed point of t n . if this does not happen,

there exists    > 0 and a subsequence, still denoted by t k such that

now k = jkn + rk where rk     {0,       , n     1} and jk is a positive integer such that
limk       jk =    . then there exists a single r     {0,       , n     1} such that for in   nitely

15.1 the power method for eigenvalues

this chapter discusses numerical methods for    nding eigenvalues. however, to do this
correctly, you must include numerical analysis considerations which are distinct from linear
algebra. the purpose of this chapter is to give an introduction to some numerical methods
without leaving the context of id202. in addition, some examples are given which
make use of computer algebra systems. for a more thorough discussion, you should see
books on numerical methods in id202 like some listed in the references.
let a be a complex p    p matrix and suppose that it has distinct eigenvalues

consider one of the terms in the sum for k (k, n) for k > 1. letting the norm of a matrix
be the maximum of the absolute values of its entries,

where c depends on the eigenvalues but is independent of n. then this converges to 0
because the in   nite sum of these converges due to the root test. thus each of the matrices
k (k, n) converges to 0 for each k > 1 as n        .

with this preparation, here is a theorem.

theorem 15.1.1 let a be a complex p    p matrix such that the eigenvalues are

with |  1| > |  j| for all j   = 1. then for x a given vector, let

{  1,   2,       ,   r}

y1 =

ax
s1
where s1 is an entry of ax which has the largest absolute value. if the scalars {s1,       , sn   1}
and vectors {y1,       , yn   1} have been obtained, let
yn     ayn   1
sn

where sn is the entry of ayn   1 which has largest absolute value. then it is probably the case
that {sn} will converge to   1 and {yn} will converge to an eigenvector associated with   1.

proof: consider the claim about sn+1. it was shown above that

(

z     p

)

)

(

p

is an eigenvector for   1. let zl be the entry of z which has largest absolute value. then for
large n, it will probably be the case that the entry of yn which has largest absolute value
will also be in the lth slot. this follows from (15.2) because for large n, zn will be very
small, smaller than the largest entry of the top part of the vector in that expression. then,
since m (n) is very small, the result follows if z has a well de   ned entry which has largest
absolute value. now from the above construction,

n       sn+1yn+1 = lim

n       ayn = av. (cid:4)

in summary, here is the procedure.

finding the largest eigenvalue with its eigenvector.

1. start with a vector, u1 which you hope is not unlucky.

2. if uk is known,

uk+1 =

auk
sk+1

where sk+1 is the entry of auk which has largest absolute value.

3. when the scaling factors sk are not changing much, sk+1 will be close to the eigenvalue

and uk+1 will be close to an eigenvector.

4. check your answer to see if it worked well.

you can begin with u1= (1,       , 1)t and apply the above procedure. however, you can
accelerate the process if you begin with anu1 and then divide by the largest entry to get
the    rst approximate eigenvector. thus

15.1.1 the shifted inverse power method

this method can    nd various eigenvalues and eigenvectors. it is a signi   cant generalization
of the above simple procedure and yields very good results. one can    nd complex eigenvalues
using this method. the situation is this: you have a number,    which is close to   , some
eigenvalue of an n    n matrix a. you don   t know    but you know that    is closer to   
than to any other eigenvalue. your problem is to    nd both    and an eigenvector which goes
with   . another way to look at this is to start with    and seek the eigenvalue   , which is
closest to    along with an eigenvector associated with   . if    is an eigenvalue of a, then
you have what you want. therefore, i will always assume    is not an eigenvalue of a and
so (a       i)
lemma 15.1.3 let {  k}n
eigenvalue   k, then xk is an eigenvector for (a       i)
  k      . conversely, if

k=1 be the eigenvalues of a. if xk is an eigenvector of a for the
   1 corresponding to the eigenvalue

   1 exists. the method is based on the following lemma.

(a       i)

   1 y =

1

         

y

(15.4)

and y   = 0, then ay =   y.

proof: let   k and xk be as described in the statement of the lemma. then

(a       i) xk = (  k       ) xk

and so

1

  k       

xk = (a       i)

   1 xk.

now assume    is closer to    than to any other eigenvalue. then the magnitude of

        [ay       y] . solving for ay leads to ay =   y. (cid:4)

suppose (15.4). then y = 1
is greater than the magnitude of all the other eigenvalues of (a       i)
power method applied to (a       i)
solve for   .

   1 will yield

        . you end up with sn+1     1

numerical methods for finding eigenvalues

15.1.2 the explicit description of the method

here is how you use this method to    nd the eigenvalue and eigenvector closest
to   .

1. find (a       i)

   1 .

2. pick u1. if you are not phenomenally unlucky, the iterations will converge.

3. if uk has been obtained,

uk+1 =

   1 uk

(a       i)
sk+1

where sk+1 is the entry of (a       i)

   1 uk which has largest absolute value.

4. when the scaling factors, sk are not changing much and the uk are not changing much,

   nd the approximation to the eigenvalue by solving

         
for   . the eigenvector is approximated by uk+1.

sk+1 =

1

5. check your work by multiplying by the original matrix to see how well what you have

found works.

thus this amounts to the power method for the matrix (a       i)

       which is closest to    7.

also    nd an eigenvector which goes with this eigenvalue.

in this case the eigenvalues are    6, 0, and 12 so the correct answer is    6 for the eigen-

value. then from the above procedure, i will start with an initial vector,

then i must solve the following equation.

simplifying the matrix on the left, i must solve

these scaling factors are pretty close after these few iterations. therefore, the predicted
eigenvalue is obtained by solving the following for   .

which gives    =    6. 01. you see this is pretty close. in this case the eigenvalue closest to
   7 was    6.

how would you know what to start with for an initial guess? you might apply ger-

schgorin   s theorem.

since a is symmetric, it follows it has three real eigenvalues which are solutions to

       . find the middle
            

if you use your graphing calculator to graph this polynomial, you    nd there is an eigenvalue
somewhere between    .9 and    .8 and that this is the middle eigenvalue. of course you could

there will be only the zero solution because the matrix on the left will be invertible and the

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation378

numerical methods for finding eigenvalues

because all these are only approximations to the eigenvalue and so the matrix in the above
is nonsingular for all of these. therefore, you will only get the zero solution and

eigenvectors are never equal to zero!

however, there exists such an eigenvector and you can    nd it using the shifted inverse power
method. pick    =    .855. then you solve

eigenvalue which is close to    .855 is the above u3 and an eigenvalue is obtained by solving

as before, it helps to get things started if you raise to a power and then go from the
approximate eigenvector obtained.

this is only a 3  3 matrix and so it is not hard to estimate the eigenvalues. just get
the characteristic equation, graph it using a calculator and zoom in to    nd the eigenvalues.
if you do this, you    nd there is an eigenvalue near    1.2, one near    .4, and one near 5.5.
(the characteristic equation is 2 + 8   + 4  2       3 = 0.) of course i have no idea what the
eigenvectors are.
   1.2. in this case, let    =    1.2. then

lets    rst try to    nd the eigenvector and a better approximation for the eigenvalue near

you can see that for practical purposes, this has found the eigenvalue closest to    1. 218 5
and the corresponding eigenvector.
the other eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be found similarly. in the case of    .4, you

now

as before, i have no idea what the eigenvector is but i am tired of always using (1, 1, 1)t
and i don   t want to give the impression that you always need to start with this vector.
therefore, i shall let u1 = (1, 2, 3)t . also, i will begin by raising the matrix to a power.

it works pretty well. for practical purposes, the eigenvalue and eigenvector have now been
found. if you want better accuracy, you could just continue iterating.

next i will    nd the eigenvalue and eigenvector for the eigenvalue near 5.5. in this case,

15.1.3 complex eigenvalues

what about complex eigenvalues? if your matrix is real, you won   t see these by graphing
the characteristic equation on your calculator. will the shifted inverse power method    nd
these eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors? the answer is yes. however, for a real
matrix, you must pick    to be complex. this is because the eigenvalues occur in conjugate
pairs so if you don   t pick it complex, it will be the same distance between any conjugate
pair of complex numbers and so nothing in the above argument for convergence implies you
will get convergence to a complex number. also, the process of iteration will yield only real
vectors and scalars.

example 15.1.7 find the complex eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for the ma-
trix

here the characteristic equation is   3     5  2 + 8       6 = 0. one solution is    = 3. the
other two are 1 + i and 1     i. i will apply the process to    = i to    nd the eigenvalue closest
to i.

this illustrates an interesting topic which leads to many related topics. if you have a
polynomial, x4 + ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, you can consider it as the characteristic polynomial of
a certain matrix, called a companion matrix. in this case,

                a    b    c    d

the above example was just a companion matrix for   3     5  2 + 8       6. you can see the
pattern which will enable you to obtain a companion matrix for any polynomial of the form
  n + a1  n   1 +        + an   1   + an. this illustrates that one way to    nd the complex zeros

of a polynomial is to use the shifted inverse power method on a companion matrix for the
polynomial. doubtless there are better ways but this does illustrate how impressive this
procedure is. do you have a better way?

note that the shifted inverse power method is a way you can begin with something close

but not equal to an eigenvalue and end up with something close to an eigenvector.

15.1.4 rayleigh quotients and estimates for eigenvalues

there are many specialized results concerning the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for hermitian
   
matrices. recall a matrix a is hermitian if a = a
means to take the transpose
of the conjugate of a. in the case of a real matrix, hermitian reduces to symmetric. recall
also that for x     fn,

   
where a

n   

|x|2 = x

   

x =

|xj|2 .

recall the following corollary found on page 179 which is stated here for convenience.

j=1

corollary 15.1.8 if a is hermitian, then all the eigenvalues of a are real and there exists
an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.

thus for {xk}n

k=1 this orthonormal basis,
i xj =   ij    
   

1 if i = j
0 if i   = j
for x     fn, x   = 0, the rayleigh quotient is de   ned by

now let the eigenvalues of a be   1       2                  n and axk =   kxk where {xk}n

the above orthonormal basis of eigenvectors mentioned in the corollary. then if x is an

in other words, the rayleigh quotient is always between the largest and the smallest eigenval-
ues of a. when x = xn, the rayleigh quotient equals the largest eigenvalue and when x = x1
the rayleigh quotient equals the smallest eigenvalue. suppose you calculate a rayleigh quo-
tient. how close is it to some eigenvalue?

15.2 the qr algorithm

15.2.1 basic properties and de   nition
recall the theorem about the qr factorization in theorem 5.7.5. it says that given an n  n
real matrix a, there exists a real orthogonal matrix q and an upper triangular matrix r such
that a = qr and that this factorization can be accomplished by a systematic procedure.
one such procedure was given in proving this theorem.
there is also a way to generalize the qr factorization to the case where a is just a
complex n   n matrix and q is unitary while r is upper triangular with nonnegative entries
be the matrix with the aj the columns,
on the main diagonal. letting a =

each a vector in cn, let q1 be a unitary matrix which maps a1 to |a1| e1 in the case that
a1   = 0. if a1 = 0, let q1 = i. why does such a unitary matrix exist? let

be an orthonormal basis and let q1
q1 preserves lengths so it is unitary by lemma 13.6.1. now

= e1, q1 (u2) = e2 etc. extend q1 linearly. then

q1a =

which is a matrix of the form

now do the same thing for a1 obtaining an n     1    n     1 unitary matrix q

this way

this algorithm was proposed by francis in 1961. the sequence {ak} is the desired

sequence of iterates. now with the above de   nition of the algorithm, here are its properties.
the next lemma shows each of the ak is unitarily similar to a and the amazing thing about
this algorithm is that often it becomes increasingly easy to    nd the eigenvalues of the ak.

numerical methods for finding eigenvalues

lemma 15.2.2 let a be an n   n matrix and let the qk and rk be as described in the algo-
rithm. then each ak is unitarily similar to a and denoting by q(k) the product q1q2        qk
and r(k) the product rkrk   1        r1, it follows that
ak = q(k)r(k)

(the matrix on the left is a raised to the kth power.)

a = q(k)akq(k)   

, ak = q(k)   

aq(k).

proof: from the algorithm, rk+1 = ak+1q

   
k+1 and so

ak = qk+1rk+1 = qk+1ak+1q

   
k+1

now iterating this, it follows

ak   1 = qkakq

   
k = qkqk+1ak+1q

   
ak   2 = qk   1ak   1q
k   1 = qk   1qkqk+1ak+1q
etc. thus, after k     2 more iterations,

   
k

   
k+1q
   
   
k+1q
kq

   
k   1

a = q(k+1)ak+1q(k+1)   

the product of unitary matrices is unitary and so this proves the    rst claim of the lemma.
now consider the part about ak. from the algorithm, this is clearly true for k = 1.

(a1 = qr) suppose then that

ak = q1q2        qkrkrk   1        r1

what was just shown indicated

a = q1q2        qk+1ak+1q
   
k+1q

   
k

       q

   
1

and now from the algorithm, ak+1 = rk+1qk+1 and so
a = q1q2        qk+1rk+1qk+1q
   
k+1q

1q1        qkrkrk   1        r1

q = lim

and i need to show both sides of the above are equal to i. the left side of the above is
unitary and the right side is upper triangular having positive entries on the diagonal. this
is because the inverse of such an upper triangular matrix having positive entries on the
main diagonal is still upper triangular having positive entries on the main diagonal and
the product of two such upper triangular matrices gives another of the same form having
positive entries on the main diagonal. suppose then that q = r where q is unitary and r
is upper triangular having positive entries on the main diagonal. let qk = q and rk = r.
it follows

irk     r = q

and so from the    rst part, rk     i but rk = r and so r = i. thus applying this to
   

   1 yields both sides equal i. (cid:4)

)

a case of all this is of great interest. suppose a has a largest eigenvalue    which is
real. then an is of the form
and so likely each of these columns
will be pointing roughly in the direction of an eigenvector of a which corresponds to this
eigenvalue. then when you do the qr factorization of this, it follows from the fact that r
is upper triangular, that the    rst column of q will be a multiple of an   1a1 and so will end
up being roughly parallel to the eigenvector desired. also this will require the entries below
the top in the    rst column of an = qt aq will all be small because they will be of the form
i aq1       qt
qt

i q1 = 0. therefore, an will be of the form

)

(

   
  
a
e b

   
where e is small. it follows that   
will be close to    and q1 will be close to an eigenvector for
  . then if you like, you could do the same thing with the matrix b to obtain approximations
for the other eigenvalues. finally, you could use the shifted inverse power method to get
more exact solutions.

15.2.2 the case of real eigenvalues

with these lemmas, it is possible to prove that for the qr algorithm and certain conditions,
the sequence ak converges pointwise to an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues
of a down the diagonal. i will assume all the matrices are real here.

(

this convergence won   t always happen. consider for example the matrix

)

.

you can verify quickly that the algorithm will return this matrix for each k. the problem
here is that, although the matrix has the two eigenvalues    1, 1, they have the same absolute
value. the qr algorithm works in somewhat the same way as the power method, exploiting
di   erences in the size of the eigenvalues.

if a has all real eigenvalues and you are interested in    nding these eigenvalues along
with the corresponding eigenvectors, you could always consider a +   i instead where    is
su   ciently large and positive that a +   i has all positive eigenvalues. (recall gerschgorin   s
theorem.) then if    is an eigenvalue of a +   i with

then

(a +   i) x =   x

ax = (         ) x

so to    nd the eigenvalues of a you just subtract    from the eigenvalues of a +   i. thus
there is no loss of generality in assuming at the outset that the eigenvalues of a are all
positive. here is the theorem. it involves a technical condition which will often hold. the
proof presented here follows [26] and is a special case of that presented in this reference.

before giving the proof, note that the product of upper triangular matrices is upper
triangular.
if they both have positive entries on the main diagonal so will the product.
furthermore, the inverse of an upper triangular matrix is upper triangular. i will use these
simple facts without much comment whenever convenient.

that   u is an upper triangular matrix having positive diagonal entries. note   2 = i and

an easy case is for a symmetric. recall corollary 7.4.13. by this corollary, there exists

an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix q such that

qt aq = d

where d is diagonal having the eigenvalues on the main diagonal decreasing in size from the
upper left corner to the lower right.

corollary 15.2.5 let a be a real symmetric n    n matrix having eigenvalues

  1 >   2 >        >   n > 0

and let q be de   ned by

qdqt = a, d = qt aq,

(15.14)

where q is orthogonal and d is a diagonal matrix having the eigenvalues on the main
diagonal decreasing in size from the upper left corner to the lower right. let qt have an
   
   
lu factorization. then in the qr algorithm, the matrices q(k) converge to q
is
where q
the same as q except having some columns multiplied by (   1) . thus the columns of q
   
are
eigenvectors of a. the matrices ak converge to d.

proof: this follows from theorem 15.2.4. here s = q, s

   1 = qt . thus

q = s = qr

and r = i. by theorem 15.2.4 and lemma 15.2.2,
   t aq

ak = q(k)t aq(k)     q

because formula (15.14) is una   ected by replacing q with q
when using the qr algorithm, it is not necessary to check technical condition about
   1 having an lu factorization. the algorithm delivers a sequence of matrices which are
s
similar to the original one. if that sequence converges to an upper triangular matrix, then
the algorithm worked. furthermore, the technical condition is su   cient but not necessary.
the algorithm will work even without the technical condition.

now lets see how well the smallest approximate eigenvalue and eigenvector works.

for practical purposes, this has found the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

15.2.3 the qr algorithm in the general case

in the case where a has distinct positive eigenvalues it was shown above that under reason-
able conditions related to a certain matrix having an lu factorization the qr algorithm
produces a sequence of matrices {ak} which converges to an upper triangular matrix. what
if a is just an n  n matrix having possibly complex eigenvalues but a is nondefective? what
happens with the qr algorithm in this case? the short answer to this question is that the
ak of the algorithm typically cannot converge. however, this does not mean the algo-
rithm is not useful in    nding eigenvalues. it turns out the sequence of matrices {ak} have

the appearance of a block upper triangular matrix for large k in the sense that the entries

395

below the blocks on the main diagonal are small. then looking at these blocks gives a way
to approximate the eigenvalues. an important example of the concept of a block triangular
matrix is the real schur form for a matrix discussed in theorem 7.4.6 but the concept as
described here allows for any size block centered on the diagonal.

first it is important to note a simple fact about unitary diagonal matrices.

in what
follows    will denote a unitary matrix which is also a diagonal matrix. these matrices
are just the identity matrix with some of the ones replaced with a number of the form ei  
for some   . the important property of multiplication of any matrix by    on either side
is that it leaves all the zero entries the same and also preserves the absolute values of the
other entries. thus a block triangular matrix multiplied by    on either side is still block
triangular. if the matrix is close to being block triangular this property of being close to a
block triangular matrix is also preserved by multiplying on either side by   . other patterns
depending only on the size of the absolute value occurring in the matrix are also preserved
by multiplying on either side by   . in other words, in looking for a pattern in a matrix,
multiplication by    is irrelevant.
now let a be an n   n matrix having real or complex entries. by lemma 15.2.2 and the

assumption that a is nondefective, there exists an invertible s,

ak = q(k)r(k) = sdks

(15.15)

where

d =

            1

0

   1

         

. . .

0

  n

and by rearranging the columns of s, d can be made such that

|  1|     |  2|                |  n| .

assume s

   1 has an lu factorization. then

consider the matrix in the middle, dkld

   k. the ijth entry is of the form

ak = sdklu = sdkld

   kdku.

(

)

   k

dkld

ij =

            k

   k
i lij  
j
1 if i = j
0 if j > i

if j < i

and these all converge to 0 whenever |  i| < |  j| . thus
   k = (lk + ek)

dkld

  k
i lij  

   k
j

where lk is a lower triangular matrix which has all ones down the diagonal and some
subdiagonal terms of the form

for which |  i| = |  j| while ek     0. (note the entries of lk are all bounded independent of

k but some may fail to converge.) then

q(k)r(k) = s (lk + ek) dku

let

slk = qkrk

(15.17)

(15.16)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation396

numerical methods for finding eigenvalues

where this is the qr factorization of slk. then

(

q(k)r(k) = (qkrk + sek) dku
   1
= qk
k
= qk (i + fk) rkdku
   
k. then

   
ksekr

)

rkdku

where fk     0. let i + fk = q

by lemma 15.2.3

   
q(k)r(k) = qkq
kr

   
krkdku

   
k

q

    i and r

   
k

    i.

now let   k be a diagonal unitary matrix which has the property that

   
kdku

  

(15.18)

is an upper triangular matrix which has all the diagonal entries positive. then

q(k)r(k) = qkq

   
   
k  k (  
kr

   
krk  k)   

   
kdku

that matrix in the middle has all positive diagonal entries because it is itself an upper
   
triangular matrix, being the product of such, and is similar to the matrix r
krk which is
upper triangular with positive diagonal entries. by lemma 15.2.3 again, this time using the
uniqueness assertion,

q(k) = qkq

   
k  k, r(k) = (  

   
kr

   
krk  k)   

   
kdku

   
k  k must be real because the algorithm gives all q(k) as real matrices.
note the term qkq
by (15.18) it follows that for k large enough

q(k)     qk  k
where     means the two matrices are close. recall

ak = q(k)t aq(k)

and so for large k,

ak     (qk  k)

   

a (qk  k) =   

   
kq

   
kaqk  k

as noted above, the form of   
not a   ected by the presence of   k and   
   
su   ces to consider q
kaqk.

   
kq

   
kaqk  k in terms of which entries are large and small is
   
k. thus, in considering what form this is in, it

this could get pretty complicated but i will consider the case where

if |  i| = |  i+1| , then |  i+2| < |  i+1| .

(15.19)

this is typical of the situation where the eigenvalues are all distinct and the matrix a is real
so the eigenvalues occur as conjugate pairs. then in this case, lk above is lower triangular
with some nonzero terms on the diagonal right below the main diagonal but zeros everywhere
else. thus maybe

(lk)s+1,s

  = 0

recall (15.17) which implies

qk = slkr

   1
k

(15.20)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation15.2. the qr algorithm

397

   1
where r
k

is upper triangular. also recall that from the de   nition of s in (15.15),

   1as = d

s

and so the columns of s are eigenvectors of a, the ith being an eigenvector for   i. now
from the form of lk, it follows lkr
is a block upper triangular matrix denoted by tb and
so qk = stb. it follows from the above construction in (15.16) and the given assumption
on the sizes of the eigenvalues, there are    nitely many 2    2 blocks centered on the main
diagonal along with possibly some diagonal entries. therefore, for large k the matrix

   1
k

ak = q(k)t aq(k)

is approximately of the same form as that of

   
kaqk = t

   1
b s

q

   1astb = t

   1
b dtb

which is a block upper triangular matrix. as explained above, multiplication by the various
diagonal unitary matrices does not a   ect this form. therefore, for large k, ak is approxi-
mately a block upper triangular matrix.

how would this change if the above assumption on the size of the eigenvalues were relaxed
but the matrix was still nondefective with appropriate matrices having an lu factorization
as above? it would mean the blocks on the diagonal would be larger. this immediately
makes the problem more cumbersome to deal with. however, in the case that the eigenvalues
of a are distinct, the above situation really is typical of what occurs and in any case can be
quickly reduced to this case.

to see this, suppose condition (15.19) is violated and   j,       ,   j+p are complex eigen-

values having nonzero imaginary parts such that each has the same absolute value but they
are all distinct. then let    > 0 and consider the matrix a +   i. thus the correspond-

ing eigenvalues of a +   i are   j +   ,       ,   j+p +   . a short computation shows shows
|  j +   | ,       ,|  j+p +   | are all distinct and so the above situation of (15.19) is obtained. of

course, if there are repeated eigenvalues, it may not be possible to reduce to the case above
and you would end up with large blocks on the main diagonal which could be di   cult to
deal with.

   
b. you know ak is also similar to a. therefore, t

so how do you identify the eigenvalues? you know ak and behold that it is close to a
   
block upper triangular matrix t
b has
eigenvalues which are close to the eigenvalues of ak and hence those of a provided k is
su   ciently large. see theorem 7.9.2 which depends on complex analysis or the exercise on
page 197 which gives another way to see this. thus you    nd the eigenvalues of this block
   
triangular matrix t
b and assert that these are good approximations of the eigenvalues of
ak and hence to those of a. how do you    nd the eigenvalues of a block triangular matrix?
this is easy from lemma 7.4.5. say

         

      
. . .

   
...
bm

   
b =
t

          b1
m   

0

det (  ij     bj)

then forming   i     t

   
b and taking the determinant, it follows from lemma 7.4.5 this equals

and so all you have to do is take the union of the eigenvalues for each bj.
emphasized here this is very easy because these blocks are just 2    2 matrices.

in the case

j=1

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation398

numerical methods for finding eigenvalues

how do you identify approximate eigenvectors from this? first try to    nd the approx-
   
b.

imate eigenvectors for ak. pick an approximate eigenvalue   , an exact eigenvalue for t
then    nd v solving t

   
   
bv =   v. it follows since t
b is close to ak that
akv       v

and so

hence

q(k)aq(k)t v = akv       v

aq(k)t v       q(k)t v

and so q(k)t v is an approximation to the eigenvector which goes with the eigenvalue of a
which is close to   .

it happens that the eigenvalues of this matrix are 1, 1 + i, 1    i. lets apply the qr algorithm
as if the eigenvalues were not known.

applying the qr algorithm to this matrix yields the following sequence of matrices.

a1 =

))

at this point the bottom two terms on the left part of the bottom row are both very
small so it appears the real eigenvalue is near 1.0. the complex eigenvalues are obtained
from solving

9. 177 2    10
   2. 855 6

this yields

   = 1.0     . 988 28i, 1.0 + . 988 28i

example 15.2.8 the equation x4 + x3 +4x2 + x    2 = 0 has exactly two real solutions. you
can see this by graphing it. however, the rational root theorem from algebra shows neither
of these solutions are rational. also, graphing it does not yield any information about the
complex solutions. lets use the qr algorithm to approximate all the solutions, real and
complex.

which is pretty close to 0. the real eigenvalues are also very close to the corresponding real
solutions to the original equation.

it seems like most of the attention to the qr algorithm has to do with    nding ways
to get it to    converge    faster. great and marvelous are the clever tricks which have been
proposed to do this but my intent is to present the basic ideas, not to go in to the numerous
re   nements of this algorithm. however, there is one thing which is usually done. it involves
reducing to the case of an upper hessenberg matrix which is one which is zero below the
main sub diagonal. to see that every matrix is unitarily similar to an upper hessenberg
matrix , see problem 1 on page 273. what follows is a construction which also proves this.

where a2 is now an n     2    n     2 matrix. continuing this way you eventually get a unitary

matrix q which is a product of those discussed above such that

this matrix equals zero below the subdiagonal. it is called an upper hessenberg matrix.

it happens that in the qr algorithm, if ak is upper hessenberg, so is ak+1. to see this,

note that the matrix is upper hessenberg means that aij = 0 whenever i     j     2.

ak+1 = rkqk

p     q     i     j     2

and so the sum equals 0.

since upper hessenberg matrices stay that way in the algorithm and it is closer to
being upper triangular, it is reasonable to suppose the qr algorithm will yield good results
more quickly for this upper hessenberg matrix than for the original matrix. this would be
especially true if the matrix is good sized. the other important thing to observe is that,
starting with an upper hessenberg matrix, the algorithm will restrict the size of the blocks
which occur to being 2    2 blocks which are easy to deal with. these blocks allow you to
identify the complex roots.

earlier theorems about markov matrices were presented. these were matrices in which all
the entries were nonnegative and either the columns or the rows added to 1. it turns out
that many of the theorems presented can be generalized to positive matrices. when this is
done, the resulting theory is mainly due to perron and frobenius. i will give an introduction
to this theory here following karlin and taylor [18].

de   nition a.0.1 for a a matrix or vector, the notation, a >> 0 will mean every entry
of a is positive. by a > 0 is meant that every entry is nonnegative and at least one is
positive. by a     0 is meant that every entry is nonnegative. thus the matrix or vector
consisting only of zeros is     0. an expression like a >> b will mean a     b >> 0 with
similar modi   cations for > and    .
for the sake of this section only, de   ne the following for x = (x1,       , xn)t , a vector.

|x|     (|x1| ,       ,|xn|)t .

   

k

||x||

1

   

|xk| .

thus |x| is the vector which results by replacing each entry of x with its absolute value1.
also de   ne for x     cn,

   

lemma a.0.2 let a >> 0 and let x > 0. then ax >> 0.

proof: (ax)i =

j aijxj > 0 because all the aij > 0 and at least one xj > 0.

lemma a.0.3 let a >> 0. de   ne

and let

now de   ne

then

s     {   : ax >   x for some x >> 0} ,

k     {x     0 such that ||x||

1 = 1} .
s1     {   : ax       x for some x     k} .

sup (s) = sup (s1) .

1this notation is just about the most abominable thing imaginable. however, it saves space in the
presentation of this theory of positive matrices and avoids the use of new symbols. please forget about it
when you leave this section.

(1.1)

the following theorem is due to perron.

theorem a.0.4 let a >> 0 be an n    n matrix and let   0 be given in (1.1). then

1.   0 > 0 and there exists x0>> 0 such that ax0 =   0x0 so   0 is an eigenvalue for a.
2. if ax =   x where x   = 0, and      =   0. then |  | <   0.
3. the eigenspace for   0 has dimension 1.
proof: to see   0 > 0, consider the vector, e     (1,       , 1)t . then

and so   0 is at least as large as

(ae)i =

let {  k} be an increasing sequence of numbers from s1 converging to   0. letting xk be
the vector from k which occurs in the de   nition of s1, these vectors are in a compact set.
therefore, there exists a subsequence, still denoted by xk such that xk     x0     k and
  k       0. then passing to the limit,

ax0       0x0, x0 > 0.

if ax0 >   0x0, then letting y     ax0, it follows from lemma a.0.2 that ay >>   0y and
y >> 0. but this contradicts the de   nition of   0 as the supremum of the elements of s
because since ay >>   0y, it follows ay >> (  0 +   ) y for    a small positive number.
therefore, ax0 =   0x0. it remains to verify that x0 >> 0. but this follows immediately
from

   

0 <

aijx0j = (ax0)i =   0x0i.

j

this proves 1.
a|x|     |  ||x| . (see the above abominable de   nition of |x|.)

next suppose ax =   x and x   = 0 and      =   0. then |ax| = |  ||x| . but this implies
case 1: |x|   = x and |x|   =    x.
in this case, a|x| > |ax| = |  ||x| and letting y = a|x| , it follows y >> 0 and
ay >>|  | y which shows ay >> (|  | +   ) y for su   ciently small positive    and veri   es
|  | <   0.

case 2: |x| = x or |x| =    x
in this case, the entries of x are all real and have the same sign. therefore, a|x| =
1 . then ay = |  | y and so |  |     s1 showing that

|ax| = |  ||x| . now let y    |x| /||x||

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation405

|  |       0. but also, the fact the entries of x all have the same sign shows    = |  | and so
       s1. since      =   0, it must be that    = |  | <   0. this proves 2.
it remains to verify 3. suppose then that ay =   0y and for all scalars   ,   x0   = y. then

a re y =   0 re y, a im y =   0 im y.

if re y =   1x0 and im y =   2x0 for real numbers,   i,then y = (  1 + i  2) x0 and it is
assumed this does not happen. therefore, either

t re y   = x0 for all t     r

or

t im y   = x0 for all t     r.

assume the    rst holds. then varying t     r, there exists a value of t such that x0 +t re y > 0
but it is not the case that x0+t re y >> 0. then a (x0 + t re y) >> 0 by lemma a.0.2. but
this implies   0 (x0 + t re y) >> 0 which is a contradiction. hence there exist real numbers,
  1 and   2 such that re y =   1x0 and im y =   2x0 showing that y = (  1 + i  2) x0. this
proves 3.

it is possible to obtain a simple corollary to the above theorem.

corollary a.0.5 if a > 0 and am >> 0 for some m     n, then all the conclusions of the
above theorem hold.

proof: there exists   0 > 0 such that amy0 =   0y0 for y0 >> 0 by theorem a.0.4 and

  0 = sup{   : amx       x for some x     k} .

)
)

let   m

0 =   0. then
(a       0i)

(
and so letting x0     (

am   1 +   0am   2 +        +   m   1
am   1 +   0am   2 +        +   m   1

0

i

y0 = (am       m

0 i) y0 = 0

y0, it follows x0 >> 0 and ax0 =
  0x0.
suppose now that ax =   x for x   = 0 and      =   0. suppose |  |       0. multiplying both
sides by a, it follows amx =   mx and |  m| = |  |m       m
0 =   0 and so from theorem a.0.4,
since |  m|       0, and   m is an eigenvalue of am, it follows that   m =   0. but by theorem
a.0.4 again, this implies x = cy0 for some scalar, c and hence ay0 =   y0. since y0 >> 0,
it follows        0 and so    =   0, a contradiction. therefore, |  | <   0.

i

0

finally, if ax =   0x, then amx =   m

(
am   1 +   0am   2 +        +   m   1

)

0

0 x and so x = cy0 for some scalar, c. consequently,

)

i

x = c

hence

x = cx0

which shows the dimension of the eigenspace for   0 is one. (cid:4)

the following corollary is an extremely interesting convergence result involving the pow-

ers of positive matrices.

corollary a.0.6 let a > 0 and am >> 0 for some m     n. then for   0 given in (1.1),
there exists a rank one matrix p such that limm

positive matrices

proof: considering at , and the fact that a and at have the same eigenvalues, corollary

a.0.5 implies the existence of a vector, v >> 0 such that

also let x0 denote the vector such that ax0 =   0x0 with x0 >> 0. first note that xt
0 v > 0
because both these vectors have all entries positive. therefore, v may be scaled such that

at v =   0v.

for x   = 0, and      = 0. applying p to both sides and using the second formula of (1.3) yields

x =   x

but since p x = 0, it follows from (1.6) that

ax =   0  x

which implies   0   is an eigenvalue of a. therefore, by corollary a.0.5 it follows that either
  0   =   0 in which case    = 1, or   0 |  | <   0 which implies |  | < 1. but if    = 1, then x is

whenever m is large enough. now by (1.5) this yields

whenever m is large enough. it follows

as claimed.

what about the case when a > 0 but maybe it is not the case that a >> 0? as before,

now de   ne

and

k     {x     0 such that ||x||

1 = 1} .
s1     {   : ax       x for some x     k}

  0     sup (s1)

(1.7)

theorem a.0.7 let a > 0 and let   0 be de   ned in (1.7). then there exists x0 > 0 such
that ax0 =   0x0.

proof: let e consist of the matrix which has a one in every entry. then from theorem

a.0.4 it follows there exists x   >> 0 , ||x  ||

1 = 1, such that (a +   e) x   =   0  x   where

  0       sup{   : (a +   e) x       x for some x     k} .

now if    <   

{   : (a +   e) x     (cid:21)x for some x     k}    
{   : (a +   e) x     (cid:21)x for some x     k}

and so   0         0   because   0   is the sup of the second set and   0   is the sup of the    rst. it
follows the limit,   1     lim     0+   0   exists. taking a subsequence and using the compactness
of k, there exists a subsequence, still denoted by    such that as        0, x       x     k.

therefore,

and so, in particular, ax       1x and so   1       0. but also, if          0,

ax =   1x

  x     ax < (a +   e) x

showing that   0          for all such   . but then   0         0 also. hence   1       0, showing these
two numbers are the same. hence ax =   0x. (cid:4)

if am >> 0 for some m and a > 0, it follows that the dimension of the eigenspace for
  0 is one and that the absolute value of every other eigenvalue of a is less than   0. if it is
only assumed that a > 0, not necessarily >> 0, this is no longer true. however, there is
something which is very interesting which can be said. first here is an interesting lemma.

and from the multilinear properties of the determinant and row operations that

the case where m is upper block triangular is similar.
this immediately implies    (m ) =    (a)        (c) .

theorem a.0.9 let a > 0 and let   0 be given in (1.7). if    is an eigenvalue for a such
that |  | =   0, then   /  0 is a root of unity. thus (  /  0)m = 1 for some m     n.

proof: applying theorem a.0.7 to at , there exists v > 0 such that at v =   0v. in
the    rst part of the argument it is assumed v >> 0. now suppose ax =   x, x   = 0 and that
|  | =   0. then
a|x|     |  ||x| =   0 |x|
and it follows that if a|x| > |  ||x| , then since v >> 0,

  0 (v,|x|) < (v,a|x|) =

=   0 (v,|x|) ,

and so, letting r     n,

also, summing (1.9) on j and using that    is an eigenvalue for x, it follows from (1.8) that

from (1.10) and (1.11),    

must have the same argument for every k, j because equality holds in the triangle inequality.
therefore, there exists a complex number,   i such that

the jordan form of a, j is given by (2.7). therefore, you can de   ne f (a) by the series in

k is an mk    mk matrix of the form given in (2.8) where a = s

      

in this case, the jordan canonical form of the matrix is not too hard to    nd.

here is a simple example.

perhaps this isn   t the    rst thing you would think of. of course the ability to get this nice
closed form description of sin (a) was dependent on being able to    nd the jordan form along
with a similarity transformation which will yield the jordan form.

the following corollary is known as the spectral mapping theorem.

corollary b.0.12 let a be an n    n matrix and let    (a) < r where for |  | < r,

      

f (  ) =

an  n.

then f (a) is also an n   n matrix and furthermore,    (f (a)) = f (   (a)) . thus the eigen-
values of f (a) are exactly the numbers f (  ) where    is an eigenvalue of a. furthermore,
the algebraic multiplicity of f (  ) coincides with the algebraic multiplicity of   .

n=0

all of these things can be generalized to linear transformations de   ned on in   nite di-
mensional spaces and when this is done the main tool is the dunford integral along with
the methods of complex analysis. it is good to see it done for    nite dimensional situations
   rst because it gives an idea of what is possible. actually, some of the most interesting
functions in applications do not come in the above form as a power series expanded about
0. one example of this situation has already been encountered in the proof of the right
polar decomposition with the square root of an hermitian transformation which had all
nonnegative eigenvalues. another example is that of taking the positive part of an hermi-
tian matrix. this is important in some physical models where something may depend on
the positive part of the strain which is a symmetric real matrix. obviously there is no way
to consider this as a power series expanded about 0 because the function f (r) = r+ is not
even di   erentiable at 0. therefore, a totally di   erent approach must be considered. first
the notion of a positive part is de   ned.

de   nition b.0.13 let a be an hermitian matrix. thus it su   ces to consider a as an
element of l (fn, fn) according to the usual notion of id127. then there
exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, {u1,       , un} such that

a =

this gives us a nice de   nition of what is meant but it turns out to be very important in
the applications to determine how this function depends on the choice of symmetric matrix
a. the following addresses this question.

equations

c.1 theory of ordinary di   erential equations

here i will present fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems for initial value problems
for the di   erential equation,

   

x

= f (t, x) .

suppose that f : [a, b]    rn     rn satis   es the following two conditions.

|f (t, x)     f (t, x1)|     k |x     x1| ,

f is continuous.

(3.1)

(3.2)

the    rst of these conditions is known as a lipschitz condition.
lemma c.1.1 suppose x : [a, b]     rn is a continuous function and c     [a, b]. then x is a
solution to the initial value problem,
   

x

= f (t, x) , x (c) = x0

(3.3)

if and only if x is a solution to the integral equation,

   

t

x (t) = x0 +

f (s, x (s)) ds.

c

(3.4)

proof:

if x solves (3.4), then since f is continuous, we may apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus to di   erentiate both sides and obtain x
(t) = f (t, x (t)) . also, letting
t = c on both sides, gives x (c) = x0. conversely, if x is a solution of the initial value
problem, we may integrate both sides from c to t to see that x solves (3.4). (cid:4)

   

{
theorem c.1.2 let f satisfy (3.1) and (3.2). then there exists a unique solution to the
initial value problem, (3.3) on the interval [a, b].
e  t |x (t)| : t     [a, b]

. then this norm is equivalent to the usual
norm on bc ([a, b] , fn) described in example 14.6.2. this means that for ||  || the norm given
there, there exist constants    and     such that

for all x    bc ([a, b] , fn) . in fact, you can take        e  a and         e  b in case    > 0 with the
two reversed in case    < 0. thus bc ([a, b] , fn) is a banach space with this norm, ||  ||
  .
then let f : bc ([a, b] , fn)     bc ([a, b] , fn) be de   ned by

    ||x     y|| k|  | .

if |  | is chosen larger than k, this implies f is a contraction mapping on bc ([a, b] , fn) .
therefore, there exists a unique    xed point. with lemma c.1.1 this proves the theorem. (cid:4)

c.2 linear systems
as an example of the above theorem, consider for t     [a, b] the system

   

x

= a (t) x (t) + g (t) , x (c) = x0

(3.5)

g (t) is a vector whose components are continuous functions of t satis   es the conditions

where a (t) is an n    n matrix whose entries are continuous functions of t, (aij (t)) and
of theorem c.1.2 with f (t, x) = a (t) x + g (t) . to see this, let x = (x1,       , xn)t and
x1 = (x11,       x1n)t . then letting m = max{|aij (t)| : t     [a, b] , i, j     n} ,

|f (t, x)     f (t, x1)| = |a (t) (x     x1)|

theorem c.2.1 let a (t) be a continuous n   n matrix and let g (t) be a continuous vector
for t     [a, b] and let c     [a, b] and x0     fn. then there exists a unique solution to (3.5)

now consider the map, p which maps all of rn to d (x0, r) given as follows. for
x     d (x0, r) , p x = x. for x /   d (x0, r) , p x will be the closest point in d (x0, r) to x. such
a closest point exists because d (x0, r) is a closed and bounded set. taking f (y)     |y     x| ,
it follows f is a continuous function de   ned on d (x0, r) which must achieve its minimum

2t re ((x     p x)    (p x     z)) + t2 |z   p x|2     0

and this can only happen if

re ((x     p x)    (p x     z))     0.

therefore,

and so

which implies

re ((x     p x)    (p x   p y))     0
re ((y     p y)    (p y   p x))     0

re (x     p x     (y     p y))    (p x   p y)     0

re (x     y)    (p x     p y)     |p x     p y|2

then using the cauchy schwarz inequality it follows

|x     y|     |p x     p y| .

(cid:4)

with this here is the local existence and uniqueness theorem.

theorem c.3.3 let [a, b] be a closed interval and let u be an open subset of fn. let
f : [a, b]    u     fn be continuous and suppose that for each t     [a, b] , the map x        f
(t, x)
is continuous. also let x0     u and c     [a, b] . then there exists an interval, i     [a, b] such
that c     i and there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem,

   xi

   

x

= f (t, x) , x (c) = x0

(3.6)

valid for t     i.

proof: consider the following picture.

u

x0

d(x0, r)

the large dotted circle represents u and the little solid circle represents d (x0, r) as
indicated. here r is so small that d (x0, r) is contained in u as shown. now let p denote
the projection map de   ned above. consider the initial value problem

   

x

= f (t, p x) , x (c) = x0.

(3.7)

from lemma c.3.1 and the continuity of x        f
that if x, y     d (x0, r) , then |f (t, x)     f (t, y)|     k |x     y| for all t     [a, b] . therefore, by

(t, x) , there exists a constant, k such

   xi

lemma c.3.2

|f (t, p x)     f (t, p y)|     k |p x   p y|     k |x     y| .

it follows from theorem c.1.2 that (3.7) has a unique solution valid for t     [a, b] . since
x is continuous, it follows that there exists an interval, i containing c such that for t     i,

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationc.4. first order linear systems

421

x (t)     d (x0, r) . therefore, for these values of t, f (t, p x) = f (t, x) and so there is a unique
solution to (3.6) on i. (cid:4)

now suppose f has the property that for every r > 0 there exists a constant, kr such

that for all x, x1

    b (0, r),

|f (t, x)     f (t, x1)|     kr |x     x1| .

(3.8)
corollary c.3.4 let f satisfy (3.8) and suppose also that (t, x)     f (t, x) is continuous.
suppose now that x0 is given and there exists an estimate of the form |x (t)| < r for all
t     [0, t ) where t         on the local solution to

   

x

= f (t, x) , x (0) = x0.

(3.9)

then there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem, (3.9) valid on [0, t ).

proof: replace f (t, x) with f (t, p x) where p is the projection onto b (0, r). then by

theorem c.1.2 there exists a unique solution to the system

   
x

= f (t, p x) , x (0) = x0

valid on [0, t1] for every t1 < t. therefore, the above system has a unique solution on [0, t )
and from the estimate, p x = x. (cid:4)

c.4 first order linear systems

here is a discussion of linear systems of the form

   

x

= ax + f (t)

where a is a constant n    n matrix and f is a vector valued function having all entries
continuous. of course the existence theory is a very special case of the general considerations
above but i will give a self contained presentation based on elementary    rst order scalar
di   erential equations and id202.

in the study of di   erential equations, one of the most important theorems is gronwall   s

now multiplying (3.14) by z and observing that
   

   

|z|2

it follows from (3.15) and the observation that z (0) = 0,

and so by gronwall   s inequality, |z (t)|2 = 0 for all t     0. thus,

x (t) = y (t)

now let w (t) = x (a     t)     y (a     t) for t     0. then w

for all t     a.
repeat the argument which was just given to conclude that x (t) = y (t) for all t     a. (cid:4)
de   nition c.4.5 let a be an n    n matrix. we say    (t) is a fundamental matrix for a
if

(t) = (   a) w (t) and you can

   

(t) = a   (t) ,    (0) = i,

(3.16)

and    (t)

   1 exists for all t     r.

why should anyone care about a fundamental matrix? the reason is that such a matrix
valued function makes possible a convenient description of the solution of the initial value
problem,

= ax + f (t) , x (0) = x0,

(3.17)

on the interval, [0, t ] . first consider the special case where n = 1. this is the    rst order
linear di   erential equation,

where g is a continuous scalar valued function. first consider the case where g = 0.

lemma c.4.6 there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem,

and the solution for    = a + ib is given by

r (t) = eat (cos bt + i sin bt) .

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

this solution to the initial value problem is denoted as e  t. (if    is real, e  t as de   ned here
reduces to the usual exponential function so there is no contradiction between this and earlier
notation seen in calculus.)

applications to differential equations

proof: from the uniqueness theorem presented above, theorem c.4.4, applied to the
case where n = 1, there can be no more than one solution to the initial value problem,
(3.19). therefore, it only remains to verify (3.20) is a solution to (3.19). however, this is
an easy calculus exercise. (cid:4)

note the di   erential equation in (3.19) says

with this lemma, it becomes possible to easily solve the case in which g   = 0.

     sg (s) ds = r0
it only remains to verify that (3.22) is a solution. but r (0) = e  0r0 +
and so the initial condition is satis   ed. next di   erentiate this expression to verify the
di   erential equation is also satis   ed. using (3.21), the product rule and the fundamental

now consider the question of    nding a fundamental matrix for a. when this is done, it
will be easy to give a formula for the general solution to (3.17) known as the variation of

the next theorem gives a formula for the fundamental matrix (3.16). it is known as

and so (3.24) reduces to

rk+1 (t) pk (a) = a   (t) .

this shows

n   1   

   (0) =

rk+1 (0) pk (a) = r1 (0) p0 = i.

it remains to verify that if (3.23) holds, then    (t)

v   = 0 and suppose for some t0,    (t0) v = 0. let x (t)        (t0 + t) v. then

   1 exists for all t. to do so, consider

   

x

(t) = a   (t0 + t) v = ax (t) , x (0) =    (t0) v = 0.

but also z (t)     0 also satis   es

   
z

(t) = az (t) , z (0) = 0,

and so by the theorem on uniqueness, it must be the case that z (t) = x (t) for all t, showing

that    (t + t0) v = 0 for all t, and in particular for t =    t0. therefore,

   (   t0 + t0) v = iv = 0

and so v = 0, a contradiction. it follows that    (t) must be one to one for all t and so,
   (t)

   1 exists for all t.
it only remains to verify the solution to (3.23) is unique. suppose    is another funda-

mental matrix solving (3.23). then letting v be an arbitrary vector,

z (t)        (t) v, y (t)        (t) v

both solve the initial value problem,

   

x

= ax, x (0) = v,

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation426

applications to differential equations

and so by the uniqueness theorem, z (t) = y (t) for all t showing that    (t) v =    (t) v for
all t. since v is arbitrary, this shows that    (t) =    (t) for every t. (cid:4)

it is useful to consider the di   erential equations for the rk for k     1. as noted above,

r0 (t) = 0 and r1 (t) = e  1t.

sometimes people de   ne a fundamental matrix to be a matrix    (t) such that   

assuming   1   =   2.
(t) =
a   (t) and det (   (t))   = 0 for all t. thus this avoids the initial condition,    (0) = i. the
next proposition has to do with this situation.
proposition c.4.9 suppose a is an n   n matrix and suppose    (t) is an n   n matrix for
each t     r with the property that

   

   
  

(t) = a   (t) .

(3.25)

then either    (t)

   1 exists for all t     r or    (t)

   1 fails to exist for all t     r.

proof: suppose    (0)

   1 exists and (3.25) holds. let    (t)        (t)    (0)

   1 . then    (0) =

i and

   

   

  

(t) =   

(t)    (0)

   1 = a   (t)    (0)

   1 = a   (t)

next suppose    (0)

so by theorem c.4.8,    (t)

   1 exists for all t. therefore,    (t)
   1 does not exist. i need to show    (t)
   1 does exist. then let   (t)        (t0 + t)    (t0)

   1 also exists for all t.
   1 does not exist for any t.
   1 . then    (0) =
   1 exists for all t and so for all

= a   so by theorem c.4.8 it follows    (t)

   1 must also exist, even for t =    t0 which implies    (0)

   1 exists after all. (cid:4)

   

suppose then that    (t0)
i and   
t,    (t + t0)

the conclusion of this proposition is usually referred to as the wronskian alternative and
another way to say it is that if (3.25) holds, then either det (   (t)) = 0 for all t or det (   (t))
is never equal to 0. the wronskian is the usual name of the function, t     det (   (t)).

the following theorem gives the variation of constants formula,.

theorem c.4.10 let f be continuous on [0, t ] and let a be an n    n matrix and x0 a

proof: from the uniqueness theorem there is at most one solution to (3.17). therefore,
if (3.26) solves (3.17), the theorem is proved. the veri   cation that the given formula works
is identical with the veri   cation that the scalar formula given in theorem c.4.7 solves the
   1 is continuous because of the formula for the inverse
initial value problem given there.    (s)
of a matrix in terms of the transpose of the cofactor matrix. therefore, the integrand in
(3.26) is continuous and the fundamental theorem of calculus applies. to verify the formula
for the inverse,    x s and consider x (t) =    (s + t) v, and y (t) =    (t)    (s) v. then

   
x
   

(t) = a   (t + s) v = ax (t) , x (0) =    (s) v

y

(t) = a   (t)    (s) v = ay (t) , y (0) =    (s) v.

by the uniqueness theorem, x (t) = y (t) for all t. since s and v are arbitrary, this shows
   (t + s) =    (t)    (s) for all t, s. letting s =    t and using    (0) = i veri   es    (t)
   1 =
   (   t) .
next, note that this also implies    (t     s)    (s) =    (t) and so    (t     s) =    (t)    (s)
   1 .
therefore, this yields (3.27) and then (3.28)follows from changing the variable. (cid:4)

theorem c.4.10 is general enough to include all constant coe   cient linear di   erential
equations or any order. thus it includes as a special case the main topics of an entire
elementary di   erential equations class. this is illustrated in the following example. one
can reduce an arbitrary linear di   erential equation to a    rst order system and then apply the
above theory to solve the problem. the next example is a di   erential equation of damped
vibration.

c.5 geometric theory of autonomous systems

here a su   cient condition is given for stability of a    rst order system. first of all, here is
a fundamental estimate for the entries of a fundamental matrix.

lemma c.5.1 let the functions, rk be given in the statement of theorem c.4.8 and sup-
pose that a is an n    n matrix whose eigenvalues are {  1,       ,   n} . suppose that these

eigenvalues are ordered such that

re (  1)     re (  2)                re (  n) < 0.

then if 0 >       > re (  n) is given, there exists a constant, c such that for each k =
0, 1,       , n,

|rk (t)|     ce

     t

(3.29)

for all t > 0.

proof: this is obvious for r0 (t) because it is identically equal to 0. from the de   nition

   
1 =   1r1, r1 (0) = 1 and so r1 (t) = e  1t which implies

of the rk, r

|r1 (t)|     ere(  1)t.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationc.5. geometric theory of autonomous systems

429

suppose for some m     1 there exists a constant, cm such that

|rk (t)|     cmtmere(  m)t

for all k     m for all t > 0. then

   
r
m+1 (t) =   m+1rm+1 (t) + rm (t) , rm+1 (0) = 0

and so

rm+1 (t) = e  m+1t

t

     m+1srm (s) ds.

e

then by the induction hypothesis,

|rm+1 (t)|     ere(  m+1)t
    ere(  m+1)t
    ere(  m+1)t

it follows by induction there exists a constant, c such that for all k     n,

|rk (t)|     ctnere(  n)t

and this obviously implies the conclusion of the lemma.

the proof of the above lemma yields the following corollary.

corollary c.5.2 let the functions, rk be given in the statement of theorem c.4.8 and
suppose that a is an n    n matrix whose eigenvalues are {  1,       ,   n} . suppose that these

eigenvalues are ordered such that

re (  1)     re (  2)                re (  n) .

then there exists a constant c such that for all k     m
|rk (t)|     ctmere(  m)t.

with the lemma, the following sloppy estimate is available for a fundamental matrix.
theorem c.5.3 let a be an n    n matrix and let    (t) be the fundamental matrix for a.
that is,

   
  

(t) = a   (t) ,    (0) = i.

suppose also the eigenvalues of a are {  1,       ,   n} where these eigenvalues are ordered such

that

re (  1)     re (  2)                re (  n) < 0.

then if 0 >       > re (  n) , is given, there exists a constant, c such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)   (t)ij

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)     ce

for all t > 0. also

then from putzer   s formula for    (t) and lemma c.5.1, there exists a constant, c such that

this proves (3.30) and completes the proof.
de   nition c.5.4 let f : u     rn where u is an open subset of rn such that a     u and
f (a) = 0. a point, a where f (a) = 0 is called an equilibrium point. then a is asymptotically
stable if for any    > 0 there exists r > 0 such that whenever |x0     a| < r and x (t) the

solution to the initial value problem,
   
x

= f (x) , x (0) = x0,

it follows

t       x (t) = a, |x (t)     a| <   

lim

   
a di   erential equation of the form x
tonomous equation of the form x

   

= f (x) is called autonomous as opposed to a nonau-
= f (t, x) . the equilibrium point a is stable if for every

   > 0 there exists    > 0 such that if |x0     a| <   , then if x is the solution of

   
x

= f (x) , x (0) = x0,

(3.31)

then |x (t)     a| <    for all t > 0.

obviously asymptotic stability implies stability.
an ordinary di   erential equation is called almost linear if it is of the form

where a is an n    n matrix and

   
x

= ax + g (x)

lim
x   0

g (x)
|x| = 0.

now the stability of an equilibrium point of an autonomous system, x

= f (x) can
always be reduced to the consideration of the stability of 0 for an almost linear system.
here is why.
= f (x) , you could
de   ne a new variable, y by a + y = x. then asymptotic stability would involve |y (t)| <   
and limt       y (t) = 0 while stability would only require |y (t)| <   . then since a is an

if you are considering the equilibrium point, a for x

   

   

equilibrium point, y solves the following initial value problem.

   

y

= f (a + y)     f (a) , y (0) = y0,

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationc.5. geometric theory of autonomous systems

431

where y0 = x0     a.

let a = df (a) . then from the de   nition of the derivative of a function,

   

y

= ay + g (y) , y (0) = y0

(3.32)

where

lim
y   0

g (y)
|y| = 0.

thus there is never any loss of generality in considering only the equilibrium point 0 for an
almost linear system.1 therefore, from now on i will only consider the case of almost linear
systems and the equilibrium point 0.

theorem c.5.5 consider the almost linear system of equations,

where

   
x

= ax + g (x)

lim
x   0

g (x)
|x| = 0

(3.33)

and g is a c 1 function. suppose that for all    an eigenvalue of a, re    < 0. then 0 is
asymptotically stable.

proof: by theorem c.5.3 there exist constants    > 0 and k such that for    (t) the

fundamental matrix for a,

|   (t) x|     ke

     t |x| .

let    > 0 be given and let r be small enough that kr <    and for |x| < (k + 1) r,|g (x)| <
   |x| where    is so small that k   <   , and let |y0| < r. then by the variation of constants

formula, the solution to (3.33), at least for small t satis   es

the following estimate holds.

e  t |y (t)| < krek  t

|y (t)| < kre(k       )t <   e(k       )t

therefore, |y (t)| < kr <    for all t and so from corollary c.3.4, the solution to (3.33)
exists for all t     0 and since k          < 0,

t      |y (t)| = 0.(cid:4)

lim

1this is no longer true when you study partial di   erential equations as ordinary di   erential equations in

c.6 general geometric theory

here i will consider the case where the matrix a has both positive and negative eigenvalues.
first here is a useful lemma.
lemma c.6.1 suppose a is an n    n matrix and there exists    > 0 such that

0 <    < re (  1)                re (  n)

where {  1,       ,   n} are the eigenvalues of a, with possibly some repeated. then there exists

a constant, c such that for all t < 0,

|   (t) x|     ce  t |x|

proof: i want an estimate on the solutions to the system

   
  

(t) = a   (t) ,    (0) = i.

for t < 0. let s =    t and let    (s) =    (t) . then writing this in terms of   ,

   

(s) =    a   (s) ,    (0) = i.

  

now the eigenvalues of    a have real parts less than       because these eigenvalues are
obtained from the eigenvalues of a by multiplying by    1. then by theorem c.5.3 there
exists a constant, c such that for any x,

|   (s) x|     ce

     s |x| .

therefore, from the de   nition of   ,

|   (t) x|     ce  t |x| .(cid:4)

here is another essential lemma which is found in coddington and levinson [6]

lemma c.6.2 let pj (t) be polynomials with complex coe   cients and let

m   

f (t) =

j=1

pj (t) e  j t

where m     1,   j   =   k for j   = k, and none of the pj (t) vanish identically. let

   = max (re (  1) ,       , re (  m)) .

then there exists a positive number, r and arbitrarily large positive values of t such that

in particular, |f (t)| is unbounded.

     t |f (t)| > r.

e

proof: suppose the largest exponent of any of the pj is m and let   j = aj + ibj. first
assume each aj = 0. this is convenient because    = 0 in this case and the largest of the
re (  j) occurs in every   j.

then arranging the above sum as a sum of decreasing powers of t,

f (t) = tm fm (t) +        + tf1 (t) + f0 (t) .

next consider the general case in which    is given above. thus

for arbitrarily large values of t. (cid:4)

next here is a banach space which will be useful.

lemma c.6.3 for    > 0, let

{
x     bc ([0,   ), fn) : t     e  tx (t) is also in bc ([0,   ), fn)

}

e   =

    sup

then e   is a banach space.

{(cid:12)(cid:12)e  tx (t)

(cid:12)(cid:12) : t     [0,   )

}

proof: let {xk} be a cauchy sequence in e  . then since bc ([0,   ), fn) is a banach
space, there exists y     bc ([0,   ), fn) such that e  txk (t) converges uniformly on [0,   ) to

y (t). therefore e

)

(3.34)

where a    and a+ are square matrices of size k    k and (n     k)   (n     k) respectively. also
assume a    has eigenvalues whose real parts are all less than       while a+ has eigenvalues
whose real parts are all larger than   . assume also that each of a    and a+ is upper
triangular.

also, i will use the following convention. for v     fn,

(

)

v =

v   
v+

where v    consists of the    rst k entries of v.

then from theorem c.5.3 and lemma c.6.1 the following lemma is obtained.

lemma c.7.1 let a be of the form given in (3.34) as explained above and let   + (t) and
      (t) be the fundamental matrices corresponding to a+ and a    respectively. then there
exist positive constants,    and    such that

|  + (t) y|     ce  t for all t < 0

also for any nonzero x     cn   k,

|      (t) y|     ce

   (  +  )t for all t > 0.

|  + (t) x| is unbounded.

(3.35)

(3.36)

(3.37)

proof: the    rst two claims have been established already. it su   ces to pick    and   
such that     (   +   ) is larger than all eigenvalues of a    and    is smaller than all eigenvalues
of a+. it remains to verify (3.37). from the putzer formula for   + (t) ,

n   1   

  + (t) x =

rk+1 (t) pk (a) x

where p0 (a)     i. now each rk is a polynomial (possibly a constant) times an exponential.
this follows easily from the de   nition of the rk as solutions of the di   erential equations

k=0

   
k+1 =   k+1rk+1 + rk.

r

now by assumption the eigenvalues have positive real parts so

       max (re (  1) ,       , re (  n   k)) > 0.

it can also be assumed

re (  1)                re (  n   k)

by lemma c.6.2 it follows |  + (t) x| is unbounded. this follows because

n   1   

  + (t) x = r1 (t) x +

k=1

rk+1 (t) yk, r1 (t) = e  1t.

since x   = 0, it has a nonzero entry, say xm   = 0. consider the mth entry of the vector
  + (t) x. by this lemma the mth entry is unbounded and this is all it takes for x (t) to be
unbounded. (cid:4)

theorem c.7.3 consider the initial value problem for the almost linear system

   

x

in which g is c 1 and where at there are k < n eigenvalues of a which have negative real
parts and n     k eigenvalues of a which have positive real parts. then 0 is not stable. more
precisely, there exists a set of points (a,   (a)) for a small and in a k dimensional subspace
such that for x0 on this set,

and for x0 not on this set, there exists a    > 0 such that |x (t, x0)| cannot remain less than

d.0.1 the nested interval lemma

first, here is the one dimensional nested interval lemma.

lemma d.0.4 let ik = [ak, bk] be closed intervals, ak     bk, such that ik     ik+1 for all k.
then there exists a point c which is contained in all these intervals. if limk       (bk     ak) = 0,

then there is exactly one such point.

proof: note that the {ak} are an increasing sequence and that {bk} is a decreasing

sequence. now note that if m < n, then

am     an     bn

while if m > n,

bn     bm     am.

it follows that am     bn for any pair m, n. therefore, each bn is an upper bound for all the
am and so if c     sup{ak}, then for each n, it follows that c     bn and so for all, an     c     bn

which shows that c is in all of these intervals.

   
if the condition on the lengths of the intervals holds, then if c, c

are in all the intervals,
then if they are not equal, then eventually, for large enough k, they cannot both be contained
   |. this would be a contradiction. hence c = c
   
.

thus diam (s) is just a careful description of what you would think of as the diameter.

it measures how stretched out the set is.

here is a multidimensional version of the nested interval lemma.

compactness and completeness

d.0.2 convergent sequences, sequential compactness
a mapping f : {k, k + 1, k + 2,      }    rp is called a sequence. we usually write it in the
form {aj} where it is understood that aj     f (j).
de   nition d.0.7 a sequence, {ak} is said to converge to a if for every    > 0 there exists
n   such that if n > n  , then |a     an| <   . the usual notation for this is limn       an = a
although it is often written as an     a. a closed set k     rn is one which has the property
that if {kj}   

j=1 is a sequence of points of k which converges to x, then x     k.

one can also de   ne a subsequence.

de   nition d.0.8 {ank

} is a subsequence of {an} if n1 < n2 <        .

the following theorem says the limit, if it exists, is unique.

theorem d.0.9 if a sequence, {an} converges to a and to b then a = b.

proof: there exists n   such that if n > n   then |an     a| <   

|an     b| <   

2 . then pick such an n.

since    is arbitrary, this proves the theorem. (cid:4)

whenever n, m     n  , if follows that |an   am| <   .

a sequence is cauchy, means the terms are    bunching up to each other    as m, n get

large.

that for all n, |an| < m for some m <    .

proof: let    = 1 in the de   nition of a cauchy sequence and let n > n1. then from the

converges.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationthe fundamental theorem of
algebra

the fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non constant polynomial having
coe   cients in c has a zero in c.
if c is replaced by r, this is not true because of the
example, x2 + 1 = 0. this theorem is a very remarkable result and notwithstanding its title,
all the best proofs of it depend on either analysis or topology. it was proved by gauss in
1797 then proved with no loose ends by argand in 1806 although others also worked on
it. the proof given here follows rudin [22]. see also hardy [12] for another proof, more
discussion and references. recall de moivre   s theorem on page 17 which is listed below for
convenience.

theorem e.0.17 let r > 0 be given. then if n is a positive integer,

[r (cos t + i sin t)]n = rn (cos nt + i sin nt) .

now from this theorem, the following corollary on page 1.5.5 is obtained.

corollary e.0.18 let z be a non zero complex number and let k be a positive integer. then
there are always exactly k kth roots of z in c.

lemma e.0.19 let ak     c for k = 1,       , n and let p (z)       

n
k=1 akzk. then p is contin-

uous.

proof:

|azn     awn|     |a||z     w|(cid:12)(cid:12)zn   1 + zn   2w +        + wn   1

(cid:12)(cid:12) .

then for |z     w| < 1, the triangle inequality implies |w| < 1 + |z| and so if |z     w| < 1,

if    > 0 is given, let

|azn     awn|     |a||z     w| n (1 + |z|)n .

(

)

   < min

1,

  

|a| n (1 + |z|)n

.

it follows from the above inequality that for |z     w| <   , |azn     awn| <   . the function of
the lemma is just the sum of functions of this sort and so it follows that it is also continuous.

theorem e.0.20 (fundamental theorem of algebra) let p (z) be a nonconstant polynomial.
then there exists z     c such that p (z) = 0.

p (z) =

n   
|p (z)|     |an||z|n     n   1   

k=0

akzk

|ak||z|k

proof: suppose not. then

where an   = 0, n > 0. then

and so

now let

k=0

|p (z)| =    .

lim|z|      

(5.1)

       inf {|p (z)| : z     c} .

by (5.1), there exists an r > 0 such that if |z| > r, it follows that |p (z)| >    + 1. therefore,

       inf {|p (z)| : z     c} = inf {|p (z)| : |z|     r} .

the set {z : |z|     r} is a closed and bounded set and so this in   mum is achieved at some
point w with |w|     r. a contradiction is obtained if |p (w)| = 0 so assume |p (w)| > 0. then
consider

q (z)     p (z + w)
p (w)

.

it follows q (z) is of the form

q (z) = 1 + ckzk +        + cnzn

where ck   = 0, because q (0) = 1. it is also true that |q (z)|     1 by the assumption that
|p (w)| is the smallest value of |p (z)| . now let        c be a complex number with |  | = 1 and

if

w   = 0,    =

  ckwk =    |w|k |ck| .

   (cid:12)(cid:12)wk

(cid:12)(cid:12)|ck|

wkck

and if w = 0,    = 1 will work. now let   k =    and let t be a small positive number.

q (t  w)     1     tk |w|k |ck| +        + cntn (  w)n

which is of the form

1     tk |w|k |ck| + tk (g (t, w))

where limt   0 g (t, w) = 0. letting t be small enough,

|g (t, w)| < |w|k |ck| /2

and so for such t,

|q (t  w)| < 1     tk |w|k |ck| + tk |w|k |ck| /2 < 1,

a contradiction to |q (z)|     1. (cid:4)

f.1 the symmetric polynomial theorem

first here is a de   nition of polynomials in many variables which have coe   cients in a
commutative ring. a commutative ring would be a    eld except you don   t know that every
nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. if you like, let these coe   cients be in a    eld
it is still interesting. a good example of a commutative ring is the integers. in particular,
every    eld is a commutative ring.

de   nition f.1.1 let k     (k1, k2,       , kn) where each ki is a nonnegative integer. let

polynomials of degree p in the variables x1, x2,       , xn are expressions of the form

g (x1, x2,       , xn) =

akxk1
1

       xkn

n

where each ak is in a commutative ring. if all ak = 0, the polynomial has no degree. such
a polynomial is said to be symmetric if whenever    is a permutation of {1, 2,       , n},

(
x  (1), x  (2),       , x  (n)

)

g

= g (x1, x2,       , xn)

an example of a symmetric polynomial is

s1 (x1, x2,       , xn)     n   

xi

i=1

another one is

sn (x1, x2,       , xn)     x1x2        xn

de   nition f.1.2 the elementary symmetric polynomial sk (x1, x2,       , xn) , k = 1,       , n
is the coe   cient of (   1)k xn   k in the following polynomial.
(x     x1) (x     x2)       (x     xn)

= xn     s1xn   1 + s2xn   2               sn

thus

   

s1 = x1 + x2 +        + xn

then the following result is the fundamental theorem in the subject. it is the symmetric
polynomial theorem. it says that these elementary symmetric polynomials are a lot like a
basis for the symmetric polynomials.

theorem f.1.3 let g (x1, x2,       , xn) be a symmetric polynomial. then g (x1, x2,       , xn)

equals a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions.

g (x1, x2,       , xn) =

       skn

n

and the ak are unique.

k

proof: if n = 1, it is obviously true because s1 = x1. suppose the theorem is true for

n     1 and g (x1, x2,       , xn) has degree d. let

   

g

(x1, x2,       , xn   1)     g (x1, x2,       , xn   1, 0)

by induction, there are unique ak such that

where s
note that

sk (x1, x2,       , xn   1, 0) = s
k (x1, x2,       , xn   1)
   

now consider

g (x1, x2,       , xn)    

aksk1

       skn   1
n   1

    q (x1, x2,       , xn)

k

is a symmetric polynomial and it equals 0 when xn equals 0. since it is symmetric, it is also
0 whenever xi = 0. therefore,

q (x1, x2,       , xn) = snh (x1, x2,       , xn)

and it follows that h (x1, x2,       , xn) is symmetric of degree no more than d     n and is
uniquely determined. thus, if g (x1, x2,       , xn) is symmetric of degree d,
n   1 + snh (x1, x2,       , xn)

g (x1, x2,       , xn) =

       skn   1

where h has degree no more than d    n. now apply the same argument to h (x1, x2,       , xn)
and continue, repeatedly obtaining a sequence of symmetric polynomials hi, of strictly de-
creasing degree, obtaining expressions of the form
       skn   1

n + snhm (x1, x2,       , xn)

g (x1, x2,       , xn) =

eventually hm must be a constant or zero. by induction, each step in the argument yields
uniqueness and so, the    nal sum of combinations of elementary symmetric functions is
uniquely determined. (cid:4)

here is a very interesting result which i saw claimed in a paper by steinberg and redhe   er

on lindemannn   s theorem which follows from the above corollary.

theorem f.1.4 let   1,       ,   n be roots of the polynomial equation

anxn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0 = 0

having integer coe   cients is also an integer. also any symmetric polynomial in the quanti-

where each ai is an integer. then any symmetric polynomial in the quantities an  1,       , an  n
ties   1,       ,   n having rational coe   cients is a rational number.
proof: let f (x1,       , xn) be the symmetric polynomial. thus

f (x1,       , xn)     z [x1        xn]

from corollary f.1.3 it follows there are integers ak1      kn such that

n (an  1,       , an  n)

and so the coe   cient of xn   k is pk (  1,       ,   n) an = an   k. also
pk (an  1,       , an  n) = ak
npk (  1,       ,   n) = ak

which is an integer. to see the last claim follows from this, take the symmetric polynomial

in   1,       ,   n and multiply by the product of the denominators of the rational coe   cients
to get one which has integer coe   cients. then by the    rst part, each homogeneous term is
just an integer divided by an raised to some power. (cid:4)

f.2 the fundamental theorem of algebra

this is devoted to a mostly algebraic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
it
depends on the interesting results about symmetric polynomials which are presented above.
i found it on the wikipedia article about the fundamental theorem of algebra. you google

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation448

fields and field extensions

   fundamental theorem of algebra    and go to the wikipedia article. it gives several other
proofs in addition to this one. according to this article, the    rst completely correct proof
of this major theorem is due to argand in 1806. gauss and others did it earlier but their
arguments had gaps in them.

you can   t completely escape analysis when you prove this theorem. the necessary anal-

ysis is in the following lemma.

lemma f.2.1 suppose p (x) = xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0 where n is odd and the

coe   cients are real. then p (x) has a real root.

proof: this follows from the intermediate value theorem from calculus.
next is an algebraic consideration. first recall some notation.

m   

ai     a1a2        am

i=1

recall a polynomial in {z1,       , zn} is symmetric only if it can be written as a sum of

elementary symmetric polynomials raised to various powers multiplied by constants. this
follows from proposition f.1.3 or theorem f.1.3 both of which are the theorem on symmetric
polynomials.

the following is the main part of the theorem. in fact this is one version of the funda-

mental theorem of algebra which people studied earlier in the 1700   s.

lemma f.2.2 let p (x) = xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with real coef-

   cients. then it has a complex root.

proof: it is possible to write

n = 2km

where m is odd. if n is odd, k = 0. if n is even, keep dividing by 2 until you are left with
an odd number. if k = 0 so that n is odd, it follows from lemma f.2.1 that p (x) has a
real, hence complex root. the proof will be by induction on k, the case k = 0 being done.
suppose then that it works for n = 2lm where m is odd and l     k     1 and let n = 2km
where m is odd. let {z1,       , zn} be the roots of the polynomial in a splitting    eld, the

existence of this    eld being given by the above proposition. then

n   

n   

p (x) =

(x     zj) =

(   1)k pkxk

where pk is the kth elementary symmetric polynomial. note this shows

j=1

k=0

an   k = pk (   1)k .

(6.1)

(6.2)

there is another polynomial which has coe   cients which are sums of real numbers times

the pk raised to various powers and it is

qt (x)    

(x     (zi + zj + tzizj)) , t     r

   

1   i<j   n

i need to verify this is really the case for qt (x). when you switch any two of the zi in qt (x)
the polynomial does not change. for example, let n = 3 when qt (x) is

(x     (z1 + z2 + tz1z2)) (x     (z1 + z3 + tz1z3)) (x     (z2 + z3 + tz2z3))

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationf.2. the fundamental theorem of algebra

449

and you can observe the assertion about the polynomial is true when you switch two dif-
ferent zi. thus the coe   cients of qt (x) must be symmetric polynomials in the zi with real
coe   cients. hence by proposition f.1.3 these coe   cients are real polynomials in terms of
the elementary symmetric polynomials pk. thus by (6.2) the coe   cients of qt (x) are real
polynomials in terms of the ak of the original polynomial. recall these were all real. it
follows, and this is what was wanted, that qt (x) has all real coe   cients.

(

)

because there are this number of ways to pick

note that the degree of qt (x) is

i < j out of {1,       , n}. now(

n

n

(

)

n (n     1)

= 2k   1m

2km     1

2
= 2k   1 (odd)

and so by induction, for each t     r, qt (x) has a complex root.

there must exist s   = t such that for a single pair of indices i, j, with i < j,

(zi + zj + tzizj) , (zi + zj + szizj)

are both complex. here is why. let a (i, j) denote those t     r such that (zi + zj + tzizj) is
complex. it was just shown that every t     r must be in some a (i, j). there are in   nitely
many t     r and so some a (i, j) contains two of them.

now for that t, s,

where t   = s and so by cramer   s rule,

and also

zi + zj =

zi + zj + tzizj = a
zi + zj + szizj = b

at this point, note that zi, zj are both solutions to the equation

x2     (z1 + z2) x + z1z2 = 0,

which from the above has complex coe   cients. by the quadratic formula the zi, zj are both
complex. thus the original polynomial has a complex root. (cid:4)

with this lemma, it is easy to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra. the di   erence
between the lemma and this theorem is that in the theorem, the coe   cients are only assumed
to be complex. what this means is that if you have any polynomial with complex coe   cients
it has a complex root and so it is not irreducible. hence the    eld extension is the same    eld.
another way to say this is that for every complex polynomial there exists a factorization
into linear factors or in other words a splitting    eld for a complex polynomial is the    eld of
complex numbers.

theorem f.2.3 let p (x)     anxn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0 be any complex polynomial,
n     1, an   = 0. then it has a complex root. furthermore, there exist complex numbers
z1,       , zn such that

n   

p (x) = an

k=1

(x     zk)

proof: first suppose an = 1. consider the polynomial

this is a polynomial and it has real coe   cients. this is because it equals

q (x)     p (x) p (x)

(
(

xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0
xn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0

)   
)

the xj+k term of the above product is of the form

akxkajxj + akxkajxj = xk+j (akaj + akaj)

and

akaj + akaj = akaj + akaj

so it is of the form of a complex number added to its conjugate. hence q (x) has real
coe   cients as claimed. therefore, by by lemma f.2.2 it has a complex root z. hence either
p (z) = 0 or p (z) = 0. thus p (x) has a complex root.

next suppose an   = 0. then simply divide by it and get a polynomial in which an = 1.

denote this modi   ed polynomial as q (x). then by what was just shown and the euclidean

algorithm, there exists z1     c such that

q (x) = (x     z1) q1 (x)

where q1 (x) has complex coe   cients. now do the same thing for q1 (x) to obtain

q (x) = (x     z1) (x     z2) q2 (x)

and continue this way. thus

p (x)
an

=

(x     zj) (cid:4)

obviously this is a harder proof than the other proof of the fundamental theorem of
algebra presented earlier. however, this is a better proof. consider the algebraic num-
bers a consisting of the real numbers which are roots of some polynomial having rational
coe   cients. by theorem 8.3.32 they are a    eld. now consider the    eld a + ia with the
usual conventions for complex arithmetic. you could repeat the above argument with small
changes and conclude that every polynomial having coe   cients in a + ia has a root in
a + ia. recall from problem 41 on page 223 that a is countable and so this is also the case
for a + ia. thus this gives an algebraically complete    eld which is countable and so very
di   erent than c. of course there are other situations in which the above harder proof will
work and yield interesting results.

f.3 transcendental numbers

most numbers are like this. here the algebraic numbers are those which are roots of a
polynomial equation having rational numbers as coe   cients. by the fundamental theorem
of calculus, all these numbers are in c. there are only countably many of these algebraic
numbers, (problem 41 on page 223). therefore, most numbers are transcendental. never-
theless, it is very hard to prove that this or that number is transcendental. probably the
most famous theorem about this is the lindemannn weierstrass theorem.

algebraic numbers. then

it follows that for j < p    1, f (j) (0) = 0. this is because of that term xp   1. if j     p, f (j) (0)
is an integer multiple of p. here is why. the terms in this derivative which are nonzero
involve taking p     1 derivatives of xp   1 and this introduces a (p     1)! which cancels out the
denominator. then there are some other derivatives of the product of the (x       i) raised
to the power p. by the chain rule, these all involve a multiple of p. thus this jth derivative
is of the form

pg (x, v  1,       , v  m) ,

(6.8)

where g (x, v  1,       , v  m) is a polynomial in x with coe   cients which are symmetric poly-
nomials in {v  1,       , v  m
} having integer coe   cients. then derivatives of g with respect
to x also yield polynomials in x which have coe   cients which are symmetric polynomials
in {v  1,       , v  m
} having integer coe   cients. evaluating g at x = 0 must therefore yield
a polynomial which is symmetric in the {v  1,       , v  m
} with integer coe   cients. since the
} are the roots of a polynomial having integer coe   cients with leading coe   -
{  1,       ,   m
cient v, it follows from theorem f.1.4 that this last polynomial is an integer and so the
jth derivative of f given by (6.8) when evaluated at x = 0 yields an integer times p. now
consider the case of the (p     1) derivative of f . the only nonzero term of f (j) (0) is the one
which comes from taking p     1 derivatives of xp   1 and so it reduces to

now q (0) = v (   1)m (  1  2

vmp (   1)mp (  1  2

         m)p

         m) = u and so vp (   1)mp (  1  2
f (p   1) (0) = vmpupv
   p = vp(m   1)up

         m)p = up which yields

note this is not necessarily a multiple of p and in fact will not be so if p > u, v because p is
a prime number. it follows

n   

f (j) (0) = vp(m   1)up + m (p) p

where m (p) is some integer.

j=0

now consider the other sum in (6.6),

m   

n   

c

i=1

j=0

f (j) (  i)

using the formula in (6.7) it follows that for j < p, f (j) (  i) = 0. this is because for such
derivatives, each term will have that product of the (x       i) in it. next consider the case
where j     p.
expression

in this case, the nonzero terms must involve at least p derivatives of the

((x       1) (x       2)       (x       m))p

since otherwise, when evaluated at any   k the result would be 0. hence the (p     1)! will
vanish from the denominator and so all coe   cients of the polynomials in the   j and x will
be integers and in fact, there will be an extra factor of p left over. thus the jth derivatives
for j     p involve taking the kth derivative, k     0 with respect to x of

pvmpg (x,   1,       ,   m)

where g (x,   1,       ,   m) is a polynomial in x having coe   cients which are integers times
symmetric polynomials in the {  1,       ,   m
} . it follows that the kth derivative for k     0

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation454

fields and field extensions

is also a polynomial in x having the same properties. therefore, taking the kth derivative
where k corresponds to j     p and adding, yields

divided by v, the integers being the coe   cients of q (x). therefore, from (6.9)

which is pvmp times an expression which consists of integers times products of coe   cients

mp. therefore, it reduces to an integer multiple of p and so the same is true of

since p is prime, it follows it cannot divide kvp(m   1)up and so the last two terms must sum
to a nonzero integer and so the equation cannot hold unless

note this shows    is irrational. if    = k/m where k, m are integers, then both i   and

   i   are roots of the polynomial with integer coe   cients,

which would require from what was just shown that
0   = 2 + ei   + e

which is not the case since the sum on the right equals 0.

the following corollary follows from this.

where i is an integer. picking prime p > max (u, k) it follows    ku p + ip is a nonzero
integer and this contradicts the left side being a small number less than 1 in absolute value.

next is an even more interesting lemma which follows from the above corollary.

lemma f.3.4 if b0, b1,       , bn are non zero integers, and   1,       ,   n are distinct algebraic

numbers, then

proof: assume

b0e  0 + b1e  1 +        + bne  n   = 0

b0e  0 + b1e  1 +        + bne  n = 0

divide by e  0 and letting k = b0,

k + b1e  (1) +        + bne  (n) = 0

(6.11)

(6.12)

where    (k) =   k
to theorem 8.3.32. therefore,    (k) is a root of a polynomial

having integer coe   cients, vk, uk   = 0. recall algebraic numbers were de   ned as roots of

polynomial equations having rational coe   cients. just multiply by the denominators to get
one with integer coe   cients. let the roots of this polynomial equation be

{

and suppose they are listed in such a way that    (k)1 =    (k). letting ik be an integer in

this is because one of the factors is the one occurring in (6.12) when ik = 1 for every k. the
product is taken over all distinct ordered lists (i1,       , in) where ik is as indicated. expand

thus a symmetric polynomial in

what was just done for g featuring this time

{

and continuing this way, it must be the case that eventually you have a sum of integer
multiples of products of elementary symmetric polynomials in    (k)j , j = 1,       , mk for
each k     n. by theorem f.1.4, these are each rational numbers. therefore, each such g is
a rational number and so the    (r)j are algebraic. now (6.15) contradicts corollary f.3.3.
(cid:4)
note this lemma is su   cient to prove lindemann   s theorem that    is transcendental.
here is why. if    is algebraic, then so is i   and so from this lemma, e0 + ei     = 0 but this is
not the case because ei   =    1.

the next theorem is the main result, the lindemannn weierstrass theorem.

theorem f.3.5 suppose a (1) ,       , a (n) are nonzero algebraic numbers and suppose

   (1) ,       ,    (n)

are distinct algebraic numbers. then

a (1) e  (1) + a (2) e  (2) +        + a (n) e  (n)   = 0

proof: suppose a (j)     a (j)1 is a root of the polynomial

vjxmj +        + uj

where vj, uj   = 0. let the roots of this polynomial be a (j)1 ,       , a (j)mj

. suppose to the

contrary that

a (1)1 e  (1) + a (2)1 e  (2) +        + a (n)1 e  (n) = 0
   

(

e  (1) + a (2)i2

e  (2) +        + a (n)in

)

e  (n)

(6.16)

then consider the big product

a (1)i1

(i1,       ,in)

ik   {1,       ,mk}

the product taken over all ordered lists (i1,       , in) . this product equals

0 = b1e  (1) + b2e  (2) +        + bn e  (n )

(6.17)

where the    (j) are the distinct exponents which result. the    (i) are clearly algebraic
because they are the sum of the    (i). since the product in (6.16) is taken for all ordered
lists as described above, it follows that for a given k,if    (k)i is switched with    (k)j , that is,
two of the roots of vkxmk +      +uk are switched, then the product is unchanged and so (6.17)
is also unchanged. thus each bk is a symmetric polynomial in the a (k)j , j = 1,       , mk for

each k. it follows

   

and this is symmetric in the

f.4 more on algebraic field extensions

the next few sections have to do with    elds and    eld extensions. there are many linear
algebra techniques which are used in this discussion and it seems to me to be very interesting.
however, this is de   nitely far removed from my own expertise so there may be some parts of
this which are not too good. i am following various algebra books in putting this together.
consider the notion of splitting    elds. it is desired to show that any two are isomorphic,
meaning that there exists a one to one and onto mapping from one to the other which
preserves all the algebraic structure. to begin with, here is a theorem about extending
homomorphisms. [17]
de   nition f.4.1 suppose f,   f are two    elds and that f : f       f is a homomorphism. this
means that

f (xy) = f (x) f (y) , f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y)

an isomorphism is a homomorphism which is one to one and onto. a monomorphism is
a homomorphism which is one to one. an automorphism is an isomorphism of a single
   eld. sometimes people use the symbol     to indicate something is an isomorphism. then if
p (x)     f [x] , say

n   

p (x) =

akxk,

  p (x) will be the polynomial in   f [x] de   ned as

  p (x)     n   

f (ak) xk.

also consider f as a homomorphism of f [x] and   f [x] in the obvious way.

k=0

the following is a nice theorem which will be useful.

f (p (x)) =   p (x)

theorem f.4.2 let f be a    eld and let r be algebraic over f. let p (x) be the minimal
polynomial of r. thus p (r) = 0 and p (x) is monic and no nonzero polynomial having
coe   cients in f of smaller degree has r as a root. in particular, p (x) is irreducible over f.
then de   ne f : f [x]     f [r] , the polynomials in r by

it follows that g is an isomorphism from the    eld f [x] / (p (x)) to f [r] .

proof: first of all, consider why f is a homomorphism. the preservation of sums is

obvious. consider products.

thus it is clear that f is a homomorphism.

first consider why g is even well de   ned. if [q (x)] = [q1 (x)] , this means that

q1 (x)     q (x) = p (x) l (x)

for some l (x)     f [x]. therefore,

f (q1 (x)) = f (q (x)) + f (p (x) l (x))

= f (q (x)) + f (p (x)) f (l (x))
    q (r) + p (r) l (r) = q (r) = f (q (x))

now from this, it is obvious that g is a homomorphism.

g ([q (x)] [q1 (x)]) = g ([q (x) q1 (x)]) = f (q (x) q1 (x)) = q (r) q1 (r)

g ([q (x)]) g ([q1 (x)])     q (r) q1 (r)

similarly, g preserves sums. now why is g one to one? it su   ces to show that if g ([q (x)]) = 0,
then [q (x)] = 0. suppose then that

g ([q (x)])     q (r) = 0

then

where the degree of    (x) is less than the degree of p (x) or else    (x) = 0. if    (x)   = 0, then
it follows that

q (x) = p (x) l (x) +    (x)

   (r) = 0

and    (x) has smaller degree than that of p (x) which contradicts the de   nition of p (x) as the
minimal polynomial of r. since p (x) is irreducible, f [x] / (p (x)) is a    eld. it is clear that g
is onto. therefore, f [r] is a    eld also. (this was shown earlier by di   erent reasoning.) (cid:4)

theorem f.4.3 let f : f       f be an isomorphism of the two    elds. let r be algebraic
over f with minimal polynomial p (x) and suppose there exists   r algebraic over   f such that
  p (  r) = 0. then there exists an isomorphism g : f [r]       f [  r] which agrees with f on f. if
g : f [r]      f [  r] is an isomorphism which agrees with f on f and if    ([k (x)])     k (r) is the
homomorphism mapping f [x] / (p (x)) to f [r] , then there must exist   r such that   p (  r) = 0
and g =     

   1 where   

   : f [x] / (p (x))       f [  r]

is given by    ([k (x)]) =   k (  r) . in particular, g (r) =   r.

proof: from theorem f.4.2, there exists   , an isomorphism in the following picture,

   ([k (x)]) = k (r).

f [r]       f [x] / (p (x))

        f [  r]

where    ([k (x)])       k (  r) . (  k (x) comes from f as described in the above de   nition.) this   
is a well de   ned monomorphism because of the assumption that   p (  r) = 0. this needs to be
veri   ed. assume then that it is so. then just let g =     

   1.

   

(x)] so that k (x)    k

   

(x) = l (x) p (x) . then

why is    well de   ned? suppose [k (x)] = [k

since f is a homomorphism,

  k (x)       k

   

(x) =   l (x)   p (x) ,   k (  r)       g  k

   

(  r) =   l (  r)   p (  r) = 0

so    is indeed well de   ned. it is clear from the de   nition that    is a homomorphism. suppose
   ([k (x)]) = 0. does it follow that [k (x)] = 0? by assumption,   g (  r) = 0 and also,

  k (x) =   p (x)   l (x) +      (x)

where the degree of      (x) is less than the degree of   p (x) or else it equals 0. but then, since
f is an isomorphism,

k (x) = p (x) l (x) +    (x)

fields and field extensions

where the degree of    (x) is less than the degree of p (x) . however, the above shows that
   (r) = 0 contrary to p (x) being the minimal polynomial. hence    (x) = 0 and this implies
   1 works if it
that [k (x)] = 0. thus    is one to one and a homomorphism. hence g =     
   1 is onto and that    is onto. hence the desired
is also onto. however, it is clear that   
extension exists.

now suppose such an isomorphism g exists. then   r must equal g (r) and

hence,    can be de   ned as above as    ([k (x)])       k (  r) relative to this   r     g (r) and

0 = g (p (r)) =   p (g (r)) =   p (  r)

   1 (k (r))        ([k (x)])       k (g (r)) = g (k (r))

(cid:4)

    

what is the meaning of the above in simple terms? it says that the monomorphisms
from f [r] to a    eld   k containing   f correspond to the roots of   p (x) in   k. that is, for each
root of   p (x), there is a monomorphism and for each monomorphism, there is a root. also,
for each root   r of   p (x) in   k, there is an isomorphism from f [r] to   f [  r].

note that if p (x) is a monic irreducible polynomial, then it is the minimal polynomial
for each of its roots. this is the situation which is about to be considered. it involves the
splitting    elds k,   k of p (x) ,   p (x) where    is an isomorphism of f and   f as described above.
see [17]. here is a little diagram which describes what this theorem says.
de   nition f.4.4 the symbol [k : f] where k is a    eld extension of f means the dimension
of the vector space k with    eld of scalars f.

theorem f.4.5 let    be an isomorphism from f to   f and let k = f [r1,       , rn] ,   k =
  f [  r1,       ,   rn] be splitting    elds of p (x) and   p (x) respectively. then there exist at most
[k : f] isomorphisms    i : k       k which extend   . if {  r1,       ,   rn} are distinct, then there
exist exactly [k : f] isomorphisms of the above sort. in either case, the two splitting    elds
are isomorphic with any of these    i serving as an isomorphism.

proof: suppose [k : f] = 1. say a basis for k is {r} . then {1, r} is dependent and so
there exist a, b     f, not both zero such that a + br = 0. then it follows that r     f and so in
this case f = k. then the isomorphism which extends    is just    itself and there is exactly
1 isomorphism.

next suppose [k : f] > 1. then p (x) has an irreducible factor over f of degree larger

than 1, q (x). if not, you would have

p (x) = xn + an   1xn   1 +        + an

and it would factor as

= (x     r1)       (x     rn)
with each rj     f, so f = k contrary to [k : f] > 1.without loss of generality, let the roots
n   
m   
of q (x) in k be {r1,       , rm}. thus

q (x) =

(x     ri) , p (x) =

are counted according to multiplicity.

now   q (x) de   ned analogously to p (x) , also has degree at least 2. furthermore, it divides

  p (x) all of whose roots are in   k. denote the roots of   q (x) in k as {  r1,       ,   rm} where they
then from theorem f.4.3, there exist k     m one to one homomorphisms    i mapping
f [r1] to   k, one for each distinct root of   q (x) in   k. if the roots of   p (x) are distinct, then
this is su   cient to imply that the roots of   q (x) are also distinct, and k = m. otherwise,
maybe k < m. (it is conceivable that   q (x) might have repeated roots in   k.) then

[k : f] = [k : f [r1]] [f [r1] : f]

and since the degree of q (x) > 1 and q (x) is irreducible, this shows that [f [r1] : f] = m > 1
and so

[k : f [r1]] < [k : f]

therefore, by induction, each of these k     m = [f [r1] : f] one to one homomorphisms
extends to an isomorphism from k to   k and for each of these    i, there are no more than
[k : f [r1]] of these isomorphisms extending f. if the roots of   p (x) are distinct, then there
are exactly m of these    i and for each, there are [k : f [r1]] extensions. therefore, if the
roots of   p (x) are distinct, this has identi   ed

[k : f [r1]] m = [k : f [r1]] [f [r1] : f] = [k : f]

isomorphisms of k to   k which agree with    on f. if the roots of   p (x) are not distinct, then
maybe there are fewer than [k : f] extensions of   .

is this all of them? suppose    is such an isomorphism of k and   k. then consider its
restriction to f [r1] . by theorem f.4.3, this restriction must coincide with one of the    i
chosen earlier. then by induction,    is one of the extensions of the    i just mentioned. (cid:4)
de   nition f.4.6 let k be a    nite dimensional extension of a    eld f such that every el-
ement of k is algebraic over f, that is, each element of k is a root of some polynomial
in f [x]. then k is called a normal extension if for every k     k all roots of the minimal
polynomial of k are contained in k.

so what are some ways to tell a    eld is a normal extension? it turns out that if k is a
splitting    eld of f (x)     f [x] , then k is a normal extension. i found this in [17]. this is an
amazing result.
proposition f.4.7 let k be a splitting    eld of f (x)     f [x]. then k is a normal extension.
in fact, if l is an intermediate    eld between f and k, then l is also a normal extension of
f.

proof: let r     k be a root of g (x), an irreducible monic polynomial in f [x].

it is
required to show that every other root of g (x) is in k. let the roots of g (x) in a splitting
   eld be {r1 = r, r2,       , rm}. now g (x) is the minimal polynomial of rj over f because g (x)
is irreducible. recall why this was. if p (x) is the minimal polynomial of rj,

g (x) = p (x) l (x) + r (x)

where r (x) either is 0 or it has degree less than the degree of p (x) . however, r (rj) = 0 and
this is impossible if p (x) is the minimal polynomial. hence r (x) = 0 and now it follows
that g (x) was not irreducible unless l (x) = 1.

by theorem f.4.3, there exists an isomorphism    of f [r1] and f [rj] which    xes f and
maps r1 to rj. now k [r1] and k [rj] are splitting    elds of f (x) over f [r1] and f [rj] respec-
tively. by theorem f.4.5, the two    elds k [r1] and k [rj] are isomorphic, the isomorphism,
   extending   . hence

[k [r1] : k] = [k [rj] : k]

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation464

fields and field extensions

but r1     k and so k [r1] = k. therefore, k = k [rj] and so rj is also in k. thus all the
roots of g (x) are actually in k. consider the last assertion.
suppose r = r1     l where the minimal polynomial for r is denoted by q (x). then
letting the roots of q (x) in k be {r1,       , rm}. by theorem f.4.3 applied to the identity
map on l, there exists an isomorphism    : l [r1]     l [rj] which    xes l and takes r1 to rj.

but this implies that

1 = [l [r1] : l] = [l [rj] : l]

hence rj     l also. since r was an arbitrary element of l, this shows that l is normal. (cid:4)
de   nition f.4.8 when you have f [a1,       , am] with each ai algebraic so that f [a1,       , am]

is a    eld, you could consider

f (x)     m   

fi (x)

where fi (x) is the minimal polynomial of ai. then if k is a splitting    eld for f (x) , this k
is called the normal closure. it is at least as large as f [a1,       , am] and it has the advantage

i=1

of being a normal extension.

f.5 the galois group
in the case where f =   f, the above suggests the following de   nition.
de   nition f.5.1 when k is a splitting    eld for a polynomial p (x) having coe   cients in
f, we say that k is a splitting    eld of p (x) over the    eld f. let k be a splitting    eld of
p (x) over the    eld f. then g (k, f) denotes the group of automorphisms of k which leave
f    xed. for a    nite set s, denote by |s| as the number of elements of s. more generally,
when k is a    nite extension of l, denote by g (k, l) the group of automorphisms of k
which leave l    xed.

it is shown later that g (k, f) really is a group according to the strict de   nition of a
group. for right now, just regard it as a set of automorphisms which keeps f    xed. theorem
f.4.5 implies the following important result.
theorem f.5.2 let k be a splitting    eld of p (x) over the    eld f. then

|g (k, f)|     [k : f]

when the roots of p (x) are distinct, equality holds in the above.

so how large is |g (k, f)| in case p (x) is a polynomial of degree n which has n distinct
roots? let p (x) be a monic polynomial with roots in k, {r1,       , rn} and suppose that none
of the ri is in f. thus

p (x) = xn + a1xn   1 + a2xn   2 +        + an

n   

=

k=1

(x     rk) , ai     f

thus k consists of all rational functions in the r1,       , rn. let    be a mapping from
{r1,       , rn} to {r1,       , rn} , say rj     rij . in other words    produces a permutation of
these roots. consider the following way of obtaining something in g (k, f) from   . if you
have a typical thing in k, you can obtain another thing in k by replacing each rj with rij in

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationf.5. the galois group

465

a rational function, a quotient of two polynomials which have coe   cients in f. furthermore,
if you do this, you can see right away that the resulting map form k to k is obviously an au-
tomorphism, preserving the operations of multiplication and addition. does it keep f    xed?
of course. you don   t change the coe   cients of the polynomials in the rational function
which are always in f. thus every permutation of the roots determines an automorphism
of k. now suppose    is an automorphism of k. does it determine a permutation of the
roots?

0 =    (p (ri)) =    (p (   (ri)))

and so    (ri) is also a root, say rij . thus it is clear that each        g (k, f) determines
a permutation of the roots. since the roots are distinct, it follows that |g (k, f)| equals
the number of permutations of {r1,       , rn} which is n! and that there is a one to one
correspondence between the permutations of the roots and g (k, f) . more will be done on
this later after discussing permutation groups.

this is a good time to make a very important observation about irreducible polynomials.
lemma f.5.3 suppose q (x)   = p (x) are both irreducible polynomials over a    eld f. then
for k a    eld which contains all the roots of both polynomials, there is no root common to
both p (x) and q (x).

proof: if l (x) is a monic polynomial which divides them both, then l (x) must equal
1. otherwise, it would equal p (x) and q (x) which would require these two to be equal.
thus p (x) and q (x) are relatively prime and there exist polynomials a (x) , b (x) having
coe   cients in f such that

now if p (x) and q (x) share a root r, then (x     r) divides both sides of the above in k [x],
but this is impossible. (cid:4)

a (x) p (x) + b (x) q (x) = 1

now here is an important de   nition of a class of polynomials which yield equality in the

inequality of theorem f.5.2.
de   nition f.5.4 let p (x) be a polynomial having coe   cients in a    eld f. also let k be a
splitting    eld. then p (x) is separable if it is of the form

m   

p (x) =

i=1

qi (x)ki

where each qi (x) is irreducible over f and each qi (x) has distinct roots in k. from the
above lemma, no two qi (x) share a root. thus

p1 (x)     m   

i=1

qi (x)

has distinct roots in k.

for example, consider the case where f = q and the polynomial is of the form

(

x2 + 1

then let k be the splitting    eld over q, q
irreducible over q and each has distinct roots in k.

.the polynomials x2 + 1 and x2     2 are
this is also a convenient time to show that g (k, f) for k a    nite extension of f really

is a group. first, here is the de   nition.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation466
de   nition f.5.5 a group g is a nonempty set with an operation, denoted here as    such
that the following axioms hold.

fields and field extensions

   1 =   

   1     g such that

2. there exists        g such that      =      =   
3. for every        g, there exists   
then why is g     g (k, f) , where k is a    nite extension of f, a group? if you simply
look at the automorphisms of k then it is obvious that this is a group with the operation
being composition. also, from theorem f.4.5 |g (k, f)| is    nite. clearly        g.
it is
just the automorphism which takes everything to itself. the operation in this case is just
composition. thus the associative law is obvious. what about the existence of the inverse?
clearly, you can de   ne the inverse of   , but does it    x f? if    =   , then the inverse is clearly
  . otherwise, consider   ,   2,       . since |g (k, f)| is    nite, eventually there is a repeat. thus

a suitable power of    and so

then the following corollary is the reason why separable polynomials are so important.
also, one can show that if f contains a    eld which is isomorphic to q then every polynomial
with coe   cients in f is separable. this will be done later after presenting the big results.
this is equivalent to saying that the    eld has characteristic zero. in addition, the property
of being separable holds in other situations which are described later.
corollary f.5.6 let k be a splitting    eld of p (x) over the    eld f. assume p (x) is
separable. then

|g (k, f)| = [k : f]

proof: just note that k is also the splitting    eld of p1 (x), the product of the distinct
irreducible factors and that from lemma f.5.3, p1 (x) has distinct roots. thus the conclusion
follows from theorem f.4.5. (cid:4)
what if l is an intermediate    eld between f and k? then p1 (x) still has coe   cients in

l and distinct roots in k and so it also follows that

|g (k, l)| = [k : l]

de   nition f.5.7 let g be a group of automorphisms of a    eld k. then denote by kg the
   xed    eld of g. thus

kg     {x     k :    (x) = x for all        g}

thus there are two new things, the    xed    eld of a group of automorphisms h denoted
by kh and the gallois group g (k, l). how are these related? first here is a simple lemma
which comes from the de   nitions.
lemma f.5.8 let k be an algebraic extension of l (each element of l is a root of some
polynomial in l) for l, k    elds. then

proof: it is clear that l     kg(k,l) because if r     l then by de   nition, everything in

g (k, l)    xes r and so r is in kg(k,l). therefore,

g (k, l) = g

k, kg(k,l)

now let        g (k, l) then it is one of the automorphisms of k which    xes everything in
the    xed    eld of g (k, l) . thus, by de   nition,        g
and so the two are the
same. (cid:4)

now the following says that you can start with l, go to the group g (k, l) and then to

k, kg(k,l)

(

)

the    xed    eld of this group and end up back where you started. more precisely,
proposition f.5.9 if k is a splitting    eld of p (x) over the    eld f for separable p (x) , and
if l is a    eld between k and f, then k is also a splitting    eld of p (x) over l and also

this has shown the following diagram in the context of k being a splitting    eld of a

which shows that

in particular, every intermediate    eld is a    xed    eld of a subgroup of g (k, f). is every
subgroup of g (k, f) obtained in the form g (k, l) for some intermediate    eld? this involves
another estimate which is apparently due to artin. i also found this in [17]. there is more
there about some of these things than what i am including.
theorem f.5.10 let k be a    eld and let g be a    nite group of automorphisms of k. then

proof: let g = {  1,       ,   n} ,   1 =    the identity map and suppose {u1,       , um} is a
linearly independent set in k with respect to the    eld kg. suppose m > n. then consider
the system of equations

  1 (u1) x1 +   1 (u2) x2 +        +   1 (um) xm = 0
  2 (u1) x1 +   2 (u2) x2 +        +   2 (um) xm = 0

  n (u1) x1 +   n (u2) x2 +        +   n (um) xm = 0

(6.18)

which is of the form m x = 0 for x     km. since m has more columns than rows, there
exists a nonzero solution x     km to the above system. note that this could not happen if
x     km
g because of independence of {u1,       , um} and the fact that   1 =   . let the solution
x be one which has the least possible number of nonzero entries. without loss of generality,
some xk = 1 for some k. if   r (xk) = xk for all xk and for each r, then the xk are each
in kg and so the    rst equation above would be impossible as just noted. therefore, there
exists l   = k and   r such that   r (xl)   = xl. for purposes of illustration, say l > k. now
do   r to both sides of all the above equations. this yields, after re ordering the resulting
equations a list of equations of the form

  1 (u1)   r (x1) +        +   1 (uk) 1 +        +   1 (ul)   r (xl) +        +   1 (um)   r (xm) = 0
  2 (u1)   r (x1) +        +   2 (uk) 1 +        +   2 (ul)   r (xl) +        +   2 (um)   r (xm) = 0

  n (u1)   r (x1) +        +   n (uk) 1 +        +   n (ul)   r (xl) +        +   n (um)   r (xm) = 0

fields and field extensions

this is because    (1) = 1 if    is an automorphism. the original system in (6.18) is of the
form

  1 (u1) x1 +        +   1 (uk) 1 +        +   1 (ul) xl +        +   1 (um) xm = 0
  2 (u1) x1 +        +   2 (uk) 1 +        +   1 (ul) xl +        +   2 (um) xm = 0

  n (u1) x1 +        +   n (uk) 1 +        +   1 (ul) xl +        +   n (um) xm = 0

...

now replace the kth equation with the di   erence of the kth equations in the original system
and the one in which   r was done to both sides of the equations. since   r (xl)   = xl the
result will be a linear system of the form m y = 0 where y   = 0 has fewer nonzero entries
than x, contradicting the choice of x. (cid:4)

with the above estimate, here is another relation between the    xed    elds and subgroups
it doesn   t seem to depend on anything being a splitting    eld of a

of automorphisms.
separable polynomial.
proposition f.5.11 let h be a    nite group of automorphisms de   ned on a    eld k. then
for kh the    xed    eld,

g (k, kh ) = h

proof: if        h, then by de   nition,        g (k, kh ). it is clear that h     g (k, kh ) .

then by proposition f.5.10 and theorem f.5.2,

|h|     [k : kh ]     |g (k, kh )|     |h|

this leads to the following interesting correspondence in the case where k is a splitting

and so h = g (k, kh ). (cid:4)
   eld of a separable polynomial over a    eld f.
l       g (k, l)
      h

fixed    elds

subgroups of g (k, f)

(6.19)

then     l = l and     h = h. thus there exists a one to one correspondence between the
   xed    elds and the subgroups of g (k, f). the following theorem summarizes the above
result.
theorem f.5.12 let k be a splitting    eld of a separable polynomial over a    eld f. then
there exists a one to one correspondence between the    xed    elds kh for h a subgroup of
g (k, f) and the intermediate    elds as described in the above. h1     h2 if and only if
kh1

    kh2. also

|h| = [k : kh ]

proof: the one to one correspondence is established above. the claim about the    xed
   elds is obvious because if the group is larger, then the    xed    eld must get harder because it
is more di   cult to    x everything using more automorphisms than with fewer automorphisms.

consider the estimate. from theorem f.5.10, |h|     [k : kh ]. but also, h = g (k, kh )
from proposition f.5.11 g (k, kh ) = h and from theorem f.5.2,

|h| = |g (k, kh )|     [k : kh ] .

(cid:4)

note that from the above discussion, when k is a splitting    eld of p (x)     f [x] , this
implies that if l is an intermediate    eld, then it is also a    xed    eld of a subgroup of g (k, f).
in fact, from the above,

l = kg(k,l)

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationf.6. normal subgroups

469

if h is a subgroup, then it is also the galois group

h = g (k, kh ) .

by proposition f.4.7, each of these intermediate    elds l is also a normal extension of f.
now there is also something called a normal subgroup which will end up corresponding with
these normal    eld extensions consisting of the intermediate    elds between f and k.

f.6 normal subgroups

when you look at groups, one of the    rst things to consider is the notion of a normal
subgroup.

de   nition f.6.1 let g be a group. then a subgroup n is said to be a normal subgroup if
whenever        g,

   1n        n

  

the important thing about normal subgroups is that you can de   ne the quotient group

g/n .
de   nition f.6.2 let n be a subgroup of g. de   ne an equivalence relation     as follows.

   1       n

          means   
why is this an equivalence relation? it is clear that           because   
(
n is a subgroup. if          , then   
   1       n and so, since n is a subgroup,
(

which shows that          . now suppose            , then

   1       n

=   

which shows that          . now suppose           and          . then   
then since n is a subgroup

   1    

   1   =   

   1       n

  

   1       n and so, since n is a

   1       n and   

   1       n.

   1   =        n since

and so           which shows that it is an equivalence relation as claimed. denote by [  ] the
equivalence class determined by   .

now in the case of n a normal subgroup, you can consider the quotient group.

de   nition f.6.3 let n be a normal subgroup of a group g and de   ne g/n as the set of
all equivalence classes with respect to the above equivalence relation. also de   ne

[  ] [  ]     [    ]

proposition f.6.4 the above de   nition is well de   ned and it also makes g/n into a
group.

proof: first consider the claim that the de   nition is well de   ned. suppose then that

         

   

and          

   

. it is required to show that

f.7 normal extensions and normal subgroups
when k is a splitting    eld of a separable polynomial having coe   cients in f, the intermediate
   elds are each normal extensions from the above. if l is one of these, what about g (l, f)?
is this a normal subgroup of g (k, f)? more generally, consider the following diagram which
has now been established in the case that k is a splitting    eld of a separable polynomial in
f [x].

f     l0
g (f, f) = {  }     g (l1, f)     g (l2, f)

    l1

    l2

           lk   1
    lk     k
           g (lk   1, f)     g (k, f)

(6.20)

the intermediate    elds li are each normal extensions of f each element of li being algebraic.
as implied in the diagram, there is a one to one correspondence between the intermediate
   elds and the galois groups displayed. is g (lj   1, f) a normal subgroup of g (lj, f)?
   1         g (lj   1, f)? let r = r1
be something in lj   1 and let {r1,       , rm} be the roots of the minimal polynomial of r
denoted by f (x) , a polynomial having coe   cients in f. then 0 =   f (r) = f (   (r)) and
so    (r) = rj for some j. since lj   1 is normal,    (r)     lj   1. therefore, it is    xed by   . it

let        g (lj, f) and let        g (lj   1, f) . then is   

follows that

   1     (r) =   

   1   (r) = r

  

and so   

   1         g (lj   1, f). thus g (lj   1, f) is a normal subgroup of g (lj, f) as hoped.

this leads to the following fundamental theorem of galois theory.

theorem f.7.1 let k be a splitting    eld of a separable polynomial p (x) having coe   cients
in a    eld f. let {li}k
i=0 be the increasing sequence of intermediate    elds between f and k
as shown above in (6.20). then each of these is a normal extension of f and the galois
group g (lj   1, f) is a normal subgroup of g (lj, f). in addition to this,

g (lj, f)     g (k, f) /g (k, lj)
where the symbol     indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.

proof: all that remains is to check that the above isomorphism is valid. let

   : g (k, f) /g (k, lj)     g (lj, f) ,    [  ]       |lj

in other words, this is just the restriction of    to lj. is    well de   ned? if [  1] = [  2] , then
   1
2    xes everything in lj. it follows that the
by de   nition,   1  
restrictions of   1 and   2 to lj are equal. therefore,    is well de   ned. it is obvious that

    g (k, lj) and so   1

   is a homomorphism. why is    onto? this follows right away from theorem f.4.5. note

that k is the splitting    eld of p (x) over lj since lj     f. also if        g (lj, f) so it is an
automorphism of lj, then, since it    xes f, p (x) =   p (x) in that theorem. thus    extends to
  , an automorphism of k. thus      =   . why is    one to one? if    [  ] =    [  ] , this means
   1     g (k, lj) which is what it
   =    on lj. thus     
means for [  ] = [  ]. (cid:4)
extension f [a1, a2,       , am] . to begin with, recall the following de   nition.
de   nition f.7.2 when you have f [a1,       , am] with each ai algebraic so that f [a1,       , am]

there is an immediate application to a description of the normal closure of an algebraic

   1 is the identity on lj. hence     

is a    eld, you could consider

f (x)     m   

fi (x)

where fi (x) is the minimal polynomial of ai. then if k is a splitting    eld for f (x) , this k
is called the normal closure. it is at least as large as f [a1,       , am] and it has the advantage

i=1

of being a normal extension.

let g (k, f) = {  1,   2,       ,   m

} . the conjugate    elds are the    elds

  j (f [a1,       , am])

thus each of these    elds is isomorphic to any other and they are all contained in k. let k   
denote the smallest    eld contained in k which contains all of these conjugate    elds. note
that if k     f [a1,       , am] so that   i (k) is in one of these conjugate    elds, then   j  i (k) is
also in a conjugate    eld because   j  i is one of the automorphisms of g (k, f). let

and the galois groups, it follows that k   
lemma f.7.3 let k denote the normal extension of f [a1,       , am] with each ai algebraic
so that f [a1,       , am] is a    eld. thus k is the splitting    eld of the product of the minimal
polynomials of the ai. then k is also the smallest    eld containing the conjugate    elds
  j (f [a1,       , am]) for {  1,   2,       ,   m

and so this shows that each   j maps k

f.8 conditions for separability
so when is it that a polynomial having coe   cients in a    eld f is separable? it turns out
that this is always the case for    elds which are enough like the rational numbers. it involves
considering the derivative of a polynomial. in doing this, there will be no analysis used, just

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundation472

fields and field extensions

the rule for di   erentiation which we all learned in calculus. thus the derivative is de   ned
as follows.

(
)   
anxn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0
    nanxn   1 + an   1 (n     1) xn   2 +        + a1

this kind of formal manipulation is what most students do anyway, never thinking about
where it comes from. here nan means to add an to itself n times. with this de   nition, it
is clear that the usual rules such as the product rule hold. this discussion follows [17].
de   nition f.8.1 a    eld has characteristic 0 if na   = 0 for all n     n and a   = 0. otherwise
a    eld f has characteristic p if p    1 = 0 for p    1 de   ned as 1 added to itself p times and p
is the smallest positive integer for which this takes place.

note that with this de   nition, some of the terms of the derivative of a polynomial could
vanish in the case that the    eld has characteristic p. i will go ahead and write them anyway.
for example, if the    eld has characteristic p, then

(xp     a)

   

= 0

because formally it equals p    1xp   1 = 0xp   1, the 1 being the 1 in the    eld.

note that the    eld zp does not have characteristic 0 because p   1 = 0. thus not all    elds

have characteristic 0.

how can you tell if a polynomial has no repeated roots? this is the content of the next

theorem.
theorem f.8.2 let p (x) be a monic polynomial having coe   cients in a    eld f, and let k
be a    eld in which p (x) factors

n   

(x     ri) , ri     k.

p (x) =

i=1

   
then the ri are distinct if and only if p (x) and p

(x) are relatively prime over f.

   
proof: suppose    rst that p

(x) and p (x) are relatively prime over f. since they are not

both zero, there exists polynomials a (x) , b (x) having coe   cients in f such that

a (x) p (x) + b (x) p

   

(x) = 1

now suppose p (x) has a repeated root r. then in k [x] ,
p (x) = (x     r)2 g (x)

   

and so p

(
(x) = 2 (x     r) g (x) + (x     r)2 g
a (x) (x     r)2 g (x) + b (x)

   

)

(x)

= 1

   

(x). then in k [x] ,
2 (x     r) g (x) + (x     r)2 g
n   

   

   
p

(x) =

j  =i

i=1

(x     rj)

then letting x = r, it follows that 0 = 1. hence p (x) has no repeated roots.

next suppose there are no repeated roots of p (x). then

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationf.8. conditions for separability

   
p

(x) cannot be zero in this case because

   
p

(rn) =

n   1   

j=1

(rn     rj)   = 0

   

j  =i

(ri     rj)   = 0.

   
because it is the product of nonzero elements of k. similarly no term in the sum for p
can equal zero because

473

(x)

   

then if q (x) is a monic polynomial of degree larger than 1 which divides p (x), then the

roots of q (x) in k are a subset of {r1,       , rn}. without loss of generality, suppose these
roots of q (x) are {r1,       , rk} , k     n    1, since q (x) divides p
   
(x) which has degree at most
n     1. then q (x) =
i=1 (x     ri) but this fails to divide p
   
(x) as polynomials in k [x] and
   
(x) as polynomials in f [x] either. therefore, q (x) = 1 and so the
so q (x) fails to divide p
two are relatively prime. (cid:4)

the following lemma says that the usual calculus result holds in case you are looking at

polynomials with coe   cients in a    eld of characteristic 0.
lemma f.8.3 suppose that f has characteristic 0. then if f
is a constant.

   

(x) = 0, it follows that f (x)

proof: suppose

f (x) = anxn + an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0

then take the derivative n     1 times to    nd that an multiplied by a positive integer man
equals 0. therefore, an = 0 because, by assumption man   = 0 if an   = 0. now repeat the

argument with

f1 (x) = an   1xn   1 +        + a1x + a0

and continue this way to    nd that f (x) = a0     f. (cid:4)

now here is a major result which applies to    elds of characteristic 0.

theorem f.8.4 if f is a    eld of characteristic 0, then every polynomial p (x) , having
coe   cients in f is separable.

proof: it is required to show that the irreducible factors of p (x) have distinct roots in
k a splitting    eld for p (x). so let q (x) be an irreducible monic polynomial. if l (x) is a
(x) , then since q (x) is
monic polynomial of positive degree which divides both q (x) and q
irreducible, it must be the case that l (x) = q (x) which forces q (x) to divide q
(x) . however,
the degree of q
(x) is less than the degree of q (x) so this is impossible. hence l (x) = 1 and
so q

(x) and q (x) are relatively prime which implies that q (x) has distinct roots. (cid:4)
it follows that the above theory all holds for any    eld of characteristic 0. for example,

   

   

   

   

if the    eld is q then everything holds.
proposition f.8.5 if a    eld f has characteristic p, then p is a prime.

proof: first note that if n    1 = 0, if and only if for all a   = 0, n    a = 0 also. this just
follows from the distributive law and the de   nition of what is meant by n    1, meaning that
you add 1 to itself n times. suppose then that there are positive integers, each larger than
1 n, m such that nm    1 = 0. then grouping the terms in the sum associated with nm    1,
it follows that n (m    1) = 0. if the characteristic of the    eld is nm, this is a contradiction
because then m    1   = 0 but n times it is, implying that n < nm but n    a = 0 for a nonzero
a. hence n    1 = 0 showing that mn is not the characteristic of the    eld after all. (cid:4)

fields and field extensions

de   nition f.8.6 a    eld f is called perfect if every polynomial p (x) having coe   cients in
f is separable.

the above shows that    elds of characteristic 0 are perfect. the above theory about
galois groups and    xed    elds all works for perfect    elds. what about    elds of characteristic
p where p is a prime? the following interesting lemma has to do with a nonzero a     f
having a pth root in f.
lemma f.8.7 let f be a    eld of characteristic p. let a   = 0 where a     f. then either
xp     a is irreducible or there exists b     f such that xp     a = (x     b)p.

proof: suppose that xp     a is not irreducible. then xp     a = g (x) f (x) where the
degree of g (x) , k is less than p and at least as large as 1. then let b be a root of g (x). then
bp     a = 0. therefore,

xp     a = xp     bp = (x     b)p .

that is right. xp     bp = (x     b)p just like many beginning calculus students believe.
it
happens because of the binomial theorem and the fact that the other terms have a factor of
p. hence

xp     a = (x     b)p = g (x) f (x)

and so g (x) divides (x     b)p which requires that g (x) = (x     b)k since g (x) has degree k.
it follows, since g (x) is given to have coe   cients in f, that bk     f. also bp     f. since k, p
are relatively prime, due to the fact that k < p with p prime, there are integers m, n such
that

then from what you mean by raising b to an integer power and the usual rules of exponents
for integer powers,

so when is a    eld of characteristic p perfect? as observed above, for a    eld of charac-

teristic p,

also,

it follows that a     ap is a homomorphism. this is also one to one because, as mentioned
above

therefore, if ap = bp, it follows that a = b. therefore, this homomorphism is also one to
one.
let fp be the collection of ap where a     f. then clearly fp is a sub   eld of f because
it is the image of a one to one homomorphism. what follows is the condition for a    eld of
characteristic p to be perfect.
theorem f.8.8 let f be a    eld of characteristic p. then f is perfect if and only if f = fp.
proof: suppose f = fp    rst. let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial over f. by theorem
(x) and f (x) are relatively prime over f then f (x) has no repeated roots. suppose
f.8.2, if f
then that the two polynomials are not relatively prime. if d (x) divides both f (x) and f
(x)
with degree of d (x)     1. then, since f (x) is irreducible, it follows that d (x) is a multiple

of f (x) and so f (x) divides f
then f (x) must be of the form

(x) = 0. but if f

since if it had some other nonzero term with exponent not a multiple of p then f

not equal zero since you would have something surviving in the expression for the derivative
after taking out multiples of p which is like

because of the fact noted earlier that a     ap is a homomorphism. however, this says that
f (x) is not irreducible after all. it follows that there exists ak such that ak /    fp contrary
to the assumption that f = fp. hence the greatest common divisor of f
(x) and f (x) must
be 1.
next consider the other direction. suppose f   = fp. then there exists a     f \ fp.
consider the polynomial xp     a. as noted above, its derivative equals 0. therefore, xp     a
and its derivative cannot be relatively prime. in fact, xp     a would divide both. (cid:4)
now suppose f is a    nite    eld. if n    1 is never equal to 0 then, since the    eld is    nite,
k    1 = m    1, for some k < m. m > k, and (m     k)    1 = 0 which is a contradiction. hence
f is a    eld of characteristic p for some prime p, by proposition f.8.5. the mapping a     ap
was shown to be a homomorphism which is also one to one. therefore, fp is a sub   eld of
f. it follows that it has characteristic q for some q a prime. however, this requires q = p
and so fp = f. then the following corollary is obtained from the above theorem.
corollary f.8.9 if f is a    nite    eld, then f is perfect.

with this information, here is a convenient version of the fundamental theorem of galois

theory.
theorem f.8.10 let k be a splitting    eld of any polynomial p (x)     f [x] where f is
either of characteristic 0 or of characteristic p with fp = f. let {li}k
i=0 be the increasing
sequence of intermediate    elds between f and k. then each of these is a normal extension
of f and the galois group g (lj   1, f) is a normal subgroup of g (lj, f). in addition to this,

g (lj, f)     g (k, f) /g (k, lj)
where the symbol     indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.

f.9 permutations
let {a1,       , an} be a set of distinct elements. then a permutation of these elements is

usually thought of as a list in a particular order. thus there are exactly n! permutations of
a set having n distinct elements. with this de   nition, here is a simple lemma.

lemma f.9.1 every permutation can be obtained from every other permutation by a    nite
number of switches.

proof: this is obvious if n = 1 or 2. suppose then that it is true for sets of n   1 elements.
take two permutations of {a1,       , an} , p1, p2. to get from p1 to p2 using switches,    rst
make a switch to obtain the last element in the list coinciding with the last element of p2.
by induction, there are switches which will arrange the    rst n     1 to the right order. (cid:4)
it is customary to consider permutations in terms of the set in     {1,       , n} to be more
speci   c. then one can think of a given permutation as a mapping    from this set in to
itself which is one to one and onto. in fact,    (i)     j where j is in the ith position. often
people write such a    in the following form

an easy way to understand the above permutation is through the use of matrix multiplica-

tion by permutation matrices. the above vector (i1,       , in)t is obtained by

(6.21)

(6.22)

this can be seen right away from looking at a simple example or by using the de   nition of
id127 directly.

de   nition f.9.2 the sign of the permutation (6.21) is de   ned as the determinant of the
above matrix in (6.22).

in other words, the sign of the permutation
      
      

n
in
equals sgn (i1,       , in) de   ned earlier in lemma 3.3.1.

1
i1

2
i2

note that from the fact that the determinant is well de   ned and its properties, the sign of
a permutation is 1 if and only if the permutation is produced by an even number of switches
and that the number of switches used to produce a given permutation must be either even
or odd. of course a switch is a permutation itself and this is called a transposition. note
also that all these matrices are orthogonal matrices so to take the inverse, it su   ces to take
a transpose, the inverse also being a permutation matrix.

the resulting group consisting of the permutations of in is called sn. an important idea
is the notion of a cycle. let    be a permutation, a one to one and onto function de   ned on

in. a cycle is of the form(

)
k,    (k) ,   2 (k) ,   3 (k) ,       ,   m   1 (k)

,   m (k) = k.

the last condition must hold for some m because in is    nite. then a cycle can be considered
as a permutation as follows. let (i1, i2,       , im) be a cycle. then de   ne    by    (i1) =
i2,    (i2) = i3,       ,    (im) = i1, and if k /    {i1, i2,       , im} , then    (k) = k.
note that if you have two cycles, (i1, i2,       , im) , (j1, j2,       , jm) which are disjoint in

the sense that

{i1, i2,       , im}     {j1, j2,       , jm} =    ,

then they commute. it is then clear that every permutation can be represented in a unique
way by disjoint cycles. start with 1 and form the cycle determined by 1. then start with the

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationf.9. permutations

477

smallest k     in which was not included and begin a cycle starting with this. continue this

way. use the convention that (k) is just the identity. this representation is unique up to
order of the cycles which does not matter because they commute. note that a transposition
can be written as (a, b).

a cycle can be written as a product of non disjoint transpositions.

(i1, i2,       , im) = (im   1, im)       (i2, im) (i1, im)

thus if m is odd, the permutation has sign 1 and if m is even, the permutation has sign
   1 =

   1. also, it is clear that the inverse of the above permutation is (i1, i2,       , im)
(im,       , i2, i1) .
de   nition f.9.3 an is the subgroup of sn such that for        an,    is the product of an

even number of transpositions. it is called the alternating group.

the following important result is useful in describing an.

proposition f.9.4 let n     3. then every permutation in an is the product of 3 cycles

and the identity.

proof: in case n = 3, you can list all of the permutations in an

in terms of cycles, these are

you can easily check that they are inverses of each other. now suppose n     4. the
permutations in an are de   ned as the product of an even number of transpositions. there
are two cases. the    rst case is where you have two transpositions which share a number,

(1, 2, 3) , (1, 3, 2)

(a, c) (c, b) = (a, c, b)

thus when they share a number, the product is just a 3 cycle. next suppose you have the
product of two transpositions which are disjoint. this can happen because n     4. first note
that

(a, b) = (c, b) (b, a, c) = (c, b, a) (c, a)

therefore,

(a, b) (c, d) = (c, b, a) (c, a) (a, d) (d, c, a)

= (c, b, a) (c, a, d) (d, c, a)

and so every product of disjoint transpositions is the product of 3 cycles. (cid:4)
lemma f.9.5 if n     5, then if b is a normal subgroup of an, and b is not the identity,

then b must contain a 3 cycle.

proof: let    be the permutation in b which is    closest    to the identity without being
the identity. that is, out of all permutations which are not the identity, this is one which
has the most    xed points or equivalently moves the fewest numbers. then    is the product
of disjoint cycles. suppose that the longest cycle is the    rst one and it has at least four
numbers. thus

since b is normal,

then for this permutation, i1     i3, i2     i2, i3     i4, i4     i1. the other numbers not in
{i1, i2, i3, i4} are    xed, and in addition i2 is    xed which did not happen with   . therefore,
this new permutation moves only 3 numbers. since it is assumed that m     4, this is a

then i1     i4, i2     i3, i3     i5, i4     i2, i5     i1 and other numbers are    xed. thus   1

moves 5 points. however,    moves more than 5 if   i is not the identity for any i     2. it

follows that

   = (i1, i2, i3)   1

and   1 can only be a transposition. however, this cannot happen because then the above
   would not even be in an. therefore,   1 =    and so

   = (i1, i2, i3)

thus in this case, b contains a 3 cycle.

now consider case (6.24). none of the   i can be a cycle of length more than 4 since
the above argument would eliminate this possibility. if any has length 3 then the above
argument implies that    equals this 3 cycle. it follows that each   i must be a 2 cycle. say

   = (i1, i2) (i3, i4)   2

         p

thus it moves at least four numbers, greater than four if any of   i for i     2 is not the
identity. as before,   1    

(i4, i2, i1) (i1, i2) (i3, i4)   2

then i1     i3, i2     i4, i3     i1, i4     i3 so this moves exactly four numbers. therefore, none
of the   i is di   erent than the identity for i     2. it follows that

   = (i1, i2) (i3, i4)

(6.25)

and    moves exactly four numbers. then since b is normal,   1    
(i5, i4, i3) (i1, i2) (i3, i4) (i3, i4, i5)     b

   1 =

(i5, i4, i3) (i1, i2) (i3, i4) (i3, i4, i5) (i3, i4) (i1, i2)     b

then   1  
then i1     i1, i2     i2, i3     i4, i4     i5, i5     i3. thus this permutation moves only three
numbers and so    cannot be of the form given in (6.25). it follows that case (6.24) does not
occur. (cid:4)

de   nition f.9.6 a group g is said to be simple if its only normal subgroups are itself and
the identity.

the following major result is due to galois [17].

proof: from lemma f.9.5, if b is a normal subgroup of an, b   = {  } , then it contains

proposition f.9.7 let n     5. then an is simple.

   1 (j3) =      (i3) =    (i1) = j1

      

      
      

   1 leaves all other numbers    xed. thus       

   1 is the given 3 cycle. it follows that
while       
b contains every 3 cycle. by proposition f.9.4, this implies b = an. the only problem is
that it is not know whether    is in an. this is where n     5 is used. you can modify    on
two numbers not equal to any of the {i1, i2, i3} by multiplying by a transposition so that
the possibly modi   ed    is expressed as an even number of transpositions. (cid:4)

f.10 solvable groups

recall the fundamental theorem of galois theory which established a correspondence be-
tween the normal subgroups of g (k, f) and normal    eld extensions. also recall that if h
is one of these normal subgroups, then there was an isomorphism between g (kh , f) and
the quotient group g (k, f) /h. the general idea of a solvable group is given next.

de   nition f.10.1 a group g is solvable if there exists a decreasing sequence of subgroups

{hi}m

i=0 such that h i is a normal subgroup of h (i   1),

g = h0     h1                hm = {  } ,

and each quotient group hi   1/hi is abelian. that is, for [a] , [b]     hi   1/hi,

[ab] = [a] [b] = [b] [a] = [ba]

note that if g is an abelian group, then it is automatically solvable. in fact you can

just consider h0 = g, h1 = {  }. in this case h0/h1 is just the group g which is abelian.

there is another idea which helps in understanding whether a group is solvable.

it
involves the commutator subgroup. this is a very good idea because this subgroup is
de   ned in terms of the group g.

f.11 solvability by radicals

first of all, there exists a    eld which has all the nth roots of 1. you could simply de   ne it
to be the smallest sub    eld of c such that it contains these roots. you could also enlarge
it by including some other numbers. for example, you could include q. observe that if
       ei2  /n, then   n = 1 but   k   = 1 if k < n and that if k < l < n,   k   =   l. such a    eld
has characteristic 0 because for m an integer, m   1   = 0. the following is from herstein [13].
this is the kind of    eld considered here.
lemma f.11.1 suppose a    eld f has all the nth roots of 1 for a particular n and suppose
there exists    such that the nth roots of 1 are of the form   k for k = 1,       , n, the   k being
distinct. let a     f be nonzero. let k denote the splitting    eld of xn     a over f, thus k is
a normal extension of f. then k = f [u] where u is any root of xn     a. the galois group
g (k, f) is abelian.

unity mentioned. then

proof: let u be a root of xn     a and let k equal f [u] . then let    be the nth root of
{
}
and so each   ku is a root of xn     a and these are distinct. it follows that
u,   u,       ,   n   1u
are the roots of xn     a and all are in f [u] . thus f [u] = k. let        g (k, f) and observe
that since       xes f,

= (  n)k un = a

  ku

(

(

((

)n     a

))n     a

0 =   

  ku

=

  

  ku

it follows that    maps roots of xn     a to roots of xn     a. therefore, if   ,    are two elements
of g (k, f) , there exist i, j each no larger than n     1 such that

)

   (u) =   iu,    (u) =   ju

a typical thing in f [u] is p (u) where p (x)     f [x]. then

)

     (p (u)) = p

  j  iu
  i  ju

  i+ju
  i+ju

therefore, g (k, f) is abelian. (cid:4)
de   nition f.11.2 for f a    eld, a polynomial p (x)     f [x] is solvable by radicals over
f     f0 if there is a sequence of    elds f1 = f [a1] , f2 = f1 [a2] ,       , fk = fk   1 [ak] such that
for each i     1, aki
lemma f.11.3 in the above de   nition, you can assume that fk is a normal extension of
f.

    fi   1 and fk contains a splitting    eld k for p (x) over f.

i

proof: first note that fk = f [a1, a2,       , ak]. let g be the normal extension of fk.

by lemma f.7.3, g is the smallest    eld which contains the conjugate    elds

  j (f [a1, a2,       , ak]) = f

]

[

(

for {  1,   2,       ,   m

f = f. then

g = f [  1 (a1) ,   1 (a2) ,       ,   1 (ak) ,   2 (a1) ,   2 (a2) ,       ,   2 (ak)       ]

and this is a splitting    eld so is a normal extension. thus g could be the new fk with
respect to a longer sequence but would now be a splitting    eld. (cid:4)

at this point, it is a good idea to recall the big fundamental theorem mentioned above
which gives the correspondence between normal subgroups and normal    eld extensions since
it is about to be used again.

f     f0
g (f, f) = {  }     g (f1, f)     g (f2, f)

    f2

    f1

           fk   1
    fk     k
           g (fk   1, f)     g (fk, f)

(6.26)
theorem f.11.4 let k be a splitting    eld of any polynomial p (x)     f [x] where f is either
of characteristic 0 or of characteristic p with fp = f. let {fi}k
i=0 be the increasing sequence
of intermediate    elds between f and k. then each of these is a normal extension of f and
the galois group g (fj   1, f) is a normal subgroup of g (fj, f). in addition to this,

g (fj, f)     g (k, f) /g (k, fj)
where the symbol     indicates the two spaces are isomorphic.
theorem f.11.5 let f (x) be a polynomial in f [x] where f is a    eld of characteristic 0
which contains all nth roots of unity for each n     n. let k be a splitting    eld of f (x) . then
if f (x) is solvable by radicals over f, then the galois group g (k, f) is a solvable group.

proof: using the de   nition given above for f (x) to be solvable by radicals, there is a

sequence of    elds

f0 = f     f1                fk, k     fk,

    fi   1, and each    eld extension is a normal extension of the pre-
where fi = fi   1 [ai], aki
ceding one. you can assume that fk is the splitting    eld of a polynomial having coe   cients
in fj   1. this follows from the lemma f.11.3 above. then starting the hypotheses of the
theorem at fj   1 rather than at f, it follows from theorem f.11.4 that

i

g (fj, fj   1)     g (fk, fj   1) /g (fk, fj)

by lemma f.11.1, the galois group g (fj, fj   1) is abelian and so this requires that
g (fk, f) is a solvable group.
of course k is a normal    eld extension of f because it is a splitting    eld. by theo-
rem f.10.5, g (fk, k) is a normal subgroup of g (fk, f). also g (k, f) is isomorphic to
g (fk, f) /g (fk, k) and so g (k, f) is a homomorphic image of g (fk, f) which is solv-
able. here is why this last assertion is so. de   ne    : g (fk, f) /g (fk, k)     g (k, f) by
   [  ]       |k. then this is clearly a homomorphism if it is well de   ned.
if [  ] = [  ] this
   1    xes everything in k so that    is indeed well de   ned.
means     
therefore, by theorem f.10.5, g (k, f) must also be solvable. (cid:4)
or more by radicals. let {a1, a2,       , an}     g where g is some    eld which contains a    eld
f0. let
the    eld of all rational functions in the numbers a1, a2,       , an. i am using this notation
because i don   t want to assume the ai are algebraic over f. now consider the equation

now this result implies that you can   t solve the general polynomial equation of degree 5

   1     g (fk, k) and so     

f     f0 (a1, a2,       , an)

p (t) = tn     a1tn   1 + a2tn   2 +           an.

and suppose that p (t) has distinct roots, none of them in f. let k be a splitting    eld for
p (t) over f so that

n   

(t     ri)

p (t) =

k=1

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationfields and field extensions

484

then it follows that

ai = si (r1,       , rn)

where the si are the elementary symmetric functions de   ned in de   nition f.1.2. for       
g (k, f) you can de   ne          sn by the rule

     (k)     j where    (rk) = rj.

for example, consider 3x5     25x3 + 45x + 1 or equivalently x5     25

recall that the automorphisms of g (k, f) take roots of p (t) to roots of p (t). this mapping
            is onto, a homomorphism, and one to one because the symmetric functions si
are unchanged when the roots are permuted. thus a rational function in s1, s2,       , sn is
una   ected when the roots rk are permuted. it follows that g (k, f) cannot be solvable if
n     5 because sn is not solvable.
3 . it clearly
has no rational roots and a graph will show it has 5 real roots. let f be the smallest    eld
contained in c which contains the coe   cients of the polynomial and all roots of unity. then
probably none of these roots are in f and they are all distinct. in fact, it appears that the
real numbers which are in f are rational. therefore, from the above, none of the roots are
solvable by radicals involving numbers from f. thus none are solvable by radicals using
numbers from the smallest    eld containing the coe   cients either.

41 obviously not. because of the coriolis force expe-
rienced by the    red bullet which is not experienced
by the dropped bullet, it will not be as simple as
in the physics books. for example, if the bullet is
   red east, then y
sin    > 0 and will contribute to
a force acting on the bullet which has been    red
which will cause it to hit the ground faster than the
one dropped. of course at the north pole or the
south pole, things should be closer to what is ex-
pected in the physics books because there sin    = 0.
also, if you    re it north or south, there seems to
be no extra force because y

= 0.

that second vector is a particular solution.

25 show that the function tu de   ned by tu (v)     v    

proju (v) is also a linear transformation.
this is the sum of two linear transformations so it
is obviously linear.

33 let a basis for w be {w1,       , wr} then if there
exists v     v \ w, you could add in v to the basis
and obtain a linearly independent set of vectors of
v which implies that the dimension of v is at least
r + 1 contrary to assumption.

the degree of r (t) is either less than 3 or it equals
zero. thus an = q (a) l (a) + r (a) = r (a) and
so all the terms an for n     3 can be replaced with
some r (a) where the degree of r (t) is no more than
2. thus, assuming there are no convergence issues,
the in   nite sum must be of the form

so what is the dimension of the span of these? one
way to systematically accomplish this is to unravel
them and then use the row reduced echelon form.
unraveling these yields the column vectors

then arranging these as the columns of a matrix
yields the following along with its row reduced ech-
elon form.

the dimension is 5.

10 it is because you cannot have more than min (m, n)
nonzero rows in the row reduced echelon form. re-
call that the number of pivot columns is the same
as the number of nonzero rows from the description
of this row reduced echelon form.

saylor url: http://www.saylor.org/courses/ma212/the saylor foundationg.10. exercises

11 it follows from the fact that e1,       , em occur as

columns in row reduced echelon form that the di-
mension of the column space of a is n and so, since
this column space is a (rn) , it follows that it equals
fm.

   

   

12 since m > n the dimension of the column space of
a is no more than n and so the columns of a cannot
span fm.

15 if

i cizi = 0, apply a to both sides to obtain

i ciwi = 0. by assumption, each ci = 0.

19 there are more columns than rows and at most m
can be pivot columns so it follows at least one col-
umn is a linear combination of the others hence a
is not one too one.

21 |b   ay|2 = |b   ax+ax   ay|2
(

)
= |b   ax|2 + |ax     ay|2 + 2 (b   ax,a (x     y))
= |b   ax|2+|ax     ay|2+2
at b   at ax, (x     y)
= |b   ax|2 + |ax     ay|2and so, ax is closest to b
out of all vectors ay.

27 no.

29 let a be an m    n matrix. then ker (a) is a sub-
space of fn. is it true that every subspace of fn is
the kernel or null space of some matrix? prove or
disprove.
let m be a subspace of fn. if it equals {0} , consider
the matrix i. otherwise, it has a basis {m1,       , mk} .

consider the matrix

(

       mk 0

m1

where 0 is either not there in case k = n or has
n     k columns.

30 this is easy to see when you consider that p ij is
its own inverse and that p ij multiplied on the right
switches the ith and jth columns. thus you switch
the columns and then you switch the rows. this has
the e   ect of switching aii and ajj. for example,

             1 0

more formally, the iith entry of p ijap ij is

31 if a has an inverse, then it is one to one. hence the
columns are independent. therefore, they are each
pivot columns. therefore, the row reduced echelon
form of a is i. this is what was needed for the
procedure to work.

this is not defective.

25 first consider the eigenvalue    = 1. then you have
ax2 = 0, bx3 = 0. if neither a nor b = 0 then
   = 1 would be a defective eigenvalue and the ma-
trix would be defective. if a = 0, then the dimen-
sion of the eigenspace is clearly 2 and so the ma-
if b = 0 but a   = 0,
trix would be nondefective.
then you would have a defective matrix because the
eigenspace would have dimension less than 2.
if
c   = 0, then the matrix is defective. if c = 0 and
a = 0, then it is non defective. basically, if a, c   = 0,
then the matrix is defective.

31 this follows from the observation that if ax =   x,

493
and so    =        . thus a + ib =     (a     ib) and so
a = 0.

15 you can see these are not similar by noticing that
the second has an eigenspace of dimension equal to
1 so it is not similar to any diagonal matrix which
is what the    rst one is.

19 this is because the general solution is yp + y where
ayp = b and ay = 0. now a0 = 0 and so the so-
lution is unique precisely when this is the only so-
lution y to ay = 0.

19 if ax =   x, then you can take the norm of both
sides and conclude that |  | = 1. it follows that the

has magnitude 1 and is real. this can only be 1 or
   1. since the determinant is given to be 1, it follows
that it is 1. therefore, there exists an eigenvector
for the eigenvalue 1.
