takeaways

    short text understanding is challenging because of it is 

sparse, noisy, and ambiguous

    short text understanding can benefit lots of applications 

such as search engines, automatic id53, 
online advertising, id126s, and 
conversational bot.

takeaways

    explicit short text understanding: using semantic networks or 

knowledge bases for short text segmentation, sense 
disambiguation, syntax structure, and semantic similarity

    single instance

    is this instance ambiguous?
    what are its basic-level concepts?
    what are its similar instances?

    short text

    how to segment this short text?
    what does this short text mean (its intent, senses, or concepts)?
    what are the relations among terms in the short text?
    how to calculate the similarity between short texts?

takeaways

    implicit short text understanding: leverage big data and
learning based techniques (especially deep learning) to 
model latent semantic representation for short texts

    word level

    with distributional hypothesis
    without distributional hypothesis

    phrase/ short text level

    using contextual knowledge
    using external knowledge
    short text/sentence level

    composition models
    non-composition models
