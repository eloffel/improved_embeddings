quick intro

   this is the first part of our deep learning tutorial with tensorflow.
   the idea of id158s (anns) is based on the belief
   that working of the human brain by making the right connections, can be
   mimicked using silicon and wires as living neurons and dendrites. it
   has been around since the 1940   s and has had a few ups and downs. there
   was mostly nothing interesting until about 2011, when deep neural
   networks began to take hold and outperform the support vector machines,
   using new techniques, huge data set availability, and much more
   powerful computers.


biological motivation and connections

   the model of the neural network is actually a very simple concept. the
   idea is to mimic a neuron, and, in a basic neuron, you have the
   dendrites, a nucleus, axon, and terminal axon. a neural network has a
   network of neurons which aren   t actually connected (axon terminal with
   dendrites) according to our present knowledge but between them, our
   messages are sent and that is synapse.

   we basically have inputs so looking here we have some raw data, suppose
   0,0,1, those inputs come in and in theory does something and sends the
   data down the axon which possibly fires and passes through synapse or
   may be to next neuron which in turn to the next and the next and so on
   to get the result.

   the human brain is composed of 100 billion neurons. they are connected
   (not actually) to other thousand cells by axons. stimuli from external
   environment or inputs from sensory organs are accepted by dendrites
   (our data sets) . these inputs create electric impulses, which quickly
   travel through the neural network (processing). a neuron may then send
   the message to other neuron to handle the issue or may not send it
   forward.


a basic neural network

   now computer scientists come in thinking we got this. so they propose a
   model of an artificial neuron that looks like:

   each input has an associated weight (w), which is assigned on the basis
   of its relative importance to other inputs. the node applies a
   function f (defined below) to the weighted sum of its inputs as shown
   in figure below:

   the above network takes numerical inputs x1 and x2 and has weights w1
   and w2 associated with those inputs. additionally, there is another
   input 1 with weight b (called the bias) associated with it which we
   will worry about later.

   the output axon from the neuron is computed as shown in the figure
   . the function f is non-linear and is called the activation
   function. the purpose of the activation function is to introduce
   non-linearity into the output of a neuron. this is important because
   most real world data is non linear and we want neurons to learn
   these non linear representations.

   every activation function (or non-linearity) takes a single number and
   performs a certain fixed mathematical operation on it [2]. there are
   several id180 you may encounter in practice:
     * sigmoid: takes a real-valued input and squashes it to range between
       0 and 1

     (x) = 1 / (1 + exp(   x))
     * tanh: takes a real-valued input and squashes it to the range [-1,
       1]

   tanh(x) = 2  (2x)     1
     * relu: relu stands for rectified linear unit. it takes a real-valued
       input and thresholds it at zero (replaces negative values with
       zero)

   f(x) = max(0, x)


   now let see what a neural network to scale looks like.

   if you are learning neural networks you must have seen this diagram
   many times. the circles are neurons or nodes, with their functions on
   the data and the lines connecting them are the weights/information
   being passed along. each column is a layer. the first layer of your
   data is the input layer. then, unless your output is your input, you
   have at least one hidden layer. if you just have one hidden layer, then
   you have a regular id158. if you elect to have many
   hidden layers you have yourself a deep neural network. wasn   t that
   easy?    well at least in concept.

   this specific model  is what we call a feed-forward neural network. the
   information flow is unidirectional. they are specifically used  in
   pattern generation/recognition/classification which we will cover in
   our upcoming tutorials.

   a feed-forward neural network can consist of three types of nodes:
    1. input nodes    the input nodes provide information from the outside
       world to the network and are together referred to as the    input
       layer   . no computation is performed in any of the input nodes    
       they just pass on the information to the hidden nodes.
    2. hidden nodes     the hidden nodes have no direct connection with the
       outside world (hence the name    hidden   ). they perform computations
       and transfer information from the input nodes to the output nodes.
       a collection of hidden nodes forms a    hidden layer   . while a
       feed-forward network will only have a single input layer and a
       single output layer, it can have zero or multiple hidden layers.
    3. output nodes     the output nodes are collectively referred to as the
          output layer    and are responsible for computations and
       transferring information from the network to the outside world.

   machine learning algorithms have been good at classification tasks but
   they are not very good at modeling logic and figuring out how to do
   that up until recently. if you want to make an algorithm to answer a
   logical question you would have to model that logic somehow which means
   you have to know linguistics and stuff like that whereas in neural
   network you give a few examples, keep doing that like few million
   times, and the neural network can figure out on its own the model and
   the logic, which is  so fascinating.
