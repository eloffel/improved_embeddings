about the technology

   machine learning has made remarkable progress in recent years. we went
   from near-unusable speech and image recognition, to near-human
   accuracy. we went from machines that couldn't beat a serious go player,
   to defeating a world champion. behind this progress is deep learning   a
   combination of engineering advances, best practices, and theory that
   enables a wealth of previously impossible smart applications.
