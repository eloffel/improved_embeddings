   opendial is a java-based, domain-independent toolkit for developing
   spoken dialogue systems. opendial was originally designed to perform
   dialogue management tasks, but it can also be used to build
   full-fledged dialogue systems, integrating e.g. id103,
   language understanding, generation, id133, multimodal
   processing and situation awareness.

   the purpose of opendial is to combine the benefits of logical and
   statistical approaches to dialogue modelling. the toolkit relies on
   probabilistic rules to represent the domain models in a compact and
   human-readable format. supervised or id23 techniques
   can be applied to estimate unknown parameters from small amounts of
   data (see [21]lison (2014) for details). the hybrid approach adopted by
   opendial makes it possible to easy incorporate expert knowledge and
   domain-specific constraints within a robust, probabilistic framework.

   opendial is designed as a blackboard architecture in which all modules
   are connected to a central information hub representing the dialogue
   state (encoded as a id110). a collection of [22]plugins is
   available to connect external components for id103,
   parsing, id133, etc.. new modules can also be easily
   implemented and integrated into the  architecture.

   the toolkit has been originally developed by the [23]language
   technology group of the university of oslo (norway), with [24]pierre
   lison as main developer.

news:

   [05.04.2016]   new release: version 1.5 of opendial! the new version
   includes new functionalities such as the support for custom functions
   and the ability to directly manipulate relational structures - such as
   dependency trees or hierarchical tasks - in the probabilistic rules.
   [17.07.2015]
   version 1.4 of opendial is out! it includes an interactive domain
   editor to easily design and evaluate dialogue domains.  the build
   framework is also switched to [25]gradle.
   [07.05.2015] a new release of opendial (version 1.3) is available. the
   release includes bug fixes, performance improvements and new
   functionalities  (such as voice activity recognition).
   [25.03.2015] due to google code's shutdown, the opendial toolkit has
   migrated to a new website: [26]http://opendial-toolkit.net, while the
   code repository is moved to [27]github.
    [08.12.2014] the version 1.1 of opendial is out! see the [28]release
   notes to know more about the latest upgrades and extensions. one
   important change is the switch to java 8.
   [18.04.2014] an updated version (0.95) of opendial is now released! one
   can now connect various plugins into the architecture. there is also
   basic support for incremental processing.
    [04.02.2014] see [29]here to watch opendial deployed in a situated
   dialogue system for id176 (using the nao robot as
   robotic platform).
    [31.01.2014] version 0.9 of opendial is finally available! the version
   contains a refactored and documented code base, an improved graphical
   interface, concrete examples of dialogue domains, and a collection of
   unit tests.
