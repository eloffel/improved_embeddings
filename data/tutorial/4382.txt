duckling [88]build status

   duckling is a haskell library that parses text into structured data.
"the first tuesday of october"
=> {"value":"2017-10-03t00:00:00.000-07:00","grain":"day"}

requirements

   a haskell environment is required. we recommend using [89]stack.

   on macos you'll need to install pcre development headers. the easiest
   way to do that is with [90]homebrew:
brew install pcre

   if that doesn't help, try running brew doctor and fix the issues it
   finds.

quickstart

   to compile and run the binary:
$ stack build
$ stack exec duckling-example-exe

   the first time you run it, it will download all required packages.

   this runs a basic http server. example request:
$ curl -xpost http://0.0.0.0:8000/parse --data 'locale=en_gb&text=tomorrow at ei
ght'

   see exe/examplemain.hs for an example on how to integrate duckling in
   your project. if your backend doesn't run haskell or if you don't want
   to spin your own duckling server, you can directly use [91]wit.ai's
   built-in entities.

supported dimensions

   duckling supports many languages, but most don't support all dimensions
   yet (we need your help!). please look into [92]this directory for
   language-specific support.
   dimension example input example value output
   amountofmoney "42   " {"value":42,"type":"value","unit":"eur"}
   creditcardnumber "4111-1111-1111-1111"
   {"value":"4111111111111111","issuer":"visa"}
   distance "6 miles" {"value":6,"type":"value","unit":"mile"}
   duration "3 mins"
   {"value":3,"minute":3,"unit":"minute","normalized":{"value":180,"unit":
   "second"}}
   email "[93]duckling-team@fb.com" {"value":"duckling-team@fb.com"}
   numeral "eighty eight" {"value":88,"type":"value"}
   ordinal "33rd" {"value":33,"type":"value"}
   phonenumber "+1 (650) 123-4567" {"value":"(+1) 6501234567"}
   quantity "3 cups of sugar"
   {"value":3,"type":"value","product":"sugar","unit":"cup"}
   temperature "80f" {"value":80,"type":"value","unit":"fahrenheit"}
   time "today at 9am"
   {"values":[{"value":"2016-12-14t09:00:00.000-08:00","grain":"hour","typ
   e":"value"}],"value":"2016-12-14t09:00:00.000-08:00","grain":"hour","ty
   pe":"value"}
   url "[94]https://api.wit.ai/message?q=hi"
   {"value":"https://api.wit.ai/message?q=hi","domain":"api.wit.ai"}
   volume "4 gallons" {"value":4,"type":"value","unit":"gallon"}

   [95]custom dimensions are also supported.

extending duckling

   to regenerate the classifiers and run the test suite:
$ stack build :duckling-regen-exe && stack exec duckling-regen-exe && stack test

   it's important to regenerate the classifiers after updating the code
   and before running the test suite.

   to extend duckling's support for a dimension in a given language,
   typically 3 files need to be updated:
     * duckling/<dimension>/<lang>/rules.hs
     * duckling/<dimension>/<lang>/corpus.hs
     * duckling/dimensions/<lang>.hs (if not already present in
       duckling/dimensions/common.hs)

   to add a new language:
     * make sure that the language code used follows the [96]iso-639-1
       standard.
     * the first dimension to implement is numeral.
     * follow [97]this example.

   to add a new locale:
     * there should be a need for diverging rules between the locale and
       the language.
     * make sure that the locale code is a valid [98]iso3166 alpha2
       country code.
     * follow [99]this example.

   rules have a name, a pattern and a production. patterns are used to
   perform character-level matching (regexes on input) and concept-level
   matching (predicates on tokens). productions are arbitrary functions
   that take a list of tokens and return a new token.

   the corpus (resp. negative corpus) is a list of examples that should
   (resp. shouldn't) parse. the reference time for the corpus is tuesday
   feb 12, 2013 at 4:30am.

   duckling.debug provides a few debugging tools:
$ stack repl --no-load
> :l duckling.debug
> debug (makelocale en $ just us) "in two minutes" [this time]
in|within|after <duration> (in two minutes)
-- regex (in)
-- <integer> <unit-of-duration> (two minutes)
-- -- integer (0..19) (two)
-- -- -- regex (two)
-- -- minute (grain) (minutes)
-- -- -- regex (minutes)
[entity {dim = "time", body = "in two minutes", value = rval time (timevalue (si
mplevalue (instantvalue {vvalue = 2013-02-12 04:32:00 -0200, vgrain = second}))
[simplevalue (instantvalue {vvalue = 2013-02-12 04:32:00 -0200, vgrain = second}
)] nothing), start = 0, end = 14}]
