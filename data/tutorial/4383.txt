customer stories

a healthcare startup used rasa to add hipaa-compliant natural language
understanding to their app, in just days

   [43]tia, a leading san francisco-based women's health focused company,
   was able to build, train, and deploy their own on-prem ai assistant,
   with team-wide input even from non-developers.

   using rasa's contextual dialogue ai, tia could focus on a compelling
   and caring user experience, and continuously add new training data,
   while learning from real user interactions.
