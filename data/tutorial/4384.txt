id95 explained in simple terms!

   [97]tavish srivastava, april 12, 2015

   in my previous article, we talked about [98]information retrieval. we
   also talked about how machine can read the context from a free
   text. let   s talk about the biggest web information retrieval engine
   i.e. google! imagine, you were to create google search in a world
   devoid of any search engine. what could be the basic rules you will
   code to build such a search engine?  if your answer is to use term
   frequency or tf-idf kind of framework, consider following case:

   a user enters the query :    harvard business school   . he expects the
   first link to be    http://www.harvard.edu/   .  but what would your
   algorithm do? it would try to find out pages which has the word
      harvard    maximum number of times, as    business    and    school    will come
   out to be common words. now, there is a possibility that    harvard   
   keyword might not be repeated multiple times on harvard   s own website.
   however, websites like business school consultants or articles on
   business school might have this keyword multiple times. this leads
   these websites to achieve a rank much higher than the actual business
   school website.

   but, do search engines like google face this challenge today? obviously
   not! this is because they take help of an algorithm known as id95.
   in this article, we will discuss the concept of id95. in the next
   article, we will take this algorithm a step forward by leveraging it to
   find the most important packages in r.

   [99]googlepr



an artificial web world

   imagine a web which has only 4 web pages, which are linked to each
   other. each of the box below represents a web page. the words written
   in black and italics are the links between pages.

   [100]1st chart

   for instance, in the web page    tavish   , it has 3 outgoing links : to
   the other three web pages. now, let   s draw a simpler directed graph of
   this ecosystem.

   [101]directed here is how google ranks a page : the page with maximum
   number of incoming links is the most important page.  in the current
   example, we see that the    kunal jain    page comes out as the most
   significant page.


mathematical formulation of google page rank

   first step of the formulation is to build a direction matrix. this
   matrix will have each cell as the proportion of the outflow. for
   instance, tavish (ts) has 3 outgoing links which makes each proportion
   as 1/3.

   [102]matrix


   now we imagine that if there were a bot which will follow all the
   outgoing links, what will be the total time spent by this bot on each
   of these pages. this can be broken down mathematically into following
   equation :
a * x = x

   here a is the proportions matrix mentioned above

   x is the id203 of the bot being on each of these pages

   [103]multiply

   clearly, we see that kunal jain   s page in this universe comes out to be
   most important which goes in the same direction as our intuition.


teleportation adjustments

   now, imagine a scenario where we have only 2 web pages : a and b. a has
   a link to b but b has no external links. in such cases, if you try
   solving the matrix, you will get a zero matrix. this looks unreasonable
   as b looks to be more important than a. but, our algorithm still
   gives same importance for both. to solve for this problem, a new
   concept of teleporatation was introduced. we include a constant
   id203 of alpha to each of these pages. this is to compensate for
   instances where a user teleports from one webpage to other without any
   link. hence, the equation is modified to the following equation :
(1-alpha) * a * x + alpha * b = x

   here, b is a constant unit column matrix. alpha is the proportion of
   teleportation. the most common value taken for alpha is 0.15 (but can
   depend on different cases).


other uses of id95 & end notes

   in this article we discussed the most significant use of id95. but,
   the use of id95 is no way restricted to search engines. here are a
   few other uses of id95 :
    1. finding how well connected a person is on social media : one of the
       unexplored territory in social media analytics is the network
       information. using this network information we can estimate how
       influential is the user. and therefore prioritize our efforts to
       please the most influential customers. networks can be easily
       analyzed using page rank algorithm.
    2. fraud detection in pharmaceutical industry : many countries
       including us struggle with the problem of high percentage medical
       frauds. such frauds can be spotted using page rank algorithm.
    3. understand the importance of packages in any programming language :
       page rank algorithm can also be used to understand the layers of
       packages used in languages like r and python. we will take up this
       topic in our next article.

   thinkpot: can you think of more usage of page rank algorithm?  share
   with us useful links to leverage page rank algorithm in various fields.

       this is very interesting. i am a beginner at r programming but i   d
       like to know how could you calculate x from the equation using r:
       a * x = x
       same goes for teleportation adjustment equation:
       (1-alpha) * a * x + alpha * b = x
       how to calculate x given a, b & alpha ?

       chitranjan,
       a * x can be solved using a simultaneous equations. lets say there
       are only 2 states with
       a = [[a1 , a2];[a3 , a4]] and x = [x1 , x2]
       a * x = [a1 x1 + a2 x2 , a3x1 + a4x2]
       hence you need to solve,
       [a1 x1 + a2 x2 , a3x1 + a4x2] = [x1 , x2]
       =>a1 x1 + a2 x2 = x1
       => a3x1 + a4x2 = x2
       here ai are all constants whereas xs are the changing variables.
       similar kind of logic can be applied for the alpha equation.
       hope this helps.

       tavish sir thanks for helping the post. sir in the above example
       which you mentioned i understand how you calculate a matrix using
       total id203 is 1 and if has three outbound link so each may
       have id203 0.33. but i dont understand how do you arrive the
       figure of [0.40,0.12,0.24,0.24]. could you please explain this. i
       am working in digital marketing company so want to know more about
       the algorithm please show some link from where i can understand
       easily about the algorithm. i am waiting for your reply of both the
       questions.

       other use of page ranking can be in banking industry for skip
       tracing in collections.
       page rank can also be used in credit risk for score card
       preparation as one of the attaribute for score card.

       in telecom industry ,page rank can be used to identify priority
       customer which is using most of the services of the operator with
       good amount of revenue.

       thanks tavish! insightful article. quite some time back, i have
       done a course on edx    networks, crowds and markets    from cornellx.
       page rank algorithm was one of of the key components of the class
       and was demonstrated to be a key tool in analysing social networks
       with respect to markets. before that i used to knew page rank as a
       google   s secret sauce only. i can relate a lot to that.

       complex concepts explained in simple terms in your blog.
       could you please publish an article on any practical example that
       uses id115 ?
