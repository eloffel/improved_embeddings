caffe2 tutorials overview

   we   d love to start by saying that we really appreciate your interest in
   caffe2, and hope this will be a high-performance framework for your
   machine learning product uses. caffe2 is intended to be modular and
   facilitate fast prototyping of ideas and experiments in deep learning.
   given this modularity, note that once you have a model defined, and you
   are interested in gaining additional performance and scalability, you
   are able to use pure c++ to deploy such models without having to use
   python in your final product. also, as the community develops enhanced
   and high-performance modules you are able to easily swap these modules
   into your caffe2 project.

tutorials installation

   first download the tutorials source.
 1

 git clone --recursive https://github.com/caffe2/tutorials caffe2_tutorials


   to run the tutorials you will need some third-party libraries,
   including [40]ipython-notebooks and [41]matplotlib. you can install
   everything you   ll need with the following command.

     anaconda users: if you   re using anaconda, use conda install instead
     of pip install.

 pip install -u pip setuptools
pip install \
    graphviz \
    hypothesis \
    ipython \
    jupyter \
    matplotlib \
    notebook \
    pydot \
    python-nvd3 \
    pyyaml \
    requests \
    scikit-image \
    scipy


   some of the tutorials also use these packages that are not in pip.

   for mac run : brew install unzip zeromq

   for ubuntu run : apt-get install unzip zeromq

   for centos run : yum install unzip zeromq

   then run the shell script in the caffe2_tutorials folder:
 1

 ./start_ipython_notebook.sh


   or you can run jupyter notebook, and when your browser opens with your
   local jupyter server (default is http://localhost:8888), browse to the
   caffe2 repository and look for them in the caffe2_tutorials directory.
   opening them this way will launch their interactive features just like
   the shell script mentioned above. the script has the additional feature
   of setting your pythonpath environment variable.

pick your path

    1. [42]use a pre-trained neural network off the shelf! (easy)
    2. [43]make my own neural network! (intermediate)
    3. [44]mobile first! i want to make an app that uses deep learning!
       (advanced)

   if you chose 1, click the link to where several examples are using
   pre-trained models and we will show you how to get a demo project up
   and running in minutes.

   if you chose 2 then you   ll need some background in neural networking
   first. have that dialed in already? skip ahead to the link. need a
   primer or a refresher? some resources are listed below.

   if you chose 3, click the link to discover how to have image
   classification in your android or ios app. it   s pretty much plug-n-play
   with android studio or xcode, but you   ll need to integrate directly
   with caffe2   s c++ hooks.

   with any choice, don   t forget to come back and check out the tutorials
   in each section. you never know what you might learn!

new to deep learning

   a broad introduction is given in the free online draft of [49]neural
   networks and deep learning by michael nielsen. in particular the
   chapters on using neural nets and how id26 works are helpful
   if you are new to the subject.

   for an exposition of neural networks in circuits and code, check out
   [50]hacker   s guide to neural networks by andrej karpathy (stanford).

experienced researchers in some facet of machine learning

   the [51]tutorial on deep learning for vision from cvpr    14 is a good
   companion tutorial for researchers. once you have the framework and
   practice foundations from the caffe tutorial, explore the fundamental
   ideas and advanced research directions in the cvpr    14 tutorial.

   these recent academic tutorials cover deep learning for researchers in
   machine learning and vision:
     * [52]deep learning tutorial by yann lecun (nyu, facebook) and
       marc   aurelio ranzato (facebook). icml 2013 tutorial.
     * [53]lisa deep learning tutorial by the lisa lab directed by yoshua
       bengio (u. montr  al).

tutorials and example scripts

   the ipython notebook tutorials and example scripts we have provided
   below will guide you through the caffe2 python interface. some
   tutorials have been generously provided by the caffe community and we
   welcome more contributions of this kind to help others get ramped up
   more quickly and to try out the many different uses of caffe2. the
   ipython notebook tutorials can be browsed or downloaded using the links
   below each tutorial   s title. you may browse these ipynb files on github
   directly and this is the preferred route if you just want to look at
   the code and try it out for yourself. however, it is recommended to run
   them in jupyter notebook and take advantage of their interactivity.
   [54]installation instructions below will show you how to do this. skip
   this part if you want to jump right into the tutorial descriptions
   below.

example scripts

   there are example scripts that can be found in
   [55]/caffe2/python/examples that are also great resources for starting
   off on a project using caffe2.
     * [56]char_id56.py: generate a recurrent convolution neural network
       that will sample text that you input and randomly generate text of
       a similar style. the [57]id56 and lstm page has further info on this
       script   s usage.
     * [58]lmdb_create_example.py: create an lmdb database of random image
       data and labels that can be used a skeleton to write your own data
       import
     * [59]resnet50_trainer.py: parallelized multi-gpu distributed trainer
       for resnet 50. can be used to train on id163 data, for example.
       the [60]synchronous sgd page has further info on this script   s
       usage.

intermediate tutorials

[70]mnist - handwriting recognition

   this tutorial creates a small convolutional neural network (id98) that
   can identify handwriting. the train and test the id98, we use
   handwriting imagery from the mnist dataset. this is a collection of
   60,000 images of 500 different people   s handwriting that is used for
   training your id98. another set of 10,000 test images (different from
   the training images) is used to test the accuracy of the resulting id98.

[71]create your own dataset

   try your hand at importing and massaging data so it can be used in
   caffe2. this tutorial uses the iris dataset.

advanced tutorials

[72]multi-gpu training with caffe2

   for this tutorial we will explore multi-gpu training. we will show you
   a basic structure for using the data_parallel_model to quickly process
   a subset of the id163 database along the same design as the
   [73]resnet-50 model. we will also get a chance to look under the hood
   at a few of caffe2   s c++ operators that efficiently handle your image
   pipeline, build a resnet model, train on a single gpu and show some
   optimizations that are included with data_parallel_model, and finally
   we   ll scale it up and show you how to parallelize your model so you can
   run it on multiple gpus.
