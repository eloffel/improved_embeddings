10 advanced deep learning architectures data scientists should know!

   [97]faizan shaikh, august 9, 2017

introduction

   it is becoming very hard to stay up to date with recent advancements
   happening in deep learning. hardly a day goes by without a new
   innovation or a new application of deep learning coming by. however,
   most of these advancements are hidden inside the large amount of
   research papers that are published on mediums like arxiv / springer

   to keep ourselves updated, we have created a small reading group to
   share our learnings internally at analytics vidhya. one such learning i
   would like to share with the community is a a survey of advanced
   architectures which have been developed by the research community.

   this article contains some of the recent advancements in deep learning
   along with codes for implementation in keras library. i have also
   provided links to the original papers, in case you are interested in
   reading them or want to refer them.

   to keep the article concise, i have only considered the architectures
   which have been successful in id161 domain.

   if you are interested, read on!

   p.s.: this article assumes the knowledge of neural networks and
   familiarity with keras. if you need to catch up on these topics, i
   would strongly recommend you read the following articles first:
     * [98]fundamentals of deep learning     starting with artificial neural
       network
     * [99]tutorial: optimizing neural networks using keras (with image
       recognition case study)

     * types of id161 tasks
     * list of deep learning architectures


what do we mean by an advanced architecture?

   deep learning algorithms consists of such a diverse set of models in
   comparison to a single traditional machine learning algorithm. this is
   because of the flexibility that neural network provides when building a
   full fledged end-to-end model.

   neural network can sometimes be compared with lego blocks, where you
   can build almost any simple to complex structure your imagination helps
   you to build.

   we can define an advanced architecture as one that has a proven track
   record of being a successful model. this is mainly seen in challenges
   like id163, where your task is to solve a problem, say image
   recognition, using the data given. those who don   t know what id163
   is, it is the dataset which is provided in ilsvr (id163 large scale
   visual recognition) challenge.

   also as described in the below mentioned architectures, each of them
   has a nuance which sets them apart from the usual models; giving them
   an edge when they are used to solve a problem. these architectures also
   fall in the category of    deep    models, so they are likely to perform
   better than their shallow counterparts.


types of id161 tasks

   this article is mainly focused on id161, so it is natural to
   describe the horizon of id161 tasks. id161; as the
   name suggests is simply creating artificial models which can replicate
   the visual tasks performed by a human. this essentially means what we
   can see and what we perceive is a process which can be understood and
   implemented in an artificial system.

   the main types of tasks that id161 can be categorised in are
   as follows:
     * object recognition / classification     in object recognition, you
       are given a raw image and your task is to identify which class does
       the image belong to.
     * classification + localisation     if there is only one object in the
       image, and your task is to find the location of that object, a more
       specific term given to this problem is localisation problem.
     * id164     in id164, you task is to identify
       where in the image does the objects lies in. these objects might be
       of the same class or different class altogether.
     * image segmentation     image segmentation is a bit sophisticated
       task, where the objective is to map each pixel to its rightful
       class.


list of deep learning architectures

   now that we have understood what an advanced architecture is and
   explored the tasks of id161, let us list down the most
   important architectures and their descriptions:

1. alexnet

   alexnet is the first deep architecture which was introduced by one of
   the pioneers in deep learning     geoffrey hinton and his colleagues. it
   is a simple yet powerful network architecture, which helped pave the
   way for groundbreaking research in deep learning as it is now. here is
   a representation of the architecture as proposed by the authors.

   when broken down, alexnet seems like a simple architecture with
   convolutional and pooling layers one on top of the other, followed by
   fully connected layers at the top. this is a very simple architecture,
   which was conceptualised way back in 1980s. the things which set apart
   this model is the scale at which it performs the task and the use of
   gpu for training. in 1980s, cpu was used for training a neural network.
   whereas alexnet speeds up the training by 10 times just by the use of
   gpu.

   although a bit outdated at the moment, alexnet is still used as a
   starting point for applying deep neural networks for all the tasks,
   whether it be id161 or id103.

2. vgg net

   the vgg network was introduced by the researchers at visual graphics
   group at oxford (hence the name vgg). this network is specially
   characterized by its pyramidal shape, where the bottom layers which are
   closer to the image are wide, whereas the top layers are deep.

   as the image depicts, vgg contains subsequent convolutional layers
   followed by pooling layers. the pooling layers are responsible for
   making the layers narrower. in their paper, they proposed multiple such
   types of networks, with change in deepness of the architecture.

   the advantages of vgg are :
     * it is a very good architecture for benchmarking on a particular
       task.
     * also, pre-trained networks for vgg are available freely on the
       internet, so it is commonly used out of the box for various
       applications.

   on the other hand, its main disadvantage is that it is very slow to
   train if trained from scratch. even on a decent gpu, it would take more
   than a week to get it to work.
     * [102]original paper link
     * [103]link for code implementation


3. googlenet

   googlenet (or inception network) is a class of architecture designed by
   researchers at google. googlenet was the winner of id163 2014, where
   it proved to be a powerful model.

   in this architecture, along with going deeper (it contains 22 layers in
   comparison to vgg which had 19 layers), the researchers also made a
   novel approach called the inception module.

   as seen above, it is a drastic change from the sequential architectures
   which we saw previously. in a single layer, multiple types of    feature
   extractors    are present. this indirectly helps the network perform
   better, as the network at training itself has many options to choose
   from when solving the task. it can either choose to convolve the input,
   or to pool it directly.

   the final architecture contains multiple of these inception modules
   stacked one over the other. even the training is slightly different in
   googlenet, as most of the topmost layers have their own output layer.
   this nuance helps the model converge faster, as there is a joint
   training as well as parallel training for the layers itself.

   the advantages of googlenet are :
     * googlenet trains faster than vgg.
     * size of a pre-trained googlenet is comparatively smaller than vgg.
       a vgg model can have >500 mbs, whereas googlenet has a size of only
       96 mb

   googlenet does not have an immediate disadvantage per se, but further
   changes in the architecture  are proposed, which make the model perform
   better. one such change is termed as an xception network, in which the
   limit of divergence of inception module (4 in googlenet as we saw in
   the image above) are increased. it can now theoretically be infinite
   (hence called extreme inception!)

4. resnet

   resnet is one of the monster architectures which truly define how deep
   a deep learning architecture can be. residual networks (resnet in
   short) consists of multiple subsequent residual modules, which are the
   basic building block of resnet architecture. a representation of
   residual module is as follows

   in simple words, a residual module has two options, either it can
   perform a set of functions on the input, or it can skip this step
   altogether.

   now similar to googlenet, these residual modules are stacked one over
   the other to form a complete end-to-end network.

   a few more novel techniques which resnet introduced are:
     * use of standard sgd instead of a fancy adaptive learning technique.
       this is done along with a reasonable initialization function which
       keeps the training intact
     * changes in preprocessing the input, where the input is first
       divided into patches and then feeded into the network

   the main advantage of resnet is that hundreds, even thousands of these
   residual layers can be used to create a network and then trained. this
   is a bit different from usual sequential networks, where you see that
   there is reduced performance upgrades as you increase the number of
   layers.

5. resnext

   resnext is said to be the current state-of-the-art technique for object
   recognition. it builds upon the concepts of inception and resnet to
   bring about a new and improved architecture. below image is a
   summarization of how a residual module of resnext module looks like.

6. rid98 (region based id98)

   region based id98 architecture is said to be the most influential of all
   the deep learning architectures that have been applied to object
   detection problem. to solve detection problem, what rid98 does is to
   attempt to draw a bounding box over all the objects present in the
   image, and then recognize what object is in the image. it works as
   follows:

   the structure of rid98 is as follows:

     * [111]link for code implementation


7. yolo (you only look once)

   yolo is the current state-of-the-art real time system built on deep
   learning for solving image detection problems. as seen in the below
   given image, it first divides the image into defined bounding boxes,
   and then runs a recognition algorithm in parallel for all of these
   boxes to identify which object class do they belong to. after
   identifying this classes, it goes on to merging these boxes
   intelligently to form an optimal bounding box around the objects.

   all of this is done in parallely, so it can run in real time;
   processing upto 40 images in a second.

   although it gives reduced performance than its rid98 counterpart, it
   still has an advantage of being real time to be viable for use in
   day-to-day problems. here is a representation of architecture of yolo

8. squeezenet

   the squeezenet architecture is one more powerful architecture which is
   extremely useful in low bandwidth scenarios like mobile platforms. this
   architecture has occupies only 4.9mb of space, on the other hand,
   inception occupies ~100mb! this drastic change is brought up by a
   specialized structure called the fire module. below image is a
   representation of fire module.

   the final architecture of squeezenet is as follows:

     * [114]original paper link
     * [115]link for code implementation


9. segnet

   segnet is a deep learning architecture applied to solve image
   segmentation problem. it consists of sequence of processing layers
   (encoders) followed by a corresponding set of decoders for a pixelwise
   classification . below image summarizes the working of segnet.

   one key feature of segnet is that it retains high frequency details in
   segmented image as the pooling indices of encoder network is connected
   to pooling indices of decoder networks. in short, the information
   transfer is direct instead of convolving them. segnet is one the the
   best model to use when dealing with image segmentation problems

10. gan (generative adversarial network)

   gan is an entirely different breed of neural network architectures, in
   which a neural network is used to generate an entirely new image which
   is not present is the training dataset, but is realistic enough to be
   in the dataset. for example, below image is a breakdown of gans are
   made of. i have covered [118]how gans work in this article. go through
   it if you are curious.

            perhaps the aim is a bit different for both the post. his
            seems to cover more of a broader horizon of deep learning

            deep learning.

       you should have more neural networks for string processing.
       unfortunately, you   ve only described deep neural networks for
       imaging. where would data scientist written in the title of your

            hi murilo, i deliberately covered image processing for deep
            learning in this article for two reasons.
            1. deep learning for image processing is more developed in
            comparison to other domains
            2. most of the techniques mentioned here may be replicated to
            other domains too (with some caveats)
            although i agree with you that there are more architectures
            which are specific to other domains like nlp. i will aim to
            cover them in the subsequent article

            hi sam, pretraining is a somewhat different concept     which
            essentially means that you dont have to train the model again
            to use them for prediction. this article mentions different
            deep learning architectures, which may be trained from scratch
            or may be pretrainined

       hi faizan
       thank you so much for your post on deep learning architectures.
       i am doing research for deep learning in id164. where
       can one find the code
       implementation for some of the recent papers such as    boosted
       convolutional neural networks (bid98) for pedestrian detection   ;
          subcategory-aware convolutional neural networks for object
       proposals and detection   ; etc?

       i think you should add more recent version also into this list like
       dense net, single shot detection(ssd), fast & faster rid98.
