     this article was originally published on my personal blog
     [11]smakosh.

         in the late    50s, a cornell scientist named frank rosenblatt had
     proposed the world   s first neural network machine. it was called the
     id88   

   let   s start by defining the terms first, ai (artificial intelligence),
   ann (id158s), machine learning & deep learning.

     the field of ai research defines itself as an area of computer
     science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like
     they are intelligent, which we haven   t yet reached since
     neuroscience haven   t solved intelligence yet.
     __________________________________________________________________

     ann or a neural net is a computing system inspired by the biological
     neural networks that constitute biological brains but they look so
     different.

   neural network

     machine learning is a field within ai that focuses on the design of
     algorithms that can learn from a given data and results which we
     call    training data    to make a prediction based on that given data
     from new input data.
     __________________________________________________________________

     deep learning is a sub-field within machine learning which focuses
     on the same goal but which uses neural networks & deep neural
     networks.

   so what   s the id88 then ? well the id88 is an algorithm for
   supervised learning (which means we know the result we   re trying to
   get, say like feeding the size & location of a house to predict the
   price, in the other hand there is unsupervised learning which is used
   to draw results from datasets consisting of input data without labeled
   responses).

   the id88 receives input data multiplied by random weights and
   adds a bias value, put in an activation function to get a result, if
   the result value is wrong, it uses back propagation & id119
   to go back & tweak the weights to get a correct result.

   it can be more than 2 inputs !

   i know there are some terms there you didn   t get, so let   s go ahead and
   explain that slowly, let   s say you   re a farmer and you want to classify
   two types of flowers manually, the best way to do this manually is to
   take the length & width of each flowers    paddle and represent them on a
   graph just like shown bellow:
   [1*17hpgwazybjtsckfw7wyaq.jpeg]
   data was taken from [12]kaggle.com

   noticed the unknown flower we   re trying to figure its type, as you can
   see on the graph it   s represented among the type 2 of flowers which
   means it is a type 2 flower.

   what you   ve just did manually is called id75, you   ve
   represented as many flowers you have on the graph as a training data,
   then you noticed that pattern and drew a line between the two types.

   so now let   s automate it using our own id88 built from scratch,
   the activation function we   ll be using is sigmoid, here   s how it looks
   like on the graph:
   [1*_ek5i9jlpmrepmpygtn0ka.jpeg]
   sigmoid function

   now let   s understand how back propagation & id119 work, and
   to do so we will need:
     * the cost function or also known as squared error function

   [1*yjusvpuqmsxif1qaak3i1q.jpeg]
   cost, loss or squared error function
     * the derivative of the sigmoid function

   [1*hq37bjswk6wict1vueve2g.jpeg]
   derivative of the sigmoid function
     * the derivative of the cost function

   [1*vwm6qp0wiwgxz-d5jjyfia.jpeg]
   derivative of the cost function
     * the slope of the cost function is: the derivative of the cost
       function multiplied by the derivative of sigmoid.
     * learning rate: we will go with 0.2
     * for the derivatives of the weights, it   s the inputs   
       values,         because the derivative of a constant multiplied by a non
       constant is the constant       & for the derivative of the bias it   s 1.
     * then we   ll be able to get the new weights & bias values like shown
       bellow:

   & we   re done :d
