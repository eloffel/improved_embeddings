equilid: socially-equitable id46

   equilid is a general purpose id46 library and
   command line utility built with the following goals:
    1. identify a broad coverage of languages
    2. recognize langugage in social media, with a particular emphasis on
       short text
    3. recognize dialectic speech from a language's speakers
    4. identify code-switched text in any language pairing at least at the
       phrase level
    5. provide whole message and per-wor

   equilid currently comes pre-trained on 70 languages (iso 639-3 codes
   given):
amh ara ben bos bul cat ces cym dan deu div ell
eng est eus fas fin fra guj hat heb hin hrv hun
hye ind isl ita jpn kan kat khm kor lao lat lava
lit mal mar mkd mon msa mya nep nld nor ori pan
pol por pus ron rus sin slk slv snd spa srp swe
tam tel tgl tha tur uig ukr urd vie zho

why use equilid?

   in global settings like twitter, this text is written by authors from
   diverse linguistic backgrounds, who may communicate with regional
   dialects or even include parallel translations in the same message to
   address different audiences. such dialectal variation is frequent in
   all languages and even macro-dialects such as american and british
   english are composed of local dialects that vary across city and
   socioeconomic development level. yet current systems for broad-coverage
   lid   trained on dozens of languages   have largely leveraged
   europeancentric corpora and not taken into account demographic and
   dialectal variation. as a result, these systems systematically
   misclassify texts from populations with millions of speakers whose
   local speech differs from the majority dialects. equilid aims to be a
   socially equitable id46 system that operates at high
   precision in a massively multilingual, broad-coverage domains and that
   supports populations speaking underrepresented dialects, multilingual
   messages, and other linguistic varieties.

   short summary: if you are working with text from a global environment
   or especially if you are working with text from a country that has
   dialectic language, equilid will provide superior language
   identification accuracy and help you find messages from
   underrepresented populations.

installation

   under the hood, equilid uses a neural id195 model. it depends on
   three libraries:
     * tensorflow 0.11.0
     * numpy
     * regex

   equilid may work with later versions of tensorflow but this hasn't been
   tested (yet).

   equilid can be installed via pip pip install equilid. however, this
   installs only the software and not the trained model. the trained model
   downloaded here
   [[68]http://cs.stanford.edu/~jurgens/data/70lang.tar.gz] (559mb
   unarchived).

   to install a trained model, create a directory models in the base
   equilid directory and unpack the model's archive file into it.

usage
     __________________________________________________________________

   equilid can be used as both a stand-alone file and as a python library
equilid.py [options]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --predict             launch equilid in per-token prediction mode
  --predict_file        reads unlabled instances from this file
                        (if unspecified, stdin is used)
  --predict_output_file writes per-token predictions to this file
                        (if unspecified, stdout is used)

   you can also use equilid as a python library:
# python
python 2.7.12 |anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, jul  2 2016, 17:42:40)
[gcc 4.4.7 20120313 (red hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux2
>>> import equilid
>>> equilid.classify("this is a test.")
['eng', 'eng', 'eng', 'eng']
>>> equilid.get_langs("esto es una prueba.")
set(['spa'])
>>> equilid.get_langs("this is a test.  esto es una prueba.")
set(['spa', 'eng'])
