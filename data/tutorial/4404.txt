open source deep learning frameworks and visual analytics

     * posted by [34]kai waehner on april 23, 2017 at 9:00am

   deep learning gets more and more traction. it basically focuses on one
   section of machine learning: id158s. this article
   explains why deep learning is a game changer in analytics, when to use
   it, and how visual analytics allows business analysts to leverage the
   analytic models built by a (citizen) data scientist.

what is deep learning and id158s?

   deep learning is the modern buzzword for id158s,
   one of many concepts and algorithms in machine learning to build
   analytics models. a neural network works similar to what we know from a
   human brain: you get non-linear interactions as input and transfer them
   to output. neural networks leverage continuous learning and increasing
   knowledge in computational nodes between input and output. a neural
   network is a supervised algorithm in most cases, which uses historical
   data sets to learn correlations to predict outputs of future events,
   e.g. for cross selling or fraud detection. unsupervised neural networks
   can be used to find new patterns and anomalies. in some cases, it makes
   sense to combine supervised and unsupervised algorithms.

   neural networks are used in research for many decades and includes
   various sophisticated concepts like recurrent neural network (id56),
   convolutional neural network (id98) or autoencoder. however, today   s
   powerful and elastic computing infrastructure in combination with other
   technologies like graphical processing units (gpu) with thousands of
   cores allows to do much more powerful computations with a much deeper
   number of layers. hence the term    deep learning   .

   the following picture from tensorflow playground shows an easy-to-use
   environment which includes various test data sets, configuration
   options and visualizations to learn and understand deep learning and
   neural networks:

   [36][deep_learning_1_tensorflow_playground.png?width=750] if you want
   to learn more about the details of deep learning and neural networks, i
   recommend the following sources:
     *    the anatomy of deep learning frameworks       an article about the
       basic concepts and components of neural networks
     * [37]tensorflow playground to play around with neural networks by
       yourself hands-on without any coding, also available on github to
       [38]build your own customized offline playground
     *    [39]deep learning simplified    video series on youtube with several
       short, simple explanations of basic concepts, alternative
       algorithms and some frameworks like h2o.ai or tensorflow

   while deep learning is getting more and more traction, it is not the
   silver bullet for every scenario.

when (not) to use deep learning?

   deep learning enables many new possibilities which were not possible in
      mass production    a few years ago, e.g. image classification, object
   recognition, speech translation or natural language processing (nlp) in
   much more sophisticated ways than without deep learning. a key benefit
   is the automated feature engineering, which costs a lot of time and
   efforts with most other machine learning alternatives.

   you can also leverage deep learning to make better decisions, increase
   revenue or reduce risk for existing (   already solved   ) problems instead
   of using other machine learning algorithms. examples include risk
   calculation, fraud detection, cross selling and predictive maintenance.

   however, note that deep learning has a few important drawbacks:
     * very expensive, i.e. slow and compute-intensive; training a deep
       learning model often takes days or weeks, execution also takes more
       time than most other algorithms.
     * hard to interpret: lack of understandability of the result of the
       analytic model; often a key requirement for legal or compliance
       regularities
     * tends to overfitting, and therefore needs id173

   deep learning is ideal for complex problems. it can also outperform
   other algorithms in moderate problems. deep learning should not be used
   for simple problems. other algorithms like id28 or
   id90 can solve these problems easier and faster.

open source deep learning frameworks

   neural networks are mostly adopted using one of various open source
   implementations. various mature deep learning frameworks are available
   for different programming languages.

   the following picture shows an overview of open source deep learning
   frameworks and evaluates several characteristics:

   [40][deep_learning_2_comparison_open_source_frameworks.png?width=750]
   these frameworks have in common that they are built for data
   scientists, i.e. personas with experience in programming, statistics,
   mathematics and machine learning. note that writing the source code is
   not a big task. typically, only a few lines of codes are needed to
   build an analytic model. this is completely different from other
   development tasks like building a web application, where you write
   hundreds or thousands of lines of code. in deep learning     and data
   science in general     it is most important to understand the concepts
   behind the code to build a good analytic model.

   some nice open source tools  like knime or rapidminerallow visual
   coding to speed up development and also encourage citizen data
   scientists (i.e. people with less experience) to learn the concepts and
   build deep networks. these tools use own deep learning implementations
   or other open source libraries like h2o.ai or deeplearning4j as
   embedded framework under the hood.

   if you do not want to build your own model or leverage existing
   pre-trained models for common deep learning tasks, you might also take
   a look at the offerings from the big cloud providers, e.g. aws polly
   for text-to-speech translation, google vision api for image content
   analysis, or microsoft   s bot framework to build id70. the tech
   giants have years of experience with analysing text, speech, pictures
   and videos and offer their experience in sophisticated analytic models
   as a cloud service; pay-as-you-go. you can also improve these existing
   models with your own data, e.g. train and improve a generic picture
   recognition model with pictures of your specific industry or scenario.

deep learning in conjunction with visual analytics

   no matter if you want to use    just    a framework in your favourite
   programming language or a visual coding tool: you need to be able to
   make decisions based on the built neural network. this is where visual
   analytics comes into play. in short, visual analytics allows any
   persona to make data-driven decisions instead of listening to gut
   feeling when analysing complex data sets. see    [41]using visual
   analytics for better decisions     an online guide    to understand the key
   benefits in more detail.

   a business analyst does not understand anything about deep learning,
   but just leverages the integrated analytic model to answer its business
   questions. the analytic model is applied under the hood when the
   business analyst changes some parameters, features or data sets.
   though, visual analytics should also be used by the (citizen) data
   scientist to build the neural network. see    [42]how to avoid the
   anti-pattern in analytics: three keys for machine ...    to understand in
   more details how technical and non-technical people should work
   together using visual analytics to build neural networks, which help
   solving business problems. even some parts of data preparation are best
   done within visual analytics tooling.

   from a technical perspective, deep learning frameworks (and in a
   similar way any other machine learning frameworks, of course) can be
   integrated into visual analytics tooling in different ways. the
   following list includes a tibco spotfire example for each alternative:
     * embedded analytics: implemented directly within the analytics tool
       (self-implementation or    oem   ); can be used by the business analyst
       without any knowledge about machine learning (spotfire: id91
       via some basic, simple configuration of a input and output data
       plus cluster size)
     * native integration: connectors to directly access external deep
       learning clusters. (spotfire: terr to use r   s machine learning
       libraries, knime connector to directly integrate with external
       tooling)
     * framework api: access via a wrapper api in different programming
       languages. for example, you could integrate mxnet via r or
       tensorflow via python into your visual analytics tooling. this
       option can always be used and is appropriate if no native
       integration or connector is available. (spotfire: mxnet   s r
       interface via spotfire   s terr integration for using any r library)
     * integrated as service via an analytics server: connect external
       deep learning clusters indirectly via a server-side component of
       the analytics tool; different frameworks can be accessed by the
       analytics tool in a similar fashion (spotfire: statistics server
       for external analytics tools like sas or matlab)
     * cloud service: access pre-trained models for common deep learning
       specific tasks like image recognition, voice recognition or text
       processing. not appropriate for very specific, individual business
       problems of an enterprise. (spotfire: call public deep learning
       services like image recognition, speech translation, or chat bot
       from aws, azure, ibm, google via rest service through spotfire   s
       terr / r interface)

   all options have in common that you need to add configuration of some
   hyper-parameters, i.e.    high level    parameters like problem type,
   feature selection or id173 level. depending on the integration
   option, this can be very technical and low level, or simplified and
   less flexible using terms which the business analyst understands.

deep learning example: autoencoder template for tibco spotfire

   let   s take one specific category of neural networks as example:
   autoencoders to find anomalies. autoencoder is an unsupervised neural
   network used to replicate the input dataset by restricting the number
   of hidden layers in a neural network. a reconstruction error is
   generated upon prediction. the higher the reconstruction error, the
   higher is the possibility of that data point being an anomaly.

   use cases for autoencoders include fighting financial crime, monitoring
   equipment sensors, healthcare claims fraud, or detecting manufacturing
   defects. a generic tibco spotfire template is available in the tibco
   community for free. you can simply add your data set and leverage the
   template to find anomalies using autoencoders     without any complex
   configuration or even coding. under the hood, the template uses
   h2o.ai   s deep learning implementation and its r api. it runs in a local
   instance on the machine where to run spotfire. you can also take a look
   at the r code, but this is not needed to use the template at all and
   therefore optional.

real world example: anomaly detection for predictive maintenance

   let   s use the autoencoder for a real-world example. in telco, you have
   to analyse the infrastructure continuously to find problems and issues
   within the network. best before the failure happens so that you can fix
   it before the customer even notices the problem. take a look at the
   following picture, which shows historical data of a telco network:

   [43][deep_learning_3_autoencoder_example_tibco_spotfire_visual_analytic
   s.png?width=750] the orange dots are spikes which occur as first
   indication of a technical problem in the infrastructure. the red dots
   show a constant failure where mechanics have to replace parts of the
   network because it does not work anymore.

   autoencoders can be used to detect network issues before they actually
   happen. tibco spotfire is uses h2o   s autoencoder in the background to
   find the anomalies. as discussed before, the source code is relative
   scarce. here is the snipped of building the analytic model with h2o   s
   deep learning r api and detecting the anomalies (by finding out the
   reconstruction error of the autoencoder):

   [44][deep_learning_4_h2oai_r_source_code.png?width=750] this analytic
   model     built by the data scientist     is integrated into tibco
   spotfire. the business analyst is able to visually analyse the
   historical data and the insights of the autoencoder. this combination
   allows data scientists and business analysts to work together fluently.
   it was never easier to implement predictive maintenance and create huge
   business value by reducing risk and costs.

apply analytic models to real time processing with streaming analytics

   this article focuses on building deep learning models with data science
   frameworks and visual analytics. key for success in projects is to
   apply the build analytic model to new events in real time to add
   business value like increasing revenue, reducing cost or reducing risk.

      how to apply machine learning to event processing    describes in more
   detail how to apply analytic models to real time processing. or watch
   the corresponding video recording leveraging tibco streambase to apply
   some h2o models in real time. finally, i can recommend to learn about
   various streaming analytics frameworks to apply analytic models.

   let   s come back to the autoencoder use case to realize predictive
   maintenance in telcos. in tibco streambase, you can easily apply the
   built h2o autoencoder model without any redevelopment via streambase   
   h2o connector. you just attach the java code generated by h2o
   framework, which contains the analytic model and compiles to very
   performant jvm bytecode:

   [45][deep_learning_5_tibco_streambase_streaming_analytics.png?width=750
   ] the most important lesson learned: think about the execution
   requirements before building the analytic model. what performance do
   you need regarding latency? how many events do you need to process per
   minute, second or millisecond? do you need to distribute the analytic
   model to a clusters with many nodes? how often do you have to improve
   and redeploy the analytic model? you need to answer these questions at
   the beginning of your project to avoid double efforts and redevelopment
   of analytic models!

   another important fact is that analytic models do not always need    real
   time processing    in terms of very fast and / or frequent model
   execution. in the above telco example, these spikes and failures might
   happen in subsequent days or even weeks. thus, in many use cases, it is
   fine to apply an analytic model once a day or week instead of just
   every second to every new event, therefore.

deep learning + visual analytics + streaming analytics = next generation big
data success stories

   deep learning allows to solve many well understood problems like cross
   selling, fraud detection or predictive maintenance in a more efficient
   way. in addition, you can solve additional scenarios, which were not
   possible to solve before, like accurate and efficient id164
   or speech-to-text translation.

   visual analytics is a key component in deep learning projects to be
   successful. it eases the development of deep neural networks by
   (citizen) data scientists and allows business analysts to leverage
   these analytic models to find new insights and patterns.

   today, (citizen) data scientists use programming languages like r or
   python, deep learning frameworks like theano, tensorflow, mxnet or
   h2o   s deep water and a visual analytics tool like tibco spotfire to
   build deep neural networks. the analytic model is embedded into a view
   for the business analyst to leverage it without knowing the technology
   details.

   in the future, visual analytics tools might embed neural network
   features like they already embed other machine learning features like
   id91 or id28 today. this will allow business
   analysts to leverage deep learning without the help of a data scientist
   and be appropriate for simpler use cases.

   however, do not forget that building an analytic model to find insights
   is just the first part of a project. deploying it to real time
   afterwards is as important as second step. good integration between
   tooling for finding insights and applying insights to new events can
   improve time-to-market and model quality in data science projects
   significantly. the development lifecycle is a continuous closed loop.
   the analytic model needs to be validated and rebuild in certain
   sequences.

          very well written, highlighting the importance of knowing the
          need of complex algoriths and limitations; along with
          executional aspects upfront.
          invariably one takes short cut... first build...then we will
          think... ends in addition to repeat effort.
          rightly said, deep learning is nn with increased layers.
          thanks for your summarized version of various platforns.
