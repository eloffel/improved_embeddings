   the tech industry has gone berserk - everyone wants to develop    skills
   in machine learning and ai    but few are willing to put in the hard
   yards to develop the foundational understanding of the relevant math
   and cs - id202, id203 theory, multivariate analysis,
   data structures, algorithms, optimization, functional programming. in
   the past few years, i have coached a few people specifically in linear
   algebra as i think this is the most important topic to master. i am
   happy to report that the coaching has gone well - it was relatively
   pain-free and some actually fell in love with id202! so i
   thought i should write down the highlights of the advice i've been
   giving on how to learn id202 by viewing it through the right
   lenses.
    1. think sets and functions, rather than manipulation of number
       arrays/rectangles: id202 is often introduced at the
       high-school level as computations one can perform on vectors and
       matrices - id127, gauss elimination, determinants,
       sometimes even eigenvalue calculations, and i believe this
       introduction is quite detrimental to one   s understanding of linear
       algebra. this computational approach continues on in many undergrad
       (and sometimes grad) level courses in engineering and the social
       sciences. in fact, many computer scientists deal with linear
       algebra for decades of their professional life with this narrow
       (and in my opinion, harmful) view. i believe the right way to learn
       id202 is to view vectors as elements in a set (vector
       space), and matrices as functions from one vector space to another.
       a vector of n numbers is an element in the vector space r^n, and a
       m x n matrix is a function from r^n to r^m. beyond this, all one
       needs to understand is that vector addition, scalar multiplication
       and matrix transformation follow the usual linearity properties.
       this approach may seem abstract but if married with plenty of
       visual (2-d and 3-d) examples, it provides the student with the
       right intuition and prepares her for the more advanced concepts in
       ways far superior to the computational treatment.
    2. matrix as a sequence of column vectors: the default view of
       matrices is typically row-wise because when we multiply a matrix m
       with a vector v (m * v), we do an inner-product of each row of the
       matrix with the vector thought of as a column (this intuition
       extends to id127). however, a better view of m is
       to think of each of its columns as a vector, and m * v is simply a
       linear combination of m   s column vectors where the scalar
       multipliers are the elements of v. if you realign your mind to this
       view as the default view, it will serve you immensely as you
       navigate advanced topics.
    3. the 4 important subspaces and the fundamental theorem: gilbert
       strang has done a great service to the world of id202 (and
       applied math) by articulating the 4 important subspaces and what he
       calls the    fundamental theorem    so beautifully in his book (the
       visual representation of this in his book should be etched in the
       head of every student). i am refering to the column space, the row
       space, the kernel and the co-kernel, and their relationships -
       isomorphism of the kernel-quotient space and column space, and the
       corresponding orthogonality of the spaces. the rank-nullity theorem
       is then just a special case of this. i would even go as far as to
       say that if there is just one thing in id202 a student
       should firmly understand, it is this - what gilbert strang famously
       refers to as the fundamental theorem of id202. also, this
       dovetails nicely with the view of matrices as linear functions
       where the kernel maps into 0, and the range of the function is the
       column space. invertibility can be characterized as the trivial
       kernel, pseudoinverse can be nicely visualized as a bijective
       function between the row space and the column space, transpose can
       be thought of with regards to the row space and the co-kernel,    .
       to list just a few of the powerful benefits of the fundamental
       theorem.
    4. understand id105s as compositions of    simple   
       functions: most people will tell you that id202 is all
       about various forms of id105s. while that is true,
       the usual treatment is to simply teach you the recipe to factorize.
       this will help you implement the algorithm in code, but it will not
       teach you the mathematical essence of these factorizations. the
       purpose of factorization is to split a matrix into    simpler   
       matrices that have nice mathematical properties (diagonal,
       triangular, orthogonal, positive-definite etc.), and a general
       matrix (i.e. linear function) can be viewed as the composition of
       these    simpler    linear functions. the study of these    simple   
       linear functions forms the bulk of the analysis in id202
       because if you have understood these simple functions (canonical
       matrices), then it   s simply a matter of putting them together
       (function compositions) to conceptualize arbitrary linear
       transformations.
    5. view eigendecomposition (ed) and singular value decomposition (svd)
       as rotations and stretches: all great mathematicians will tell you
       that even the hardest, most abstract topic in math requires
       geometric intuition. ed and svd are probably the most used
       factorizations in applied math (and in real-life problems), but
       many a student has been frustrated by the opacity and dryness of
       the treatment in typical courses and books. picturing them as
       rotations and stretches is the (in my opinion, only) way to go
       about understanding them. eigenvectors are a basis of vectors
       (independent but not necessarily orthogonal) that the given matrix
          purely stretches    (i.e., does not change their directions), and
       eigenvalues are the stretch quantities. this makes our life
       extremely easy but not all matrices can be ed-ed. but fear not - we
       have svd that is more broadly usable albeit not as simple/nice as
       ed. svd works on any rectangular matrix (ed works only for certain
       square matrices) and involves two different bases of vectors that
       both turn out to be orthogonal bases (orthogonality is of course
       very nice to have!). svd basically tells us that the matrix simply
       sends one orthogonal basis to the other (modulo stretches), the
       stretch amounts known as singular values (appearing on the middle
       diagonal matrix). so an arbitrary matrix applied on an arbitrary
       vector will first rotate the vector (as given by the orientation of
       the first orthogonal basis), then stretch the components of the
       resultant vector (by the singular values), and finally rotate the
       resultant vector (as given by the orientation of the second
       orthogonal basis). there is also a nice connection between ed and
       svd since svd is simply ed on the product of a matrix and its
       transpose. there are some neat little animation tools out there
       that bring ed and svd to life by vividly presenting the matrix
       operations as rotations/stretches. do play with them while you
       learn this material.
    6. positive definite matrices as quadratic forms with a bowl-like
       visual: people will tell you positive definite matrices (pdms) are
       really important but few can explain why they are important and few
       will go beyond the usual definition: v^t m v > 0 for every non-zero
       vector v. this definition, although accurate, confuses the hell out
       of students. the right way to understand pdms is to interpret v^t m
       v as a    quadratic form   , i.e., a function (of v) from r^n to r that
       is quadratic in the components of v, in every term in the function.
       secondly, it   s best to graph several examples of quadratic forms
       for n = 2 (i.e., viewed as a 3-d graph). pdms are those matrices m
       for which this graph is a nice bowl-like shape, i.e., the valley is
       a unique point from which you can only go up. the alternatives are
       a    flat valley    where you can walk horizontally, or a    saddle
       valley    from where you can climb up in some directions or climb
       down in other directions. pdms are desirable because they are
       simple and friendly to optimization methods. the other very nice
       thing about pdms is that all of their eigenvalues are positive and
       their eigenvectors are orthogonal.

   in fact, these six concepts learnt through the lenses i described serve
   as a quick introduction to id202 that prepares you for
   learning machine learning, optimization, ai or more generally, applied
   math. you will of course run into other id202 details in the
   process of learning these applied math topics, but once grounded in
   these foundationals, you will pick up those details on the fly pretty
   quickly (eg: wiki will then be your great friend!).
