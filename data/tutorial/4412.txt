generating images from captions with attention

   code for paper [69]generating images from captions with attention by
   elman mansimov, emilio parisotto, jimmy ba and ruslan salakhutdinov;
   iclr 2016.

   we introduce a model that generates image blobs from natural language
   descriptions. the proposed model iteratively draws patches on a canvas,
   while attending to the relevant words in the description.

   [70]theimage

getting started

   the code is written in python. to use it you will need:
     * python 2.7
     * theano 0.7 (mostly tested using commit from june/july 2015)
     * numpy and scipy
     * h5py (hdf5 (>= 1.8.11))
     * [71]skip-thoughts

   before running the code make sure that you set floatx to float32 in
   theano settings.

   additionally, depending on the tasks you will probably need to download
   these files by running:
wget http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~emansim/datasets/mnist.h5
wget http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~emansim/datasets/text2image/train-images-32x32.n

mnist with captions

   to train the model simply go to mnist-captions folder and run
python aligndraw.py models/mnist-captions.json

   to generate 60x60 mnist images from captions as specified in appendix
   of the paper run
python sample-captions.py --model models/mnist-captions.json --weights /path/to/
trained-weights

   note: i have also provided implementation of simple draw model in files
   draw.py and sample.py

microsoft coco

   to train the model simply go to coco folder and run
python aligndraw.py models/coco-captions-32x32.json

   to generate images from captions after training run
python sample-captions.py --model models/coco-captions-32x32.json --weights /pat
h/to/trained-weights --dictionary dictionary.pkl --gan_path gan.hdf5 --skipthoug
ht_path /path/to/skipthoughts-folder

   note: i have been caught up with other non-research stuff, so i will
   add baseline model files like noaligndraw and others during the week of
   feb 29 - mar 6.

   feel free to email me if you have some questions or if you are
   uncertain about some parts of the code.

acknowledgments

   i would like to acknowledge the help of [72]tom white for some
   suggestion on cleaning and organizing the code.
