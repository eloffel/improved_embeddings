   we have seen the top 100 medium users that got the most recommends, but
   this does not help us with nothing in our quest to read interesting
   articles :
   [17]top 100 medium writers that wrote about artificial intelligence /

   there are over 6500 articles about ai/ml/dl written on medium, and if
   you would want to read them all, you would need   medium.com

   this is why, now we will see the top 100 articles written about

   data visualization
   there are over 3,700 articles tagged big data, data science, data
   visualization on medium, and if you would want to   medium.com

   my aim with this research is to allow me to quickly find the most
   relevant and appreciated articles about the topic of artificial
   intelligence (a.i), machine learning(m.l.) and deep learning(d.l), so
   that i can improve my knowledge about the subject, without having to
   read 100 articles to find the 4   5 of them that are interesting and
   exciting for me.

   after scrapping 6 million posts from medium.com in the winter of 2016,
   i was able to filter just the posts that are tagged with either ai/ml
   or deep learning.

   in total, i got 6,546 articles, written by 3,528 users.

   all of this articles have a total of 153,567 recommends.

   so, to do this, i extracted the top 100 articles posted on medium,
   related to ai/ml/dl and created a list with all of them, so that i can
   read them in the coming weeks.

   (half of them i have already read them, but there were some interesting
   discoveries in the list)

the data is old, i have collected the data in december 2016         january 2017.

   in february, the government of romania wanted to legalize corruption
   and bribes. via a facebook community called corruption kills, that i
   founded 2 years ago, i dedicated my time facilitating the organization
   of the biggest protests in the history of romania ( around 600k persons
   participated) ( we used slack a lot ) and also did some civic projects,
   and for the last 6 months i did not had time until now to play with the
   data that i got from [22]medium.
   [23]anger and mistrust fuel unabated protests in romania
   "we don't trust this government. they lied to us. we want this
   government to resign," said maria stoica, 38, an   www.nytimes.com

short information's about the data.

from the 5.5 m posts that i got from medium, i extracted a subgroup of 6548
posts that were tagged either as a.i./m.l/d.l.

   from now own, when i will refer to all the articles, i will speak only
   about the 6548 articles tagged a.i./m.l/d.l.

   i then sorted and extracted just the top 100 articles, based on the
   number of recommends that each article got.

   the average reading time of all the articles is 4.1 minutes. for the
   top 100 articles, the average reading time is 9.1 minutes.

   the average post, considering all the articles, contains 3 images. for
   the top 100 articles, the average post contains 10 images.

   the average post, considering all the articles, contains 4.4 links. for
   the top 100 articles, the average post contains 9.4 links.

     the time required to read all of the top 100 articles :

   in the last 3 years i collaborated with rise project, were i did data
   analysis and pattern recognition to uncover patterns of corruption in
   unstructured data-sets.

   as a job, i am a senior map analyst, working with osm data.

   in september 2016 i moved for 3 months to san francisco, [202]to start
   a new life.

   now i`m back in romania, searching for a remote/ part/full time

       they go viral.
     * combining facebook reactions with[204] id31 to create
       the emotional fingerprint of a post, a page.
     * downloading all the public posts from top 12.000 fb pages in
       romania. 19m posts downloaded until now. see one use-case here,
