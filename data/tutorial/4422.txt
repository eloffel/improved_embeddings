1.14. semi-supervised[26]  

   [27]semi-supervised learning is a situation in which in your training
   data some of the samples are not labeled. the semi-supervised
   estimators in [28]sklearn.semi_supervised are able to make use of this
   additional unlabeled data to better capture the shape of the underlying
   data distribution and generalize better to new samples. these
   algorithms can perform well when we have a very small amount of labeled
   points and a large amount of unlabeled points.

   unlabeled entries in y

   it is important to assign an identifier to unlabeled points along with
   the labeled data when training the model with the fit method. the
   identifier that this implementation uses is the integer value \(-1\).

1.14.1. label propagation[29]  

   label propagation denotes a few variations of semi-supervised graph
   id136 algorithms.

   a few features available in this model:

          + can be used for classification and regression tasks
          + kernel methods to project data into alternate dimensional
            spaces

   scikit-learn provides two label propagation models:
   [30]labelpropagation and [31]labelspreading. both work by constructing
   a similarity graph over all items in the input dataset.
   [32]../_images/sphx_glr_plot_label_propagation_structure_0011.png

   an illustration of label-propagation: the structure of unlabeled
   observations is consistent with the class structure, and thus the class
   label can be propagated to the unlabeled observations of the training
   set.

   [33]labelpropagation and [34]labelspreading differ in modifications to
   the similarity matrix that graph and the clamping effect on the label
   distributions. clamping allows the algorithm to change the weight of
   the true ground labeled data to some degree. the [35]labelpropagation
   algorithm performs hard clamping of input labels, which means
   \(\alpha=0\). this clamping factor can be relaxed, to say
   \(\alpha=0.2\), which means that we will always retain 80 percent of
   our original label distribution, but the algorithm gets to change its
   confidence of the distribution within 20 percent.

   [36]labelpropagation uses the raw similarity matrix constructed from
   the data with no modifications. in contrast, [37]labelspreading
   minimizes a id168 that has id173 properties, as such
   it is often more robust to noise. the algorithm iterates on a modified
   version of the original graph and normalizes the edge weights by
   computing the normalized graph laplacian matrix. this procedure is also
   used in [38]spectral id91.

   label propagation models have two built-in kernel methods. choice of
   kernel effects both scalability and performance of the algorithms. the
   following are available:

     * rbf (\(\exp(-\gamma |x-y|^2), \gamma > 0\)). \(\gamma\) is
       specified by keyword gamma.
     * knn (\(1[x' \in knn(x)]\)). \(k\) is specified by keyword
       n_neighbors.

   the rbf kernel will produce a fully connected graph which is
   represented in memory by a dense matrix. this matrix may be very large
   and combined with the cost of performing a full id127
   calculation for each iteration of the algorithm can lead to
   prohibitively long running times. on the other hand, the knn kernel
   will produce a much more memory-friendly sparse matrix which can
   drastically reduce running times.
