dogs vs. cats: image classification with deep learning using tensorflow in
python

the problem

   given a set of labeled images of  cats and dogs, a  machine learning
   model  is to be learnt and later it is to be used to classify a set of
   new images as cats or dogs.
     * the original dataset contains a huge number of images, only a few
       sample images are chosen (1100 labeled images for cat/dog as
       training and 1000images from the test dataset) from the dataset,
       just for the sake of  quick demonstration of how to solve this
       problem using deep learning (motivated by the udacity course deep
       learning by google), which is going to be described (along with the
       results) in this article.

     * the accuracy on the test dataset is not going to be good in general
       for the above-mentioned reason. in order to obtain good
       accuracy  on the test dataset using deep learning, we need to train
       the models with a large number of input images (e.g., with all the
       training images from the kaggle dataset).
     * a few sample labeled images from the training dataset are shown
       below.

   cats
   download (1).png as a pre-processing step, all the images are
   first resized to 50  50 pixel images.

classification with a few off-the-self classifiers

     * first, each image from the training dataset is fattened and
       represented as 2500-length vectors (one for each channel).

     * next, a few sklearn models are trained on this flattened data. here
       are the results

m1
m2
m4 m3

   as shown above, the test accuracy is quite poor with a few
   sophisticated off-the-self classifiers.

classifying images using deep learning with tensorflow

   now let   s first train a id28 and then a couple of neural
   network models by introducing l2 id173 for both the models.
     * first, all the images are converted to gray-scale images.
     * the following figures visualize the weights learnt for the cat vs.
       the dog class during training the id28  model
       with sgd with l2-id173 (  =0.1, batch size=128).

test accuracy: 53.6%

     * the following animation visualizes the weights learnt for 400
       randomly selected hidden units using a neural net with a single
       hidden layer with 4096 hidden nodes by training the neural
       net model  with sgd with l2-id173 (  1=  2=0.05, batch
       size=128). cd_nn_hidden1.png
       minibatch loss at step 0: 198140.156250
       minibatch accuracy: 50.0%
       validation accuracy: 50.0%

test accuracy: 57.8%

   clearly, the model learnt above overfits the training dataset, the test
   accuracy improved a bit, but still quite poor.
     * now, let   s train a deeper neural net with a two hidden layers,
       first one with 1024 nodes and second one with 64 nodes.

test accuracy: 55.2%

     * the following animation visualizes the weights learnt
       for 400 randomly selected hidden units from the first hidden layer,
       by training the neural net model with sgd
       with l2-id173 (  1=  2=  3=0.1, batch size=128, dropout
       rate=0.6).
       h1c
     * the next animation visualizes the weights learnt and then the
       weights learnt for all the 64 hidden units for the second hidden
       layer. h2c
     * clearly, the second deeper neural net model learnt
       above overfits the training dataset more, the test
       accuracy decreased a bit.

classifying images with deep convolution network

   let   s use the following conv-net shown in the next figure


   f8.png

   as shown above, the convnet uses:
     * 2 convolution layers each with
          + 5  5 kernel
          + 16 filters
          + 1  1 stride
          + same padding
     * 2 max pooling layers each with
          + 2  2 kernel
          + 2  2 stride
     * 64 hidden nodes
     * 128 batch size
     * 5k iterations
     * 0.7 dropout rate
     * no learning decay

   results

   minibatch loss at step 0: 1.783917
   minibatch accuracy: 55.5%
   validation accuracy: 50.0%

   minibatch loss at step 500: 0.269719
   minibatch accuracy: 89.1%
   validation accuracy: 54.0%

   minibatch loss at step 1000: 0.045729
   minibatch accuracy: 96.9%
   validation accuracy: 61.0%

   minibatch loss at step 1500: 0.015794
   minibatch accuracy: 100.0%
   validation accuracy: 61.0%

   minibatch loss at step 2000: 0.028912
   minibatch accuracy: 98.4%
   validation accuracy: 64.0%

   minibatch loss at step 2500: 0.007787
   minibatch accuracy: 100.0%
   validation accuracy: 62.0%

   minibatch loss at step 3000: 0.001591
   minibatch accuracy: 100.0%
   validation accuracy: 63.0%
test accuracy: 61.3%

   the following animations show the features learnt at
   different convolution and maxpooling layers:

   c1n.gif

   c2n.gif

   c3n

   c4n
     * clearly, the simple convolution neural net outperforms all the
       previous models in terms of test accuracy, as shown below.

   f14.png

   only 1100 labeled images (randomly chosen from the training dataset)
   were used to train the model and predict 1000 test images (randomly
   chosen from the test dataset). clearly the accuracy can be improved a
   lot if a large number of images are used fro training with deeper /
   more complex networks (with more parameters to learn).
