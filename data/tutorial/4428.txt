how time-series databases help make sense of sensors

how time-series databases help make sense of sensors

time-series databases like influxdb are ideal for managing things that
generate a lot of data that changes over time.

   infrastructure environments' needs and demands change every year
   and systems become more complex and involved. but all this growth is
   meaningless if we don't understand the infrastructure and what's
   happening in our environment. this is where monitoring tools and
   software come in; they give operators and administrators the ability to
   see problems in their environments and fix them in real time.

   but what if we want to predict problems before they happen? collecting
   metrics and data about our environment gives us a window into how our
   infrastructure is performing and lets us make predictions based on
   data. when we know and understand what's happening, we can prevent
   problems, rather than just fixing them.

   before we can use this data, we need to figure out how to collect and
   store it. for example, if we want to collect data on the cpu usage of
   100 machines every 10 seconds, we're generating a lot of data. on top
   of that, what if each machine is running 15 containers and you want to
   generate data about each of those individual containers too? what if we
   want to generate data per process? this is where time-series data
   becomes helpful. time-series databases store time-series data. but what
   does that mean? we'll explain all of this and more, plus introduce you
   to [169]influxdb, an open source time-series database. by the end of
   this article, you will understand:
     * what time-series data and databases are
     * basic information about influxdb and the tick stack
     * how to install influxdb and other tools

introducing time-series concepts

   ^example of a table, or how a rdbms like mysql stores data.
   image from [171]devshed.

   if you're familiar with relational database management software (rdbms)
   like mysql, [172]tables, columns, and primary keys are familiar terms.
   everything is like a spreadsheet, with data in columns and rows. some
   data might be unique, other parts might be the same as other rows.
   id208 are widely used and great for reliable
   transactions that follow [173]acid (atomicity, consistency, isolation,
   and durability) compliance and data you could model in a table. you
   might update certain data by overwriting and replacing it.

   but what if you're collecting data on something that generates a lot of
   data, like a self-driving car, and you want to watch how the
   data changes over time? the car is constantly collecting information
   about its environment. it takes this data and it analyzes changes over
   time to behave correctly. the amount of data might be tens of gigabytes
   an hour. while you could use a relational database to collect this
   data, when it comes to scaling and usability of the data you're
   collecting, an rbdms isn't the best tool for the job.

why time-series is a good fit

   this is where time-series data makes sense. let's say you're collecting
   data about a city's traffic, temperature from farming equipment, or the
   production rate of an assembly line. instead of putting the data into a
   table with rows and columns, imagine pushing multiple rows of data that
   are uniquely sorted with a timestamp. this visual might help make more
   sense of this:

[174]picture-the-cloud.gif

   imagine rows and rows of data, uniquely sorted by timestamps

   ^imagine rows and rows of data, uniquely sorted by timestamps.
   image from [175]timescale.

   having the data in this format makes it easier to track and watch
   change over time. when data accumulates, you can see how something
   behaved in the past, how it's behaving now, and how it might behave in
   the future. your options to make smarter data decisions expand!

   curious how the data is stored and formatted? it depends on the
   time-series database you use. influxdb stores the data in the [176]line
   protocol format. [177]queries return the data in json.

   to learn more about time-series data or why you would want to use it
   over another solution, [181]timescale and [182]influxdata offer
   excellent, in-depth explanations.

influxdb: a time-series database

   [183]influxdb is open source time-series database software developed by
   [184]influxdata. it's written in go (a compiled language), which means
   you can start using it without installing any dependencies. it supports
   multiple data ingestion protocols, such as [185]telegraf (also from
   influxdata), [186]graphite, [187]collectd, and [188]opentsdb. this
   leaves you with flexible options for how you want to collect data and
   from where you're pulling it. it's also one of the [189]fastest-growing
   time-series database software options available. you can find the
   source code for influxdb on [190]github.

   let's take a look at using three tools in influxdata's [191]tick stack
   to build a time-series database and begin collecting and processing
   data.

tick stack

   influxdata's platform is based on four open source projects that work
   and play well with each other for time-series data. by using
   them together, you can easily collect, store, process, and view the
   data. the four pieces of the platform are known as the tick stack,
   which stands for:
     * telegraf: plugin-driven server agent for collecting and reporting
       metrics
     * influxdb: scalable data store for metrics, events, and real-time
       analytics
     * chronograf: monitoring/visualization user interface for tick stack
       (not covered in this article)
     * kapacitor: framework for processing, monitoring, and alerting on
       time-series data

   these tools work and integrate well with the other pieces by design.
   however, it's also easy to substitute one piece out for another tool of
   your choice. here, we'll explore three parts of the tick stack:
   influxdb, telegraf, and kapacitor.

   from [193]influxdata.com.

influxdb

   as mentioned, [194]influxdb is the tick stack's time-series database.
   there are a few things that make influxdb stand out from other
   time-series databases.
     * emphasis on performance: performance is one of influxdb's top
       priorities. this allows you to use data quickly and easily, even
       under heavy loads. to do this, influxdb focuses on quickly
       ingesting the data and using compression to keep it manageable. to
       query and write data, it uses an http(s) api. its performance is
       noteworthy, standing up the amount of data influxdb is capable of
       handling. it can handle up to a million points of data per second,
       at a precise level, even to the nanosecond.

     * sql-like queries: if you're familiar with sql-like syntax, querying
       data from influxdb will feel familiar. it uses its own sql-like
       syntax, [195]influxql, for queries. as an example, imagine you're
       collecting data on used disk space on a machine. if you wanted to
       see that data, you could write a query that might look like this,
       which will pull the mean values of used disk space from a
       three-month period and group them in 10-day increments:


   select mean(diskspace_used) as mean_disk_used
   from disk_stats
   where time() >= 3m
   group by time(10d)
     * downsampling and data retention: when working with large amounts of
       data, storing it becomes a concern. over time, it can accumulate to
       huge sizes. with influxdb, you can downsample into less precise,
       smaller metrics that you can store for longer periods of time.
       data-retention policies enable you to do this. for example, imagine
       you have sensors collecting data on the amount of ram in a number
       of machines. you might collect metrics on the amount of memory in
       use by multiple users, the system, cached memory, and more. while
       it might make sense to hang on to that data for 30 days to watch
       what's happening, after 30 days, you might not need such precise
       data. instead, you might only want the ratio of total memory to
       memory in use. using data-retention policies, you can tell influxdb
       to hang on to the precise data for all the different usages for 30
       days. after 30 days, you can average data to be less precise, and
       you can hold on to that data for six months, forever, or however
       long you like. this compromise meets in the middle between keeping
       historical data and reducing disk usage.

telegraf

   if influxdb is where all your data is going, you first need a way to
   collect and gather the data. [196]telegraf is a metric collection
   daemon that gathers various metrics from system components, internet of
   things (iot) sensors, and more. it's [197]open source and written
   completely in go. like influxdb, telegraf is written by the influxdata
   team, and it's built to work with influxdb. it also includes support
   for different databases, such as mysql/mariadb, mongodb, redis, and
   more. you can read more about it on [198]influxdata's website.

   telegraf is modular and heavily based on plugins. this means that
   telegraf is as lean and minimal or as full and complex as you need it.
   out of the box, it supports more than 100 [199]plugins for various
   input sources (including apache, ceph, docker, iptables, kubernetes,
   nginx, and varnish), processing, and outputs.

   even if you're not using influxdb as a data store, you may find
   telegraf a useful way to collect data and information about your
   systems or sensors.

kapacitor

   now we have a way to collect and store our data. but what about doing
   things with it? [200]kapacitor is the piece of the stack that lets you
   process and work with the data in a few different ways. it supports
   both stream and batch data. stream data means you can actively work and
   shape the data in real time, even before it makes it to your data
   store. batch data means you can retroactively perform actions on
   samples or batches of the data.

   one of the biggest pluses for kapacitor is that it enables real-time
   alerts for events happening in your environment. cpu usage overloading
   or temperatures too high? you can set up several different alert
   systems, including but not limited to email, triggering a command,
   slack, hipchat, opsgenie, and many more. you can see the full list in
   the [201]documentation.

   like the other tick stack tools, kapacitor is [202]open source; you can
   read more about the project in the [203]readme.

installing the tick stack

   packages are available for nearly every distribution. you can install
   these packages from the command line. use the instructions for your
   distribution.
