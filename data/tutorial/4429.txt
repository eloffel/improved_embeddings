rethinkdb pushes json to your apps in realtime.

   when your app polls for data, it becomes slow, unscalable, and
   cumbersome to maintain.

   rethinkdb is the open-source, scalable database that makes building
   realtime apps dramatically easier.

reactive web and mobile apps
       web apps like [20]google docs, [21]trello, and [22]quora pioneered
       the realtime experience on the web. with rethinkdb, you can build
       amazing realtime apps with dramatically less engineering effort.

multiplayer games
       when a player takes an action in a multiplayer game, every other
       player in the game needs to see the change in realtime. rethinkdb
       dramatically simplifies the data infrastructure for low latency,
       high throughput realtime interactions.
     * [marketplaces_@2x.png]

realtime marketplaces
       rethinkdb dramatically reduces the complexity of building realtime
       trading and optimization engines. publish realtime updates to
       thousands of clients, and provide pricing updates to users in
       milliseconds.
     * [analytics_@2x.png]

streaming analytics
       build realtime dashboards with rethinkdb data push notifications,
       and make instantaneous business decisions.

connected devices
       rethinkdb dramatically simplifies modern iot infrastructures.
       stream data between connected devices, enable messaging and
       signaling, and trigger actions in millions of devices in
       milliseconds.

what's in the box?

work with your favorite stack

   query json documents with python, ruby, node.js or [28]dozens of other
   languages. build modern apps using your favorite web framework, paired
   with realtime technologies like [29]socket.io or [30]signalr.

robust architecture

   rethinkdb integrates the latest advances in database technology. it has
   a modern distributed [31]architecture, a highly-optimized buffer cache,
   and a state of the art storage engine. all of these components work
   together to create a robust, scalable, high-performance database.

everything you need to build modern apps

   express relationships using [32]joins, build [33]location-aware apps,
   or store [34]multimedia and [35]time-series data. do analytics with
   [36]aggregation and map/reduce, and speed up your apps using flexible
   [37]indexing.

built with love by the open source community

   developed by a core team of database experts and over 100 contributors
   from around the world, rethinkdb is shaped by developers like you
   participating in [38]an open development process.

scale your cluster in seconds

   when you're ready to scale your app, shard and replicate in a few
   clicks using an intuitive web ui.

   if you need it, a simple api provides precise control over the cluster:
r.table('games').reconfigure(shards=5, replicas=3)

   monitor your production cluster with live statistics and complete
   visibility into running jobs:
r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').changes()
