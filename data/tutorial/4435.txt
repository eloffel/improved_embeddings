introduction to deep learning for natural language processing

   this repo accompanies the introduction to deep learning for natural
   language processing workshop to explain the core concepts of deep
   learning with emphasis on classifying text as the application. python
   data stack is used for the workshop.

overview

   the following topics are covered
    1. what is deep learning?
    2. motivation: some use cases
    3. building blocks of neural networks (neuron, activation function,
       id26 algorithm)
    4. id27
    5. id97
    6. introduction to keras
    7. multi-layer id88
    8. convolutional neural network
    9. recurrent neural network
   10. challenges in deep learning

   depending on time, the following topics might be covered
    1. using tensorflow as backend for keras
    2. unsupervised learning using autoencoders

installation instructions

   please refer to the [77]installation instructions document. that
   document also has instructions on how to run a script to check if the
