when government rules by software, citizens are left in the dark

   [predictable_algorithm_transparency.jpeg]
   ben bours

   in july, san francisco superior court judge sharon reardon considered
   whether to hold lamonte mims, a 19-year-old accused of violating his
   probation, in jail. one piece of evidence before her: the output of
   algorithms known as psa that scored the risk that mims, who had
   previously been convicted of burglary, would commit a violent crime or
   skip court. based on that result, another algorithm recommended that
   mims could safely be released, and reardon let him go. five days later,
   police say, he robbed and murdered a 71-year old man.

   on monday, the san francisco district attorney   s office said staffers
   using the tool had erroneously failed to enter mims    prior jail term.
   had they done so, psa would have recommended he be held, not released.

   mims    case highlights how governments increasingly rely on mathematical
   formulas to inform decisions about criminal justice, child welfare,
   education and other arenas. yet it   s often hard or impossible for
   citizens to see how these algorithms work and are being used.

   san francisco superior court began using psa in 2016, after getting the
   tool for free from the john and laura arnold foundation, a texas
   nonprofit that works on criminal-justice reform. the initiative was
   intended to prevent poor people unable to afford bail from needlessly
   lingering in jail. but a [39]memorandum of understanding with the
   foundation bars the court from disclosing    any information about the
   tool, including any information about the development, operation and
   presentation of the tool.   

   the agreement was unearthed [40]in december by two law professors, who
   [41]in a paper released this month document a widespread transparency
   problem with state and municipal use of predictive algorithms. robert
   brauneis, of george washington university, and ellen goodman, of
   rutgers university, filed 42 open-records requests in 23 states seeking
   information about psa and five other tools used by governments. they
   didn   t get much of what they asked for.

   many governments said they had no relevant records about the programs.
   taken at face value, that would mean those agencies did not document
   how they chose, or how they use, the tools. others said contracts
   prevented them from releasing some or all information. goodman says
   this shows governments are neglecting to stand up for their own, and
   citizens   , interests.    you can really see who held the pen in the
   contracting process,    she says.

   the arnold foundation says it no longer requires confidentiality from
   municipal officials, and is happy to amend existing agreements, to
   allow officials to disclose information about psa and how they use it.
   but a representative of san francisco superior court said its contract
   with the foundation has not been updated to remove the gag clause.

   goodman and brauneis ran their records-request marathon to add
   empirical fuel to a debate about [42]widening use of predictive
   algorithms in government decision-making. in 2016, an investigation by
   propublica found that a system used in sentencing and bail decisions
   was [43]biased against black people. scholars have warned for years
   public policy could become hidden under the shroud of trade secrets, or
   technical processes divorced from the usual policy-making process.

   the scant results from nearly a year of filing and following up on
   requests suggests those fears are well-grounded. but goodman says the
   study has also helped convince her that governments could be more open
   about their use of algorithms, which she says have clear potential to
   make government more efficient and equitable.

   some scholars and activists want governments to reveal the code behind
   their algorithms, a tough ask because they are often commercial
   products. goodman thinks it   s more urgent that the public knows how an
   algorithm was chosen, developed, and tested   for example how sensitive
   it is to false positives and negatives. that   s no break from the past,
   she argues, because citizens have always been able to ask for
   information about how new policy was devised and implemented.
      governments have not made the shift to understanding this is policy
   making,    she says.    the concern is that public policy is being pushed
   into a realm where it   s not accessible.   

   for goodman   s hopes to be met, governments will have to stand up to the
   developers of predictive algorithms and software. goodman and brauneis
   sought information from 16 local courts that use psa. they received at
   least some documents from five; four of those, including san francisco,
   said their agreement with the arnold foundation prevented them from
   discussing the tool and its use.

   some things are known about psa. the arnold foundation has made public
   [44]the formulas at the heart of its tool, and the factors it
   considers, including a person   s age, criminal history and whether they
   have failed to appear for prior court hearings. it says researchers
   used data from nearly 750,000 cases to design the tool. after psa was
   adopted in lucas county, ohio, the arnold foundation says, crimes
   committed by people awaiting trial fell, even as more defendants were
   released without having to post bail.

   goodman argues the foundation should disclose more information about
   its dataset and how it was analyzed to design psa, as well as the
   results of any validation tests performed to tune the risk scores it
   assigns people. that information would help governments and citizens
   understand psa   s strengths and weaknesses, and compare it with
   competing pretrial risk-assessment software. the foundation didn   t
   answer a direct request for that information from the researchers this
   march. moreover, some governments now using psa have agreed not to
   disclose details about how they use it.

   an arnold foundation spokeswoman says it is assembling a dataset for
   release that will allow outside researchers to evaluate its tool. she
   says the foundation initially required confidentiality from
   jurisdictions to inhibit governments or rivals from using or copying
   the tool without permission.

   goodman and brauneis also queried 11 police departments that use
   predpol, commercial software that predicts where crime is likely to
   occur and can be used to plan patrols. only three responded. none
   revealed the algorithm predpol uses to make predictions, or anything
   about the process used to create and validate it. predpol is marketed
   by a company of the same name, and originated in a collaboration
   between los angeles police department and university of california los
   angeles. it did not respond to a request for comment.

   some municipalities were more forthcoming. allegheny county in
   pennsylvania produced a report describing the development and testing
   of an algorithm that helps child-welfare workers decide whether to
   formally investigate new reports of child maltreatment, for example.
   the county   s department of human services had commissioned the tool
   from auckland university of technology, in new zealand. illinois
   specifies that information about its contracts for a tool that tries to
   predict when children may be injured or killed will be public unless
   prohibited by law.

   most governments the professors queried didn   t appear to have the
   expertise to properly consider or answer questions about the predictive
   algorithms they use.    i was left feeling quite sympathetic to
   municipalities,    goodman says.    we   re expecting them to do a whole lot
   they don   t have the wherewithal to do.   

   danielle citron, a law professor at the university of maryland, says
   that pressure from state attorneys general, court cases, and even
   legislation will be necessary to change how local governments think
   about, and use, such algorithms.    part of it has to come from law,    she
   says.    ethics and best practices never gets us over the line because
   the incentives just aren   t there.   

   researchers believe predictive algorithms are growing more prevalent    
   and more complex.    i think that probably makes things harder,    says
   goodman.

   update 07:34 am et 08/17/17: an earlier version of this story
   incorrectly described the arnold foundation's psa tool. update 07:02 pm
   et 08/17/17: an earlier version of this story misstated the reason for
   mims' initial court appearance.
