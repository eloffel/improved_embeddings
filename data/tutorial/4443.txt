deep learning - the straight dope

note: [straight dope is growing up] ---> much of this content has been
incorporated into the new dive into deep learning book available at
[129]https://d2l.ai/

abstract

   this repo contains an incremental sequence of notebooks designed to
   teach deep learning, mxnet, and the gluon interface. our goal is to
   leverage the strengths of jupyter notebooks to present prose, graphics,
   equations, and code together in one place. if we're successful, the
   result will be a resource that could be simultaneously a book, course
   material, a prop for live tutorials, and a resource for plagiarising
   (with our blessing) useful code. to our knowledge there's no source out
   there that teaches either (1) the full breadth of concepts in modern
   deep learning or (2) interleaves an engaging textbook with runnable
   code. we'll find out by the end of this venture whether or not that
   void exists for a good reason.

   another unique aspect of this book is its authorship process. we are
   developing this resource fully in the public view and are making it
   available for free in its entirety. while the book has a few primary
   authors to set the tone and shape the content, we welcome contributions
   from the community and hope to coauthor chapters and entire sections
   with experts and community members. already we've received
   contributions spanning typo corrections through full working examples.

implementation with apache mxnet

   throughout this book, we rely upon mxnet to teach core concepts,
   advanced topics, and a full complement of applications. mxnet is widely
   used in production environments owing to its strong reputation for
   speed. now with gluon, mxnet's new imperative interface (alpha), doing
   research in mxnet is easy.

dependencies

   to run these notebooks, you'll want to build mxnet from source.
   fortunately, this is easy (especially on linux) if you follow
   [130]these instructions. you'll also want to [131]install jupyter and
   use python 3 (because it's 2017).

slides

   the authors (& others) are increasingly giving talks that are based on
   the content in this books. some of these slide-decks (like the 6-hour
   kdd 2017) are gigantic so we're collecting them separately in [132]this
   repo. contribute there if you'd like to share tutorials or course
   material based on this books.

translation

   as we write the book, large stable sections are simultaneously being
   translated into       , available in a [133]web version and via [134]github
   source.

choose your own adventure

   we've designed these tutorials so that you can traverse the curriculum
   in more than one way.
     * anarchist - choose whatever you want to read, whenever you want to
       read it.
     * imperialist - proceed through all tutorials in order. in this
       fashion you will be exposed to each model first from scratch,
       writing all the code ourselves but for the basic id202
       primitives and automatic differentiation.
     * capitalist - if you don't care how things work (or already know)
       and just want to see working code in gluon, you can skip (from
       scratch!) tutorials and go straight to the production-like code
       using the high-level gluon front end.
