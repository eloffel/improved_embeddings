welcome to the general inquirer home page.

   we mourn the loss of philip stone who died on january 31st, 2006, and
   we dedicate the continuation of this site to his memory. established as
   the home website for the general inquirer, a computer-assisted approach
   for content analyses of textual data, the site is designed to be a
   resource for learning about the inquirer as well as a reference in
   using the inquirer.

   for a copy of the "strengths compared" powerpoint presented at the
   positive psychology conference, click [1]here for the web version and
   [2]here for the power point file to download.

a note on email contact.

   you may contact roger hurwitz with questions about access to the
   general inquirer ([3]rhhu@csail.mit.edu)
   a reminder in the original page still holds true: please put "inquirer"
   as the first word in any email you send to roger. the account hosting
   this site is not being monitored for email, so please do not send
   messages to inquirer at wjh.harvard.edu.

demonstration access

   the nsf-sponsored "webuse" project at the university of maryland,
   developed by john robinson and his staff, provides an opportunity to
   try out the general inquirer on text you supply. this is a demo site,
   for use with short amounts of text. we received numerous emails about
   the site being down, but it was back up when last checked. link to it
   at: [4]http://www.webuse.umd.edu. the inquirer is listed under
   "resources" at the left of this page. you can type or paste text into
   the box and obtain different levels of feedback, depending on the
   checks you make below the box.

server access

   for serious amounts of text processing, the general inquirer is now
   available on a server, so users no longer have to download the system
   to their own computers. the rationale for using a server-bsed inquirer
   was presented intially a blog which is no longer available. [5]we have
   extracted the major article from the blog here for your reference.
   to use the server-based version, you will need to establish a project
   account on the server. [6]check the server's homepage to arrange this
   or contact roger hurwitz ([7]rhhu@csail.mit.edu)



development history

   general inquirer development has been supported by grants from the usa
   national science foundation and research grant councils of great
   britainand australia. until the mid-1990's, it only operated on large
   mainframe ibm computers that supported the pl/1 programming language.
   however with its reprogramming supported by the gallup organization,
   first in truebasic by philip stone and then in java by vanja buvac, the
   system now provides english-language content analysis capabilities
   using both the "harvard" and "lasswell" general-purpose dictionaries as
   well as any dictionary categories developed by the user. with today's
   pc's or macs, the system, including its disambiguation routines for
   high-frequency english homographs, usually processes text files on the
   order of a million words an hour. however, it is not packaged to be
   commercially available, nor do we intend to commit ourselves to
   providing the support services such availability would require.

   for the last several years, we have made the system available for
   academic research purposes. in addition to a seminar at harvard,
   workshops with laboratories have been taught at essex university (as
   part of the european social science consortium program) and at a large
   cologne sociology conference on research methods. our java software
   (which operates on pc, mac, unix or linux, including the mac's osx
   terminal), together with dictionaries, and disambiguation rules, can be
   downloaded as a zipped file. perhaps the inquirer users don't want to
   bother us, but none of those who have used the system have reported any
   software-caused crashes or other difficulties. the inquirer runs on any
   recent-vintage pc or mac computer, using less ram than current versions
   of ms word. to obtain a copy for academic purposes, please email us
   from your "edu" address. please comply carefully with the terms of use
   in the short "license" section of the documentation that comes the the
   download, including the request not to distribute the general inquirer
   on your own. and please send us copies of any reports or publications
   id30 from the use of the system.

   the java software has been augmented with an optional "word" output in
   which counts are provided for each word and word sense match (after any
   necessary suffix removals) in the combined harvard/lasswell
   dictionaries, as well as the frequency of every unmatched "leftover"
   word appearing in the texts that is not in these dictionaries. the
   output matrix can be large, with rows for every word and word sense
   appearing in the text, followed by rows for leftover words, with a
   column of raw counts for each text file processed. however, this can be
   very useful for drilling down further on your data, revising and
   expanding categories, and new category development.



introductory materials

   for an excellent general introduction to content analysis, we highly
   recommend "the content analysis guidebook" by kimberly neuendorf,
   published a year ago by sage publications. while we continue to think
   of content analysis as a "mapping" operation, rather than the
   "summarizing" operation she describes, we generally agree with her
   point of view and appreciate her thoughtful treatment of many topics
   regarding content analysis. for access to the on-line site for this
   book, [8]click here.

   this website is divided into several sections, giving both information
   about the inquirer and pointers to other systems. our website pages
   include links to the first hundred words of each category in both the
   harvard and lasswell dictionaries.

     1) for an opportunity to try out the inquirer on a moderate amount
     of text and see what it does, [9]try linking to the "webuse" site.
     for several years, we used an apple computer configured as a linux
     server to provide this internet access, which was was recommended in
     neuendorf's book and elsewhere. the webuse project at the university
     of maryland then made this capability available on their server. the
     "webuse" site only provides applications of the harvard dictionary
     categories, not the lasswell dictionary categories. note that the
     full listing for each category, not just the first 100 entries, can
     be found on this site at [10]http://www.webuse.umd.edu:9090/tags/.

     comparison of the general inquirer with other approaches, a useful
     next step might be to [11]click here.

     and lasswell dictionaries and descriptions of 182 general inquirer
     tag categories, [12]click here.

     part of the general inquirer dictionaries, [13]click here.

     organize files into folders as input to the general inquirer,
     [14]click here.

     the general inquirer, [15]click here.

     7) for some basic suggestions about how to develop new general
     inquirer categories, [16]click here.

     8) for information about a new inquirer multiword dictionary-entry
     feature, which exists for the truebasic version of the inquirer but
     is yet to be implemented for the java version, [17]click here.

     challenges, see: p.j. stone, "thematic text analysis: new agendas
     for analyzing text content." which appears as chapter 2 in text
