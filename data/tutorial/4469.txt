resnet-101-deploy.prototxt

    protobuf as the interface 
    portable 
    ca   e binary + protobuf model 
    reading and writing protobuf are 

not straightforward

   .  

(4k lines of codes)

3

tensor   ow

implement adam 

> 300 lines of codes

    a rich set of operators (~2000) 
    the codes are not very easy to 

read, e.g. not python-like

4

keras

    simple and easy to use  
    di   cult to implement 

sophisticated algorithms

5

pytorch & chainer

    flexible 
    complicate programs might 

be slow to run

6

mxnet

implement resnet

implement adam

    symbolic on network de   nition 
    imperative on tensor computation 
    huh.., not good enough

gluon at a glance

net.hybridize()    

converts from 

imperative to symbolic 

execution

9

    symbolic 
    e   cient & portable 
    but hard to use

in summary
    gluon 
    imperative  for developing 
    symbolic for deploying

    imperative 
       exible  
    may be slow
