i shall also suppose that the number of 
symbols which may be printed is finite. if 
we were to allow an infinity of symbols, 
then there would be symbols differing to 
an arbitrarily small extent ...

    we will also suppose that the number of states 
of mind which need be taken into account is finite. 
the reasons for this are of the same character as 
those which restrict the number of symbols. if we 
admitted an infinity of states of mind, some of 
them will be '' arbitrarily close " and will be 
confused.
