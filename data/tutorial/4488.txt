why	do	people do	what	they	do
(when	other	people	are	involved)?

nlp	

:a	great	way	to	find	out!

why nlp for css?

much of online human activity leaves 
digital traces that are recorded in 
natural-language format. 

exploiting these resources under a computational 
framework can bring  a phase transition in our 
understanding of human social behavior 
and shape the future of social-media systems.

    research questions

persuasion, linguistic change, framing

    techniques

language models, bayesian feature analysis

   research practices

cmv:	the	tontine	should	be	
legalized	and	made	a	common	
retirement	strategy.

[reference	url	omitted]	basically,	today	we	have	a	huge	problem	with	
retirement	[...+73	words]
a	tontine	for	retirement	looks	like	[...+56	words]	the	yearly	sum	is	divided	
evenly	for	all	the	surviving	participants	[...+25	words].	the	key	advantages	
as	i	see	it	are:
*we	don't	need	actuaries	[...+29	words...]	
*management	fees	can	be	quite	low	[...+22	words]
* [another	reason]
* [another	reason]
but	cmv.	are	there	major	risks	i	am	not	forseeing?	[+2	more	questions]

  

a	tontine	is	a	pretty	crappy	retirement	vehicle	for	most	people.		it	pays	
out	the	least	when	you	need	the	most,	and	the	most	when	you	need	the	
least.

people   s	income	needs	in	retirement	generally	fall	as	they	age.	[...+35

very	interesting.	i'll	give	a	    because	i	
didn't	have	any	idea	that	was	true	
and	changes	my	idea of	how	the	
tontine	should	work.	that	said,	i	don't	
think	it's	unsolvable	[...+44	words]

[deltabot]	confirmed:	1	delta	awarded	to	[red]	

the	social	security	system	is	basically	one	giant	
tontine	[...+13	words]		so	it's	already	legal.

i'd	imagine	the	tontine	as	a	
secondary		system	to	social	
security	though,	one	that	is	
optional	for	people	to	do,	not	
mandatory	like	social	security.
[   +11		words]

there	are	some	key	differences	
though.	first,	social	security	is	defined	
by	the	government		[...+36	words]

and	a	tontine	would	be	defined	by	
your	bank	[...+79	words]

language models, bayesian feature analysis

   research practices

controls, feasibility, data inspection   

looking forward:

deeper interplay between 

natural language processing

how people use and are affected by language 

is a huge opportunity for all concerned.
