non-stationarity
combinatorial actions
reward definition
outline
practical lessons
non-stationarity 
best policy in hindsight changes

new actions, e.g.: news articles, products, ads etc. are added


periodic trends in preferences 
non-stationarity 
best policy in hindsight changes

msn model trained on day 1, relative to models trained on days 2 and 3


non-stationarity: practical fixes 
non-stationarity: research directions
no agreed upon benchmark for non-stationary problems

exp4 with higher uniform exploration, computationally inefficient
aggregate learners over different times, weak bounds [alns    17]

simple fixes tend to be quite robust, more research needed

combinatorial actions








how to optimize choice of rankings, slideshows and other complex page layouts?
combinatorial actions
explore here
combinatorial actions: better fixes
number of models for combinatorial actions

semibandits [krs   10, kwas   15a, kad    16]: sum of observed per-action rewards 
slates [krs   10, skadljz    15]: sum of unobserved per-action rewards
cascading models [kwas   15b, lwzc    16]: observed rewards on only a prefix of actions matter, e.g. user stops reading
diverse rankings [rkj   08, sg   08, srg   13]: use techniques from submodular optimization. e.g.: separate bandit for each slot as greedy algorithm

different modeling assumptions in each, pick depending on your application

reward definition
great at optimizing given reward function
what reward function to use?
reward definition




cb reward associated with a given (context, action)
short-term proxies for long-term rewards
clicks or dwell-time for user satisfaction
exercise minutes in a day for weight-loss

long-term reward predictor can be good short-term proxy
quarterly profits
weight loss
number of returning users
reward definition: practical tricks
bad dependence on importance weights if most costs are 1!
good fit for many problems
fundamental questions have useful answers
need for system and systems exist
recipes for applying to common scenarios

concluding remarks
contextual bandits research mature for consumption
more advanced questions like non-stationarity still open
enables problems well beyond supervised learning and works much more easily than general rl

more automatic algorithms?
broader subsets of rl?
new applications?
