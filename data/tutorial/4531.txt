1. the expression   u for        r and unit vector u     rn de   nes a line of points
that may be obtained by varying the value of   . derive an expression for
the point y that lies on this line that is as close as possible to an arbitrary
point x     rn. this operation of replacing a point by its nearest member
within some set is called projection.

solutions

1. we begin by de   ning the distance from y to x. we would like to    nd the

y that minimizes this distance:

||x     y||2.

(1)

next, we need to enforce the constraint that y lies on the line de   ned by
  u. we can do this simply by de   ning y to be   u.

||x       u||2.

next, we expand the expression:

||x       u||2
=(x       u)(cid:62)(x       u)
=x(cid:62)x     2  x(cid:62)u +   2u(cid:62)u
=x(cid:62)x     2  x(cid:62)u +   2.

(6)

in the last line, we used the fact that u is a unit vector to make the
simpli   cation u(cid:62)u = 1.
we can minimize this distance by taking the derivative with respect to   
and setting it to zero:

    2x(cid:62)u + 2   = 0

      = x(cid:62)u.

(8)

recalling that y =   u, we can conclude that y = x(cid:62)uu.
