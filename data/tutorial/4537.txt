often have missing information:
(1) missing phase (phase retrieval)
(2) missing and/or corrupted entries in data matrix (robust pca)
(3) missing high-frequency spectrum (super-resolution)

makes signal/data recovery di   cult

this lecture
convex programming usually (but not always) returns the right answer!

random sampling (cs)

low-frequency sampling (sr)

compressive sensing: spectrum interpolation
super-resolution:
spectrum extrapolation

super-resolving point sources

signal of interest is superposition of point sources

celestial bodies in astronomy
line spectra in speech analysis
fluorescent molecules in single-molecule microscopy

many applications

radar
spectroscopy
medical imaging

astronomy
geophysics
...

single molecule imaging (with we moerner   s lab)

microscope receives light from    uorescent molecules

problem
resolution is much coarser than size of individual molecules (low-pass data)
can we    beat    the di   raction limit and super-resolve those molecules?

higher molecule density        faster imaging
