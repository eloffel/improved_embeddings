deep learning isn't a dangerous magic genie. it's just math

   [gw20160134040.jpg]
   geordie wood for wired

   deep learning is rapidly    eating    artificial intelligence. but let's
   not mistake this ascendant form of artificial intelligence for anything
   more than it really is. the famous author arthur c. clarke wrote, "any
   sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." and
   deep learning is certainly an advanced technology   it can identify
   objects and faces in photos, recognize spoken words, translate from one
   language to another, and even beat the top humans at the ancient game
   of go. but it's far from magic.

wired opinion

about

   oren etzioni is the ceo of the allen institute for artificial
   intelligence and a computer scientist at the university of washington.

   as companies like google and facebook and microsoft continue to push
   this technology into everyday online services   and the world continues
   to marvel at alphago, google's go playing super-machine   the pundits
   often describe deep learning as an imitation of the human brain. but
   it's really just simple math executed on an enormous scale.

   in particular, deep learning is a class of algorithmic methods for
      tuning    neural networks based on data. what does that mean? well, a
   neural network is a computer program, loosely inspired by the structure
   of the brain, which consists of a large number of very simple
   interconnected elements. each element takes numeric inputs, and
   computes a simple function (for example, a sum) over the inputs. the
   elements are far simpler than neurons, and the number of elements and
   their interconnections is several orders of magnitude smaller than the
   number of neurons and synapses in the brain. deep learning merely
   strengthens the connections in such networks.

   deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is a vibrant
   research area in artificial intelligence, or ai. abstractly, machine
   learning is an approach to approximating functions based on a
   collection of data points. for example, given the sequence "2, 4,
   6,..." a machine might predict that the 4th element of the sequence is
   8, and that the 5th is 10, by hypothesizing that the sequence is
   capturing the behavior of the function 2 times x, where x is the
   position of the element in the sequence. this paradigm is quite
   general. it has been highly successful in applications ranging from
   self-driving cars and id103 to anticipating airfare
   fluctuations and much more.

   in a sense, deep learning is not unique. any machine learning
   system   deep or not   consists of the following fundamental components:
    1. performance element: the component of the system that takes some
       action in the world (e.g., making moves in the game of go).
    2. target function: the function being learned (e.g., a mapping from
       board positions to move choices in go).
    3. training data: the set of labeled data points used to approximate
       the target function (e.g., a set of go board positions, each
       labeled with the move chosen by a human expert in that position).
    4. data representation: each data point is typically represented as a
       vector of pre-determined variables (e.g., the position of a piece
       on the go board).
    5. learning algorithm: the algorithm that computes an approximation of
       the target function based on the training data.
    6. hypothesis space: the space of possible functions the learning
       algorithm can consider.

   this architecture captures the full gamut of machine learning methods
   from simple id75 methods to complex deep-learning
   algorithms. technically, we are referring to supervised learning where
   each data point is labeled, typically by humans. when the data isn   t
   labeled, we have unsupervised learning or id91, and that's much
   harder to pull off. when some of the data is labeled, we have
   semi-supervised learning. statisticians refer to estimating the value
   of an independent variable based on dependent variables as regression.

   it   s important to realize that the first five components of a machine
   learning architecture are manually crafted inputs; the human programmer
   constructs each of these elements, and they are outside of the control
   of the learning program. in fact, the programmer typically analyzes the
   behavior of the learning program, realizes that it is unsatisfactory,
   and manually modifies one or more of these elements. this laborious
   process is often repeated many times over the course of a year or more
   before the desired performance level is achieved.

helping humans

   we can see that that a learning program   s abilities are strictly
   curtailed by this architecture. specifically:
    1. the program cannot modify any of the components of the
       architecture.
    2. the program cannot modify itself.
    3. the program cannot    learn    a function outside of its hypothesis
       space.

   for this reason, a learning program such as alphago cannot learn to
   play chess or checkers without extensive human labor. moreover, most
   programmers are not able to successfully modify machine-learning
   systems without substantial specialized training. even highly trained
   data scientists require substantial time and resources to build
   successful systems.

     a learning program such as alphago cannot learn to play chess or
     checkers without extensive human labor.

   the design and implementation of the alphago system required more than
   30 million training examples culled from the internet, and years of
   effort by a large team of researchers and engineers. in fact, merely
   improving alphago   s performance from defeating the european go
   champion, fan hui, to defeating lee sedol required several months of
   intensive work.

   alphago also utilized a class of machine-learning methods known as
   id23 where the program learns to maximize a reward by
   choosing actions, repeatedly, and observing the outcome. alphago
   repeatedly chose go moves, and observed the outcome of the game. in
   id23, training data is not a pre-labeled input.
   instead, the learning program is provided with a    reward function    that
   assigns a reward to different states of the world. while reinforcement
   learning methods acquire their training data by taking actions, and
   observing rewards, the analysis of machine learning in this article
   applies equally well to id23   such methods are still
   constrained by their target function, data representation, and
   hypothesis space, among other things.

the space of possibilities

   evolution is often cited as an example of the unbridled power of
   learning to produce remarkable results, but it is essential to
   understand the distinction between the evolutionary process of natural
   selection and its simulation in a computer program. programs that
   attempt to simulate evolutionary processes in a computer are called
   id107, and have not been particularly successful

   id107 modify a representation of the    organism,    and such
   representations tend to be very large. for example, the human genome is
   estimated to contain more than a billion bits of information. this
   means the number of possible human dna sequences is two to the power of
   a billion. exploring much of that space computationally is
   prohibitively expensive. yet, the topology of this space does not lend
   itself to algorithms that can take    easy short cuts    to a solution. in
   contrast, the game of go defines a far smaller space of possibilities,
   and one that is far easier to explore using machine learning methods.

   when we can successfully define an objective function and reduce a
   real-world task to an optimization problem, computer scientists,
   operations researchers, and statisticians have a decades-long track
   record of solving such problems (sooner or later). however, many
   problems require additional analysis before they can even be
   represented to a machine in a form that it can manipulate. for example,
   how do we write down the meaning of a single sentence in a
   machine-understandable language? as gerald sussman put it,    you can   t
   learn what you can   t represent.    in this case, the problem of choosing
   an appropriate representation is far from being formulated effectively,
   let alone solved.

   thus, deep learning (and machine learning in general) has proven to be
   a powerful class of methods in ai, but current machine learning methods
   require substantial human involvement to formulate a machine learning
   problem and substantial skill and time to iteratively reformulate the
   problem until it is solvable by a machine. most important, the process
   is narrowly circumscribed, providing the machine with a very limited
   degree of autonomy; unlike people, ai does not beget autonomy

   machine learning is far from being a    genie    that is ready to spring
   from a bottle and run amok. rather, it is a step in a decades-long (or,
   perhaps, centuries-long) research endeavor to understand intelligence
   and to construct human-level ai.

what the ai behind alphago teaches us about humanity

   when google's ai beat the world's go champion 4-1, it stirred a certain
   sadness in many people. but the reality is the technologies at the
   heart of alphago are the future. so it's a time to be excited not
   scared.
