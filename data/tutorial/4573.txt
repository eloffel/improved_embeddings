   note: this is an incomplete project. i may decide to spend a lot more
   time on it if people persist giving it positive attention.

id88

   a flexible id158 builder to analysis performance,
   and optimise the best model.

   id88 is a software that will help researchers, students, and
   programmers to design, compare, and test id158s. as
   it stands, there are few visual tools that do this for free, and with
   simplicity. this software is largely for educational purposes, allowing
   people to experiment and understand how the different parameters within
   an ann can result in different performances and better results. i have
   not used libraries like tensorflow specifally so people can see what
   goes on lower level, all within the code.
