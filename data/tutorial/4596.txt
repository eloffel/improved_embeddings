pytorch tutorial for fine tuning/id21 a resnet for image
classification

   if you want to do image classification by fine tuning a pretrained
   mdoel, this is a tutorial will help you out. it shows how to perform
   fine tuning or id21 in pytorch with your own data. it is
   based on a bunch of of official pytorch tutorials/examples. i felt that
   it was not exactly super trivial to perform in pytorch, and so i
   thought i'd release my code as a tutorial which i wrote originally for
   my research.

   highly encourage you to run this on a new data set (read
   main_fine_tuning.py to know which format to store your data in), but
   for a sample dataset to start with, you can download a simple 2 class
   dataset from here -
   [80]https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip

   all torch and pytorch specific details have been explained in detail in
   the file main_fine_tuning.py

   hope this tutorial helps you out! :)

   credits - this tutorial is built on top of mainly on 2 pytorch
   tutorials -
   [81]http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.ht
   ml and [82]https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/id163.
