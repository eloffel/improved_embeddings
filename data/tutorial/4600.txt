goal

   dependency parsers are fast, accurate, and produce easy-to-interpret
   results, but phrase-structure parses are nice too and are required
   input for many nlp tasks.

   the pad parser produces phrases-after-dependencies. give it the output
   of a dependency parser and it will produce the optimal constrained
   phrase-structure parse.

installation

cd src
make

how to use

> ./dep_parser sents.txt | ./pad -m pad.model | head
(top  (sinv  (cc but)   (s  (np  (prp you) ) )   (md ca)   (np  (rb n't) )   (vp

erely)   (jj commercial)   (cc and)   (jj lightweight) ) ) )   (. .) ) )


   or
./pad --model model --sentences test.predicted.conll

>./pad --help

pad: phrases after dependencies
  usage: pad [options]

  options:
  --help:              print this message and exit.
  --model, -m:         (required) model file.
  --sentences, -g:     conll sentence file.
  --oracle, -o:        run in oracle mode.
  --pruning, -p:        .
  --dir_pruning:        .

how to train

   to train a new model, you'll need a grammar file and gold annotations.
   the file formats are described below.
> ./padt --grammar rules --model model --annotations parts --conll train.conll -
-epochs 5 --simple_features

   padt takes the following options.
> ./padt --help

padt: phrases after dependencies trainer
usage: padt [options]

options:
--help:             print this message and exit.
--grammar, -g:      (required) grammar file.
--conll, -c:        (required) conll sentence file.
--model, -m:        (required) model file to output.
--annotations, -a   (required) gold phrase structure file.
--epochs[=10], -e:  number of epochs.
--lambda[=0.0001]:  l1 id173 constant.
--simple_features   use simple set of features.

   we also provide python scripts for extracting a grammar and annotations
   from phrase-structure trees using the collins head rules.

   please refers to python/readme.md

file formats

   the grammar file has two types of lines. for unary rules:
rule# 0 x y 0

   for binary rules:
rule# 1 x y z head

   the annotation file is only required for training. each line is of the
   form:
#rules
i j k h m r

   where i, j, k are the span of the rule, h is the head index, m is the
   modifier index, and r in the index of the rule from the grammar file.

   there is no line break between sentences.
