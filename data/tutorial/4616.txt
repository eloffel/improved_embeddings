tensorslow

a re-implementation of [76]tensorflow functionality in pure python

   tensorslow is a minimalist machine learning api that mimicks the
   tensorflow api, but is implemented in pure python (without a c
   backend). the source code has been built with maximal understandability
   in mind, rather than maximal efficiency. therefore, tensorslow should
   be used solely for educational purposes. if you want to understand how
   deep learning libraries like tensorflow work under the hood, this may
   be your best shot.

   i have written an article in my blog at [77]deepideas.net that develops
   this library step by step, explaining all the math and algorithms on
   the way: [78]deep learning from scratch.

how to use

   import:
import tensorslow as ts

   create a computational graph:
ts.graph().as_default()

   create input placeholders:
training_features = ts.placeholder()
training_classes = ts.placeholder()

   build a model:
weights = ts.variable(np.random.randn(2, 2))
biases = ts.variable(np.random.randn(2))
model = ts.softmax(ts.add(ts.matmul(x, w), b))

   create training criterion:
loss = ts.negative(ts.reduce_sum(ts.reduce_sum(ts.multiply(training_classes, ts.
log(model)), axis=1)))

   create optimizer:
optimizer = ts.train.gradientdescentoptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(j)

   create placeholder inputs:
feed_dict = {
        training_features: my_training_features,
        training_classes: my_training_classes
}

   create session:
session = ts.session()

   train:
for step in range(100):
        loss_value = session.run(loss, feed_dict)
        if step % 10 == 0:
                print("step:", step, " loss:", loss_value)
        session.run(optimizer, feed_dict)

   retrieve model parameters:
weights_value = session.run(weigths)
biases_value = session.run(biases)
