deep learning with tensorflow in python: convolution neural nets

     * posted by [34]sandipan dey on august 3, 2017 at 10:30pm
     * [35]view blog

   the following problems appeared in the assignments in the udacity
   course deep learning (by google). the descriptions of the problems are
   taken from the assignments (continued from the last post).

classifying the letters with notmnist dataset with deep network

   here is how some sample images from the dataset look like:

   im13

   let   s try to get the best performance using a multi-layer model! (the
   best reported test accuracy using a deep network is  97.1%).
     * one avenue you can explore is to add multiple layers.
     * another one is to use learning rate decay.


learning l2-regularized  deep neural network with sgd

   the following figure recapitulates the neural network with a 3 hidden
   layers, the first one with 2048 nodes,  the second one with 512 nodes
   and the third one with with 128nodes, each one with relu intermediate
   outputs. the l2 id173s applied on the lossfunction for the
   weights learnt at the input and the hidden layers
   are   1,   2,   3 and   4, respectively.

   the next 3 animations visualize the weights learnt for 400 randomly
   selected nodes from hidden layer 1 (out of 2096 nodes), then
   another 400 randomly selected nodes from hidden layer 2 (out
   of 512 nodes) and finally at all 128 nodes from hidden layer 3, at
   different steps using sgd and l2 regularized id168
   (with   1 =   2 =   3 =   4
   =0.01).  as can be seen below, the weights learnt are gradually
   capturing (as the sgd steps increase) the different features of the
   letters at the corresponding output neurons.

   f2

   batch size = 128 and drop-out rate = 0.8 for training dataset are used
   for the above set of experiments, with learning decay. we can play with
   the hyper-parameters to get better test accuracy.

convolution neural network

   previously  we trained fully connected networks to
   classify notmnist characters. the goal of this assignment is to make
   the neural network convolutional.

   let   s build a small network with two convolutional layers, followed
   by one fully connected layer. convolutional networks are more expensive
   computationally, so we   ll limit its depth and number of fully connected
   nodes. the below figure shows the simplified architecture of
   the convolution neural net.

   as shown above, the convnet uses:
     * 5  5 kernels
     * 16 filters
     * 2  2 strides
     * same padding
     * 64 hidden nodes

   the following figures visualize the feature representations at
   different layers for the first 16 images during training:

convolution neural network with max pooling

   the convolutional model above uses convolutions with stride 2 to reduce
   the dimensionality. replace the strides by a max pooling
   operation of stride 2 and kernel size 2. the below figure shows the
   simplified architecture of the convolution neural net with max pooling
   layers.

   as shown above, the convnet uses:
     * 5  5 kernels
     * 16 filters

     * same padding

   as can be seen from the above results, with max pooling, the test
   accuracy increased slightly.

   the following figures visualize the feature representations at
   different layers for the first 16 images during training with max
   pooling:

   f10 f11 f12 f13

   till now the convnets we have tried are small enough and we did not
   obtain high enough accuracy on the test dataset. next we shall make our
   convnet deep to increase the test accuracy.

   to be continued
