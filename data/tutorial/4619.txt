tensorflow

   in may 2017 google announced the second-generation of the tpu, as well
   as the availability of the tpus in [37]google compute engine.[38][12]
   the second-generation tpus deliver up to 180 teraflops of performance,
   and when organized into clusters of 64 tpus provide up to 11.5
   petaflops.

keras

   in 2017, google   s tensorflow team decided to support keras in
   tensorflow   s core library. chollet explained that keras was conceived
   to be an interface rather than an end-to-end machine-learning
   framework. it presents a higher-level, more intuitive set of
   abstractions that make it easy to configure neural networks regardless
   of the backend scientific computing library.

   keras cheat sheet

numpy

   numpy targets the [40]cpython reference [41]implementation of python,
   which is a non-optimizing [42]bytecode interpreter. mathematical
   algorithms written for this version of python often run much slower
   than [43]compiled equivalents. numpy address the slowness problem
   partly by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators
   that operate efficiently on arrays, requiring rewriting some code,
   mostly inner loops using numpy.

pandas

   the name    pandas    is derived from the term    [44]panel data   , an
   [45]econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets.

scipy

   scipy builds on the [51]numpy array object and is part of the numpy
   stack which includes tools like [52]matplotlib, [53]pandas and
   [54]sympy, and an expanding set of scientific computing libraries. this
   numpy stack has similar users to other applications such as [55]matlab,
   [56]gnu octave, and [57]scilab. the numpy stack is also sometimes
   referred to as the scipy stack.[58][3]

matplotlib

   matplotlib is a [60]plotting [61]library for the [62]python programming
   language and its numerical mathematics extension [63]numpy. it provides
   an [64]object-oriented [65]api for embedding plots into applications
   using general-purpose [66]gui toolkits like [67]tkinter, [68]wxpython,
   [69]qt, or [70]gtk+. there is also a [71]procedural    pylab    interface
   based on a [72]state machine (like [73]opengl), designed to closely
   resemble that of [74]matlab, though its use is discouraged.[75][2]
   [76]scipy makes use of matplotlib.

   pyplot is a matplotlib module which provides a matlab-like
   interface.[77][6] matplotlib is designed to be as usable as matlab,
   with the ability to use python, with the advantage that it is free.
