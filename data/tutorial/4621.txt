getting ready for ai based gaming agents     overview of open source
id23 platforms

   [97]faizan shaikh, december 15, 2016

introduction

   we are living in exciting times. we are all set to create an army of
   smart machines and robots. creating these machines has been a dream and
   one of the biggest challenges humans have faced. what adds to this
   excitement is that no one knows how these smart machines and robots
   will impact us in return. will they end up taking people out of their
   jobs? or will they create new avenues and opportunities, which we
   humans can   t think of as of now! one thing is for sure though     there
   is a lot of automation about to happen here!

   researchers have created a [98]roadmap for machine intelligence
   research. following suite, some major platforms have been built to give
   way to this research. in this article, i explain id23
   in simple terms and compare major platforms for testing reinforcement
   learning algorithms. kindly note, i have included only those platforms
   which have projects dedicated for the environment and not those which
   have integrated support for id23 algorithms.

   these platforms should enable a generation of research and new findings
   / developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

    1. what is id23?
    2. examples of id23
    3. what is a id23 platform?
    4. examples of id23 platform
    5. cheatsheet of major platforms
    6. a few other notable platforms


1. what is id23?

   let us start with a simple analogy. if you have a pet at home, you may
   have used this technique with your pet.

   a clicker (or whistle) is a technique to let your pet know some treat
   is just about to get served! this is essentially    reinforcing    your pet
   to practice good behavior. you click the    clicker    and follow up with a
   treat. and with time, your pet gets accustomed to this sound and
   responds every time he/she hears the click sound. with this technique,
   you can train your pet to do    good    deeds when required.

   now let   s make these replacements in the example:
     * the pet becomes the artificial agent
     * the treat becomes the reward function
     * the good behavior is the resultant action

   the above example explains what id23 looks like. this
   is actually a classic example of id23.

   to apply this on an artificial agent, you have a kind of a feedback
   loop to reinforce your agent. it rewards when the actions performed is
   right and punishes in-case it was wrong. basically what you have in
   your kitty is:
     * an internal state, which is maintained by the agent to learn about
       the environment
     * a reward function, which is used to train your agent how to behave
     * an environment, which is a scenario the agent has to face
     * an action, which is done by the agent in the environment
     * and last but not the least, an agent which does all the deeds!

2. examples of id23

   now, i am sure you must be thinking how the experiment conducted on
   animals can be relevant to people practicing machine learning. this is
   what i thought when i came across id23 first.

   a lot of beginners tend to think that there are only 2 types of
   problems in machine learning     supervised machine learning and
   unsupervised machine learning. i don   t know where this notion comes
   from, but the world of machine learning is much more than the 2 types
   of problems mentioned above. id23 is one such class
   of problems.

   let   s look at some real-life applications of id23.
   generally, we know the start state and the end state of an agent, but
   there could be multiple paths to reach the end state     reinforcement
   learning finds an application in these scenarios. this essentially
   means that driverless cars, self navigating vaccum cleaners, scheduling
   of elevators are all applications of id23.

   here is a video of a game bot trained to play flappy bird.

3. what is a id23 platform?

   before we look into what a platform is, lets try to understand a
   id23 environment.

   a id23 environment is what an agent can observe and
   act upon. the horizon of an agent is much bigger, but it is the task of
   the agent to perform actions on the environment which can help it
   maximize its reward. as per [101]   a brief introduction to reinforcement
   learning    by murphy (1998),

     the environment is a modeled as a stochastic finite state machine
     with inputs (actions sent from the agent) and outputs (observations
     and rewards sent to the agent).

   let   s take an example,

   [supermariobrosbeginning.png]

   this is a typical game of mario. remember how you played this game. now
   consider that you are the    agent    who is playing the game.

   now you have    access    to a land of opportunities, but you don   t know
   what will happen when you do something, say smash a brick. you can see
   a limited amount of    environment   , and until you traverse around the
   world you can   t see everything. so you move around the world, trying to
   perceive what entails ahead of you, and at the same time try to
   increase your chances to attain your goal.

   this whole    story    is not created by itself. you have to    render    it
   first. and that is the main task of the platform, viz to create
   everything required for a complete experience     the environment, the
   agent and the rewards.


4. major id23 platforms

i) deepmind lab

     deepmind lab is a fully 3d game-like platform tailored for
     agent-based ai research

   a recent release by google deepmind, deepmind lab is an integrated
   agent-environment platform for general artificial intelligence research
   with a focus on first person perspective games. it was built to
   accomodate the research done at deepmind. deepmind lab is based on an
   open-source engine ioquake3 , which was modified to be a flexible
   interface for integration with artificial systems.

   things i liked
     * it has richer and realistic visuals.
     * closer integration with the gaming environment

   things i did not like
     * it still lacks variety in terms of a gaming environment, which
       would get built over time by open source contributions.
     * also at the moment, it supports only linux, but has been tested on
       different os. bazel (which is a dependency for deepmind lab) is
       experimental for windows. so windows support for deepmind lab is
       still not guaranteed.

   resources to explore further:
     * [102]release post
     * [103]open-source repository
     * [104]deepmindlab
     * [105]simple tutorial


ii) openai gym

     (openai gym is) a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement
     learning algorithms

   openai gym is a platform for creating, evaluating and benchmarking
   artificial agents in a game environment. the best thing i like about
   gym is that along with the toolkit, there is a community support built
   around it, viz an evaluation platform, code sharing platform and a
   discussion platform. gym platform consists multiple categories of
   environment along with sample solutions provided by the community

   things i liked
     * variety of game environments with considerable open-source support.

   things i did not like
     * like deepmind lab, gym also has a limit on the number of
       environments it supports (this is essentially taken care by openai
       universe)

   resources to explore further:
     * [106]release post
     * [107]open-source repository
     * [108]whitepaper
     * [109]simple tutorial


iii) openai universe

     [110]universe is a software platform for measuring and training an
     ai   s general intelligence across the world   s supply of games,
     websites and other applications

   this is essentially an extension to openai gym, with support for
   literally    anything    you can do on a computer. universe is built to
   emulate how a human interacts with a computer. it uses [111]virtual
   network computing to access a computer remotely, packages any program
   and converts it into a gym environment.
   things i liked
     * unlimited access to any game environment.
     * universe is not only constrained to gaming environment, it can be
       used to replace things like manual testing and working on amazon
       mechanical turk

   things i did not like
     * initial release lacks many things which were promised, the
       significant one is integration with windows.

   resources to explore further:
     * [112]release post
     * [113]open-source repository
     * [114]simple tutorial

iv) project malmo

     the malmo platform is a sophisticated ai experimentation platform
     built on top of minecraft, and designed to support fundamental
     research in artificial intelligence.

   project malmo is a research initiative by microsoft research, with an
   aim to build ai agents to do complex tasks. minecraft is a perfect
   scenario for building ai agents, and that is why they chose it.

   things i liked
     * integration with a sophisticated environment
     * flexibility for customizing game environment

   things i did not like
     * the support is only for minecraft, and no other game environment
       unlike openai universe.

   resources to explore further:
     * [115]release post
     * [116]open-source repository
     * [117]whitepaper
     * [118]simple tutorial


v) vizdoom

     doom-based ai research platform for id23 from raw
     visual information

   i personally found this the most interesting platform to build ai
   agents, as you can have a multi-agent support with a competitive
   environment to test the agent. the platform runs on doom, a first
   person shooting game, with a variety of levels and modes.

   things i liked
     * variety of game modes with competitive environment

   things i did not like
     * similar to above platform, vizdoom has only support for one
       environment.

   resources to explore further:
     * [119]release post
     * [120]open-source repository
     * [121]whitepaper
     * [122]simple tutorial
