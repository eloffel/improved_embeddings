non-distributional

   manaal faruqui, [69]manaalfar@gmail.com

   this repository contains data released with the paper on
   non-distributional word vector representation (faruqui & dyer, 2015).
   we provide here word vectors that have been constructed using
   non-distributional information. this lexical information has been
   collected from different linguistic lexicons constrcuted over time in
   nlp research. for more details please refer to the paper.

data and tools

   ####binary-vectors.txt.gz

   this is a word vector file which is very high dimensional and is 99.9%
   sparse. it contains binary vectors i.e, every word vector has only 1 or
   0 as elements. its best to use this file in a compressed mode as it
   expands to around 41 gb of text file.

   example vector:-

   the 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ...

   ####word-feat.txt

   every line of this file contains a word followed by all the features
   that the word possesses as collected from the group of lexicons in
   lexicons/ folder. this is an un-expanded form of the word vectors in
   binary-vectors.txt.gz

   example vector:-

   untrustworthiness wn_noun.attribute noun,negative

   ####create-vector.py

   this script takes a lexicon and converts it into a binary vector. we
   have created binary-vectors.txt.gz using this script from all the files
   in lexicon/ folder. if you want to create vectors from framenet use the
   following command:-

   python create-vector.py < lexicons/framenet.txt > binary-fn-vectors.txt

   we created binary-vectors.txt using the following command:-

   python create-vector.py < <(cat lexicons/*) > binary-vectors.txt

   ####lexicons/

   every file in this directory is a lexicon containing the word and the
   features that it possesses.
