how to draw a syntax tree, part 8: a step-by-step tree-drawing guide, with
gifs

   i   ve talked previously about [30]all the different possibilities for
   what constitutes a syntax tree, but not about how you get from    here   s
   how you   re supposed to represent things    to actually drawing a tree
   yourself. and that   s a pity, because i   ve actually got a really nice
   series of steps that i   ve developed from teaching, taing, and tutoring.

   here are the steps in a nutshell: i   m going to go through them one at a
   time.

   1. label parts of speech
   2. label main constituents
   3. draw tree

   note: i recommend doing all of these steps by hand if at all possible.
   you   ll see from the photos and gifs below that it was easier for me to
   break out the paper and markers than to try to represent this
   electronically. if you want to type up your tree later, [31]here are
   some tools for doing so, but it   ll be much easier to type up from an
   existing handwritten draft rather than try to do the thinking and the
   typesetting as part of the same step. pencil or even a
   chalkboard/whiteboard is often a good idea for tree-drafting, and
   you   ll get better at figuring out spacing as you practice more.

   so what do these steps look like in practice? note that rather like
   learning to ride a bicycle, the extended description looks long and
   complicated, but with practice many of the steps become automatic with
   time.

   step 1: label parts of speech

   you   re going to start with your sentence just written out normally    
   feel free to use the version that you get printed on your test or
   assignment, or write it out for yourself on scrap paper. if you   re
   writing it out yourself, it   s a good idea to leave extra space between
   the words, for the sake of the next step.

   now label each word with its part of speech (also called lexical or
   grammatical category). start with the easy, obvious ones: label the
   nouns as n, label the verbs as v, label the adjectives (a or adj),
   prepositions (p), and adverbs (adv). now move on to the less obvious
   ones, determiners (d or det), auxiliaries (aux), degree words (deg),
   and complementizers (c ). (i   ve also seen degree words referred to as
   mod for modifier, although i find this confusing because entire phrases
   can also be used to modify things.)

   possible tricky bits in this step: some words can belong to multiple
   categories! for example, play can be a noun (going to a play), a verb
   (play tennis), or even an adjective (a play banana, as opposed to a
   real one). fortunately, while play in isolation is ambiguous, it should
   be clear from context what category it belongs to in a particular
   sentence. your course materials should include some tests for part of
   speech, or you can refer to [32]these notes, [33]these lists (but note
   that there are adverbs that don   t end in -ly, such as often), or
   [34]this set of examples.

   one easy way to keep track of parts of speech is to learn a keyword or
   two that unambiguously belongs in each category, and then when you   re
   trying to figure out whether another word belongs to that category, you
   can say    could i replace it with this other word that i know the
   lexical category of?    here   s a sample list:

     noun - cat, happiness
     verb - see, laugh
     adjective - blue, happy
     adverb - quickly
     preposition - in
     determiner - the
     complementizer -  if, whether
     auxiliary - could
     degree word - very, nearly

   (note: do not use    that    as a keyword, because it can be a determiner,
   as in    that cat   , or a complementizer, as in    i saw that the cat was
   purring   . compare what happens when you substitute them:    the cat    but
   not    *if cat   ,    *whether cat   , and    i saw whether the cat was purring   
   but not    *i saw the the cat was purring   .  "be" and    have    are
   sometimes verbs as in    i am/have a cat   , sometimes auxiliaries, as in
      i was laughing/have laughed    and your course may have particular
   conventions distinguishing them from modal auxiliaries like can, could,
   may, might, shall, should, will, would.)

   in general, this step is going to end up with essentially the same
   results regardless of [35]what theory your course is using. apart from
   the auxiliaries and degree words/modifiers things, the only other part
   where i   d expect variation is depending on how your course treats
   pronouns and maybe proper names, so just check whether you   re using np,
   n, d, etc for them.

   why are we doing this step? rather than rushing into drawing a tree
   right away, this step will make sure you get all the labels for each
   node correct and don   t forget anything. move on to step 2 once all
   words are labelled.

   here   s a image of step 1: i labeled the words starting with the more
   obvious content words and then adding in the less obvious function
   words, but you can do it in any order that makes sense.
   image

   step 2: label main constituents

   once you   ve gotten everything labelled, you want to figure out the
   constituents and the main relationships between various parts of the
   sentence. your goal for this step is to get every head inside its own
   phrase: for every n, you need to figure out what its np is, for every
   v, you figure out its vp, etc. if you   re doing bar levels, you might
   label a couple of those at this step if you   ve got ambiguity or a whole
   lot of stuff inside a particular phrase, but for the routine bar levels
   you can just put them in at the next step.

   there are two main ways to tackle this problem, bottom-up and top-down.
   they   re not mutually exclusive though: just alternate between them,
   doing whichever is easiest until you   ve got all your heads inside their
   respective phrases.

   bottom-up: start by identifying the easy phrases that only have a word
   or two in them: adjps, advps, and nps are often fairly small. then move
   on to slightly larger constituents, including pps and more elaborate
   nps (and dps if you   re using them), then vps and finally ips and cps,
   if necessary.

   top-down: start by identifying the verb(s): if you   re drawing a
   sentence, there should be at least one of them.

   now, every verb has a subject, and they often have an object as well,
   maybe even two. you can identify these by asking questions about the
   sentence: the answer to    who is verbing?    is the subject, and the
   answer to    who is being verbed?    is the object. (the answer to    who is
   the object being verbed to?    is the indirect object.) and there might
   be other stuff that relates to the verb as well, such as an adverb or
   prepositional phrase.

   so your subject, including associated words like determiners,
   adjectives, pps, etc, needs to form an np (or maybe a cp or dp) all by
   itself, while your object, also including associated words, is an np,
   cp, or dp that   s inside the vp. also inside the vp (but not inside the
   object) might be some extra stuff, adverbs and pps. you can indicate
   this with brackets around the vp, or another thing you might want to do
   for maximum clarity is underline the subject and object, and use arrows
   to point them to their verbs.

   this is also the point where, if there   s any movement that   s going on,
   you   ll want to    restore    the affected word(s) back to their original
   position(s). you may be able to do this with the same questions that
   you used to figure out subject and object, or if you   re dealing with a
   question, try answering it (   what did the cat play?           the cat (did)
   play the piano   , so your restored sentence is    the cat did play
   what?   ).

   how do we know what   s inside each of our phrases, besides the head?
   there are certain non-head words that typically go with certain types
   of heads: degree words with adjectives, prepositions, or adverbs,
   determiners with nouns (it   s a bit more complicated if you   re using
   dps), auxiliaries with verbs (unless your course is putting them at i).
   but for phrases within other phrases, you   ll have to figure it out, and
   that   s the tricky bit.

   fortunately, there are a series of questions you can ask in order to
   figure out which phrases contain other phrases, and they   re known as
   constituency tests.  your course may give you a list of constituency
   tests     if not, [36]here are two [37]not-very-overlapping lists. two
   very common types are questions and substitution. i   ll demonstrate them
   both below for various constituents in the sentence    youtube showed
   that the cat played the piano.   

   questions:
     * what did youtube do? [show that the cat played the piano] - vp
     * what did youtube show? [that the cat played the piano] - cp
     * what did the cat do? [play the piano] - vp
     * what did youtube show the cat played? [the piano] - np
     * what was played? [the piano] - np
     * where did the cat play the piano? [youtube] - np
     * where did the cat play the piano? *[youtube showed] -not a
       constituent
     * who played the piano? [the cat] - np

   substitution:
     * youtube showed that the cat played the piano, and vimeo did __ too.
       ( __ = show that the cat played the piano - vp)
     * youtube showed it (it=that the cat played the piano - cp)
     * the cat played the piano, and the dog did __ too. ( __ = play the
       piano - vp)
     * youtube showed that the cat played it. (it = the piano - np)
     * it showed that the cat played the piano. (it = youtube - np)
     * youtube showed that s/he played the piano (s/he = the cat - np)

   when you figure out that some string of words is a constituent, put
   square brackets around it and label what kind of constituent it is (np,
   pp, vp, etc). i like to do this by hand because i can make the square
   brackets of different sizes or colours to keep track of them all. if
   you find it helpful, you can also use underlining, highlighting, or
   circles to group other elements. (here   s [38]an example of particularly
   enthusiastic colour usage.)

   if we have an extra modifier of some sort, we can use the same tests to
   figure out what it modifies. for example, we can add several different
   prepositional phrases beginning with    in    to the sentence above:

     youtube showed that the cat played the piano in a blue shirt.
     youtube showed that the cat played the piano in high definition.
     youtube showed that the cat played the piano in the living room.

   but [in something] doesn   t necessarily modify the same thing each time,
   so we need to ask questions about it:

     what was in a blue shirt? the cat (playing), not youtube or the
     piano.
     what was in high definition? youtube   s showing, not the cat or the
     piano.
     what was in the living room? the piano (or maybe the cat playing)
     but not youtube.

   and based on the answers to these questions, we can mark up the
   sentence as follows:

     youtube showed that the cat [ played the piano in a blue shirt ]vp
     youtube [ showed [ that the cat played the piano ]cp  in high
     definition ]vp
     youtube showed that the cat played [ the piano in the living room
     ]np

   why are we doing this step? this step is where most of the thinking
   happens: the goal is to know exactly what you   re putting in your tree
   before any of the tree-drawing actually happens. otherwise it   s
   tempting to just draw a general shape that looks kind of like the trees
   you   ve seen before without fully examining what each part is
   contributing, which will end up as a mess. no really. it will.

   proceed onto the next step when: all heads (n, v, p, adj, adv, c, and,
   if you   re using it, d) are inside their respective phrases (np, vp, pp,
   adjp, advp, cp and maybe dp). make sure you know what the subject(s)
   and object(s) is/are. also make sure that for any adjp, advp, or pp
   that you know what it modifies and how to indicate this in the
   structure.

   as you get more practised at drawing trees, this step will take less
   time and you can skip over the easy parts if you want. for example, if
   parts of speech are 100% intuitive to you, you may be able to go right
   to labeling the constituents. or you may not need to draw brackets
   around all the adjps and nps, you can just figure out the subject and
   object and any ambiguities. but even once you   re fairly good at
   tree-drawing, if you   re ever faced with an unexpectedly daunting
   sentence to draw, you can always fall back on step 1: label the words
   and step 2: label the constituents. or, if you   re drawing a really
   high-stakes tree, for a test or an assignment, you may still want to
   proceed as methodically as possible to reduce your chances of making a
   silly mistake.

   note that i have not gotten into sentence-level projections (i.e. [39]s
   or [40]ip or [41]tp, whichever you   re using). there   s a reason for
   that: first of all, that   s where there   s the most variance between
   course conventions. secondly, this is the type of projection that may
   not have an obvious head (unless you have an aux and your course is
   treating aux as an i head). and thirdly, you automatically need an
   s/ip/tp to contain your entire sentence, so it   s not a particularly
   informative constituent to add since it will literally just contain the
   whole sentence. but, and this is important, you also need another
   s/ip/tp for every additional verb that you have in your sentence,
   because any verb and associated words (subject, object, etc) could also
   be a sentence by itself.

   for example:

     youtube showed that the cat played the piano.

   contains two verbs,    showed    and    played    and thus two clauses, each of
   which could be a sentence with minor modifications:

     the main (or [42]matrix) clause:    youtube showed      

     the subordinate (or embedded) clause:    that the cat played the
     piano   

   so we also need to split these up. we know that    that    is a
   complementizer   , so it creates a cp (or s    if you   re using it), but
   inside the cp is an s/ip/tp (directly inside every cp, in the position
   of sister to the c, is an s/ip/tp).

     [s/ip/tp youtube showed [cp that [s/ip/tp the cat played the piano ]
     ] ]

   however, if you only have one verb in your sentence, then you also only
   have one clause, the main clause, so you can skip this part.

   here   s a gif of step 1+2: i start by labelling the words as in step 1,
   and then add labels for various constituents (here i am using a strict
   x-bar theory with ips). i worked bottom-up from smaller to bigger
   groups, but you could also do a top-down approach, whatever works for
   you. notice the brackets getting bigger and bigger, which is an
   advantage of handwriting. leaving lots of space around the words will
   help fit in all the brackets, but you definitely don   t need to be as
   pretty as i   m being here.
   image

   and here   s a static image of the final result (note that i   ve labelled
   both sides of the brackets for extra clarity, but you don   t have to):
   image

   step 3: draw tree

   now, finally, we get to draw the tree!

   a lot of people think that this is the step that you start at, but
   unless you   re dealing with a really, really easy sentence and you
   already have practice drawing trees, jumping right into drawing a tree
   will just leave you confused and not sure what to put where. it   s a lot
   better to be confused at the previous step, where you can pause and try
   a couple things and figure it out, rather than at this step, where
   you   ll be tempted to just draw something that looks basically like a
   tree and think    eh, good enough   . trust me, despite the fact that the
   rules may look confusing and arbitrary to you when you   re starting out,
   they make good sense to your prof or ta, and it will be very obvious to
   them if you do that.

   i   m going to point out at this stage that syntax trees are not
   something you can bs. however, this is in fact a great and wonderful
   thing, because it means that you can, with enough effort, check your
   own work and prove that your tree is correct (or fix it if it   s not),
   and you are not at the mercy of dubious judgement calls and whether or
   not the prof likes you. a correct syntax tree is correct, a wrong
   (portion of a) syntax tree is wrong, and although there are a few
   fudgey bits in the realm of    how much do we care that this thing is
   wrong?   , it is entirely possible to get a score of 100% in a syntax
   course or unit.

   syntax (and in fact linguistics in general, actually) is not one of
   those subjects where the prof artificially caps the maximum score at 80
   or 85: if you draw a completely correct tree, or in general demonstrate
   a very thorough understanding of the topic, you will get full marks,
   and for every mark you lose, there is something very specific that you
   should have done differently, and most profs and tas will tell you
   exactly what answer they were looking for. it   s very satisfying. (i
   mean, until you get to high-level courses where you realize that what a
   syntax tree should even look like is still a matter of theoretical
   debate, but in an intro course there is definitely still a right
   answer.)

   but enough with the pep talk: how do you take your
   now-thoroughly-marked-up sentence and make it into a tree?

   you   re going to start at the top. as tempting as it may be to draw your
   sentence along the bottom of the page and draw up from there, this is
   not how syntax trees are conventionally drawn. why? well, starting from
   the top gives you more symmetrically-sized branches rather than long
   branches on one side and cramped, tiny, hard-to-read ones on the other,
   as well as more space for movement arrows. it   s also how the vast
   majority of syntax trees are drawn, and it   s easier for everyone to
   interpret each other   s trees if we follow a few basic formatting
   conventions.

   if you   re worried about spacing, note that english trees will branch
   more on the right than on the left, so starting your s/ip/tp about a
   third of the way over on the left side of the page at the very top is
   generally better than starting it in the middle. or just find an empty
   classroom and practise on a large whiteboard/chalkboard where you don   t
   need to worry about wasting paper. thanks to the miracles of modern
   technology, you can even take a photo of your whiteboard tree when
   you   re finished, which was definitely not a thing when i was an
   undergraduate.

   (related: do not, for the love of chomsky, draw your syntax trees
   upside-down. that is, do not write the sentence along the top of the
   page and draw branches down from it. i   ve gotten one or two of these in
   every stack of syntax assignments i   ve marked, and while i do always
   try to mark it as much as possible, it takes me about three times as
   long to figure out what   s going on and hence makes me grumpy. and you
   don   t want a grumpy person marking your assignment. if you want to
   instead make your marker especially happy, i have gotten some
   delightfully entertaining drawings from students on tests and
   assignments over the years, so you know, feel free.)

   so you   re going to start at the top of the page with your maximal
   sentence projection, s or ip or tp (that   s s    or cp if you   ve got a
   question), and proceed down from there.

   [43]if you   re using s, s will branch into an np (subject) and a vp
   (containing v, the object np, and maybe more) plus maybe other things.

   if you   re using [44]ip or [45]tp, ip or tp will branch into np
   (subject) and i    or t   , which will branch into i or t and vp
   (containing v, the object np, and maybe other things). (or these nps
   might all be dps, if you   re using [46]the dp hypothesis. if you   ve
   never seen a dp, just ignore everything i   m saying about them.)

   anyway, this first part is pretty much always the same for any
   sentence, which is why we didn   t really bother map out this top
   projection in the previous step.

   now you   re going to take the constituents that you figured out in the
   previous step and get them into the tree:
     * what   s in your subject? put it all under that subject position.
     * make sure to include bar levels if your course is using them.
     * do you have anything modifying your verb? put it under the vp (v   
       if you   re using them).
     * what   s in your object? put it all directly sister to your v.
     * include bar levels again if relevant.
     * do you have any embedded clauses? you   ve figured out what they   re
       embedded under in the previous step, now put them there. be sure to
       include a cp (s   ) and s/ip/tp before going into the subject, verb,
       etc of the embedded clause.
     * is anything ambiguous? if you figured out an ambiguity in the
       previous step, there are a couple ways to proceed. if your course
       or assignment has mentioned ambiguity as an option, you should
       probably draw both trees and indicate which meaning each one
       corresponds to. if there   s a technical ambiguity but one
       interpretation is way more plausible than the other, and you
       haven   t been told to find ambiguities, you may be able to get away
       with just drawing the most plausible interpretation (although in
       that case, feel free to include a note to the marker). draw
       ambiguities on separate trees though, not the same one.
     * if you need to draw movement, make sure you represent the original
       position and the moved position using whatever conventions your
       course is using (arrows, traces, etc).

   when you think you   ve finished your tree, here are a few common errors
   that you can check:

   basic errors:
    1. did you include all the words from the target sentence in your
       tree?
    2. does the tree, left to right, read in the same order as your target
       sentence? (after any movement has happened.) if this is not the
       case, you need to fix something.
    3. do all the words have their part of speech labels that you
       established at the beginning? (double-check the tests you used at
       the labelling step if you want to be really careful.)
    4. is each head inside its corresponding maximal projection? (n inside
       np, v inside vp, etc.)
    5. if you   re doing strict x    theory, do you have at least one bar
       level between each head and its maximal projection? (n    between n
       and np, v    between v and vp, etc.)
    6. do you have any triangles? (your instructor may use triangles.
       [47]this is why you should not.)

   more specific errors:
    1. if you have more than one verb, is each verb inside its own vp
       which is inside its own s/ip/tp? is each non-matrix verb   s s/ip/tp
       inside its own s   /cp?
    2. is there any movement? if it   s a question, what would the statement
       version sound like? if there are multiple verbs, what would each
       mini clause sound like separately? if there is passive, what would
       the active version sound like?
    3. what complements do you have, if any? especially complements of pps
       (generally nps/dps), or nps and adjps (often pps beginning with
          of   ). are they in the right positions? (in x    theory, a complement
       is sister to the head, so complement of a noun     sister to n,
       complement of an adjective     sister to adj, etc. in a theory
       without bar levels, a complement is simply inside the phrasal
       level, so complement of a noun     inside its np, complement of a
       verb     inside its vp, etc.)
    4. what modifiers do you have, if any? adjps, advps, pps   what does
       each modifier modify? is it in the right position to do so? (in x   
       theory, a modifier is sister to the bar level of the modified
       element, so modifying a noun     sister to its n   , modifying a verb    
       sister to its v   , etc. in a theory without bar levels, a modifier
       is simply inside the phrasal level of the modified element, so
       modifying a noun     inside its np, modifying a verb     inside its vp,
       etc. note that if you don   t have bar levels, there is no difference
       between a complement and a modifier.)
    5. if you   re in x    theory, another way of phrasing the previous two
       questions is: for every pp, is it a complement or a modifier? is it
       in the appropriate position for which one it is? (adjps are almost
       always modifiers, unless they   re after a verb:    the blue shirt    =
       modifier;    the shirt is blue    = complement. i can   t think of any
       examples where an advp would be a complement and not a modifier,
       but you may want to double check just in case. and an advp might
       modify several different things, so especially check that part.)
    6. what   s the subject (including modifiers & complements) of each
       verb? is it in the appropriate subject position that your course is
       using? (under s or sister to i    are the most likely.)
    7. what   s the object (including modifiers & complements) of each verb?
       is it sister to the verb?
    8. do you have any ambiguity? if so, have you represented it clearly?

   here   s a gif of drawing the tree, again assuming you   re using a strict
   x-bar theory with ips (note that the colours correspond to the colours
   of the brackets i used at the previous step     this is for your ease in
   following, it   s not a thing you need to do in drawing your own trees,
   as switching ink colours this often will probably make it harder).

   and here   s the final tree as a still image:
   image

   lastly, here are the brackets and the tree side-by-side, just for fun.
   image

   notice that subjects are in spec, ip (sister to i   ) of their respective
   ips, and objects are in complement position of their respective verbs
   (sister to v). these trees assume you   re doing a strict x    theory
   structure: if you   re using tps or dps, feel free to substitute them
   instead, and if you   re doing basic phrase structure rules, substitute s
   for ip and delete all the bar levels (just move everything up to attach
   directly to the phrase).

   this is part 8 of a series on [48]how to draw syntax trees. if you   re
   confused about why i keep referring to different course conventions
   rather than giving a specific answer, check out the remainder of the
   series below.
    1. [49]so, you asked the internet how to draw syntax trees. here   s why
       you   re confused.
    2. [50]what do we even mean by a syntax tree?
    3. [51]type 1: a sentence is an s
    4. [52]type 2: a sentence is an ip
    5. [53]type 3: a sentence is a tp
    6. [54]reconciling theories and final notes
    7. [55]other resources and topics
    8. a step-by-step guide to drawing trees, with gifs
