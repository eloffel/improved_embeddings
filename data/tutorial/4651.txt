ipa transcription practice

   here are some words and sentences to practise transcribing in ipa, with
   relatively broad transcriptions and commentary below the cut. for more
   teaching-yourself-ipa resources, try [30]here or [31]here.

   a. what do you want to do about it?

   b. inconceivable

   c. the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.

   d. id102 is a pleasure.

   e. every child should have a toy.

   note: there is no capitalization or punctuation in ipa! sometimes
   capitals and/or punctuation marks stand for specific sounds, but they
   never stand for the same things that capitals or punctuation stand for
   in regular orthography. if you want to represent the intonational
   information that punctuation sometimes indicates, you can use pitch
   markers, although i will not do so here. people also often transcribe
   stress, although i   m only doing so for    inconceivable    because the
   other words are very short so stress isn   t very meaningful for them. it
   also is technically correct to write ipa without spaces between words,
   since words are produced in an unbroken stream, but for ease of
   readability people normally do mark spaces (and sometimes even morpheme
   boundaries, with hyphens).

   a. w  t du ju w  n t   du   bawt   t

   a few options here. the most precise version would be something like
   /w  t du ju w  nt tu du   bawt   t/, but most people are unlikely to
   actually say it that way in natural-paced speech, so /w  t du ju w  n t  
   du   bawt   t/ is a reasonable compromise. even more rapidly, you might
   end up with /w  t dju w  n t   du   bawt   t/ or even /w       w  n   du   bawt
     t/.

   the first vowel in    about    is schwa, not /a/ or /  /, because it is
   unstressed. the second vowel (actually diphthong) is /  w/ if you have
   [32]canadian raising. some conventions also write these diphthongs as
   /a  / or /    /. a few people may devoice the /w/ in    what    to get /  / but
   this pronunciation is growing less common. note that /j/ in ipa stands
   for a palatal glide, which english speakers think of as a    y    sound,
   and that /y/ in ipa stands for a front high rounded vowel, which is not
   found in english but is the sound in french    tu    or german      ber   .

   b.       k  n  siv  bl

   the nasal is velar (i.e., /  / not /n/) before a velar stop /k/. /c/ in
   ipa is a palatal stop, which is not found in english, so all instances
   of    c    in english orthography can be written /k/, /s/, /  / etc. the
   schwa before /b/ could also be /  / although it is again probably not
   /a/ or /  / unless you   re hperarticulating. the /l/ at the end is
   syllabic, which could also be written with the syllabic diacritic as
   /l  / (a short line under the symbol). or, if you don   t consider it
   syllabic, you could write it as /  l/.

   there are several ways of determining stress. one way is to    call    a
   word like you would call a person   s or dog   s name: the syllable that
   gets a high pitch is the primary stressed one. another way is to
   pronounce the word several times, each time putting really heavy stress
   on a different syllable (inconceivable, inconcivable, inconceivable,
   inconceivable, inconceivable): the one that sounds the least weird is
   the one where you   ve emphasized the primary stressed syllable, and the
   one that sounds slightly weirder but still not as terrible as the
   others is the one where you   ve emphasized the secondary stressed
   syllable.

   c.      kw  k brawn f  ks     mps owv      lejzi d  g

   the    th    in    the    is voiced /  / not voiceless /  /. /q/ in ipa is a
   uvular stop, which is also not found in english, so all instances of
      q    in english orthography can be written with /k/ or possibly other
   symbols if they make a different sound. again, there is no /c/ in
   english. the symbol /x/ in ipa represents a velar fricative, so all
   instances of    x    in english orthography can be written /ks/, /gz/, /z/,
   etc. /  / is a rhotacized schwa and makes the    er    sound as in    singer   :
   you can also write this sound as a syllabic r (i.e. /r  / or /    /) or
   schwa r (/  r/ or /    /). which r-symbol you use depends on your
   priorities: /  / or /  / are more technically accurate, but /r/ is
   sometimes used for english-only transcription despite the fact that it
   really indicates a trill because it   s easier to type.

   the /ow/ and /ej/ could have been written /o  / and /e  / or even /o/ and
   /e/ if you   re not representing the more subtle english diphthongs. if
   you   re representing devoiced sonorants, the /w/ after the /k/ would be
   devoiced: /kw  /.

   d. f  n  t  ks   z    pl      

   orthographic    ph    here makes a /f/ sound, not a p+h sound as in    top
   hat   .  the sound /  / has notoriously inconsistent spellings in english
   so watch out for it. orthographic    cs    here makes a    ks    sound. see
   note above about /  /. if you   re representing flapping, the /t/ in
   /f  n  t  ks/ would be a tap/flap /f  n      ks/. if you   re representing
   devoiced sonorants, the /l/ in /pl      / would be devoiced /pl  /.

   e.   vri   ajld     d h  v    t  j

   you probably don   t say    every    with three syllables unless you   re
   hyperarticulating, which is a common mistake of beginning transcribers.
   the diphthong /aj/ could also be written /a  /: it cannot be subject to
   [33]canadian raising (which would produce /  j/ or /    /) because it is
   before a voiced segment. also watch out for /  /, which doesn   t have a
   very consistent spelling in english (generally    oo    or    ou    but these
   combinations can also stand for /u/ or /aw/). the diphthong /  j/ could
   also be written /    / or if you   re completely ignoring this vowel you
   might even see /oj/ or /o  /. if you   re representing aspiration, the /t/
   in /t  j/ would be aspirated: /t    j/.

   have i missed anything? please do let me know! precise transcription is
   notoriously prone to typos since you can   t exactly spellcheck it. there
   may be other phonetic processes (e.g. vowel nasalization or
   lengthening) that you might want to transcribe sometimes but i haven   t
   indicated here.

   update: check out the notes below for other people   s transcriptions,
   since everyone   s accent is going to be slightly different, there are
   more options than the ones i   ve mentioned, especially when it comes to
   rapid speech. one thing that i didn   t mention is the caught-cot merger:
   i pronounce these words the same, but if you don   t, americans will
   probably have /  / in    dog    and brits probably /  / in both    fox    and
      dog   , at least according to the dictionaries i checked. a few people
   have also mentioned various vowels in    want   , such as /  / and /  /: i
   definitely have /  / but i suppose there must be variation here too.
