machine learning basics: a guide for the perplexed

   artificial intelligence and machine learning play a bigger part in our
   lives today than most people can imagine. we use intelligent services
   and applications every day that rely heavily on machine learning
   advances. voice activation services like siri or alexa, image
   recognition services like snapchat or google image search, and even
   self driving cars all rely on the ability of machines to learn and
   adapt.

   if you   re new to machine learning, it can be very easy to get bogged
   down in buzzwords and complex concepts of this dark art. with this in
   mind, we thought we   d put together a quick introduction to the basics
   of machine learning and how it works.

   note: this post is aimed at newbies     if you know a bayesian model from
   a id98, head on over to the research section of [21]our blog, where
   you   ll find posts on more advanced subjects.

so what exactly is machine learning?

   machine learning refers to a process that is used to train machines to
   imitate human intuition     to make decisions without having been told
   what exactly to do.

   machine learning is a subfield of computer science, and you   ll find it
   defined in many ways, but the simplest is probably still arthur
   samuel   s [22]our definition from 1959:    machine learning gives
   computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed   .
   machine learning explores how programs, or more specifically
   algorithms, learn from data and make predictions based on it. these
   algorithms differ from traditional programs by not relying on strict
   coded instruction, but by making data-driven, informed predictions or
   decisions based on sample training inputs. its applications in the real
   world are highly varied but the one common element is that every
   machine learning program learns from past experience in order to make
   predictions in the future.

   machine learning can be used to process massive amounts of data
   efficiently, as part of a particular task or problem. it relies on
   specific representations of data, or    features    in order to recognise
   something, similar to how when a person sees a cat, they can recognize
   it from visual features like its shape, its tail length, and its
   markings, machine learning algorithms learn from from patterns and
   features in data previously analyzed.

different types of machine learning

   there are many types of machine learning programs or algorithms. the
   most common ones can be split into three categories or types:
   1. supervised machine learning
       2. unsupervised machine learning
       3. id23

1. supervised machine learning

   supervised learning refers to how a machine learning application has
   been trained to recognize patterns and features in data. it is
      supervised   , meaning it has been trained or taught using correctly
   labeled (usually by a human) training data.

   the way supervised learning works isn   t too different to how we learn
   as humans. think of how you teach a child: when a child sees a dog, you
   point at it and say    look! a dog!   . what you   re doing here essentially
   is labelling that animal as a    dog   . now, it might take a few hundred
   repetitions, but after a while the child will see another dog somewhere
   and say    dog,    of their own accord. they do this by recognising the
   features of a dog and the association of those features with the label
      dog    and a supervised machine learning model works in much the same
   way.

   it   s easily explained using an everyday example that you have certainly
   come across. let   s consider how your email provider catches spam.
   first, the algorithm used is trained on a dataset or list of thousands
   of examples of emails that are labelled as    spam    or    not spam   . this
   dataset can be referred to as    training data   . the    training data   
   allows the algorithm to build up a detailed picture of what a spam
   email looks like. after this training process, the algorithm should be
   able to decide what label (spam or not spam) should be assigned to
   future emails based on what it has learned from the training set. this
   is a common example of a classification algorithm     a supervised
   algorithm trained on pre-labeled data.

                               screenshot (58)

                         training a spam classifier

2. unsupervised machine learning

   unsupervised learning takes a different approach. as you can probably
   gather from the name, unsupervised learning algorithms don   t rely on
   pre-labeled training data to learn. alternatively, they attempt to
   recognize patterns and structure in data. these patterns recognized in
   the data can then be used to make decisions or predictions when new
   data is introduced to the problem.

   think back to how supervised learning teaches a child how to recognise
   a dog, by showing it what a dog looks like and assigning the label
      dog   . unsupervised learning is the equivalent to leaving the child to
   their own devices and not telling them the correct word or label to
   describe the animal. after a while, they would start to recognize that
   a lot of animals while similar to each other, have their own
   characteristics and features meaning they can be grouped together, cats
   with cats and dogs with dogs. the child has not been told what the
   correct label is for a cat or dog, but based on the features identified
   they can make a decision to group similar animals together. an
   unsupervised model will work in the same way by identifying features,
   structure and patterns in data which it uses to group or cluster
   similar data together.

   amazon   s    customers also bought    feature is a good example of
   unsupervised learning in action. millions of people buy different
   combinations of books on amazon every day, and these transactions
   provide a huge amount of data on people   s tastes. an unsupervised
   learning algorithm analyzes this data to find patterns in these
   transactions, and returns relevant books as suggestions. as trends
   change or new books are published, people will buy different
   combinations of books, and the algorithm will adjust its
   recommendations accordingly, all without needing help from a human.
   this is an example of a id91 algorithm     an unsupervised
   algorithm that learns by identifying common groupings of data.

                               screenshot (40)

                          id91 visualization

supervised versus unsupervised algorithms

   each of these two methods have their own strengths and weaknesses, and
   where one should be used over the other is dependent on a number of
   different factors:
   the availability of labelled data to use for training
   whether the desired outcome is already known
       whether we have a specific task in mind or we want to make a
       program for very general use
       whether the task at hand is resource or time sensitive

   put simply, supervised learning is excellent at tasks where there is a
   degree of certainty about the potential outcomes, whereas unsupervised
   learning thrives in situations where the context is more unknown.

   in the case of supervised learning algorithms, the range of problems
   they can solve can be constrained by their reliance on training data,
   which is often difficult or expensive to obtain. in addition, a
   supervised algorithm can usually only be used in the context you
   trained it for. imagine a food classifier that has only been trained on
   pictures of hot dogs     sure it might do an excellent job at recognising
   hotdogs in images, but when it   s shown an image of a pizza all it knows
   is that that image doesn   t contain a hotdog.

   unsupervised learning approaches also have many drawbacks: they are
   more complex, they need much more computational power, and
   theoretically they are nowhere near as understood yet as supervised
   learning. however, more recently they have been at the center of ml
   research and are often referred to as the [24]next frontier in ai.
   unsupervised learning gives machines the ability to learn by
   themselves, to extract information about the context you put them in,
   which essentially, is the core challenge of artificial intelligence.
   compared with supervised learning, unsupervised learning offers a way
   to teach machines something resembling common sense.

3. id23

   id23 is the third approach that you   ll most commonly
   come across. a id23 program tries to teach itself
   accuracy in a task by continually giving itself feedback based on its
   surroundings, and continually updating its behaviour based on this
   feedback. id23 allows machines to automatically
   decide how to behave in a particular environment in order to maximize
   performance based off    reward    feedback or a reinforcement signal. this
   approach can only be used in an environment where the program can take
   signals from its surroundings as positive or negative feedback.

              iframe: [25]https://giphy.com/embed/gexdemtwxdcd6

                      id23 in action

   imagine you   re programming a self-driving car to teach itself to become
   better at driving. you would program it to understand certain actions    
   like going off the road for example     is bad by providing negative
   feedback as a reinforcement signal. the car will then look at data
   where it went off the road before, and try to avoid similar outcomes.
   for instance, if the car sees a pattern like when it didn   t slow down
   at a corner it was more likely to end up driving off the road, but when
   it slowed down this outcome was less likely, it would slow down at
   corners more.

conclusion

   so this concludes our introduction to the basics of machine learning.
   we hope it provides you with some grounding as you try to get familiar
   with some of the more advanced concepts of machine learning. if you   re
   interested in natural language processing and how machine learning is
   used in nlp specifically, keep an eye on our blog as we   re going cover
   how machine learning has been applied to the field. if you want to read
