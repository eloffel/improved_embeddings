a new multi-turn, multi-domain, task-oriented dialogue dataset

   [9]mihail eric       07/03/2017
     __________________________________________________________________

   task-oriented dialogue focuses on conversational agents that
   participate in user-initiated dialogues on domain-specific topics.
   traditionally, the task-oriented dialogue community has often been
   hindered by a lack of sufficiently large and diverse datasets for
   training models across a variety of different domains. in an effort to
   help alleviate this problem, we release a corpus of 3,031 multi-turn
   dialogues in three distinct domains appropriate for an in-car
   assistant: calendar scheduling, weather information retrieval, and
   point-of-interest navigation. our dialogues are grounded through
   knowledge bases ensuring that they are versatile in their natural
   language without being completely free form. the dialogues include
   exchanges such as the following:
   driver i need to find the time and parties attending my optometrist
   appointment.
   car i have 3 appointments scheduled, with alex, your sister, and jeff.
   which are you referring to?
   driver i want to know about the one that alex is joining me at.
   car that optometrist appointment is at 4 pm.
   driver thanks.
   car no problem.

data collection

   our data was collected using a wizard-of-oz scheme inspired by that of
   [10]wen et. al. in our scheme, users had two potential modes they could
   play: driver and car assistant. in the driver mode, users were
   presented with a task that listed certain information they were trying
   to extract from the car assistant as well as the dialogue history
   exchanged between driver and car assistant up to that point. an example
   task is presented in the driver mode figure below. the driver was then
   only responsible for contributing a single line of dialogue that
   appropriately continued the discourse given the prior dialogue history
   and the task definition.

   driver mode

   tasks were randomly specified by selecting values (5pm, saturday, san
   francisco, etc.) for three to five slots (time, date, location, etc.)
   that depended on the domain type. values specified for the slots were
   chosen according to a uniform distribution from a per-domain candidate
   set.

   in the car assistant mode, users were presented with the dialogue
   history exchanged up to that point in the running dialogue and a
   private knowledge base known only to the car assistant with information
   that could be useful for satisfying the driver query. examples of
   knowledge bases could include a calendar of event information, a
   collection of weekly forecasts for nearby cities, or a collection of
   nearby points-of-interest with relevant information. the car assistant
   was then responsible for using this private information to provide a
   single utterance that progressed the user-directed dialogues. the car
   assistant was also asked to fill in dialogue state information for
   mentioned slots and values in the dialogue history up to that point. we
   provide a screenshot of car assistant mode below:

   car assistant mode

   each private knowledge base had six to seven distinct rows and five to
   seven attribute types. the private knowledge bases used were generated
   by uniformly selecting a value for a given attribute type, where each
   attribute type had a variable number of candidate values. some
   knowledge bases intentionally lacked certain attributes to encourage
   diversity in discourse.

   while specifying the attribute types and values in each task presented
   to the driver allowed us to ground the subject of each dialogue with
   our desired entities, it would occasionally result in more mechanical
   discourse exchanges. to encourage more naturalistic, unbiased
   utterances, we had users record themselves saying commands in response
   to underspecified visual depictions of an action a car assistant could
   perform. these commands were transcribed and then inserted as the first
   exchange in a given dialogue on behalf of the driver. roughly 1,500 of
   the dialogues employed this transcribed audio command first-utterance
   technique.

   241 unique workers from amazon mechanical turk were anonymously
   recruited to use the interface we built over a period of about six
   days.

data statistics

   below we include statistics for our dataset:
   training dialogues             2,425
   validation dialogues           302
   test dialogues                 304
   calendar scheduling dialogues  1034
   navigation dialogues           1000
   weather dialogues              997
   avg. # utterances per dialogue 5.25
   avg. # tokens per utterance    9
   vocabulary size                1,601
   # of distinct entities         284
   # of entity (or slot) types    15

   we also include some information regarding the type and number of slots
   per domain:
   calendar scheduling weather information retrieval poi navigation
   slot types event, time, date,
   party, room agenda location, weekly time,
   temperature, weather attribute poi name, traffic info,
   poi category, address, distance
   # distinct slot values 79 65 140

   our dataset was designed so that each dialogue had the grounded world
   information that is often crucial for training task-oriented dialogue
   systems, while at the same time being sufficiently lexically and
   semantically versatile. we hope that this dataset will be useful in
   building diverse and robust task-oriented dialogue systems!
