challenges of data-to-document generation

   [1]sam wiseman [2]stuart m. shieber [3]alexander m. rush

   recent neural models have shown significant progress on the problem of
   generating short descriptive texts conditioned on a small number of
   database records. in this work, we suggest a slightly more difficult
   data-to-text generation task, and investigate how effective current
   approaches are on this task. in particular, we introduce a new,
   large-scale corpus of data records paired with descriptive documents,
   propose a series of extractive evaluation methods for analyzing
   performance, and obtain baseline results using current neural
   generation methods. experiments show that these models produce fluent
   text, but fail to convincingly approximate human-generated documents.
   moreover, even templated baselines exceed the performance of these
   neural models on some metrics, though copy- and reconstruction-based
   extensions lead to noticeable improvements.
