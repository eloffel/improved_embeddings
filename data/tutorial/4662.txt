readme.md

   data used in [73]challenges in data-to-document generation (wiseman,
   shieber, rush; emnlp 2017). if you use this data, please cite the above
   paper.

   update (1/22/18): thanks to @janenie for pointing out that some of the
   line-scores in the data (which report team-level stats) had the team
   names flipped. player-level information was not affected. these
   examples have now been unflipped.

data

   this dataset consists of (human-written) nba basketball game summaries
   aligned with their corresponding box- and line-scores. summaries taken
   from rotowire.com are referred to as the "rotowire" data, and summaries
   taken from sbnation.com (and associated team-specific sites) are
   referred to as the "sbnation" data; we treat these sub-datasets
   separately, since they are quite different.

   to extract the data, run tar -jxvf rotowire.tar.bz2 to form a rotowire/
   directory (and similarly for sbnation.tar.bz2).

rotowire data

   the rotowire data can be found in rotowire/[train|valid|test].json.
   there are 4853 distinct rotowire summaries, covering nba games played
   between 1/1/2014 and 3/29/2017; some games have multiple summaries. the
   summaries have been randomly split into training, validation, and test
   sets consisting of 3398, 727, and 728 summaries, respectively.

sbnation data

   the sbnation data can be found in sbnation/[train|valid|test].json.
   there are 10903 distinct rotowire summaries, covering nba games played
   between 11/3/2006 and 3/26/2017; some games have multiple summaries.
   the summaries have been randomly split into training, validation, and
   test sets consisting of 7633, 1635, and 1635 summaries, respectively.

data format

   each file is utf-8 encoded json, and contains a list of json objects
   corresponding to each aligned summary/data pair. these json objects
   have the following fields:
     * home_name - name of home team (unicode)
     * home_city - city of home team (unicode)
     * vis_name - name of visiting team (unicode)
     * vis_city - city of visiting team (unicode)
     * day - date of game in %mm_%dd_%yy format (unicode)
     * summary - tokenized summary of game
     * home_line - home team line-score object; see below
     * vis_line - visiting team line-score object; see below
     * box_score - box-score object; see below

line-score objects

   line-score objects have the following fields:
     * team-name - team name (unicode)
     * team-city - team city (unicode)
     * team-ast - number of team assists (integer as unicode)
     * team-fg3_pct - percentage of 3 pointers made by team (integer as
       unicode)
     * team-fg_pct - percentage of field goals made by team (integer as
       unicode)
     * team-ft_pct - percentage of free throws made by team (integer as
       unicode)
     * team_losses - team losses (integer as unicode)
     * team-pts - total team points (integer as unicode)
     * team-pts_qtr1 - team points in first quarter (integer as unicode)
     * team-pts_qtr2 - team points in second quarter (integer as unicode)
     * team-pts_qtr3 - team points in third quarter (integer as unicode)
     * team-pts_qtr4 - team points in fourth quarter (integer as unicode)
     * team-reb - total team rebounds (integer as unicode)
     * team-tov - total team turnovers (integer as unicode)
     * team-wins - team wins (integer as unicode)

box-score objects

   box-score objects contain (column) objects mapping row numbers to
   values. rows are numbered from 0 to at most 25, and each row
   corresponds to a player in the game. in particular, a box-score object
   contains the following column objects:
     * ast - player assists (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * blk - player blocks (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * dreb - player defensive rebounds (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * fg3a - player 3-pointers attempted (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * fg3m - player 3-pointers made (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * fg3_pct - player 3-pointer percentage (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * fga - player field goals attempted (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * fgm - player field goals made (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * fg_pct - player field goal percentage (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * first_name - player first name (row_number -> unicode)
     * fta - player free throws attempted (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * ftm - player free throws made (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * ft_pct - player free throw percentage (row_number -> integer as
       unicode)
     * min - player minutes played (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * oreb - player offensive rebounds (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * pf - player personal fouls (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * player_name - player full name (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * pts - player points (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * reb - player total rebounds (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * second_name - player second name (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * start_position - player position (row_number -> unicode)
     * stl - player steals (row_number -> integer as unicode)
     * team_city - player team city (row_number -> unicode)
     * to - player turnovers (row_number -> integer as unicode)

preprocessing details

box- and line-scores

   all number values in the box- and line-scores have been converted to
   integers by rounding if necessary. (so, percents are given as integers
   between 0 and 100).

summaries

   summaries are tokenized using nltk, and hyphenated phrases are
   separated. tweets and photos were removed from the sbnation summaries,
   as were any paragraphs that did not contain at least 2 numbers (in
   either numeric or verbal form).
