cifar-10 image classification with keras convnet

   [25]08/06/201609/30/2017[26]convnet, [27]deep learning, [28]keras,

   (updated on july, 24th, 2017 with some improvements and keras 2 style,
   but still a work in progress)

   [32]cifar-10 is a small image (32 x 32) dataset made up of 60000 images
   subdivided into 10 main categories. check the web page in the reference
   list in order to have further information about it and download the
   whole set. considering our current screen resolutions, it   s not
   difficult saying that those images are no more than icons and indeed
   some of them are very hard to be classified even by human beings.

   using keras, i   ve modeled a deep convolutional network (vggnet-like) in
   order to try a classification. i   m still investigating the best
   architecture (in cifar home page, there are very interesting references
   to papers and other results), however, i think it can be a good
   starting point. as the output is a softmax layer, it can also be
   interesting to evaluate mixed results, for example, an image with
   features belonging both to a dog and a plane and so forth.

   convnet

   the full script, without any particular image preprocessing step (data
   augmentation) except for the id172 between 0 and 1, is the
   following one (you can easily try to change layer features and
   dimensions):
   view the code on [33]gist.

   the validation accuracy reaches 0.79 after 66 epochs when the early
   stopping terminates the process because the validation loss has stopped
   decreasing (the final value is about 0.6).

   in my experiments, the majority of errors are related to cat-dog or
   dog-cat distinctions (something absolutely not surprising, considering
   that most of main features are common to both categories).

   the code is always available in
   gist: [34]https://gist.github.com/giuseppebonaccorso/e77e505fc7b61983f7

     fork autoencoders are a very interesting deep learning application
     because they allow a consistent id84 of an
     entire dataset with a controllable loss level. the jupyter notebook
     for this small project is available on the github repository:

       excelente blog but there is a curiosity in your articles, they are
       repeated.

            where do you see them repeated?

       dear giuseppe bonaccorso,
       i have a question : why you did not try to plot the acc vs val_acc
       because it seems that there is a sort of overfitting !! also 15
       epochs are very few     
       best regards

            dear noura,
            thank you for your comment! you are probably right because the
            model is quite small. normally i prefer considering the
            validation accuracy as a benchmark and, in this case, it
            doesn   t show an exceptional result (even if the convnet is not
            very complex). i think it would be a good idea to increase the
            dropout or adding another dropout layer in between the
            convolutional blocks. for the epochs, of course, it   s possible
            to increase them, but i think (probably i   m wrong :)) that the
            risk of overfitting increases.
            i   m going to test these options.
            g.

       yes, usually the risk of the overfitting increases but also
       increasing epochs will let you to know when your accuracy becomes
       asymptotically stable     
       did you change anything later in convnet inorder to get a higher
       accuracy ?
       best regards,
       noura
