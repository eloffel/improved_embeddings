   in my [18]previous article, i have introduced the basics of dna,
   nucleotides and their arrangement. you might be wondering how we can
   identify the precise order of nucleotides of a dna molecule. this is
   where dna sequencing comes into action.

what is dna sequencing?

   sequencing is the operation of determining the precise order of
   nucleotides of a given dna molecule. it is used to determine the order
   of the four bases adenine (a), guanine (g), cytosine (c) and thymine
   (t), in a strand of dna.

   dna sequencing is used to determine the sequence of individual genes,
   full chromosomes or entire genomes of an organism. dna sequencing has
   also become the most efficient way to sequence rna or proteins.

history of sequencing

   the work carried out by a british biochemist named frederick sanger,
   laid the foundation for sequencing proteins. in 1955, sanger had
   completed the sequence of all the amino acids in insulin. his work
   provided evidence that proteins consisted of chemical entities with a
   specific pattern, rather than a mixture of substances.

   later, a method named as sanger sequencing was developed by frederick
   sanger and his colleagues in 1977, where dna could be sequenced by
   generating fragments. it was the most widely used sequencing method for
   approximately 40 years.

whole genome sequencing and sequence assembly

   a dna sequencing reaction produces a sequence that is several hundred
   bases long. gene sequences are typically thousands of bases long. the
   largest known gene is the one associated with [21]duchenne muscular
   dystrophy. it is approximately 2.4 million bases in length. in order to
   study one whole gene, scientists use a simple strategy known as shotgun
   sequencing. the long dna sequence is assembled from a series of shorter
   overlapping sequences. let   s see what happens in the shotgun sequencing
   approach.

   shotgun sequencing

   special machines, known as sequencing machines are used to extract
   short random dna sequences from a particular genome we wish to
   determine (target genome). current dna sequencing technologies cannot
   read one whole genome at once. it reads small pieces of between 20 and
   30000 bases, depending on the technology used. these short pieces are
   called reads. special software are used to assemble these reads
   according to how they overlap, in order to generate continuous strings
   called contigs. these contigs can be the whole target genome itself, or
   parts of the genome (as shown in the above figure).

   the process of aligning and merging fragments from a longer dna
   sequence, in order to reconstruct the original sequence is known as
   sequence assembly.

   in order to obtain the whole genome sequence, we may need to generate
   more and more random reads, until the contigs match to the target
   genome.

sequence assembly problem

   the sequence assembly problem can be described as follows.

     given a set of sequences, find the minimal length string containing
     all members of the set as substrings.

   this problem is further complicated due to the existence of repetitive
   sequences in the genome as well as substitutions or mutations withing
   them.

   the sequence assembly problem can be compared to a real life scenario
   as follows.

     assume that you take many copies of a book, pass each of them
     through a shredder with a different cutter, and then you try to make
     the text of the book back together just by gluing together the
     shredded pieces. it is obvious that this task is pretty difficult.
     furthermore, there are some extra practical issues as well. the
     original copy may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may
     be modified during shredding to have typos. parts from another book
     may have also been added in, and some shreds may be completely
     unrecognizable.

   it sounds very confusing and quite impossible to be carried out. this
   problem is known to be np complete. np complete problems are problems
   whose status is unknown. no polynomial time algorithm has yet been
   discovered for any np complete problem, nor has anybody yet been able
   to prove that no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any of them.
   however, there are id192 to solve the sequence assembly
   problem, where experiments have proven to perform fairly well in
   practice.

   a common method used to solve the sequence assembly problem and perform
   sequence data analysis is sequence alignment.

sequence alignment

   sequence alignment is a method of arranging sequences of dna, rna, or
   protein to identify regions of similarity. the similarity being
   identified, may be a result of functional, structural, or evolutionary
   relationships between the sequences.

   if we compare two sequences, it is known as pairwise sequence
   alignment. if we compare more than two sequences, it is known as
   multiple sequence alignment.

next-generation sequencing

   next-generation sequencing (ngs), also known as high-throughput
   sequencing, is the collective term used to describe many different
   modern sequencing technologies such as,
     * [23]illumina (solexa) sequencing
     * [24]roche 454 sequencing
     * [25]ion torrent proton / pgm sequencing
     * [26]solid sequencing

   these recent technologies allow us to sequence dna and rna much more
   quickly and cheaply than the previously used sanger sequencing, and
   have revolutionized the study of genomics.

final thoughts

   sequence data analysis has become a very important aspect in the field
   of genomics. bioinformatics has made the task of analysis much easier
   for biologists, by providing different software solutions and saving
   all the tedious manual work.

   you can find a list of software tools used for dna sequencing from
   [27]here. furthermore, you can find a list of sequence alignment
   software from [28]here.

   hope you got a basic idea about sequence data analysis.

   in my next article, i will walk you through the details of pairwise
   sequence alignment and a few common algorithms that are being used in
   the field.

   since i   m still very new to this field, i would like to hear your
   advice.     

   thanks for reading
