about

   tel-aviv deep learning bootcamp is an intensive (and free!) 5-day
   program intended to teach you all about deep learning. it is nonprofit
   focused on advancing data science education and fostering
   entrepreneurship. the bootcamp is a prominent venue for graduate
   students, researchers, and data science professionals. it offers a
   chance to study the essential and innovative aspects of deep learning.

   participation is via a donation to the a.l.s association for promoting
   research of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) disease.

curriculum

   the bootcamp amalgamates    theory    and    practice        identifying that a
   deep learning scientist desires a survey of concepts combined with a
   strong application of practical techniques through labs. primarily, the
   foundational material and tools of the data science practitioner are
   presented via sk-learn. topics continue rapidly into exploratory data
   analysis and classical machine learning, where the data is organized,
   characterized, and manipulated. from day two, the students move from
   engineered models into 4 days of deep learning.

bootcamp 5 day structure

   the bootcamp consists of the following folders and files:
     * [114]day 01: practical machine learning with python and sk-learn
       pipelines
     * [115]day 02 pytorch and pycuda: neural networks using the gpu,
       pycuda, pytorch and matlab
     * [116]day 03: applied deep learning in python
     * [117]day 04: convolutional neural networks using keras
     * [118]day 05: applied deep id23 in python
     * [119]docker: a gpu based docker system for the bootcamp

requirements

   for a docker based system see
   [124]https://github.com/quantscientist/data-science-arrayfire-gpu/tree/
   master/docker
     * ubuntu linux 16.04
     * python 2.7
     * cuda drivers.running a cuda container requires a machine with at
       least one cuda-capable gpu and a driver compatible with the cuda
       toolkit version you are using.

the html slides were created using (you can run this directly from jupyter):

   %%bash jupyter nbconvert \ --to=slides \
   --reveal-prefix=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reveal.js/3.2.0/
   \ --output=py05.html \ './05 pytorch automatic differentiation.ipynb'
