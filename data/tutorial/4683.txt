id23 and ai

     * posted by [34]william vorhies on september 13, 2016 at 9:00am

   summary:  at the core of modern ai, particularly robotics, and
   sequential tasks is id23.  although rl has been
   around for many years it has become the third leg of the machine
   learning stool and increasingly important for data scientist to know
   when and how to implement.


   if you poled a group of data scientist just a few years back about how
   many machine learning problem types there are you would almost
   certainly have gotten a binary response:  problem types were clearly
   divided into supervised and unsupervised.
     * supervised: you   ve got labeled data (clearly defined examples).
     * unsupervised: you   ve got data but it   s not labeled.  see if there   s
       a structure in there.

   today if you asked that same question you are very likely to find that
   machine learning problem types are divided into three categories:

    [36] [reinforcementstructure.jpg?width=600]

   while id23 (rl) has been around since at least the
   80   s and before that in the behavioral sciences, its introduction as a
   major player in machine learning reflects it rising importance in ai.


   the key to understanding when to use id23 is this:
     * data for learning currently does not exist
     * or you don   t want to wait to accumulate it (because delay might be
       costly)
     * or the data may change rapidly causing the outcome to change more
       rapidly than a typical model refresh cycle can accommodate.

   what problems fit this description?  well robotic control for one and
   game play for another, both a central focus of ai over the last few
   years.

   to drastically simplify, rl methods are deployed to address two problem
   types:
    1. prediction:  how much reward can be expected for every combination
       of possible future states. (e.g. how much can we hope to collect
       from delinquent accounts based on the following set of steps?)
    2. control: by moving through all possible combinations of the
       environment (interacting with the environment or state space) find
       a combination of actions (a    policy    in rl-speak) that maximizes
       reward and allows for action planning and optimal control.  (e.g.
       how to steer an autonomous vehicle, or how to win a game of chess.)

   we   ll offer some additional examples to clarify this, but you should
   immediately perceive the confusion created by introducing this third ml
   type.  the distinction between supervised and unsupervised problem
   types was immediately clear by both the problem definition and the data
   that is available.

   rl on the other hand is defined by the absence of pre-existing data,
   but has goals that could also be addressed by supervised or
   unsupervised techniques as well if you first gathered training data.
   for example, value prediction is clearly also in the realm of
   supervised problems, and some control problems that focus on optimized
   outcomes can also be answered with supervised or even unsupervised
   techniques.


   [37][newbornspringboktryingtostand.jpg?width=200] origins of
   id23

   the concepts underlying rl come from animal behavior studies.  one of
   the most commonly used examples is that of the new-born baby gazelle.
   although it is born without any understanding or model of how to use
   its legs, within minutes it is standing and within 20 minutes it is
   running.  this learning has come from rapidly interacting with its
   environment, learning which muscle responses are successful, and being
   rewarded by survival.


   rl basic concepts

   rl is exactly that: a system in which success is learned by interacting
   with its environment through trial and error.  contrasted to supervised
   and unsupervised learning which both have data on which to learn, rl is
   making its own data through experience and determining the    champion
   model    through trial and error, and pure reinforcement.  rl agents
   learn from their own experience, contrasted to supervised learners
   which have examples from which to learn

   the basic idea behind rl is simplicity itself.

                        [38][rldiagram.jpg?width=400]
     *  the    environment    is understood to be the matrix of all possible
       alternative values or steps that can be taken.  (think possible
       moves of all pieces in a game of checkers or all the possible
       steering corrections an autonomous steering mechanism could take in
       response to visual sensor input of the road ahead).
     * the    agent    is the rl algorithm.  there   s not just one, there are
       many types.
     * the agent begins to randomly explore alternative actions in the
       environment and reinforces the agent when the moves are successful.
     * the    state    is the current set of moves or values which is modified
       after each try and seeks to optimize the reward via the feedback
       loop.
     * the agent must learn from its experiences of the environment as it
       explores the full range of possible states.
     * the resulting solution or algorithm is called a    policy   .  the
       policy is intended to be the set of steps or procedures that result
       in optimizing the reward.


   example problems

   some additional examples of problems where rl is a good choice.

                       [39][rlexamples.png?width=500]


   overlap with supervised learning and some rl strategies

   in the table above look specifically at the    marketing team    and
      website designer    examples and you should recognize problems where
   classical a/b testing or a supervised classification problem to detect
   best prospects have been the historical go-to solutions.  both these
   would require running tests to gather training data, then modeling and
   applying results.  similarly, many of the other problems would yield to
   supervised or unsupervised modeling if training data were available.

   consider the a/b test for example.  the rl practitioner would say    why
   wait for training data?  let   s just start showing options (probably
   more than just a and b) to customers and continue to show the ones that
   get the best results.   

   this in fact is the core of the rl strategy with this exception.  if we
   allow the agent to settle in too quickly on what appears to be the
   winning solution it may never explore all the other options (the full
   extent of the state space).  this may result in overfitting or an early
   hang up on a local optima.

   to minimize this likelihood, in designing the rl agent we should use    a
   greedy theta (     ).  this factor tells the agent at what rate to
   continue to look randomly in the state space for a better solution.
   set it too high and the system may take too long to optimize.  set it
   too low, the system may never examine some of the state space.  (for
   more on this see multi-armed bandits and markov decision process).


   four problems that rl must deal with

   in the design of your rl project there are four problems you must deal
   with (kevin murphy, 1998, florentin woergoetter and bernd porr, 2008).
    1. the exploration-exploitation tradeoff:  should we continue to
       explore the state space or stick with what we see is working.  this
       issue is explored above in the a/b tradeoff example.
    2. the problem of delayed reward:  when playing a board game the value
       of each move cannot be taken in a vacuum but can only be considered
       strong or weak in the context of whether the game was won or lost
       after many moves.  which move in that long sequence was actually
       responsible for the win or loss?  solutions to this question are in
       the realm of temporal difference learning.
    3. non-stationary environments:  we want the agent to interact with
       and learn from the environment.  but what happens if the
       environment changes too fast?  how much weight do we give to the
       distant past versus the recent past?  does the change represent a
       discontinuity with the past?  if the dynamics of the environment
       change slowly and continuously we   re probably ok but rl algorithms
       do not converge very fast.  this could result in a failure even in
       a slowly changing environment.
    4. generalization:  in a large multi-dimensional state space
       combinatorial explosion and compute speed means that it is unlikely
       that we can afford to visit all of the possible options in the
       state space and must therefore settle for a subset.  this leads to
       the obvious question of whether the subset is representative and
       whether the solution will generalize.  feature extraction and
       id84 become particularly important strategies.
       the fact is that this curse of dimensionality is difficult to
       overcome in rl and makes it best suited for low dimensionality
       states.

   all of these are areas of active research and exploration.  as compute
   speeds grow higher and costs lower we can visit increasingly larger
   subsets of the state space and examine more time delay options.  many
   of these solutions apply principles from neural nets, back propagation,
   evolutionary or annealing-like procedures, and factored structures all
   of which reside primarily in the realms of supervised and unsupervised
   learning.  this cross over of domains can be confusing but where and
   how to apply rl is an increasingly important body of knowledge for data
   scientists.
