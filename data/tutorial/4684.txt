using algorithms to detect fake news     the state of the art

     * posted by [34]william vorhies on may 1, 2017 at 3:30pm

   summary:  just how accurate are algorithms at spotting fake news and
   are we ready to turn them loose to suppress material they don   t find
   credible.  here are some considerations and stories about some of the
   companies trying to build these fact-checkers.

    [36] [161031090422fakenews1024x576.jpg?width=500]


   which of the following headlines is fake?

   a)     police investigating clinton-backed pizza shop pedophilia ring

   b)     the pope endorses donald trump for president

   c)      eastern european fake news sites impact pro-trump anti-clinton
   voter sentiment


   the first two are in fact fake.  you may actually have seen them during
   last fall   s election coverage.  the third headline however is true, but
   not with the implications you may think.

   depending on which conspiracy theory you subscribe to, either the
   russian government or someone else produced huge volumes of pro-trump
   fake news with the intent of influencing the election.  what
   [37]buzzfeed discovered last november is that at least 140 pro-trump
   web sites were being run out of one small macedonian town of veles
   (population 45,000 and no not part of russia) by a relatively small
   group of teens and young adults cashing in on the google adsense pay
   per click revenue stream.

   their motive - strictly the cash.  apparently you can have a pretty
   good life style in veles from just this source.  their political
   knowledge     none beyond the fact that these extremist web sites once on
   facebook drew tons of cash generating clicks.

   so what   s driving fake news is the change in the fundamental business
   model of news reporting, from a few well fact-checked news agencies to
   the new internet enabled anyone-can-write-a-headline-and-get-paid free
   for all.  essentially version 2.0 of the nigerian prince email racket.

   there are lots of us who understand the inherent danger in this
   proliferation of fake news.  what we want to look at here is how much
   progress we   ve made toward using data science to be able to detect fake
   news and do something about it.


   not everyone has the same motives for finding fake news

   you might think that it   s individual discriminating readers who most
   want to be protected from fake news.  there may be a few but the
   reality is that pretty much everyone mistakenly believes they can tell
   true from false, and fewer of us are willing to take several extra
   clicks to run an app that might flag content as true or false.  the
   real stakeholders in this battle are all motivated by money.
     * aggregators like facebook and google are already suffering from
       advertisers pulling their ads that were programmatically placed on
       sites that proved to provide fake news or other offensive content.
       beyond that they have general reputational risk with their users
       who may visit less often if they are exposed to blatantly false or
       offensive material.
     * legitimate news agencies like thomson reuters or any of the major
       news broadcast or print organizations who take raw information
       feeds and convert it to news stories.  they would suffer greatly if
       their material started to be compromised by falsehoods.


   what does fake news look like

   [38][fakenews.jpg?width=300] a further problem is that fake news
   doesn   t all look alike.  in fact you may need separate models to
   identify targets in different categories.  [39]brennan borlaug, one
   member of small team of grad students at uc berkeley who have tackled
   this problem classifies them this way:
    1. clickbait         shocking headlines meant to generate clicks to increase
       ad revenue. oftentimes these stories are highly exaggerated or
       totally false.
    2. propaganda         intentionally misleading or deceptive articles meant
       to promote the author   s agenda. oftentimes the rhetoric is hateful
       and incendiary.
    3. commentary/opinion         biased reactions to current events. these
       articles oftentimes tell the reader how to perceive recent events.
    4. humor/satire         articles written for entertainment. these stories
       are not meant to be taken seriously.


   can data science spot fake news

   this has become a hot and potentially profitable area and many
   companies are working on this.  we   re going to highlight a few that
   have particularly interesting stories.


   full fact

   full fact is a uk based fact-checking outfit recently granted $50,000
   by google to immediately start developing an automated fact-checking
   helper.  will moy, the director of full fact says computers can start
   helping human fact-checkers soon, but that a perfect system is still
   far off.

   perhaps the most interesting thing about full fact is that its plan is
   based on their belief that there are fundamentally two distinct data
   science architectures that can be applied.  the one they did not choose
   is the more traditional path of nlp similar to spam detection.

   the path adopted by moy is to build a watson-like platform that can
   parse facts floating around the world as unstructured social media data
   and determine if they are true or false.  this would mean loading the
   system with a huge volume of curated known-true facts then comparing
   new material using the logic of id53 machines (qams) like
   watson.


   watson

   [40]well what about watson?  this seems like a problem made to order
   for ibm   s qam.  ibm has in fact spent several years working on ways
   that watson could help users distinguish fact from fiction. in the
   spring of 2016 ibm released the beta of watson angles complete with a
   corpus of 55 million previously published news articles.

   by late 2016 however ibm had pulled back its prototype.  according to
   ben fletcher, senior software engineer at ibm watson research who built
   the system, it was unsuccessful in tests - but not because it couldn   t
   spot a lie.

      we got a lot of feedback that people did not want to be told what was
   true or not,    he says.    at the heart of what they want, was actually
   the ability to see all sides and make the decision for themselves.   

   remember, that aside from the ux implications of fletcher   s comment, a
   successful watson implementation requires constantly adding to and
   deleting from the corpus of knowledge.  this would be a huge human
   undertaking to attempt to catalogue all of what is    true    in the news.
   in other more successful watson implementations the knowledge base like
   tax law or sample images of cancerous tumors simply doesn   t change as
   fast as the news.


   thomson reuters

   thomson reuter   s 2,500 journalists in 200 countries take in unfiltered
   news articles from the web along with the full social media feeds of
   twitter and other major channels, and craft valid and fact-checked news
   articles.  as a trusted source, a failure to spot a fake source would
   be a major failure.  but being slow to report a breaking newsworthy
   event would also be a fail.

   at the strata+hadoop conference in san jose in march, khalid al-kohani,
   head of r&d demonstrated tracer news, the most complete and sensitive
   system i have yet seen.  gone are the days when newspaper men hung out
   at the police station or the court house hoping for a scoop.  now they
   sit at large displays with constantly updated summaries of themes
   consolidated via nlp and some very sophisticated logic.

    [41] [thomsonreuters.png?width=600]

   in the screen shot above, the journalist defines several    channels    or
   themes he is interested in, for examples    crises   , or    trending   , or
      trump taxes   .  as al-kohani explained, within 40 ms the
   algorithmically driven platform performs these steps:
     * first filters for noise, selecting only those feeds that look like
       events.
     * adds metadata such as topics, entities, relationships, and
       locations allowing the input to be clustered into the basic who,
       why and where of events.
     * determines if the event is newsworthy or merely subjective
       reporting.
     * is it an assertion or statement of fact or is it an opinion.
     * assigns a veracity score by looking at characteristics of the
       source and author such as    
          + are there multiple sources
          + are the sources known to be good
          + what is the history of these sources, for example do they
            participate in rumors or conspiracy theories, and what is the
            civility of their discourse.

   a variety of sensitivity filters are provided for the user along with a
   visual flag indicating both newsworthy and true.

   al-kohani says their analysis of news stories has proven 84% accurate.
    and with a sample of only 5 tweets they can differentiate between
   rumor and fact with 78% accuracy.

   tracer news has been two years in development and is used internally as
   well as by reuter   s financial customers.


   classify news     making news credible again

   our final entrant is focused on the individual reader providing a tool
   that you can use to score the veracity of an article by entering its
   url.  these four grad students, brennan borlaug, sashi gandavarapu,
   talieh hajzargarbashi, and umber singh built this classifier as the
   capstone project for their uc berkeley   s master of information and data
   science program.  you can access the classifier and test for yourself
   here ([42]www.classify.news).

   their approach highlights one of the other complexities of fake news
   identification, the need to consider both content and context.  context
   is frequently the element most difficult to model.

   this team ultimately produced an ensemble classifier using na  ve bayes
   for content and adaptive boosting for context.  their training set of
   about 5,000 articles is on the small side but their site claims 84%
   accuracy based on voluntary user provided feedback.

   the two fake news samples i tested scored 60% and 67% likely to be
   non-credible respectively.  right answer though the score does not give
   me a huge confidence margin.


   human fact-checkers are still the gold standard     most of the time

   human fact-checkers, either in house at major new organizations or at
   outfits like snopes and politifact are still way ahead of purely
   machine learning solutions using a logical approach modeled by trace
   news described above.  but humans are expensive.

   snopes reports that a seemingly simple claim can take hours while a
   seemingly complex one might take just 15 minutes.  currently there   s no
   way to predict required manpower.  like id103 and image
   processing before it, the gap is likely to narrow as we press toward
   automating as much of this process as possible.

   perhaps the most important question is whether we will ever reach a
   point where it is acceptable for an algorithm to automatically suppress
   a news story.  there will always be false positives and false
   negatives.  is 5% too great?  is 1% too great?  it   s one thing to
   misclassify a photo or misinterpret speech, but errors or unintentional
   bias here has freedom of speech implications that will not remain
   hidden very long once they arise.

   [43][fakebook.png?width=300] here   s a final story about why we   re not
   ready for this yet.  in mid-2016 facebook was using a team of human
   editors to curate its trending news section.  in addition to deciding
   what was    trending    they were also charged with fact-checking and
   linking them to a news story from a credible source.

   by the time the presidential election got underway however [44]gizmodo
   broke the story that these editors were instructed to suppress news
   about conservative topics.  although initially denying the practice,
   within months the editors had all been fired and replaced by
   algorithms.

   all did not go well.  within days the trending news featured a fake
   news story that megyn kelly had been fired from her job as a fox news
   host for being a    traitor    and supporting hillary clinton for
   president. quickly it was taken down but not before being seen by
   millions.  since stories posted there come with the implied approval of
   facebook, the reputational damage was done.

      well managed    humans versus algorithms.  we   ll have to watch a little
   longer to see how this develops before we give up evaluating stories
   for ourselves.

          so [55]www.classify.news is classified as non-credible with
          59.62% certainty.

   comment by [56]imrul kayes on may 3, 2017 at 10:05am
          thanks @william vorhies for posting the update. their
          explanation makes sense.

          after being classified as non-credible on the
          [58]www.classify.news site we reviewed above, i got the
          following email from their team explaining why this might have
          occurred.  here's their email response:

          bill - thanks for featuring our work in this post!

           currently i would only recommend classifying articles that
          deliver news. we've found our accuracies tend to plummet when
          testing on a more casual (or conversational) writing style. we
          even tried classifying our own blog and received a non-credible
          rating! our solution is by no means a silver bullet solution.
          there's still tons of work to do! of the four types of "fake
          news" defined on our blog, performance is by far best on 1)
          clickbait and 2) propaganda since this describes the majority of
          the "fake" articles in our training corpus. we love discussing
          potential improvements and new approaches with as many people as
          possible!

           thanks

          sashi

          too funny.  i repeated this and you're right.  all right grad
          students.  back to the drawing boards.

   comment by [60]imrul kayes on may 2, 2017 at 8:58am
          funny or irony whatever you may name it, i was running this blog
          on the classifier ([61]www.classify.news) you mentioned in this
          article. it was showing that this article is "our model has
          classified this article as non-credible with 67.98% certainty."
