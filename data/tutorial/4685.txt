common id203 distributions: the data scientist   s crib sheet

   [57]december 3, 2015

   data scientists have hundreds of id203 distributions from which
   to choose. where to start?

   data science, whatever it may be, remains a big deal.     a data
   scientist is better at statistics than any software engineer,    you may
   overhear a [62]pundit say, at your local tech get-togethers and
   hackathons. the applied mathematicians have their revenge, because
   statistics hasn   t been this [63]talked-about since the roaring 20s.
   they have their own [64]legitimizing venn diagram of which people don   t
   [65]make fun. suddenly it   s you, the engineer, left out of the chat
   about [66]confidence intervals instead of tutting at the analysts who
   have never heard of the apache bikeshed project for distributed comment
   formatting. to fit in, to be the life and soul of that party again, you
   need a crash course in stats. not enough to get it right, but enough to
   sound like you could, by making basic observations.

   id203 distributions are fundamental to statistics, just like data
   structures are to computer science. they   re the place to start studying
   if you mean to talk like a data scientist. you can sometimes get away
   with simple analysis using [67]r or [68]scikit-learn without quite
   understanding distributions, just like you can manage a java program
   without understanding hash functions. but it would soon end in tears,
   bugs, bogus results, or worse: sighs and eye-rolling from stats majors.

   there are hundreds of id203 distributions, some sounding like
   monsters from medieval legend like the [69]muth or [70]lomax. only
   about 15 distributions turn up consistently in practice though. what
   are they, and what clever insights about each of them should you
   memorize?

now, what   s a id203 distribution?

   things happen all the time: dice are rolled, it rains, buses arrive.
   after the fact, the specific outcomes are certain: the dice came up 3
   and 4, there was half an inch of rain today, the bus took 3 minutes to
   arrive. before, we can only talk about how likely the outcomes are.
   id203 distributions describe what we think the id203 of
   each outcome is, which is sometimes more interesting to know than
   simply which single outcome is most likely. they come in many shapes,
   but in only one size: probabilities in a distribution always add up to
   1.

   for example, flipping a fair coin has two outcomes: it lands heads or
   tails. (assume it can   t land on edge or be stolen by a seagull in
   mid-air.) before the flip, we believe there   s a 1 in 2 chance, or 0.5
   id203, of heads. the same is true for tails. that   s a id203
   distribution over the two outcomes of the flip, and if you can follow
   that sentence, you   ve already mastered the [71]bernoulli distribution.

   despite exotic names, the common distributions relate to each other in
   intuitive and interesting ways that make them easy to recall, and
   remark on with an air of authority. several follow naturally from the
   bernoulli distribution, for example. it   s time to reveal a map of the
   relationships.

   [72]distribution

   each distribution is illustrated by an example of its [73]id203
   density function (pdf). this post deals only with distributions of
   outcomes that are single numbers. so, the horizontal axis in each box
   is the set of possible numeric outcomes. the vertical axis describes
   the id203 of outcomes. some distributions are discrete, over
   outcomes that must be integers like 0 or 5. these appear as sparse
   lines, one for each outcome, where line height is the id203 of
   that outcome. some are continuous, for outcomes that can take on any
   real numeric value like -1.32 or 0.005. these appear as dense curves,
   where it   s areas under sections of the curve that give probabilities.
   the sums of the heights of lines, and areas under the curves, are
   always 1.

   print, cut along the dotted line, and take it with you in your wallet
   or purse. this is your field guide to spotting distributions and their
   relatives.

bernoulli and uniform

   you met the bernoulli distribution above, over two discrete
   outcomes   tails or heads. think of it, however, as a distribution over 0
   and 1, over 0 heads (i.e. tails) or 1 heads. above, both outcomes were
   equally likely, and that   s what   s illustrated in the diagram. the
   bernoulli pdf has two lines of equal height, representing the two
   equally-probable outcomes of 0 and 1 at either end.

   the bernoulli distribution could represent outcomes that aren   t equally
   likely, like the result of an unfair coin toss. then, the id203
   of heads is not 0.5, but some other value p, and the id203 of
   tails is 1-p. like many distributions, it   s actually a family of
   distributions defined by parameters, like p here. when you think
      [74]bernoulli,    just think    (possibly unfair) coin toss.   

   it   s a short jump to imagine a distribution over many equally-likely
   outcomes: the [75]uniform distribution, characterized by its flat pdf.
   imagine rolling a fair die. the outcomes 1 to 6 are equally likely. it
   can be defined for any number of outcomes n or even as a continuous
   distribution.

   associate the uniform distribution with    rolling a fair die.   

binomial and hypergeometric

   the [76]binomial distribution may be thought of as the sum of outcomes
   of things that follow a bernoulli distribution. toss a fair coin 20
   times; how many times does it come up heads? this count is an outcome
   that follows the binomial distribution. its parameters are n, the
   number of trials, and p, the id203 of a    success    (here: heads,
   or 1). each flip is a bernoulli-distributed outcome, or [77]trial.
   reach for the binomial distribution when counting the number of
   successes in things that act like a coin flip, where each flip is
   independent and has the same id203 of success.

   or, imagine an urn with equal numbers of white and black balls. close
   your eyes and draw a ball and note whether it is black, then put it
   back. repeat. how many times did you draw a black ball? this count also
   follows a binomial distribution.

   imagining this odd situation has a point, because makes it simple to
   explain the [78]hypergeometric distribution. this is the distribution
   of that same count if the balls were drawn without replacement instead.
   undeniably it   s a cousin to the binomial distribution, but not the
   same, because the id203 of success changes as balls are removed.
   if the number of balls is large relative to the number of draws, the
   distributions are similar because the chance of success changes less
   with each draw.

   when people talk about picking balls from urns without replacement,
   it   s almost always safe to interject,    the hypergeometric distribution,
   yes,    because i have never met anyone who actually filled urns with
   balls and then picked them out, and replaced them or otherwise, in real
   life. (i don   t even know anyone who owns an urn.) more broadly, it
   should come to mind when picking out a significant subset of a
   population as a sample.

poisson

   what about the count of customers calling a support hotline each
   minute? that   s an outcome whose distribution sounds binomial, if you
   think of each second as a bernoulli trial in which a customer doesn   t
   call (0) or does (1). however, as the power company knows, when the
   power goes out, 2 or even hundreds of people can call in the same
   second. viewing it as 60,000 millisecond-sized trials still doesn   t get
   around the problem   many more trials, much smaller id203 of 1
   call, let alone 2 or more, but, still not technically a bernoulli
   trial. however, taking this to its infinite, logical conclusion works.
   let n go to infinity and let p go to 0 to match so that np stays the
   same. this is like heading towards infinitely many infinitesimally
   small time slices in which the id203 of a call is infinitesimal.
   the limiting result is the [79]poisson distribution.

   like the binomial distribution, the poisson distribution is the
   distribution of a count   the count of times something happened. it   s
   parameterized not by a id203 p and number of trials n but by an
   average rate   , which in this analogy is simply the constant value of
   np. the poisson distribution is what you must think of when trying to
   count events over a time given the continuous rate of events occurring.

   when things like packets arrive at routers, or customers arrive at a
   store, or things wait in some kind of queue, think    [80]poisson.   

geometric and negative binomial

   from simple bernoulli trials arises another distribution. how many
   times does a flipped coin come up tails before it first comes up heads?
   this count of tails follows a [81]geometric distribution. like the
   bernoulli distribution, it   s parameterized by p, the id203 of
   that final success. it   s not parameterized by n, a number of trials or
   flips, because the number of failure trials is the outcome itself.

   if the binomial distribution is    how many successes?    then the
   geometric distribution is    how many failures until a success?   

   the [82]negative binomial distribution is a simple generalization. it   s
   the number of failures until r successes have occurred, not just 1.
   it   s therefore parameterized also by r. sometimes it   s described as the
   number of successes until r failures. as my life coach says, success
   and failure are what you define them to be, so these are equivalent, as
   long as you keep straight whether p is the id203 of success or
   failure.

   if you need an ice-breaker, you might point out that the binomial and
   hypergeometric distributions are an obvious pair, but the geometric and
   negative binomial distributions are also pretty similar, and then say,
      i mean, who names these things, am i right?   

exponential and weibull

   back to customer support calls: how long until the next customer calls?
   the distribution of this waiting time sounds like it could be
   geometric, because every second that nobody calls is like a failure,
   until a second in which finally a customer calls. the number of
   failures is like the number of the seconds that nobody called, and
   that   s almost the waiting time until the next call, but almost isn   t
   close enough. the catch this time is that the sum will always be in
   whole seconds, but this fails to account for the wait within that
   second until the customer finally called.

   as before, take the geometric distribution to the limit, towards
   infinitesimal time slices, and it works. you get the [83]exponential
   distribution, which accurately describes the distribution of time until
   a call. it   s a continuous distribution, the first encountered here,
   because the outcome time need not be whole seconds. like the poisson
   distribution, it is parameterized by a rate   .

   echoing the binomial-geometric relationship, poisson   s    how many events
   per time?    relates to the exponential   s    how long until an event?   
   given events whose count per time follows a poisson distribution, then
   the time between events follows an exponential distribution with the
   same rate parameter   . this correspondence between the two
   distributions is essential to name-check when discussing either of
   them.

   the exponential distribution should come to mind when thinking of    time
   until event   , maybe    time until failure.    in fact, this is so important
   that more general distributions exist to describe time-to-failure, like
   the [84]weibull distribution. whereas the exponential distribution is
   appropriate when the rate   of wear, or failure for instance   is constant,
   the weibull distribution can model increasing (or decreasing) rates of
   failure over time. the exponential is merely a special case.

   think of    [85]weibull    when the chat turns to time-to-failure.

normal, log-normal, student   s t, and chi-squared

   the [86]normal distribution, or [87]gaussian distribution, is maybe the
   most important of all. its bell shape is instantly recognizable. like
   [88]e, it   s a curiously particular entity that turns up all over, from
   seemingly simple sources. take a bunch of values following the same
   distribution   any distribution   and sum them. the distribution of their
   sum follows (approximately) the normal distribution. the more things
   that are summed, the more their sum   s distribution matches the normal
   distribution. (caveats: must be a well-behaved distribution, must be
   independent, only tends to the normal distribution.) the fact that this
   is true regardless of the underlying distribution is amazing.

   this is called the [89]central limit theorem, and you must know that
   this is what it   s called and what it means, or you will be immediately
   heckled.

   in this sense, it relates to all distributions. however it   s
   particularly related to distributions of sums of things. the sum of
   bernoulli trials follows a binomial distribution, and as the number of
   trials increases, that binomial distribution becomes more like the
   normal distribution. its cousin the hypergeometric distribution does
   too. the poisson distribution   an extreme form of binomial   also
   approaches the normal distribution as the rate parameter increases.

   an outcome that follows a [90]log-normal distribution takes on values
   whose logarithm is normally distributed. or: the exponentiation of a
   normally-distributed value is log-normally distributed. if sums of
   things are normally distributed, then remember that products of things
   are log-normally distributed.

   [91]student   s t-distribution is the basis of the [92]t-test that many
   non-statisticians learn in other sciences. it   s used in reasoning about
   the mean of a normal distribution, and also approaches the normal
   distribution as its parameter increases. the distinguishing feature of
   the t-distribution are its tails, which are fatter than the normal
   distribution   s.

   if the fat-tail anecdote isn   t a hot enough take to wow your neighbor,
   go to its mildly-interesting [93]back-story concerning beer. over 100
   years ago, [94]guinness was using statistics to make better stout.
   there, [95]william sealy gosset developed some whole new stats theory
   just to grow better barley. gosset convinced the boss that the other
   brewers couldn   t figure out how to use the ideas, and so got permission
   to publish, but only under the pen name    student   . gosset   s best-known
   result is this t-distribution, which is sort of named after him.

   finally, the [96]chi-squared distribution is the distribution of the
   sum of squares of normally-distributed values. it   s the distribution
   underpinning the [97]chi-squared test which is itself based on the sum
   of squares of differences, which are supposed to be normally
   distributed.

gamma and beta

   at this point, if you   re talking about chi-squared anything, then the
   conversation has gotten serious. you are likely talking to actual
   statisticians, and you may want to excuse yourself at this point,
   because things like the [98]gamma distribution may come up. it is a
   generalization of both the exponential and chi-squared distributions.
   more like the exponential distribution, it is used as a sophisticated
   model of waiting times. for example, the gamma distribution comes up
   when modeling the time until the next n events occur. it appears in
   machine learning as the    [99]conjugate prior    to a couple
   distributions.

   do not get into that conversation about conjugate priors, but if you
   do, be sure that you   re about to talk about the [100]beta distribution,
   because it   s the conjugate prior to most every other distribution
   mentioned here. as far as data scientists are concerned, that   s what it
   was built for. mention this casually, and move toward the door.

the beginning of wisdom

   id203 distributions are something you can   t know too much about.
   the truly interested should check out this [101]incredibly detailed map
   of all univariate distributions. hopefully, this anecdotal guide gives
   you the confidence to appear knowledgeable and with-it in today   s tech
   culture. or at least, a way to detect, with high id203, when you
   should find a less nerdy cocktail party.

       i   m surprised you didn   t mention the family of levy-stable
       distributions. thought the beta distribution (and maybe the gamma
       for suitable parametrization?) looks to have some similarities, the
       levy-stable distributions themselves come up. just as the normal
       distribution is the limiting distribution of sums of i.i.d. random
       variables with finite variance, the levy-stable distributions are
       limiting distributions of i.i.d. random variables without finite
       variance (there are some other criteria, but that   s the basic
       idea).

            @abe there are certainly a lot more distributions; i tried to
            draw the line at ones i thought would plausibly come up in
            practice for the average data scientist.

       the negative binomial is also the convolution of a gamma with a

       there can   t be enough of these sorts of summaries. i have an
       undergrad math background but am rusty, and never fully embraced
       statistics. i had the horribly misguided sense that it was just
       math-like, essentially. i   ve spent the last few years slowly
       accreting more and better statistical information, and as you say,
       there   s plenty of depth to plumb. i also like count bayesie among
       others ([139]http://www.countbayesie.com/).
       thank you and keep up the good work!

       great intro and graphic. i absolutely agree with an earlier post on
       misconceptions and lack of interest in statistics among the
       mathematician community and it   s a hard cycle to break. both
       disciplines could benefit from each other and yes., they are
       different. i have a phd in mathematics and have been a teaching
       professor for about 10 years, and another six while working towards
       my degree. it is embarrassing how many math professors teach
       statistics based on on a first half of some undergraduate textbook.
       it is a shameful display of ignorance from some of my colleagues.
       this is how i was exposed to statistics. it was boring and seemed
       redundant even after the often required mathematical statistics.
       but that title alone should have been a hint. why mathematical
       statistics? is there another kind? my area of expertise is complex
       dynamics. we never spoke about statistics, id203. yet ergodic
       theory was discussed daily. it took a graduate student of mine who
       was doing an independent study with me on differential geometry to
       spark my interest in stats. i have been obsessed with bayesian
       statistics, econometrics, causal id136, and finally understood
       the amazingly close connection to my field. the search for academic
       work regarding this connection proved fruitless. so, to my future
       colleagues working on a thesis or looking for one. start above,,
       and keep going. there is a plethora of open questions and thesis
       topics. and to my current colleagues, if you do not immediately
       understand the original post you shouldn   t be teaching statistics,
