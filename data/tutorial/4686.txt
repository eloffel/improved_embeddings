   14:03

   [38]1.1: overview of differential equations linear equations include
   dy/dt = y, dy/dt =    y, dy/dt = 2ty. the equation dy/dt = y*y is
   nonlinear.
   [39][thumbnail.11.640.360.jpg]
   14:47

   [40]1.2: the calculus you need the sum rule, product rule, and chain
   rule produce new derivatives from the derivatives of x^n, sin(x) and
   e^x. the fundamental theorem of calculus says that the integral inverts
   the derivative.

   input, e^st, from outside and exponential growth, e^at, from inside,

   15:54

   [44]1.4c: response to oscillating input, cos(w*t) an oscillating input
   cos(  t) produces an oscillating output with the same frequency    (and a
   phase shift).

   13:58

   [46]1.4d: solution for any input, q(t) to solve a linear first order
   equation, multiply each input q(s) by its growth factor and integrate
   those outputs.

   15:40

   [48]1.4e: step function and delta function a unit step function jumps
   from 0 to 1. its slope is a delta function: zero everywhere except
   infinite at the jump.

   [60]1.8: separable equations separable equations can be solved by two
   separate integrations, one in t and the other in y. the simplest is
   dy/dt = y, when dy/y equals dt. then ln(y) = t + c.

   16:01

   [68]2.3c: impulse response and step response the impulse response g is
   the solution when the force is an impulse (a delta function). this also
   solves a null equation (no force) with a nonzero initial condition.

   exponentials), a particular solution has this same form.
   [77][thumbnail.11.640.361.jpg]
   15:48

   [78]2.6b: an example of method of undetermined coefficients this method
   is also successful for forces and solutions such as (at^2 + bt +c)
   e^st: substitute into the equation to find a, b, c.
   [79][thumbnail.11.640.361.jpg]
   19:21

   16:30

   [84]2.7b: laplace transform: second order equation the second
   derivative transforms to s^2y and the algebra problem involves the
   transfer function 1/ (as^2 + bs +c).

   10:28

   [86]2.7c: laplace transforms and convolution when the force is an
   impulse    (t), the impulse response is g(t). when the force is f(t),
   the response is the    convolution    of f and g.
