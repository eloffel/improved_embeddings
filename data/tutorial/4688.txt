merlin: the neural network (nn) based id133 system

   this repository contains the neural network (nn) based id133
   system
   developed at the centre for speech technology research (cstr),
   university of edinburgh.

   merlin is a toolkit for building deep neural network models for
   statistical parametric id133. it must be used in combination
   with a front-end text processor (e.g., festival) and a vocoder (e.g.,
   straight or world).

   the system is written in python and relies on the theano numerical
   computation library.

   merlin comes with recipes (in the spirit of the [107]kaldi automatic
   id103 toolkit) to show you how to build state-of-the art
   systems.

   merlin is free software, distributed under an apache license version
   2.0, allowing unrestricted commercial and non-commercial use alike.

   read the documentation at [108]cstr-edinburgh.github.io/merlin.

   merlin is compatible with: python 2.7-3.6.

installation

   merlin uses the following dependencies:
     * numpy, scipy
     * matplotlib
     * bandmat
     * theano
     * tensorflow (optional, required if you use tensorflow models)
     * sklearn, keras, h5py (optional, required if you use keras models)

   to install merlin, cd merlin and run the below steps:
     * install some basic tools in merlin

bash tools/compile_tools.sh

     * install python dependencies

pip install numpy
pip install -r requirements.txt

   for detailed instructions, to build the toolkit: see [109]install and
   [110]cstr blog post.
   these instructions are valid for unix systems including various flavors
   of linux;

getting started with merlin

   to run the example system builds, see egs/readme.txt

   as a first demo, please follow the scripts in egs/slt_arctic

   now, you can also follow josh meyer's [111]blog post for detailed
   instructions
   on how to install merlin and build slt demo voice.

   for a more in-depth tutorial about building voices with merlin, you can
   check out:
     * [112]deep learning for text-to-id133, using the merlin
       toolkit (interspeech 2017 tutorial)
     * [113]arctic voices
     * [114]build your own voice

synthetic speech samples

   listen to [115]synthetic speech samples from our slt arctic voice.

development pattern for contributors

    1. [116]create a personal fork of the [117]main merlin repository in
       github.
    2. make your changes in a named branch different from master, e.g. you
       create a branch my-new-feature.
    3. [118]generate a pull request through the web interface of github.
