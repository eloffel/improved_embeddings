text2vec

dmitriy selivanov

   you   ve just discovered [11]text2vec!

   text2vec is an r package which provides an efficient framework with a
   concise api for text analysis and natural language processing (nlp).

   goals which we aimed to achieve as a result of development of text2vec:
     * concise - expose as few functions as possible
     * consistent - expose unified interfaces, no need to explore new
       interface for each task
     * flexible - allow to easily solve complex tasks
     * fast - maximize efficiency per single thread, transparently scale
       to multiple threads on multicore machines
     * memory efficient - use streams and iterators, not keep data in ram
       if possible

   see [12]api section for details.

performance

   htop author of the package is a little bit obsessed about efficiency.

   this package is efficient because it is carefully written in c++, which
   also means that text2vec is memory friendly. some parts (such as glove)
   are fully parallelized using the excellent [13]rcppparallel package.
   this means that the id27s are computed in parallel on os x,
   linux, windows, and even solaris (x86) without any additional tuning or
   tricks.

   other emrassingly parallel tasks (such as vectorization) can use any
   parallel backend which supports [14]foreach package. they can achieve
   near-linear scalability with number of available cores.

   finally, a streaming api means that users do not have to load all the
   data into ram.
   text2vec is created by [15]dmitry selivanov and contributors.    2016.
