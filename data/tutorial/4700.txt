   pydata ann arbor: sebastian raschka | an introduction to deep learning
   with tensorflow
   as a ph.d. candidate at michigan state university, sebastian raschka is
   developing novel computational methods in the field of computational
   biology. among others, his research activities include the development
   of new deep learning architectures to solve problems in the field of
   biometrics.
   among his other works is his book    python machine learning,    a
   bestselling title at packt and on amazon.com, which has been translated
   into german, korean, chinese, japanese, and italian. in his free time,
   sebastian loves to contribute to open source projects, and methods that
   he implemented are now successfully used in machine learning
   competitions such as kaggle.
   in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the open-source tensorflow
   library for deep learning. what's so great about tensorflow is that it
   allows us to work with multi-dimensional arrays and train deep neural
   network very efficiently by utilizing gpu resources.
   in this introduction to tensorflow, you will learn how to define
   computational graphs and how to execute them in a python runtime
   environment. after implementing id26 for a simple
   multi-layer id88, we will talk about tensorflow's convenience
   features for optimization and the new layers api to construct more
   complex deep learning architectures more compactly.
