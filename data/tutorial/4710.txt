get ready for core ml 2

   take advantage of core ml 2, the machine learning framework used across
   apple products, including siri, camera, and quicktype. core ml 2
   delivers blazingly fast performance with easy integration of machine
   learning models, enabling you to build apps with intelligent features
   using just a few lines of code. and now, you can create your own models
   on mac using create ml and playgrounds in xcode 10.

using core ml 2 in your apps

   core ml 2 lets you integrate a broad variety of machine learning model
   types into your app. in addition to supporting extensive deep learning
   with over 30 layer types, it also supports standard models such as tree
   ensembles, id166s, and generalized linear models. because it   s built on
   top of low level technologies like metal and accelerate, core ml
   seaid113ssly takes advantage of the cpu and gpu to provide maximum
   performance and efficiency. you can run machine learning models on the
   device so data doesn   t need to leave the device to be analyzed.

vision

   you can easily build id161 machine learning features into
   your app. supported features include face tracking, face detection,
   landmarks, text detection, rectangle detection, barcode detection,
   object tracking, and image registration.

natural language

   the natural language framework is a new framework you use to analyze
   natural language text and deduce its language-specific metadata. you
   can use this framework with create ml to train and deploy custom nlp
   models.

introducing create ml

   this new framework lets you easily build machine learning models, with
   no machine learning expertise required. familiar and easy to use thanks
   to swift, create ml is integrated into playgrounds in xcode 10 so you
   can view model creation workflows in real time. just add a few lines of
   swift code to leverage our vision and natural language technologies and
   create models optimized for the apple ecosystem for a variety of tasks,
   including regression, image classification, word tagging, and sentence
   classification. and you can use your mac to train models from apple
   with your custom data     no need for a dedicated server.
