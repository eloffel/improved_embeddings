format

   the book-crossing dataset comprises 3 tables.
     * bx-users
       contains the users. note that user ids (`user-id`) have been
       anonymized and map to integers. demographic data is provided
       (`location`, `age`) if available. otherwise, these fields contain
       null-values.
     * bx-books
       books are identified by their respective isbn. invalid isbns have
       already been removed from the dataset. moreover, some content-based
       information is given (`book-title`, `book-author`,
       `year-of-publication`, `publisher`), obtained from amazon web
       services. note that in case of several authors, only the first is
       provided. urls linking to cover images are also given, appearing in
       three different flavours (`image-url-s`, `image-url-m`,
       `image-url-l`), i.e., small, medium, large. these urls point to the
       amazon web site.
     * bx-book-ratings
       contains the book rating information. ratings (`book-rating`) are
       either explicit, expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values
       denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, expressed by 0.

   in .zip format
     * [9]sql dump [26.391 kb]
