about
neural network console

concept

   network_image

   the ultimate tool for deep learning developers.
   our tool provides an elegant user interface to design,
   train and evaluate neural network models.

   deep learning technologies deserve to
   be used in practice more widely.
   this has been our anticipation since 2010,
   when we have started research
   and development involving deep learning,
   and continued to see its powers since then.

story of
neural network console / libraries

   "neural network console" lets you design, train, and evaluate your
   neural networks in a refined user interface.
   "neural network libraries" provides the developers with deep learning
   techniques developed by sony.
   kobayashi, a researcher at sony who has performed research and
   development on deep learning, speaks about these two projects, their
   development hitsory, and its implications.
