   as someone who often finds himself explaining machine learning to
   non-experts, i offer the following list as a public service
   announcement.
    1. machine learning means [11]learning from data; ai is a buzzword.
       machine learning lives up to the hype: there are an incredible
       number of problems that you can solve by providing the right
       training data to the right learning algorithms. call it ai if that
       helps you sell it, but know that ai, at least as used outside of
       academia, is often a buzzword that can mean whatever people want it
       to mean.
    2. machine learning is about data and algorithms, but mostly data.
       there   s a lot of excitement about advances in machine learning
       algorithms, and particularly about [12]deep learning. but data is
       the key ingredient that makes machine learning possible. you can
       have machine learning [13]without sophisticated algorithms, but not
       without good data.
    3. unless you have a lot of data, you should stick to simple models.
       machine learning trains a model from patterns in your data,
       exploring a space of possible models defined by parameters. if your
       parameter space is too big, you   ll [14]overfit to your training
       data and train a model that doesn   t [15]generalize beyond it. a
       detailed explanation requires [16]more math, but as a rule you
       should keep your models as simple as possible.
    4. machine learning can only be as good as the data you use to train
       it. the phrase    [17]garbage in, garbage out    predates machine
       learning, but it aptly characterizes a key limitation of machine
       learning. machine learning can only discover patterns that are
       present in your training data. for [18]supervised machine learning
       tasks like [19]classification, you   ll need a robust collection of
       correctly labeled, richly featured training data.
    5. machine learning only works if your training data is
       representative. just as a fund prospectus warns that    past
       performance is no guarantee of future results   , machine learning
       should warn that it   s only guaranteed to work for data generated by
       the same distribution that generated its training data. be vigilant
       of skews between training data and production data, and retrain
       your models frequently so they don   t become stale.
    6. most of the hard work for machine learning is data transformation.
       from reading the hype about new machine learning techniques, you
       might think that machine learning is mostly about selecting and
       tuning algorithms. the reality is more prosaic: most of your time
       and effort goes into [20]data cleansing and [21]feature
       engineering         that is, transforming raw [22]features into features
       that better represent the signal in your data.
    7. deep learning is a revolutionary advance, but it isn   t a magic
       bullet. deep learning has earned its hype by delivering advances
       across a broad range of machine learning application areas.
       moreover, deep learning automates some of the work traditionally
       performed through feature engineering, especially for image and
       video data. but deep learning isn   t a silver bullet. you can   t just
       use it out of the box, and you   ll still need to invest significant
       effort in data cleansing and transformation.
    8. machine learning systems are highly vulnerable to operator error.
       with apologies to the nra,    machine learning algorithms don   t kill
       people; people kill people.    when machine learning systems fail,
       it   s rarely because of problems with the machine learning
       algorithm. more likely, you   ve introduced human error into the
       training data, creating bias or some other systematic error. always
       be skeptical, and approach machine learning with the discipline you
       apply to software engineering.
    9. machine learning can inadvertently create a self-fulfilling
       prophecy. in many applications of machine learning, the decisions
       you make today affect the training data you collect tomorrow. once
       your machine learning system embeds biases into its model, it can
       continue generating new training data that reinforces those biases.
       [23]and some biases can ruin people   s lives. be responsible: don   t
       create self-fulfilling prophecies.
   10. ai is not going to become self-aware, rise up, and destroy
       humanity. a surprising number of people ([24]cough) seem to be
       getting their ideas about artificial intelligence from science
       fiction movies. we should be inspired by science fiction, but not
       so credulous that we mistake it for reality. there are enough real
       and present dangers to worry about, from consciously evil human
       beings to unconsciously biased machine learning models. so you can
       stop worrying about [25]skynet and    [26]superintelligence   .

   there   s far more to machine learning than i can explain in a top-10
   list. but hopefully this serves as a useful introduction for
   non-experts.
