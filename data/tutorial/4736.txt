   recently, google added try the api boxes on the product pages of each
   of its [15]cloud machine learning apis: [16]cloud vision api,
   [17]speech api and [18]natural language api. now anyone can instantly
   experience the power of google's machine intelligence on their own
   images, voice and text. let's see how it works.

try cloud vision api

   cloud vision api enables developers to understand the content of an
   image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an
   easy-to-use rest api. to try it now, go to [19]the cloud vision api
   product page and drop or open any image file onto the try the api box.
   click on the captcha dialog box to prove you're not an automated
   script, and drop in your image. here   s what the vision api had to say
   about a picture i took of a jack o   lantern that my son and i carved at
   a halloween party:

   machine-intelligence-11rzr5.png

   using the [20]label detection method of the api, cloud vision executes
   image content analysis on the uploaded image. looks like cloud vision   s
   machine intelligence is smart enough to understand not just the object,
   but also the context ("halloween,"    holiday,       carving   ). awesome,
   isn't it? you can also see the api   s response in the raw json format by
   clicking the json response tab.

id42 (ocr)

   another impressive feature of the api is id42
   (ocr). it can recognize characters and words in multiple languages
   inside an image and extract them as strings, attached with the position
   of each word in the image. let's try the feature with this image.

   to see this image with full resolution, go [21]here

   when you drop this image to the box and open the text tab, you can see
   the ocr result.
   machine-intelligence-14fhnx.png

   even though the words in this image were slanted and unclear, the ocr
   extracts the words and their positions correctly. it even picks up the
   word "beacon" on the presenter's t-shirt.

   detection of explicit images, landmarks and logos

   cloud vision api can also [22]detect other features, including popular
   [23]landmarks and corporate or product logos     all with a high degree
   of accuracy. safe search detection, meanwhile, checks for adult,
   violent, medical or spoofed images, and is already in production use at
   several social content providers. previously, those social providers
   filtered out objectionable images uploaded by users by hiring a large
   staff and checking every single image manually. with safe search, they
   can reduce that staff significantly. for more details about safe search
   detection, check out sara robinson   s blog post [24]filtering
   inappropriate content with cloud vision api. and for landmark
   detection, check out this detailed post by [25]greg wilson, [26]testing
   google cloud vision api landmark detection with my own travel
   photographs, which has lots of great examples.

try cloud speech api

   have you noticed teenagers control their smartphones using their voice?
   the same voice recognition engine that powers google search and google
   now in modern smartphones is behind cloud speech api. you can now take
   advantage of this disruptive technology for your own applications. for
   example, a call center provider can use cloud speech api to convert
   audio data to text (and later, you can analyze it with natural language
   api     we will discuss that next).

   cloud speech api also has a try the api box. go to [27]the product
   page, click on the microphone icon, and make a recording up to 30
   seconds long. when you finish recording, it uploads the audio data to
   the api and displays the result.

   this webpage includes a live demo of the cloud speech api which
   requires access to your microphone. in order to enable the demo, please
   connect a microphone and allow your browser to access it. if you
   previously blocked microphone access to this page, you should re-enable
   it in your browser's settings."

   error

   we are unable to process your request at this time. please try again
   later.

   you can also try cloud speech api with many languages besides english.
   pick from [28]80 supported languages and their variants from the
   drop-down menu. personally, i found the technology works impressively
   with japanese too.

try natural language api

   many developers use simple keyword or regular expression matches to
   process natural language text. in other words, they process text as
   unstructured data without any clue about what it means.

   with cloud natural language api, powerful machine learning models
   reveal the structure and meaning with an easy-to-use rest api. now that
   you can handle text as structured data with various attributes and
   metadata, it   s possible to add intelligence to your application by
   processing, analyzing or querying on the text generated by end
   customers.

   let's look at [29]natural language api   s try the api box. clicking the
   analyze button to explore the default sample text.
   machine-intelligence-6kaj7.png

   the entities tab displays [30]the entity analysis result. given the
   default sample text, the word google is classified as an organization,
   and mountain view is a location. and according to the api, sundar
   pichai is a popular person, and android must be a consumer good. cloud
   natural language api also returns links to wikipedia pages of those
   entities if they are available.

   now give it a try on your own.

sentiment and syntactic analysis

   for [31]id31 of the text, click on the sentiment tab.

   machine-intelligence-10g24m.png

   according to the cloud natural language api, the sentence "sundar
   pichai said in his keynote that users love their new android phones"
   has a positive sentiment.

   on the syntax tab, you can see the sentence   s [32]syntactic analysis.
   machine-intelligence-7k9zk.png

   the json response from the syntactic analysis method provides the data
   to build a [33]dependency parse tree of the text, like the one pictured
   above. with this feature, you can split the whole sentence into several
   tokens, as well as the parts of speech (pos) of each token such as noun
   and verb, and dependencies between them. now the unstructured data
   becomes structured data with insights about it.

develop amazing apps with cloud machine learning apis

   as we have seen in this article, it   s easy to experience the power of
   google's latest machine learning technologies with their respective try
   the api boxes.

   cloud vision api is now generally available and ready for production
   use. speech api and natural language api are in beta and anyone can
   start evaluating them. the time is now for developers to start playing
   with this game-changing technology.
