http://www.cooltownstudios.com/2009/04/08/id104-101 

id104 (howe 2006) 
   = crowd intelligence + outsourcing  
   the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by 
employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) 
network of people in the form of an open call    
 
idea: 
     collective workforce of unskilled workers equals or beats the single 
expert (wikipedia-principle, many eyes see more than two) 
     micropayments for microwork unlocks workforce that cannot work a 
regular job 
     fast throughput through potentially large number of workers

     amazon mechanical turk https://www.mturk.com 
      since 2005 
      largest and most  
well-known platform

     crowdflower http://crowdflower.com

     microworkers https://microworkers.com/

most platforms sell    campaign    packages or 
specialize in a few    key    areas. 
we concentrate on those that allow 
the free definition of micro-tasks.

home stories from 2006 

      one of those workers is kristy milland, 27, a mother of one []..]    i have a lot of 
free time basically sitting at the computer while the kids play,    she says. [..] 
when mturk.com first began, milland would churn through 3-cent hits. [..] in an 
eight-hour day, when she didn   t have the kids to watch, milland could go 
through 1,000 photos, making a cool $30. 
      curtis taylor, 50, [..] , who has earned more than $345 on mturk.com, doesn   t 
even think of turking as work. to him, it   s a way to kill time.    i   m not in it to 
make money, i   m in it to goof off,    he says. taylor travels a lot for business 
and finds himself sitting around in hotel rooms at night. he doesn   t like to watch 
tv much, and says that turking beats playing free online poker. [..] .    if i ever 
stop being entertained, i   ll stop doing it,    he says.    i   ll just quit.     
      why do people do it if the pay is so low? it   s a question stranieri [a requester] 
wonders about himself.    i think it   s something of a hybrid between trying to 
make money on the side and a diversion, a substitute for doing a 
crossword puzzle. it   s sort of a mental exercise.

requesters and workers 

     requester 
      defines a id104 task 
      accepts/rejects work 
      pays the bill 
      common requesters: search engines (relevance judgments), survey, data entry, 
transcription, marketing, researchers 

     worker 
      works on tasks 
      gets paid 
      tries to maximize her/his acceptance rate 
      common workers (mturk):  
      in the beginning: mostly us population from all social statuses, slightly 

increased: young educated females 

      nowadays: mostly young males from india  

28 

main issue: quality control 

      workers try to get money quickly, using random work 
      when checking the work of workers, there is no time saving as opposed to doing it 

yourself 

mechanisms 
      hit acceptance rate, location 
      qualifications: pre-tests 
      test items with known answers 
      redundancy 
      verification through subsequent task 

never trust a 
single worker      
trust the crowd!  

consequences (eickhoff & de vries, 2011) 
      simple hits 
      quick hits 
      clear answers that allow redundancy 
      no training required

(csdm) at the fourth acm international conf. 

29 

a few words on id104 practice 

     in case of yes/no-answers, these have to be (more or less) balanced 
      workers learn quickly that always the same answer is    right    and stop thinking 
      balance you dataset artificially by biasing test items, or appropriate filtering 
     the benefit of doubt 
      don   t get hung up on corner cases: strike the balance between easiness of task 
and well-definedness 
     there is no    best way    
      try what works 
      try again 
      and make it work. 
      everything counts: the task is only as strong as its weakest link 
     don   t underpay! 
      or do you want to be one of those bad capitalists that practice modern slavery?

us tax laws     form 1099 
a law that was originally designed for highly-paid experts   

     irs (us tax organization) form 1099    independent contractors    
         nonemployee    status reduces burden on employer, such as social security, 
health benefits, no statutory right to minimum wage, overtime pay, 
compensation for injuries sustained on the job, unemployment insurance if 
involuntarily separated from employment, or protection against discrimination. 
      contractors have to declare their income and pay taxes, employer does not 
have to withhold them 

     only yearly payouts of $600 or more have to be declared by the 
employer, using form 1099. 

law was originally designed for highly-paid experts.  
this leads to serious complications for large-scale requesters, including 
amazon themselves.  

32 

amazon mechanical turk: characteristics 
https://www.mturk.com 
     old and popular platform 
     bare-bone platform with very little in-built mechanisms for quality control 
     free definition of tasks, can use tasks from your own server 
     comparatively low premium of 20%, but at least 1 cent / hit 
     restful api  
     need a us address for requester role 
      if you don   t live in the us, get a forwarding address from services like 
http://www.ipsparcel.com if you are getting serious, or make up one if you   re not 
      use your credit card with billing address from anywhere 
     need to handle taxation bureaucracy on the requester side 
      payouts of more than $600 / year for a single worker require a us tax form 
      avoid by tracking payouts and revoking qualifications 

summary: full control (for the better or the worse), low premium, need 
some trickery for non-us-based requesters, beware the taxation issue. 

33 

crowdflower: characteristics 
http://crowdflower.com 
     established meta-platform, distributes tasks over many platforms 
     many mechanisms for quality control, main: gold items 
     free definition of tasks, can use java script for complex interfaces 
     comparatively high premium of 33% 
     restful api  
     works from anywhere with credit card 
     taxation bureaucracy handling included in service 
     academic accounts with minimal support, need to make data public 
     pro accounts (with private data) need a minimum cash flow of several 
thousand usd / month! 

summary: good quality control handling, high premium, high amount of 
services, access to many platforms, issues with proprietary data, good for 
business customers esp. outside of the us
