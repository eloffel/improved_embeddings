     id104 platforms for text tasks 
      amazon mechanical turk (amt) 
      crowdflower (cf) 
     a small sample $5 project: emotions and associations 
      learn step by step how amt and cf work  
      discussion of results and differences  
     a more ambitious $40 project: paraphrases in context 
      use of advanced apis 
      iteration for the evolution of id104 tasks

id104 platforms 

     amazon mechanical turk https://www.mturk.com 
      since 2005 
      largest and most  
well-known platform 
      highly flexible 
     crowdflower http://crowdflower.com 
      automated quality control 
      more formalized, easier to configure 
     microworkers https://microworkers.com/ 
      mostly seo 

most platforms sell    campaign    packages or 
specialize in a few    key    areas. 
we concentrate on those that allow 
the free definition of micro-tasks.

amazon mechanical turk: characteristics 
https://www.mturk.com 
     old and popular platform 
     bare-bone platform with very little in-built mechanisms for quality control 
     free definition of tasks, can use tasks from your own server 
     comparatively low premium of 20%, but at least 1 cent / hit 
     restful api  
     need a us address for requester role 
      if you don   t live in the us, get a forwarding address from services like 
http://www.ipsparcel.com  
      use your credit card with billing address from anywhere 
     need to handle taxation bureaucracy on the requester side 
      payouts of more than $600 / year for a single worker require a us tax form 
      avoid by tracking payouts and revoking qualifications 

summary: full control (for the better or the worse), low premium, need 
some trickery for non-us-based requesters, beware the taxation issue. 

4 

crowdflower: characteristics 
http://crowdflower.com 
     established meta-platform, distributes tasks over many platforms 
     many mechanisms for quality control, main: gold items 
     free definition of tasks, can use java script for complex interfaces 
     comparatively high premium of 33% 
     restful api  
     works from anywhere with credit card 
     taxation bureaucracy handling included in service 
     academic accounts with minimal support, need to make data public 
     pro accounts (with private data) need a minimum cash flow of several 
thousand usd / month! 

summary: good quality control handling, high premium, high amount of 
services, access to many platforms, issues with proprietary data, good for 
business customers esp. outside of the us

$5 project: emotion and association 

     let   s say we want to collect emotions for words 
     let   s also say we   re interested in associated terms 
     example: for the target word love, we expect highly positive emotions 
and associations such as marriage, romance, etc. 

applications: psychology research, makeyourtextnicer.com, sentiment 
classification, ...

some comments (all on amt except last one) 

helicopter (+1)     rescue : i always think of helicopters as rescuing 
people and flying them to hospitals or saving them from places rescue 
people can't get to, like mountains or lakes, so it's a positive word.  
 
love (+2)     francis : pope francis really made an impression on me 
watching his visit on tv, and how he inspired love and how much that love 
seemed to make the world a little better place for awhile. 
 
garbage (-2)     cans : i have to take out the garbage cans every week, 
and they are heavy, and in the winter it;s hard, which is why i put strong 
negative. 
 
laptop (+1)     acer : i have acer

lessons learned from this experiment 

     specify guidelines!  
      non-english     comer    
      capitalization 
      verbs vs. nouns vs. proper names 
      add redundancy:    put single word in lowercase    
     people mix up the two tasks    neutral    
     small batch: almost no scammers despite lack of quality control

goal: a semantic writing aid that: 
      provides  paraphrase detection and prediction capability 
     
      provides varied writing styles by suggesting semantically 

improves readability of documents  

equivalent paraphrases  

      removes redundant or overused words or phrases.

     s 

49 

but, really, how do you crowdsource id141? 

     directly embedding paraphrase tool: no control over 
      how many phrases are paraphrased 
      whether people edit the text freely 
      quality assurance 

     remember lessons learned: 
      keep it simple 
      avoid free text whenever possible 
      make sure to have a handle on test items 

50 

amt interface for id141 in context 

     5 targets per hit, 5 candidates per target 
     extra field for additional input 
     jquery to control user inputs: enforce    at least one    
 

51 

experiment and analysis 

     5% control hits (unrelated paraphrase candidates) 
     experiment conducted in smaller chunks  
     price was adjusted in every iteration (the higher the price the fastest) 
     more than 4000 paraphrase instances collected with an observed 
agreement of 80% 

 

52 

experiment and analysis 

     lessons learned 
      if the amt template is used, the name attribute is required to get answers 
      by default, tasks created with amt template sets qualifications to masters only 
      location of workers matters 
      workers should not be rejected if the hit submitted has an error (example 
attribute name missed     lost $2 ) 
      the smaller the task, the easier to manage     can automatize. 
      approve/reject 

      group by worker id 
      check for control questions 

      if we wait for the whole task to be completed, we get more spammers 
      keywords matter for the task   s visibility 

 

53 

post-hoc machine learning evaluation:  
directly check the output of your system 

     id104 task for paraphrase scoring (without context) 
      use the british academic writers corpus (bawc) for this task 
     compute correlation with ppdb2 results 
     repeat experiment (with context) 
     compare correlation to see the impact of context
