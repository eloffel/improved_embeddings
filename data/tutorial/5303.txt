cheap and fast     but is it good?  

     systematic comparative evaluation of quality 
and cost of crowdworkers vs. expert 
annotators 
     several tasks, example (on right)  for 
   affective text analysis    

main takeaways: 
     experts are better but more expensive 
     average of 4 crowdworkers needed to 
replace 1 expert 
     controlling for label bias and quality helps

quality control mechanisms  

     reputation systems: stats about approval rate, hits completed etc.  
     qualification tests: user-defined tests 
     aggregation and redundancy: don   t trust a single worker, trust the crowd! 
     embedded gold standard data: trust is good, checking is better 
     second-pass reviewing: turk the turkers 
     economic incentives: bonus for agreement 
     statistical models: embrace the noise and attribute more weight to 
reliable crowdworkers

indian spam 

(2013) while there are certainly many high-quality workers outside the us, 
there is a certain segment of workers that join the market with the sole 
purpose of getting something for nothing. especially after indian 
workers became eligible to receive cash compensation (instead of just gift 
cards available to other non-us workers), the number of spam attacks 
from india went up significantly.

typical distributions of hits per crowdworker 

     just like anything else that is uncontrolled and unbound, distribution 
follows a power law: ~half of the people do only 1 hit 
     quality and number of hits does not correlate, but there are typical 
   outliers   : high-volume scammers, low-volume tryouts...

$300 project: acquire complex paraphrases 

     previous project: paraphrase candidates given 
     reached agreement through formalizing/constraining the interface 
     how to reach agreement for collection of paraphrases? 
      high variability of correct answers 
      thus, no    gold    items 
      how to reach high quality?  
     solution: use crowdworkers for validation!

paraphrase generation 

crowdflower task design 
     short text chunks 
      verb phrases (most promising for id141) 
      3 to 8 words 
      extracted with nltk chunking grammar 

np:	{<dt|jj.*|cd|prp\$>*<nn.*>+}	
pp:	{<in><np>}	
arg:	{<np|pp>}	
verb:	{<md>?<vb.*>+<prp|r.*>?}	
verbphrase:	{<verb><arg>} 

 
 

     source corpus: msrp (microsoft research paraphrase corpus) 
     hit:    please paraphrase the given expression    
     prevent bad input as good as possible 

9 

two/multi-stage generation 

simple multi-stage generation process as 
proposed by negri et. al, 2012 
 
1.    text chunks to paraphrase 
2.    obtain crowd paraphrases 
3.   

(optional)  further iterations to increase 
lexical divergence 

4.    use a validation task to filter bad data 

     the validate step can have gold 
     but generation step is just chance

combined task scheme 

     combine generate / verify hits into one 
atomic unit 

     initial generate 

     pair each generate hit with validate hit 

     use gold on validate to infer generate quality 

 

11 

combined task interface (crowdflower) 

     in the combined setting, 
spamming on half of the hit 
is still possible, but rather 
unlikely 
     use jquery rules to avoid 
copy-and-paste of the 
expression as well as empty 
text 
     bad data caught early, bad 
workers can be blocked 

12 

paraphrase validation 

     two possibilities 
      binary verification 
 ask the worker to make a binary decision yes / no 
      semantic similarity rating 
 ask the worker to rate the similarity 

 
choice depends on goal: 
      binary is easier for agreement 
      n-ary needs less judgments for converging graded score, but costs more

design pattern: find-fix-verify 

find-fix-verify splits complex crowd intelligence tasks into a series of 
generation and review stages that utilize independent agreement and 
voting to produce reliable results.  
separate open-ended tasks into three stages: 
     find: identify areas that need work / errors   
aggregate to determine what should be fixed 
     fix: propose solutions to identified problems 
collect only a few alternatives 
     verify: vote on the alternatives to find the best one 

typically, enforce different workforce on the three stages

     ambiguous words have multiple senses, e.g. case (container/legal/...). 
mostly, sense frequency distribution is highly skewed in both collection 
and queries.

error analysis (manual on 100 words) 

     (4) overlap or containment of one sense in the other leads to matching 
with two classes. an indicator of this is the number of set aside sentences 
in task 3.  
     (3) systematic part-of speech tagger errors. e.g.:     back   . turkers did not 
consistently mark pos errors as impossible (although instructed). they 
reliably distinguished among senses. 
     (3) con   ation of senses. despite differences in meaning, two senses (as 
perceived by us) had suf   cient overlap in their substitutions to not get 
clustered apart (e.g.    relationship   )  
     (2) oscillation of senses. differences in the subjective judgment of turkers 
caused the sense inventory to oscillate between grouping and 
distinguishing senses, such as    over the centuries    vs.    the 16th 
century   . larger teams help. 

40 

minor senses 

     (8) minor senses in set aside sentences (sampling).  
some minor senses in the domain did not make it into the sense 
inventory; however, the cases never represented more than 4% of 
sample sentences.  
     few substitutions for minor senses. of the 834 senses distinguished in 
our experiment, 41 did not get any substitution with frequency     2 and 
142 senses did not record a substitution frequency of four or more.  

for most applications, we are not interested in minor senses.
