background

comparative method strongly focuses on two types of data:

morphological paradigms
regular sound correspondences

both are not very suitable for computational approaches, because

morphological categories are not easily comparable across languages,
especially if we look individual language families
also, isolating languages have no morphology
identifying regular sound correspondences automatically is a surprisingly
hard problem, due to data sparseness
currently one of the hot topics, far from resolved (list, 2014; hruschka
et al., 2015; bouchard-c  t   et al., 2013)

background

what we need (especially if we apply statistical methods):

data types which are applicable to all natural languages
ideally lots of data

current practice:

word lists + expert annotations about cognacy (currently the dominant
paradigm)
unannotated word lists in phonetic transcriptions
discrete grammatical categorizations (compiled by human experts)

swadesh lists

collections of 100     200 concepts (there are di   erent versions)
core vocabulary:

not culture dependent
diachronically stable, i.e. resistant both against semantic change and
aginst borrowing

proposed by morris swadesh (swadesh, 1955, 1971) to facilitate an
early attempt to automatize certain tasks in historical linguistics
popular among computational historical linguistics because it is a
standard
see (list, 2016) for a thoughtful discussion of the notion of cognacy

cognates

cognates are words that have the same origin

latin    lius     french    ls, italian    glio

traditionally, cognacy excludes loanwords, but terminology among
computationalists is sometimes less strict:

latin persona     english person

would also qualify as cognate pair
on average, the closer two languages are related, the more cognate
pairs they share

cognates

during language change, the word for a given concept is sometimes
replaced by a non-cognate one
causes: semantic change, borrowing, morphological word formation
   bone   : old high german bein (cognate to engl. bone     new high
german knochen
bein is still part of the german lexicon, but it now means leg
cognate replacement is comparable to a mutation in biological
evolution

cognates

caveats

cognacy is not binary, but a matter of degree

english woman     old english wi   -man
   rst component is cognate to wife, german weib etc., and second
component to man, german mann etc. are woman and weib cognate
or not?

for distantly related languages, experts often disagree about cognacy
