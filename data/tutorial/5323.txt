ideally, we could infer the historical time since the latest common
ancestor for any pair of languages
not possible     at least not in a purely data-driven way
best we can hope for: estimate amount of linguistics change since
latest common ancestor
following the lead of bioinformatics, estimation is based on continuous
time markov process model
basic idea:

time is continuous
language change involves mutations of discrete characters
mutations can occur at any point in time
mutations in di   erent branches are stochastically independent

de   nition
a discrete time markov chain over a countable state space s is a function
from n into random variables x over s with the markov property
p(xn+1 = x|x1 = x1, x2 = x2, . . . , xn = xn) = p(xn+1 = x|xn = xn)
which is stationary:

   m, n : p(xn+1 = xi|xn = xj) = p(xm+1 = xi|xm = xj)

a dt markov chain with    nite state space is characterized by

its initial distribution x0, and
its transition matrix p, where

pij = p(xn+1 = xj|xn = xi)

p is a stochastic matrix, i.e.    i(cid:80)

we say i     j if there is a path (with positive probabilities in each
step) from xi to xj.
the symmetric closure of this relation, i     j, is an equivalence
relation. it partitions a markov chain into communicating classes.
a markov chain is irreducible i    it consists of a single communicating
class.
a state xi is recurrent i

if p is the transition matrix of a discrete time markov process, then so
is p n.
in other words, p n give the transition probabilities for a time interval
n.
generalization:

p (t) is transition matrix as a function of time t.
for discrete time: p (t) = p (1)t.

time reversibility

does not mean that a     b and b     a are equally likely.
rather, the condition is

  ap(t)ab =   bp(t)ba

  aqab =   bqba

this means that sampling an a from the equilibrium distribution and
observe a mutation to b in some interval t is as likely as sampling a b
in equilibrium and see it mutate into a after time t.

practical advantages of time reversibility:

if q is time reversible, the lower triangle can be computed from the

we assume that gain/loss of cognate classes follows continuous time
markov process, and that characters a stochastically independent.
both assumptions are clearly false:

markov assumption is violated due to language contact     borrowings
constitute mutations, but their id203 depends on the state of the
borrowing and the receiving language
gaining a cognate class for a given concept increases likelihood for loss
of di   erent class and vice versa (avoidance of lexical gaps and
synonymy)
. . .

for the time being, we will also assume that all cognate classes have
the same mutation rate. (omg!!!)
justi   cation: let   s start with the simplest model possible and re   ne it
step by step when necessary.

neighbor joining tree

data sparseness for nepali (only 31 characters are de   ned)     all
distances come out as way too small
note that root was determined by midpoint rooting to make it look
nicer
neighbor joining does not tell us anything about the location of the
root
tree structure is largely consistent with received opinion (except that
italian and french should swap places, and english is too high within
germanic)

cognacy data and grammatical/typological classi   cations rely on
expert judgments:
labor intensive
subjective, hard to replicate

sound change, a very conspicuous aspect of language change, is
ignored

discrete characters though

run the script loadnexusfiles.r in an interactive session
implement the dice distance. note that all characters with value    -    in
either of the vectors compared have to be ignored
computed the distance matrices for the three nexus    les, using the
estimates for s from the slides
compute the neighbor joining trees, using the function nj()
display the tree with the plot() command
experiment with di   erent values for s to get a feel for how sensitive
the result is for this parameter
