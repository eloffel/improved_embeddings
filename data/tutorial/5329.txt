why do we want to build a predicting function from the examples rather
than just implementing it?

why do we want to build a predicting function from the examples rather
than just implementing it?

often we don   t know how to write down the function

often a hand-written function isn   t complete

what is more expensive here: (acquiring accurate) knowledge or data?

we have a set of examples and we want to obtain an id136 scheme
to model our data: we want to generalise

our model is general enough if it can describe yet unseen examples
(with an acceptable error rate)

learning from data = inferring what we don   t know from what we know

standard)

for each instance in the test set, we compare the class predicted by
the classi   er with the class speci   ed in the gold standard

how do we measure performance?

when is a model good enough?

what is good enough?

upperbound: inter-annotator agreement

baseline: performance of basic, simple model
for example: assignment of most frequent class in data set

sense1 9/10 and sense2 1/10
sense1 6/10 and sense2 4/10
