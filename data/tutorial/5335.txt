(log-)likelihood of a tree

theory

this is essentially identical to sanko    algorithm for parsimony:

weight(i, j) = log p (lk)ij
weight matrix depends on branch length     needs to be recomputed for
each branch

overall likelihood for entire tree depends on id203 distribution on
root
if we assume that root node is in equilibrium:

l(tree) = (s, r)tl(root)

does not depend on location of the root (    time reversibility)
this is for one character     likelhood for all data is product of

tree search

theory

ml computation gives us likelihood of a tree topology, given data and
a model
ml tree:

heuristic search to    nd the topology maximizing likelihood
optimize branch lengths to maximize likelihood for that topology

computationally very demanding!
for the 25 taxa in our running example, ml tree search for the full
model requires several hours on a single processor; parallelization helps
ideally, one would want to do 24 heuristic tree searches, one for each
model speci   cation, and pick the tree+model with lowest aic
in practice one has to make compromises

ml is conceptually superior to mp (let alone distance methods)

di   erent mutation rates for di   erent characters are inferred from the
data
possibility of multiple mutations are taken into account     depending
on branch lengths
side e   ect of likelihood computation: id203 distribution over
character states at each internal node can be read o   

disadvantages:

computationally demanding
many parameter settings makes model selection di   cult
(note that the ultrametric trees in our example are sometimes better
even though they have higher aic)
ultrametric constraint makes branch lengths optimization
computationally more expensive     not feasible for larger data sets

what is ancestral state reconstruction?

while tree-building methods seek to    nd branching diagrams which
explain how a language family has evolved, asr methods use the
branching diagrams in order to explain what has evolved concretely.
ancestral state reconstruction is very common in evolutionary biology
but only spuriously practiced in computational historical linguistics
(bouchard-c  t   et al., 2013)
in classical historical linguistics, on the other hand, linguistic
reconstruction of proto-forms and proto-meanings is very common and
one of the main goals of the classical comparative method (fox 1995).

asr of lexical replacement patterns

if we look for words corresponding to one meaning in a wordlist and
know which of the words are cognate or not, we may ask which of the
word forms was the most likely candidate to be used in the
proto-language of all descendant languages.
this question resembles the task of    semantic reconstruction   , but in
contrast to classical semantic reconstruction, we are only operating
within one concept slot here, disregarding all words with a di   erent
meaning which may also be cognate with the words in our sample.
as a result of this restriction, it is quite likely that we cannot recover
the original form from our data.
it is, however, very interesting to see to which degree we can propose
a good candidate word form (cognate set) for the proto-language.

we evaluate the di   erences qualitatively by checking

the re   ection of the proposed root in the branches, especially with
semantically shifted word forms,
the likelihood of semantic shift of the given root with help of the
database of cross-linguistic colexi   cations (clics, list et al. 2013

thoroughly whether the cognate sets in the data are really re   exes of
the proposed pie root.

form in gs meant    water    in pie. although a shift from    water    to    river    is likely according
to clics, this meaning is an innovation in germanic. the asr form is re   ected across
multiple branches and a much better candidate.

form in gs is not re   ected in the standard literature (liv and lin), form in asr is re   ected
in the meaning    to rub, to bore   .

form in gs is only re   ected in few germanic languages, probably with a wrong cognate
assignment. following derksen (2008), assuming the gsr form is a much better candidate
for the pie word for    scratch   .

form in gs is a good pie root, but not necessarily with the meaning    skin   , as the meaning
of the re   exes di   ers greatly. the gsr form derives from a pie verb meaning    to cover   ,
but the cognate should not contain slavic words (derksen 2008).

the gs form is only re   ected in germanic. the asr form is a clear pie root, but the
meaning may also have been    to go   .

the asr form is a much better candidate for    water    in pie, due to its high number of
re   exes in all branches.

the gs form is only re   ected in romance in this meaning and as meaning    cloud    in hittite.
the asr form is a much better candidate, with a much more plausible connection between
re   exes meaning    shine    and    white   , as also con   rmed by clics.

the asr form is re   ected in more di   erent branches of pie, while the gs form is only
re   ected in germanic and romance.

form in gs meant    water    in pie. although a shift from    water    to    river    is likely according
to clics, this meaning is an innovation in germanic. the asr form is re   ected across
multiple branches and a much better candidate.

form in gs is not re   ected in the standard literature (liv and lin), form in asr is re   ected
in the meaning    to rub, to bore   .

form in gs is only re   ected in few germanic languages, probably with a wrong cognate
assignment. following derksen (2008), assuming the gsr form is a much better candidate
for the pie word for    scratch   .

form in gs is a good pie root, but not necessarily with the meaning    skin   , as the meaning
of the re   exes di   ers greatly. the gsr form derives from a pie verb meaning    to cover   ,
but the cognate should not contain slavic words (derksen 2008).

the gs form is only re   ected in germanic. the asr form is a clear pie root, but the
meaning may also have been    to go   .

the asr form is a much better candidate for    water    in pie, due to its high number of
re   exes in all branches.

the gs form is only re   ected in romance in this meaning and as meaning    cloud    in hittite.
the asr form is a much better candidate, with a much more plausible connection between
re   exes meaning    shine    and    white   , as also con   rmed by clics.

the asr form is re   ected in more di   erent branches of pie, while the gs form is only
re   ected in germanic and romance.

moon

this form would go back to a pie root meaning    to shine    and is often said to
have independently turned to mean    moon    in romance and slavic and other
branches. the shift from    shine    to    moon    is however not very likely (no evidence
in clics), so it is also possible that the word meant already    moon    in pie as
an epithet (vaan 2008).

the form has probably independently shifted from the original meaning    frost,
cold   , which is a very likely shift according to clics.

the root is present in this meaning in many subbranches and a good candidate
for pie in this meaning.

the root is a clear pie demonstrative (meier-brg  ger 2010), but the re   exes in
the daughter languages vary greatly, due to analogical levelling.

a very good candidate for the meaning with re   exes in greek, indo-iranian and
slavic.

this form is re   ected in old greek as a prohibitive negation and also recon-
structed as such. whether it was the normal negation in pie is less clear.

this form is mainly re   ected in latin and spuriously in indian and greek. it is
much more likely that it meant something else in pie and then shifted into this
meaning.

no need to reconstruct this form back to pie, since it is only re   ected in two
languages of romance.

this form has only re   exes in germanic languages. generally, the meaning    year   
is di   cult to reconstruct, due to the high potential for shift from    summer   ,
   winter   ,    time   , etc. as shown in clics.

good if not even better candidates than those which we found in the gold
standard. given the general and well-known uncertainties in semantic
reconstruction in classical historical linguistics, it seems that asr methods
could provide actual help in semantic reconstruction by providing objective
evolutionary scenarios for word evolution along a given tree which follow a
speci   c evolutionary model.
