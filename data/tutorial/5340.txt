computational semantics 

is about making 

id136s 

with the help of meanings. but what are meanings? 

the big idea of computational semantics 

       automate the process of associating semantic 
representations with expressions of natural language  

human 
language 
(ambiguous) 

logical 
language 
(unambiguous) 

       use logical representations of natural language to 
automate the process of drawing id136s
