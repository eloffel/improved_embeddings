    what does responsiveness mean here? 

    what do people do in dialogues? 

    dialogue as coordinated, joint action / as process. 

    grounding, turn-taking, etc. 

    state of the art in responsive conversational agents

spoken dialogue

    uses evanescent medium. 

    consists of spontaneously and autonomously 

produced contributions. 

    participants want to understand and be 

understood. 

    need to coordinate what they are doing.

b

turn-taking

    observations to account for: 

    overlaps are fairly rare in dialogue (less than 5%) 
    pauses between turns are very short (around 200ms) 

--- shorter than motor-planning of new utterance!

turn-taking

   

   

sacks et al. model (1974): 
at each transition-relevant-point (trp) of each 
turn, the following holds: 
1.

if during this turn the current speaker has selected a 
as the next speaker, then a must speak next. 
if the current speaker does not select the next speaker, 
any other speaker may take the next turn. 
if no one else takes the next turn, the current speaker 
may take the next turn.

2.

3.

turn-taking

    selection, how? 

    by asking a question, making a suggestion, etc... 
 

--> adjacency pairs 

 
 
 

a: who came to the party? 
b: <silence> 
a: what's up? did i say something wrong?

turn-taking 

    model  

    is projective, i.e. utterance itself indicates whether 

trp is coming up, and whether other speaker is 
selected, not "signal-reaction" model 

    can explain "significant silence" 

    although turn-taking works exactly the same 

way in non-visual modalities (on phone), if 
visual info is there, then gaze etc. give 
additional indications.

turn-taking

    holds only for "track-1" contributions: 
backchannels systematically overlap! 

    rules can be broken: competition for getting 

floor, upgrading, shouting matches...

presentation at a 
time 
* if it   s your turn, 
start asap.

our takeaways

    dialogue participants  

    try to reach mutual understanding; need 

evidence that they have 

    continuously monitor whether they have reached 

it 

    and, if necessary, repair asap; 

    so if you don   t react, you risk repair.

our takeaways

    why asap? 

    life   s too short! 

    responsiveness is built into the fabric of dialogue. 
    reducing it makes dialogue harder. (cf. eg. 

(brannigon et al. 2011)

responsive agents

    working de   nition:   

are responsive to the needs of the dialogue partner(s), at all times   
minimize time between event and response   
respond to many more types of events than    end of turn      
because they optimize mutual understanding 

    presentation events 
    understanding events 
    feedback responses 
    repair responses

    qs: 

    why? 
    how? 
    what type of events? 
    which types of responses? 
    who / what creates these events? 
    does an event have to have occurred to respond to it? 
    what are the optimization criteria?
