principles

     coherent texts consist of minimal units, which are linked to 

each other, recursively, through rhetorical relations
(cid:131) rhetorical relations also known, in other theories, as 

coherence or discourse relations

     coherent texts do not show gaps or non-sequiturs

(cid:131) therefore, there must be some relation holding among the 

different parts of the text

4

components

     units of discourse

(cid:131) texts can be segmented into minimal units, or spans

     nuclearity

(cid:131) some spans are more central to the text   s purpose 
(nuclei), whereas others are secondary (satellites)

(cid:131) based on hypotactic and paratactic relations in language

     relations among spans

(cid:131) spans are joined into discourse relations

     hierarchy/recursion

(cid:131) spans that are in a discourse relation may enter into 

new relations

5

paratactic (coordinate)
     at the sub-sentential level (traditional coordinated 

clauses)
(cid:131) peel oranges, and slice crosswise.

     but also across sentences

(cid:131) 1. peel oranges, 2. and slice crosswise. 3. arrange in a 
bowl 4. and sprinkle with rum and coconut. 5. chill until 
ready to serve.

6

hypotactic (subordinate)

     sub-sentential concession 

relation

     concession across 

sentences
(cid:131) nucleus (spans 2-3) 

made up of two spans in 
an antithesis relation

7

relations

     they hold between two non-overlapping text 

spans

     most of the relations hold between a nucleus and 
a satellite, although there are also multi-nuclear 
relations

     a relation consists of:

1. constraints on the nucleus,
2. constraints on the satellite,
3. constraints on the combination of nucleus and satellite,
4. the effect.

8

example: evidence

     constraints on the nucleus

(cid:131) the reader may not believe n to a degree satisfactory to the 

writer

     constraints on the satellite

(cid:131) the reader believes s or will find it credible

     constraints on the combination of n+s

(cid:131) the reader   s comprehending s increases their belief of n

     effect (the intention of the writer)

(cid:131) the reader   s belief of n is increased

     assuming a written text and readers and writers; extensions of rst to 

spoken language discussed later

     definitions of most common relations are available from the rst web site 

(www.sfu.ca/rst)

9

relation types

     relations are of different types

(cid:131) subject matter: they relate the content of the text spans

    cause, purpose, condition, summary

(cid:131) presentational: more rhetorical in nature. they are 

meant to achieve some effect on the reader
    motivation, antithesis, background, evidence

10

other possible classifications

     relations that hold outside the text

(cid:131) condition, cause, result
vs. those that are only internal to the text
(cid:131) summary, elaboration

     relations frequently marked by a discourse marker

(cid:131) concession (although, however); condition (if, in case)
vs. relations that are rarely, or never, marked
(cid:131) background, restatement, interpretation

     preferred order of spans: nucleus before satellite

(cid:131) elaboration     usually first the nucleus (material being elaborated on) 

and then satellite (extra information)

vs. satellite-nucleus
(cid:131) concession     usually the satellite (the although-type clause or span) 

before the nucleus

          enablement 
          motivation

          concession 
condition and otherwise 
          condition 
           otherwise

other classifications are possible, and longer and shorter lists have been 
proposed

     they specify how spans of text can co-occur, 

determining possible rst text structures

graphical representation

     a horizontal line 

covers a span of text 
(possibly made up of 
further spans

     a vertical line signals 
the nucleus or nuclei
     a curve represents a 

relation, and the 
direction of the arrow, 
the direction of 
satellite towards 
nucleus

14

how to do an rst analysis

1.  divide the text into units

     unit size may vary, depending on the goals of the analysis
     typically, units are clauses (but not complement clauses)

2.  examine each unit, and its neighbours. is there a clear relation 

holding between them?

3.  if yes, then mark that relation (e.g., condition)
4.  if not, the unit might be at the boundary of a higher-level 

relation. look at relations holding between larger units (spans)

5.  continue until all the units in the text are accounted for
6.  remember, marking a relation involves satisfying all 4 fields 

(especially the effect). the effect is the plausible intention that 
the text creator had.

15

some issues

     problems in identifying relations

(cid:131) judgments are plausibility judgments. two analysts might 

differ in their analyses

     definitions of units

(cid:131) vary from researcher to researcher, depending on the level of 

granularity needed
     relations inventory

(cid:131) many available
(cid:131) each researcher tends to create their own, but large ones tend 

to be unmanageable

     a theory purely of intentions

(cid:131) in contrast with grosz and sidner   s (1986), it does not relate 
structure of discourse to attentional state. on the other hand, 
it provides a much richer set of relations.
