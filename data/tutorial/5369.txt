introductory guide on id135 for (aspiring) data scientists

introduction

   optimization is the way of life. we all have finite resources and time
   and we want to make the most of them. from using your time productively
   to solving supply chain problems for your company     everything uses
   optimization. it   s a especially interesting and relevant topic in
   [97]data science.

   it is also a very interesting topic     it starts with simple problems,
   but can get very complex. for example, sharing a chocolate between
   siblings is a simple optimization problem. we don   t think
   in mathematical term while solving it. on the other hand devising
   inventory and warehousing strategy for an e-tailer can be very complex.
   millions of skus with different popularity in different regions to be
   delivered in defined time and resources     you see what i mean!

   id135 (lp) is one of the simplest ways to perform
   optimization. it helps you solve some very complex optimization
   problems by making a few simplifying assumptions. as an analyst you are
   bound to come across applications and problems to be solved by linear
   programming.

   for some reason, lp doesn   t get as much attention as it deserves while
   [98]learning data science. so, i thought let me do justice to this
   awesome technique. i decided to write an article which explains linear
   programming in simple english. i have kept the content as simple as
   possible. the idea is to get you started and excited about linear
   programming.


table of content

    1. what is id135?
          + basic terminologies
          + process to define a lp problem
    2. solve linear program by graphical method
    3. solve linear program using opensolver
    4. simplex method
    5. northwest corner method and least cost method
    6. applications of id135


1.what is id135?

   now, what is id135? id135 is a simple
   technique where we depict complex relationships through linear
   functions and then find the optimum points. the important word in
   previous sentence is depict. the real relationships might be much more
   complex     but we can simplify them to linear relationships.

   applications of id135 are every where around you. you use
   id135 at personal and professional fronts. you are using
   id135 when you are driving from home to work and want to
   take the shortest route. or when you have a project delivery you make
   strategies to make your team work efficiently for on time delivery.

example of a id135 problem

   let   s say a fedex delivery man has 6 packages to deliver in a day. the
   warehouse is located at point a. the 6 delivery destinations are given
   by u, v, w, x, y and z. the numbers on the lines indicate the distance
   between the cities. to save on fuel and time the delivery person wants
   to take the shortest route.

   [pic-4.png]

   so, the delivery person will calculate different routes for going to
   all the 6 destinations and then come up with the shortest route. this
   technique of choosing the shortest route is called id135.

   in this case, the objective of the delivery person is to deliver the
   parcel on time at all 6 destinations. the process of choosing the best
   route is called operation research. operation research is an approach
   to decision-making, which involves a set of methods to operate a
   system. in the above example, my system was the delivery model.

   id135 is used for obtaining the most optimal solution for
   a problem with given constraints. in id135, we formulate
   our real life problem into a mathematical model. it involves an
   objective function, linear inequalities with subject to constraints.

   is the linear representation of the 6 points above representative of
   real world? yes and no. it is oversimplification as the real route
   would not be a straight line. it would likely have multiple turns, u
   turns, signals and traffic jams. but with a simple assumption, we have
   reduced the complexity of the problem drastically and are creating a
   solution which should work in most scenarios.


formulating a problem     let   s manufacture some chocolates

   example: consider a chocolate manufacturing company which produces only
   two types of chocolate     a and b. both the chocolates require milk and
   choco only.  to manufacture each unit of a and b, following quantities
   are required:
     * each unit of a requires 1 unit of milk and 3 units of choco
     * each unit of b requires 1 unit of milk and 2 units of choco

   the company kitchen has a total of 5 units of milk and 12 units of
   choco. on each sale, the company makes a profit of
     * rs 6 per unit a sold
     * rs 5 per unit b sold.

   now, the company wishes to maximize its profit. how many units of a and
   b should it produce respectively?

   solution: the first thing i   m gonna do is represent the problem in a
   tabular form for better understanding.
         milk choco profit per unit
   a     1    3      rs 6
   b     1    2      rs 5
   total 5    12


   let the total number of units produced of a be = x

   let the total number of units produced of b be = y

   now, the total profit is represented by z

   the total profit the company makes is given by the total number of
   units of a and b produced multiplied by its per unit profit rs 6 and rs
   5 respectively.

   profit: max z = 6x+5y

   which means we have to maximize z.

   the company will try to produce as many units of a and b to maximize
   the profit. but the resources milk and choco are available in limited
   amount.

   as per the above table, each unit of a and b requires 1 unit of milk.
   the total amount of milk available is 5 units. to represent this
   mathematically,

   x+y     5

   also, each unit of a and b requires 3 units & 2 units of choco
   respectively. the total amount of choco available is 12 units. to
   represent this mathematically,

   3x+2y     12

   also, the values for units of a can only be integers.

   so we have two more constraints, x     0  &  y     0

   for the company to make maximum profit, the above inequalities have to
   be satisfied.

   this is called formulating a real-world problem into a mathematical
   model.


common terminologies used in id135

   let us define some terminologies used in id135 using the
   above example.
     * decision variables: the decision variables are the variables which
       will decide my output. they represent my ultimate solution. to
       solve any problem, we first need to identify the decision
       variables. for the above example, the total number of units for
       a and b denoted by x & y respectively are my decision variables.
     * objective function: it is defined as the objective of making
       decisions. in the above example, the company wishes to increase the
       total profit represented by z. so, profit is my objective function.
     * constraints: the constraints are the restrictions or limitations on
       the decision variables. they usually limit the value of the
       decision variables. in the above example, the limit on the
       availability of resources milk and choco are my constraints.
     * non-negativity restriction: for all linear programs, the decision
       variables should always take non-negative values. which means the
       values for decision variables should be greater than or equal to 0.

process to formulate a id135 problem

   let us look at the steps of defining a id135 problem
   generically:
    1. identify the decision variables
    2. write the objective function
    3. mention the constraints
    4. explicitly state the non-negativity restriction

   for a problem to be a id135 problem, the decision
   variables, objective function and constraints all have to be linear
   functions.

   if the all the three conditions are satisfied, it is called a linear
   programming problem.


2. solve linear programs by graphical method

   a linear program can be solved by multiple methods. in this section, we
   are going to look at the graphical method for solving a linear program.
   this method is used to solve a two variable linear program. if you have
   only two decision variables, you should use the graphical method to
   find the optimal solution.

   a graphical method involves formulating a set of linear inequalities
   subject to the constraints. then the inequalities are plotted on a x-y
   plane. once we have plotted all the inequalities on a graph the
   intersecting region gives us a feasible region. the feasible region
   explains what all values our model can take. and it also gives us the
   optimal solution.

   let   s understand this with the help of an example.

   example: a farmer has recently acquired an 110 hectares piece of land.
   he has decided to grow wheat and barley on that land. due to the
   quality of the sun and the region   s excellent climate, the entire
   production of wheat and barley can be sold. he wants to know how to
   plant each variety in the 110 hectares, given the costs, net profits
   and labor requirements according to the data shown below:
   variety cost (price/hec)  net profit (price/hec)  man-days/hec
   wheat   100               50                      10
   barley  200               120                     30

   the farmer has a budget of us$10,000 and an availability of 1,200
   man-days during the planning horizon. find the optimal solution and the
   optimal value.

   solution: to solve this problem, first we gonna formulate our linear
   program.

formulation of linear problem

   step 1: identify the decision variables

   the total area for growing wheat = x (in hectares)

   the total area for growing barley  = y (in hectares)

   x and y are my decision variables.


   step 2: write the objective function

   since the production from the entire land can be sold in the market.
   the farmer would want to maximize the profit for his total produce. we
   are given net profit for both wheat and barley. the farmer earns a net
   profit of us$50 for each hectare of wheat and us$120 for each barley.

   our objective function (given by z) is, max z = 50x + 120y


   step 3: writing the constraints

   1. it is given that the farmer has a total budget of us$10,000. the
   cost of producing wheat and barley per hectare is also given to us. we
   have an upper cap on the total cost spent by the farmer. so our
   equation becomes:

   100x + 200y     10,000

   2. the next constraint is, the upper cap on the availability on the
   total number of man-days for planning horizon. the total number of
   man-days available are 1200. as per the table, we are given the
   man-days per hectare for wheat and barley.

   10x + 30y     1200

   3. the third constraint is the total area present for plantation. the
   total available area is 110 hectares. so the equation becomes,

   x + y     110


   step 4: the non-negativity restriction

   the values of x and y will be greater than or equal to 0. this goes
   without saying.

   x     0, y     0

   we have formulated our linear program. it   s time to solve it.

solving a lp through graphical method

   since we know that x, y     0. we will consider only the first quadrant.

   to plot for the graph for the above equations, first i will simplify
   all the equations.

   100x + 200y     10,000 can be simplified to x + 2y     100 by dividing by
   100.

   10x + 30y     1200 can be simplified to x + 3y     120 by dividing by 10.

   the third equation is in its simplified form, x + y     110.

   plot the first 2 lines on a graph in first quadrant (like shown below)

   the optimal feasible solution is achieved at the point of intersection
   where the budget & man-days constraints are active. this means the
   point at which the equations x + 2y     100 and x + 3y     120 intersect
   gives us the optimal solution.

   the values for x and y which gives the optimal solution is at (60,20).

   to maximize profit the farmer should produce wheat and barley in 60
   hectares and 20 hectares of land respectively.

   the maximum profit the company will gain is,

   max z = 50 * (60) + 120 * (20)

   =  us$5400

3. solve linear program using opensolver

   in reality, a linear program can contain 30 to 1000 variables and
   solving it either graphically or algebraically is next to impossible.
   companies generally use opensolver to tackle these real-world problems.
   here i am gonna take you through steps to solve a linear program using
   opensolver.

   opensolver is an open source linear and optimizer for microsoft excel.
   it is an advanced version of built-in excel solver. you can download
   opensolver [99]here and follow the installation [100]manual.

   i want you to get a hands-on knowledge on using opensolver. so, for
   clear understanding, i will explain it using an example.

   example: below there is a diet chart which gives me calories, protien,
   carbohydrate and fat content for 4 food items. sara wants a diet with
   minimum cost. the diet chart is as follows:
                             food item 1  food item 2  food item 3  food item 4
   calories                  400          200          150          500
   protien (in grams)        3            2            0            0
   carbohydrates ( in grams) 2            2            4            4
   fat (in grams)            2            4            1            5
   cost                      $0.50        $0.20        $0.30       $0.80

   the chart gives the nutrient content as well as the per-unit cost of
   each food item. the diet has to be planned in such a way that it should
   contain at least 500 calories, 6 grams of protien, 10 grams of
   carbohydrates and 8 grams of fat.

   solution: first, i   m gonna formulate my linear program in a
   spreadsheet.
     * step 1: identify the decision variables. here my decision variables
       are the food items. add the headers. for  trial purpose, we are
       entering arbitrary values. let   s say, sara consumes 3 units of food
       item 1, 0 unit of food item 2, 1  unit of food item 3 and 0 unit of
       food item 4. these are called variable cells.

   [dp_12.png]
     * step 2: now we will write our objective function. for the diet to
       be optimal we must have minimum cost along with required calories,
       protein, carbohydrate and fat.

   [dp_21.png]

   in cell b7:e7  we take the reference the number of units. and in cell
   b8:e8 we put the per-unit cost of each food items.

   in cell b10, we want the total cost for the diet. the total cost is
   given by the sumproduct of number of units eaten and per unit cost.
   sumproduct is given by = b7*b8+c7*c8+d7*d8+e7*e8. let   s see this in a
   spreadsheet.

   [dp_31.png]
     * step 3: now, we will enter the constraints.  column f contains the
       total of calories, protien, carbohydrate and fat. the total number
       of calorie intake in given by sumproduct the number of food items
       eaten and the calorie consumed per food item. for cell f13=
       sumprodcut($b$7:$f$7, b13:f13). similarly for others. column g
       gives the inequality, since the problem demands calories, protien,
       carbohydrate and fat to be atleast 500, 6, 10 and 8 respectively.
       column h gives the required nutrient content.

   [dp_41.png]
     * step 4: now, we will enter the linear program into the solver. now,
       once you have installed opensolver. when you click on the data tab,
       on the right you will see model. click on model, then enter the
       values one by one. first, we will enter the objective function,$b10
       i.e  in objective cell. select minimise because we want to minimize
       the diet cost.

   [os_1.png]
     * step 5: now enter the decision variables in the variable cells.

   [os_2.png]
     * step 6: now, we will add the constraints. the first constraint is
       f13      h13. add all the constraints one by one.

   [os_3.png]
     * step 7: now, you have to enter one important constraint. the
       non-negativity restriction. all the decision variables will be
       greater than 0.

   [os_4-1.png]
     * step 8: now, click on save model to finish the modeling process.
       once you save the model, it will look something like this.

   [dp_5.png]
     * step 9: once the model is saved click on data tab then click solve.
       the optimal solution and values are displayed in the corresponding
       cells. the optimal minimum cost is us$0.90. sara should consume 3
       units of food item 2 and 1 unit of food item 3 for the required
       nutrient content at the minimum cost. this is solves our linear
       program.

   [dp_6.png]


4. simplex method

   simplex method is one of the most powerful & popular methods for linear
   programming. simplex method is an iterative procedure for getting the
   most feasible solution. in this method, we keep transforming the value
   of basic variables to get maximum value for the objective function.

   a id135 function is in its standard form if it seeks to
   maximize the objective function.  [image-8.png] subject to constraints,
   [image-9.png] [image-10.png]

   .                 .                 .                 .
   .              .

   .                 .                 .                  .
   .             .

   [image-112.png]

   where,  [image-121.png]  and  [image-13.png] . after adding slack
   variables, the corresponding system of constraint equation is,

   [image-14.png]

   [image-15.png]

   .                                    .
         .                    .

   [image-161.png] where,  [image-17.png]

   the variables,                      .  are called slack variables. they are
   non-negative numbers which are added to remove the inequalities from an
   equation.

   the above explanation gives the theoretical explanation of simplex
   method. now, i am gonna explain how to use simplex method in real life
   using excel.

   example: the advertising alternatives for a company include television,
   newspaper and radio advertisements. the cost for each medium with their
   audience coverage is given below.
                              television  newspaper  radio
   cost per advertisement ($) 2000        600        300
   audience per advertisement 100,000     40,000     18,000

   the local newspaper limits the number of advertisements from a single
   company to ten. moreover, in order to balance the advertising among the
   three types of media, no more than half of the total number of
   advertisements should occur on the radio. and at least 10% should occur
   on television. the weekly advertising budget is $18,200. how many
   advertisements should be run in each of the three types of media to
   maximize the total audience?

   solution: first i am going to formulate my problem for a clear
   understanding.


   step 1: identify decision variables

   let [image-212.png] , [image-27.png]  ,  [image-231.png]    represent
   the total number of ads for television, newspaper, and radio
   respectively.


   step 2: objective function

   the objective of the company is to maximize the audience. the objective
   function is given by:

   [image-241.png]


   step 3: write down the constraints

   now, i will mention each constraint one by one.

   it is clearly given that we have a budget constraint. the total budget
   which can be allocated is $18,200. and the individual costs per
   television, newspaper and radio advertisement is $2000, $600 and $300
   respectively. this can be represented by the equation,

   [image-28.png]

   since for a newspaper advertisement, there is an upper cap on the
   number of advertisements to 10. my first constraints is,
   [image-26.png]

   the next constraint is the number of advertisements on television. the
   company wants at least 10% of the total advertisements to be on
   television. so, it can be represented as:

   [image-29.png]

   the last constraint is the number of advertisements on the radio cannot
   be more than half of the total number of advertisements. it can be
   represented as

   [image-30.png]

   now, i have formulated my id135 problem. we are using
   simplex method to solve this. i will take you through simplex method
   one by one.

   to reiterate all the constraints are as follows. i have simplified the
   last two equations to bring them in standard form.

   [image-28.png]

   [image-26.png] [image-35.png]

   [image-36.png]

   we have a total of 4 equations. to balance out each equation, i am
   introducing 4 slack variables,   ,   and .

   so our equations are as follows:

   [image-39.png]

   [image-41.png]

   [image-40.png]

   [image-38.png]

   i hope now you are available to make sense of the entire advertising
   problem. all the above equations, are only for your better
   understanding. now if you solve these equations, you will get the
   values for x1= 4, x2= 10 and x3= 14.

   on solving the objective function you will get the maximum weekly
   audience as 1,052,000. you can follow the [101]tutorial here to solve
   the equation. to solve linear program in excel, follow this
   [102]tutorial.


5. northwest corner method and least cost method

5.1 northwest corner method

   northwest corner method is a special type method used for
   transportation problems in id135. it is used to calculate
   the feasible solution for transporting commodities from one place to
   another. whenever you are given a real-world problem, which involves
   supply and demand from one source of different source. the data model
   includes the following:
     * the level of supply and demand at each source is given
     * the unit transportation of a commodity from each source to each
       destination

   the model assumes that there is only one commodity. the demand for
   which can come from different sources. the objective is to fulfill the
   total demand with minimum transportation cost. the model is based on
   the hypothesis that the total demand is equal to the total supply, i.e
   the model is balanced. let   s understand this with the help of an
   example.

   example: consider there are 3 silos which are required to satisfy the
   demand from 4 mills. (a silo is a storage area of farm used to store
   grain and mill is a grinding factory for grains).

   [sd1.png]

   solution: let   s understand what the above table explains.

   the cost of transportation from silo i to mill j is given by the cost
   in each cell corresponding to the supply from  each silo 1 and the
   demand at each mill. for example: the cost of transporting from silo 1
   to mill 1 is $10, from silo 3 to mill 5 is $18. it is also given the
   total demand & supply for mill and silos. the objective is to find the
   minimal transportation cost such that the demand for all the mills is
   satisfied.

   as the name suggests northwest corner method is a method of allocating
   the units starting from the topleft cell. the demand for mill 1 is 5
   and silo 1 has a total supply of 15. so, 5 units can be allocated to
   mill1 at a cost of $10 per unit.the demand for mill1 is met. then we
   move to top left cell of mill 2. the demand for mill 2 is 15 units,
   which it can get 10 units from silo 1 at a cost of $2 per unit and 5
   units from silo 2 at a cost of $7 per unit. then we move onto mill 3,
   the northwest cell is s2m3. the demand for mill 3 is 15 units, which it
   can get from silo 2 at a cost of $9 per unit. moving on to the last
   mill, mill  4 has a demand of 15 units. it will get 5 units from a silo
   2 at a cost of $20 per unit and 10 units from silo 3 at a cost of $18
   per unit.

   the total cost of transportation is = 5*10+(2*10+7*5)+9*15+(20*5+18*10)
   = $520

   [image-51.png]


5.2 least cost method

   least cost method is another method to calculate the most feasible
   solution for a id135 problem. this method derives more
   accurate result than northwest corner method. it is used for
   transportation and manufacturing problems. to keep it simple i am
   explaining the above transportation problem.

   [image-53.png]

   according to the least cost method, you start from the cell containing
   the least unit cost for transportation. so, for the above problem, i
   supply 5 units from silo 3 at per unit cost of $4. the demand for mill1
   is met. for mill 2, we supply 15 units from silo 1 at per unit cost of
   $2. then for mill 3 we supply 15 units from silo 2 at per unit cost of
   $9. then for mill 4 we supply 10 units from silo 2 at per unit cost of
   $20 and 5 units from silo 3 a $18 per unit. the total transportation
   costs is $475.

   well the above method explains we can optimize our costs further with
   the best method. let   s check this using excel solver. solver is an
   in-built add-on in microsoft excel. it   s an add-in plug available in
   excel. go to file->options->add-ins->select solver->click on
   manage->select solver->click ok. your solver is now added in excel. you
   can check it under the data tab.

   the first thing i am gonna do is enter my data in excel. after entering
   the data in excel, i have calculated the total of c3:f3. similarly for
   others. this is done to take the total demand from silo 1 and others.

   [image-45.png]

   after this, i am gonna break my model into two. the first table gives
   me the units supplied and the second table gives me the unit cost.

   [image-46.png]

   now, i am calculating my total cost which will be given by sumproduct
   of unit cost and units supplied.

   [image-47.png]

   now i am gonna use solver to compute my model. similar to the above
   method. add the objective function, variable cells, constraints.

   [image-481.png]

   now your model is ready to be solved. click on solve and you will get
   your optimal cost. the minimum transportation cost is $435.

7. applications of id135

   id135 and optimization are used in various industries.
   manufacturing and service industry uses id135 on a regular
   basis. in this section, we are going to look at the various
   applications of id135.
    1. manufacturing industries use id135 for analyzing their
       supply chain operations. their motive is to maximize efficiency
       with minimum operation cost. as per the recommendations from the
       id135 model, the manufacturer can reconfigure their
       storage layout, adjust their workforce and reduce the bottlenecks.
       here is a small warehouse case study of cequent a us base company,
       watch this [103]video for a more clear understanding.
    2. id135 is also used in organized retail for shelf space
       optimization. since the number of products in the market have
       increased in leaps and bounds, it is important to understand what
       does the customer want. optimization is aggressively used in stores
       like walmart, hypercity, reliance, big bazaar, etc. the products in
       the store are placed strategically keeping in mind the customer
       shopping pattern. the objective is to make it easy for a customer
       to locate & select the right products. this is with subject to
       constraints like limited shelf space, the variety of products, etc.
    3. optimization is also used for optimizing delivery routes. this is
       an extension of the popular traveling salesman problem. service
       industry uses optimization for finding the best route for multiple
       salesmen traveling to multiple cities. with the help of id91
       and greedy algorithm the delivery routes are decided by companies
       like fedex, amazon, etc. the objective is to minimize the operation
       cost and time.
    4. optimizations is also used in machine learning. supervised learning
       works on the fundamental of id135. a system is trained
       to fit on a mathematical model of a function from the labeled input
       data that can predict values from an unknown test data.

   well, the applications of id135 don   t end here. there are
   many more applications of id135 in real-world like applied
   by shareholders, sports, stock markets, etc. go on and explore further.


end notes

   i hope you enjoyed reading this article. i have tried to explain all
   the basic concepts under id135. if you have any doubts or
   questions feel free to post them in the comments section.

   i have explained each concept with real life example. i want you to try
   them at your end and get hands-on experience. let me know what you
