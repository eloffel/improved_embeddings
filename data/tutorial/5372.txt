salesforce is using ai to democratize sql so anyone can query databases in
natural language

   sql is about as easy as it gets in the world of programming, and yet
   its learning curve is still steep enough to prevent many people from
   interacting with id208. [7]salesforce   s ai research team
   took it upon itself to explore how machine learning might be able to
   open doors for those without knowledge of sql.

   their recent [8]paper, seq2sql: generating structured queries
   from natural language using id23, builds on sequence
   to sequence models typically employed in machine translation. a
   id23 twist allowed the team to obtain promising
   results translating natural language database queries into sql.

   in practice this means that you could simply ask who the winningest
   team in college football is and an appropriate database could be
   automatically queried to tell you that it is in fact the university of
   michigan.

      we don   t actually have just one way of writing a query the correct
   way,    victor zhong, one of the salesforce researchers who worked on the
   project, explained to me in an interview.    if i give a natural language
   question, there might be two or three ways to write the query. we use
   id23 to encourage use of queries that obtain same
   result.   

   you can imagine how machine translation problems can quickly become
   massively complex with large vocabularies. the more you can limit the
   number of possible translations for each missing word, the simpler your
   problem becomes. to this avail, salesforce opted to limit its
   vocabulary to words used in database labels, the words in the question
   being asked and the words typically used in sql queries.

   the idea of democratizing sql isn   t new. startups like cleargraph,
   which was recently acquired by tableau, have made it their business to
   open up data with english rather than sql.

      some models perform execution on a database itself,    added zhong.    but
   there   s potential privacy concerns if you   re asking a question about
   social security numbers.   

   outside of the paper itself, salesforce   s biggest contribution here
   comes in the form of the wikisql data set it constructed to aid in
   building its model. first html tables were collected from wikipedia.
   these tables became the basis for randomly generated sql queries. these
   queries were used to form questions that were then passed off to humans
   for id141 over amazon mechanical turk. each id141 was
   verified twice with additional human guidance. the resulting data set
   is the largest such data set in existence.
