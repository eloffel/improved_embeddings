deepl schools other online translators with clever machine learning

   tech giants [8]google, microsoft and facebook are all applying the
   lessons of machine learning to translation, [9]but a small company
   called deepl has outdone them all and raised the bar for the field. its
   translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition, but more
   accurate and nuanced than any we   ve tried.

   i only speak a smattering of french in addition to my passable english,
   but luckily my colleague frederic is a man of many tongues. we both
   agreed that [10]deepl   s translations were generally superior to those
   from google translate and bing.

   take, for example, the following passage from a german news article, as
   rendered by deepl (top) and google:

   as frederic puts it:    whereas google translate often goes for a very
   literal translation that misses some nuances and idioms (or gets the
   translation of these idioms dead wrong), deepl often provides a more
   natural translation that comes closer to that of a trained translator.   

   the second sentence is parsed more naturally; the measure is    designed
   to    accomplish something rather than just doing that thing; the police
   are    on the road in armoured vehicles    as opposed to merely on them;
      martial appearance    may be imperfect (though inspired) but it   s far
   better than the nonsensical    fighters    turmoil   had come to the fore.   

   a few tests of my own on some french literature i know well enough to
   judge had deepl coming out on top regularly, as well. fewer errors of
   tense, intent and agreement, plus a better understanding and deployment
   of idiom make for a much more readable translation. we thought so, and
   so did translators in deepl   s own blind testing. but don   t take anyone
   else   s word for it     [11]test it out yourself.

   while it   s true that meaning can be conveyed successfully despite
   errors of that class, as evidenced by the utility we   ve all found in
   even the poorest machine translations, it   s far from guaranteed that
   anything but the barest facts of will make it through.

linguee evolved

   deepl was born from the similarly excellent linguee, a translation tool
   that has existed for years and, while popular, never quite reached the
   level of google translate     the latter has a huge advantage in brand
   and position, after all. linguee   s co-founder, gereon frahling, used to
   work for google research but left in 2007 to pursue this new venture.

   the team has been working with machine learning for years, for tasks
   adjacent to the core translation, but it was only last year that they
   began working in earnest on a whole new system and company, both of
   which would bear the name deepl.

   in an email, frahling told me that the time was ripe:    we have built a
   neural translation network that incorporates most of the latest
   developments, to which we added our own ideas.   

   an enormous database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a
   method of ground-truthing translations by searching for similar
   snippets on the web, made for a strong base in the training of the new
   model. they also put together what they claim is the 23rd most powerful
   supercomputer in the world, conveniently located in iceland.

   developments published by universities, research agencies and indeed
   linguee   s competitors showed that convolutional neural networks were
   the way to go, rather than the recurrent neural networks the company
   had been using previously. now isn   t really the place to go into the
   differences between id98s and id56s, so it must suffice to say that for
   accurate translation of long, complex strings of related words, the
   former is a better bet as long as you can control for its weaknesses.

   for example, a id98 could roughly be able to be said to tackle one word
   of the sentence at a time. this becomes a problem when, for instance,
   as commonly happens, a word at the end of the sentence determines how a
   word at the beginning of the sentence should be formed. it   s wasteful
   to go through the whole sentence only to find that the first word the
   network picked is wrong, and then start over with that knowledge, so
   deepl and others in the machine learning field apply    attention
   mechanisms    that monitor for such potential trip-ups and resolve them
   before the id98 moves on to the next word or phrase.

   there are other secret techniques in play, of course, and their result
   is a translation tool that i personally plan to make my new default. i
   look forward to seeing the others step up their game.
