this article is an addendum to the series [12]machine learning for humans         , a
guide for getting up-to-speed on machine learning concepts in 2-3 hours.

general advice on crafting a curriculum

   going to school for a formal degree program for isn   t always possible
   or desirable. for those considering an autodidactic alternative, this
   is for you.

   1. build foundations, and then specialize in areas of interest.

   you can   t go deeply into every machine learning topic. there   s too much
   to learn, and the field is advancing rapidly. master foundational
   concepts and then focus on projects in a specific domain of
   interest         whether it   s natural language understanding, computer
   vision, deep id23, robotics, or whatever else.

   2. design your curriculum around topics that personally excite you.

   motivation is far more important than micro-optimizing a learning
   strategy for some long-term academic or career goal. if you   re having
   fun, you   ll make fast progress. if you   re trying to force yourself
   forward, you   ll slow down.
we   ve included resources that we explored personally or came highly recommended.
 this list is not meant to be exhaustive. there are endless options, and too muc
h choice is counterproductive. but if we   re missing a great resource that belong
s here, please [13]reach out!

        you take the blue pill, the story ends. you wake up in your bed and
     believe whatever you want to believe. you take the red pill, you
     stay in wonderland, and i show you how deep the rabbit hole
     goes.            morpheus
