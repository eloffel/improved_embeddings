exploratory data analysis in python

pycon 2016 tutorial  |  june 8th, 2017

   earlier this year, we wrote about the value of exploratory data
   analysis and [9]why you should care. in that post, we covered at a very
   high level what exploratory data analysis (eda) is, and the reasons
   both the data scientist and business stakeholder should find it
   critical to the success of their analytical projects. however, that
   post may have left you wondering: how do i do eda myself?

   last month, my fellow senior data scientist, jonathan whitmore, and i
   taught a tutorial at [10]pycon titled [11]exploratory data analysis in
   python   you can watch it [12]here. in this post, we will summarize the
   objectives and contents of the tutorial, and then provide instructions
   for following along so you can begin developing your own eda skills.

tutorial objectives

   our objectives for this tutorial were to help those attending:
    1. develop the eda mindset by walking through a questions to ask
       yourself through the various stages of exploration and pointing out
       things to watch out for
    2. learn how to invoke some basic eda methods effectively, in order to
       understand datasets and prepare for more advanced analysis. these
       basic methods include:
          + slicing and dicing
          + calculating summary statistics
          + basic plotting for numerical and categorical data
          + basic visualization of geospatial data on maps
          + using jupyter notebook widgets for interactive exploration

   we view eda very much like a tree: there is a basic series of steps you
   perform every time you perform eda (the main trunk of the tree) but at
   each step, observations will lead you down other avenues (branches) of
   exploration by raising questions you want to answer or hypotheses you
   want to test.

   which branches you pursue will depend on what is interesting or
   pertinent to you. as such, the actual exploration you do while
   following along on this tutorial will be yours. we have no answers or
   set of conclusions we think you should come to about the datasets. our
   goal is simply to aid in making your exploration as effective as
   possible, and to let you have the fun of choosing which branches to
   follow.

tutorial outline

   the talk consists of the following:
    1. introduction to exploratory data analysis: i summarize the
       motivation for eda and our general strategy that we dive deeper
       into throughout the tutorial.
    2. introduction to jupyter notebooks: our tutorial entails working
       through a series of jupyter notebooks and so jonathan gives a quick
       introduction to using them for those who haven   t seen them before.
       we even learn a new trick from an attendee!
    3. exploratory analysis of the [13]redcard dataset: jonathan works
       through an exploratory analysis of a dataset that comes from a
       [14]fascinating paper published with commentary [15]in nature. the
       core question of the paper is reflected in the title,    many
       analysts, one dataset: making transparent how variations in
       analytical choices affect results   . the authors recruited around 30
       analytic teams who were each tasked with the same research
       question:    are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to
       dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?    and given
       the same data. the dataset came from the players who played in the
       2012   13 european football (soccer) professional leagues. data about
       the players    ages, heights, weights, position, skintone rating, and
       more were included. the results from the teams were then compared
       to see how the different ways of looking at the dataset yielded
       different statistical conclusions. the rich dataset provides ample
       opportunity to perform exploratory data analysis. from deciding
       hierarchical field positions, to quantiles in height or weight. we
       demonstrate several useful libraries including standard libraries
       like pandas, as well as lesser known libraries like missingno,
       pandas-profiling, and pivottablejs.
    4. exploratory analysis of the aquastat dataset: in this section, i
       work through exploration of the [16]food and agriculture
       organization (fao) of the united nation   s [17]aquastat dataset.
       this dataset provides metrics around water availability and water
       use, as well as other demographic data for each country, reported
       every five years since 1952. this dataset is often called panel or
       longitudinal data because it is data that is repeatedly collected
       for the same subjects (in this case, countries) over time. we
       discuss methods for exploring it as panel data, as well as methods
       focused on looking at only a cross-section of the data (data
       collected for a single time period across the countries). the data
       also is geospatial, as each observation corresponds to a geolocated
       area. we show how to look at very basic data on maps in python, but
       geospatial analysis is a deep field and we scratch only the surface
       of it while looking at this dataset. we recommend the [18]pysal
       tutorial as an introduction to geospatial analysis in python.

following along at home

   to get full value out of this tutorial, we recommend actually working
   through the jupyter notebooks that we have developed. you can do this
   in one of two ways:
    1. in the cloud via [19]microsoft azure notebooks: set up an account
       and then clone [20]this library. cloning this library will allow
       you to open, edit, and run each jupyter notebook online without
       having to worry about setting up jupyter notebooks and a python
       environment. this service is free and your notebooks can be saved
       for future use without any constraint. the only thing to know about
       this service is that while notebooks are persisted indefinitely,
       there is no saving of data or other non-notebook files after the
       working session. data can be imported and then analyzed but any
       results outside of the notebook will have to be downloaded before
       leaving.
    2. locally on your computer: clone the [21]github repo here and set up
       your python environment according to the instructions found in the
       [22]readme.

   following along at home, you have the benefit of being able to put us
   on pause. we went through a lot of material in the three hours of the
   tutorial (and had to deal with some of the technical troubles
   inevitable during a hands-on tutorial of 65+ people using computers
   with different operating systems and various company firewalls!). to
   get full value out of the content, we suggest you pause throughout the
   tutorial when there are suggestions to try certain analyses yourself.

   the possibilities for eda are endless, even for a single dataset. you
   may want to look at the data in different ways and we welcome you to
   submit your own eda notebooks for either or both of the datasets
   through a pull request in the github repo. we will provide feedback and
   approve prs for your approaches to be shared with others developing
   their eda skills.
