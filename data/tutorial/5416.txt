graphquestions: a characteristic-rich id53 dataset

   graphquestions is a characteristic-rich dataset for factoid question
   answering described in the paper "[67]on generating characteristic-rich
   question sets for qa evaluation" - emnlp'16.

introduction

   natural language id53 (qa), i.e., finding direct answers
   for natural language questions, is undergoing active development.
   questions in real life often present rich characteristics, constituting
   dimensions along which question difficulty varies. the aim of this
   project is to explore how to construct characteristic-rich qa dataset
   in a systematic way, and provide the community with a dataset with rich
   and explicitly specified question characteristics. a dataset like this
   enables fine-grained evaluation of qa systems, i.e., developers can
   know exactly on what kind of questions their systems are failing, and
   improve accordingly.

   we present graphquestions, a qa dataset consisting of a set of factoid
   questions with logical forms and ground-truth answers. the current
   release (v1.0) of the dataset contains 5,166 questions, which are
   constructed based on freebase, a large-scale knowledge base. an array
   of question characteristics are formalized, and every question has an
   explict specification of characteristics:
     * structure complexity: the number of relations involved in a
       question
     * function: addtional functions like counting or superlatives, e.g.,
       "how many children of ned stark were born in winterfell?"
     * commonness: how common a question is, e.g., "where was obama born?"
       is more common than "what is the tilt of axis of polestar?"
     * id141: different natural language expressions of the same
       question
     * answer cardinality: the number of answers to a question

example

   here are some example questions and their characteristics (refer to the
   [68]paper and the [69]appendix for the definition and distribution of
   question characteristics). topic entities are bold-faced. note how the
   topic entities and the whole questions are paraphrased:
   question domain answer # of relations function commonness # of answers
   - find terrorist organizations involved in september 11 attacks.
   - who did september 11 attacks?
   - the nine eleven were carried out with the involvement of what
   terrorist organizations? terrorism alqaeda 1 none -16.67 1
   - for eddard stark's children, how many of them were born in
   winterfell?
   - in winterfell, how many children of eddard stark were born?
   - how many children of ned stark were born in winterfell? fictional
   universe 3 2 count -23.34 1
   - in which month does the average rainfall of new york city exceed 86
   mm?
   - rainfall averages more than 86 mm in new york city during which
   months?
   - list the calendar months when nyc averages in excess of 86
   millimeters of rain? travel march, august
   ... 3 comparative -37.84 7

reference

   please refer to the following paper for more details about the dataset.
   if you use this dataset in your work, please cite:

    author    = "su, yu and sun, huan and sadler, brian and srivatsa, mudhakar a
nd g{\" u}r, izzeddin and yan, zenghui and yan, xifeng",
    title     = "on generating characteristic-rich question sets for {qa} evalua

    address   = "austin, texas, usa",
    month     = "nov",
    publisher = "association for computational linguistics"
}

usage

   the dataset works the best when the knowledge backend of a qa system is
   freebase, because the provided answers are from freebase. nevertheless,
   it can still serve as a useful resource to qa systems based on other
   knowledge backend like dbpedia or the web. also, the dataset can be
   used to study or learn question id141.

   to set up a database to store and query freebase, we refer users to the
   [70]fastrdfstore project or the [71]sempre project.

   use the standard training/testing split if you would like to compare
   with other methods.

evaluation

   we provide a standard evaluation script which will evaluate the overall
   performance based on your result file as well as the breakdown
   performance by question characteristics. once you get your result file
   correctly formatted (refer to provided example result files for
   formatting), you can easily run the evaluation script, e.g.,
python evaluate.py ./freebase13/results/sempre.res
