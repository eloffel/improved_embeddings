   unless you are an english native speaker with a perfect british accent
   or a direct descendant of uncle sam, the future is not yet here for
   you. sorry, but you cannot talk to your chatbot. you   ll have to
   continue typing for a few more months (fingers crossed) until google,
   ibm or microsoft nail it. yep. we share the disappointment.

   so let   s throw some figures in. there   s this magic number everyone
   keeps referencing: 0.85. i don   t know if it   s researchers or popular
   science gurus, but we keep hearing that in order for a speech-to-text
   machine to be performing it should have a precision higher than 0.85.
   google scratches this threshold and gets a    pass    score. no    summa cum
   laude   . watson in english is behind. and it ends there. watson in
   french is not even close (0.6) and microsoft is in the twilight zone
   (somewhere between 0.7 and 0.8). amazon, apple, nuance are not in the
   match. apis not available, no doc, or too restrictive technical
   constraints.

   we guess that at recast.ai, we   ll have to go with (and pay for!) google
   for our collaborative bot platform. to be honest, we had better
   expectations before we started this exercise. let   s hope that in 6
   months time, when we   ll redo it, we   ll encounter way better results.
   until then, our 15,000 developer community will have to excuse us and
   wait.

services

   this article presents results for three speech to text providers.
   others are not present for several reasons detailed below.

   the following services were tested in this benchmark:
     * google cloud speech api
     * ibm watson
     * microsoft speech bing api

   regarding microsoft, the bing api was used instead of the custom speech
   service because it   s only available in english for now. the bing api
   allows you to create custom speech models depending on your usecase and
   vocabulary.

   nuance, houndify and amazon services are not present in this benchmark
   because of some audio format limitations. they accept only some
   specific sampling rates, which doesn   t make them production-ready for
   us. as we receive non-constrained audio data from our users, we cannot
   limit ourselves to a certain sampling rate.

   for more information about frequencies and audio processing, we
   published an [19]article about how developers can work with audio data.

data

   this benchmark uses audio data and transcription from the [20]voxforge
   corpus (standard dataset highly referenced in research papers). we have
   used 1000 samples (from 3 to 11 seconds) for both english and french
   benchmarks. the whole dataset is available [21]here. the sentences are
   all audible, even if the quality isn   t consistent.

experiments

     * google speech api is consumed through the official [22]google cloud
       sdk
     * ibm watson is consumed through the official [23]ibm watson sdk
     * microsoft speech api is consumed through [24]the http api

   as we use id103 in a real time context, we will analyze
   both accuracy and speed of each provider.

   accuracy is measured with two metrics:
     * percentage of exact recognized sentences
     * wer (word error rate): ratio between insertions, deletions and
       substitution over the size of the sentence

   these two metrics are computed on lowercase sentences, without
   punctuation. the speed is measured in milliseconds.

results

exact match

   this metric is a binary value on all samples, whether the prediction is
   the same as the expected output or not. every single letter must be the
   same.

   example:    this sentence will be recognized    doesn   t match with    this
   sentence will be recognize   .
   [0*sik1ockt-z8lv8mo.png]

   the first thing to note is that all three providers are significantly
   better in english than in french.

   google is outperforming ibm and microsoft and has the lowest difference
   between the two languages. microsoft and ibm are more than twice (!) as
   good in english than in french.

   provider exact match (english) exact match (french) google 40.2% 35.1%
   ibm watson 32.5% 8.8% microsoft 25.8% 12.0%

   at a higher level, the complexity of french conjugation gives rise to a
   lot of mistakes that make the sentences inaccurate.

   here is an example of the output the different apis provided for the
   sentence    lls   taient quatre r  veill  s son commandant lui et deux
   techniciens   .
   [1*nvtojyzh1aoe_qqcojyxhq.png]

   on the phonetic aspect, the three outputs are quite good. only ibm
   watson got a perfect phonetic score not missing the link between    ils   
   and      taient   ! (the    s    is pronounced). nevertheless, none of them
   managed to construct a grammatically valid sentence. note that although
   the error of replacing    deux    (=two) par    de    (=of) doesn   t make the
   sentence completely unreadable, it leads to a loss of quite valuable
   information.

word error rate

   this metric describes the percentage of errors on word recognition. an
   error can either be a substitution, a deletion or an addition.
   [1*qq_moxzbawuvjsqkh1qclg.png]
   [0*2tfpkjavvntq2czv.png]

   once again, google is the best performing and the most consistent while
   ibm and microsoft are acceptable in english but not in french.

   google and microsoft record a disappointing 11% and 31% error increase
   respectively while ibm   s error is increased by 140% (!). we could
   attribute the error increase between english and french to the high
   level of complexity of french grammar.
   [1*pnp-oxx3ozfpuhyxe5zkeq.png]

   api response time

   while google and microsoft have a very acceptable response time, ibm is
   quite slow (twice as slow in english, three times as slow in french).
   [0*hzmjxov99b3goebe.png]

real life test

   at recast.ai, we use id103 to help our users build
   chatbots. therefore, we conducted a real life experiment of speech to
   text applied to bots!

   in this test, we   re comparing how the bot and nlp react to both text
   and voice-translated text.

   the use case is a simple chatbot for customer service: it provides
   information about insurance records. to do that, it needs to collect
   the customer   s name and their reference number.

   the dialog is very simple and is made of 6 interactions:
    1. the user asks for the status of their insurance claim concerning a
       water damage.
    2. the bot asks for the customer   s name.
    3. the customer gives their name
    4. the bot asks for the reference number
    5. the customer gives the reference number
    6. the bot gives the claim status to the customer

   here is the text input in english:
     * user         hi, i   ve made a water damage claim last tuesday and would
       like to know its status
     * bot         i   d be glad to help you with that. can you please give me
       your full name?
     * user         jeffrey lebowski
     * bot         very well. what is your record number?
     * user         aefd1267
     * bot         thank you. the status of your claim is    in examination   

   and in french:
     * user         bonjour, j   ai d  clar   un d  g  t des eaux mardi dernier dans
       mon appartement. je voudrais savoir o   en est mon dossier.
     * bot         j   aurais besoin de votre pr  nom et de votre nom.
     * user         jeffrey lebowski
     * bot         tr  s bien, pouvez-vous me fournir votre num  ro de dossier?
     * user         aefd1267
     * bot         merci, l     tat de votre dossier est actuellement: en attente
       de validation.

   for the experiment, we recorded speech files with the content above,
   fed them to all apis in both languages and used the outputs to conduct
   the bot conversation.

results

google:

english:

   [1*dnbw_1vneqqdcnztfjzejg.png]

   the first sentence is well recognized and translated. however, the last
   name debowsky and the reference number are in the correct format and
   accurately detected but not spelled properly. therefore, the
   insurance   s information systems can   t match the two pieces of
   information to provide the correct update. conversation fails.

french:

   [1*pdj59wqggro4v1gkcptvsa.png]

   that   s going well! minus a conjugation error, the first sentence is
   detected and understood correctly, the name and id record are well
   understood and transcribed, so the bot can go to the end of the
   conversation. well done!

ibm watson:

english:

   [1*-2nfyu-sd45dijyic6pneq.png]

   with watson, there are a few mistakes in the first sentence, but the
   overall meaning is clearly conveyed. the name is correctly translated
   and recognized, but the reference number is not accurate, even if it is
   in the right format (4 letters and 4 digits). therefore, the bot cannot
   move forward.

   note that recast.ai easily detected the reference number entity, even
   if watson transcribed the values in letters and not numbers!

french:

   [1*jxcf64iuxlg1kee-urhvxg.png]

   it gets trickier!

   in the first sentence, there is a translation error that puts a name in
   the sentence when there isn   t one: au nom de doucet (in the name of
   doucet). the bot detects this name, assumes it   s the client name, and
   follows up directly by asking for the reference number. the bot doesn   t
   need a very strict    problem -> name -> id    structure to function
   properly! if it detects a name, it has what it needs and moves on to
   the next piece of information required: in this case, skipping the
   second step of our test.

   unfortunately, the id record is not understood in a valid format (4
   letters and 4 digits) as the first number is understood as    en    instead
   of    un (1)   . conversation has failed.

microsoft:

english:

   [1*62fly81-woei2aauj5mqsa.png]

   with microsoft, the first sentence is understood correctly while both
   the name and reference number are detected in the correct format but
   inaccurately translated. the user can   t get an update on his claim.

french:

   [1*bulabmtn4povqmto8pc3bw.png]

   in french, the reference number is correctly detected and translated,
   but the name isn   t! therefore, the bot can   t match them with an
   existing claim.

   as you can see, through 6 conversations, only one has been able to
   correctly finish the 3-sentence exchange. strangely, the most
   successful is in french! maybe that comes from the fact that we are
   native french speakers and have a slight french accent in english.

conclusion

   in the end, id103 doesn   t look as human-like as what we
   might expect!

   google cloud speech seems to be the better solution as they have the
   most accurate and consistent results, but it is the most expensive. ibm
   watson suffers a big drop in performance when working with french
   speech. moreover, the response time is way too high for real-time
   usage. microsoft is in the middle with a good response time.

   bottom line, if you are the head of ibm watson or microsoft speech bing
   api and you are reading this, speaking at least on behalf of our
   community, your users would truly appreciate an earth-shaking
   performance boost. as for google cloud speech api, keep working, make
   it free and we   ll all say amen :)
