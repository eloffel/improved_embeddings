tf-agents: a library for id23 in tensorflow

   note: current tf-agents pre-release is under active development and
   interfaces may change at any time. feel free to provide feedback and
   comments.

   the documentation, examples and tutorials will grow over the next few
   weeks.

agents

   in tf-agents, the core elements of rl algorithms are implemented as
   agents. an agent encompasses two main responsibilities: defining a
   policy to interact with the environment, and how to learn/train that
   policy from collected experience.

   currently the following algorithms are available under tf-agents:
     * [98]id25: human level control through deep id23
       mnih et al., 2015
     * [99]did25: deep id23 with double id24
       hasselt et al., 2015
     * [100]ddpg: continuous control with deep id23
       lillicrap et al., 2015
     * [101]td3: addressing function approximation error in actor-critic
       methods fujimoto et al., 2018
     * [102]reinforce: simple statistical gradient-following algorithms
       for connectionist id23 williams, 1992
     * [103]ppo: proximal policy optimization algorithms schulman et al.,
       2017
     * [104]sac: soft actor critic haarnoja et al., 2018

tutorials

   see [105]tf_agents/colabs/ for tutorials on the major components
   provided.

examples

   end-to-end examples training agents can be found under each agent
   directory. e.g.:
     * id25: [106]tf_agents/agents/id25/examples/v1/train_eval_gym.py

installation

   to install the latest version, use nightly builds of tf-agents under
   the pip package tf-agents-nightly, which requires you install on one of
   tf-nightly and tf-nightly-gpu and also tfp-nightly. nightly builds
   include newer features, but may be less stable than the versioned
   releases.

   to install the nightly build version, run the following:
# installing with the `--upgrade` flag ensures you'll get the latest version.
pip install --user --upgrade tf-agents-nightly  # depends on tf-nightly

   if you clone the repository you will still need a tf-nightly
   installation. you can then run pip install -e .[tests] from the agents
   directory to get dependencies to run tests.
