asyncronous rl in tensorflow + keras + openai's gym

   this is a tensorflow + keras implementation of asyncronous 1-step q
   learning as described in [71]"asynchronous methods for deep
   id23".

   since we're using multiple actor-learner threads to stabilize learning
   in place of experience replay (which is super memory intensive), this
   runs comfortably on a macbook w/ 4g of ram.

   it uses keras to define the deep q network (see model.py), openai's gym
   library to interact with the atari learning environment (see
   atari_environment.py), and tensorflow for optimization/execution (see
   async_id25.py).

requirements

     * [72]tensorflow
     * [73]gym
     * [gym's atari environment] ([74]https://github.com/openai/gym#atari)
     * skimage
     * keras

usage

training

   to kick off training, run:
python async_id25.py --experiment breakout --game "breakout-v0" --num_concurrent
8

   here we're organizing the outputs for the current experiment under a
   folder called 'breakout', choosing "breakout-v0" as our gym
   environment, and running 8 actor-learner threads concurrently. see
   [75]this for a full list of possible game names you can hand to --game.

visualizing training with tensorboard

   we collect episode reward stats and max q values that can be vizualized
   with tensorboard by running the following:
tensorboard --logdir /tmp/summaries/breakout

   this is what my per-episode reward and average max q value curves
   looked like over the training period:

evaluation

   to run a gym evaluation, turn the testing flag to true and hand in a
   current checkpoint file:
python async_id25.py --experiment breakout --testing true --checkpoint_path /tmp/
breakout.ckpt-2690000 --num_eval_episodes 100

   after completing the eval, we can upload our eval file to openai's site
   as follows:
import gym
gym.upload('/tmp/breakout/eval', api_key='your_api_key')

   now we can find the eval at
   [76]https://gym.openai.com/evaluations/eval_uwwan0u3skskocc0pjewq

next steps

   see a3c.py for a wip async advantage actor critic implementation.

resources

   i found these super helpful as general background materials for deep
   rl:
     * [77]david silver's "deep id23" lecture
     * [78]nervana's demystifying deep id23 blog post

important notes

     * in the paper the authors mention "for asynchronous methods we
       average over the best 5 models from 50 experiments". i overlooked
       this point when i was writing this, but i think it's important.
       these async methods seem to vary in performance a lot from run to
       run (at least in my implementation of them!). i think it's a good
       idea to run multiple seeded versions at the same time and average
       over their performance to get a good picture of whether or not some
       architectural change is good or not. equivalently don't get
       discouraged if you don't see performance on your task right away;
       try rerunning the same code a few more times with different seeds.
     * this repo has no affiliation with deepmind or the authors; it was
       just a simple project i was using to learn tensorflow. feedback is
       highly appreciated.
