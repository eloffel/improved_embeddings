   still be downloaded.

  geoquery database

   geoquery contains a small database of information about united states
   geography. it has about 800 facts, represented as prolog assertions.
   the database mainly contains the following information:
     * states - their capitals, populations, areas, population densities,
       major cities, rivers and the bordering states
     * cities - their populations and the states they are in
     * rivers - their lengths and the states through which they flow
     * mountains - their heights and the states they are in

   the database can be downloaded from [1]here.

  geoquery training corpus

   the training corpus for geoquery system contains 880 examples of
   queries in natural language paired with the corresponding queries in
   the formal query language. the learning systems for id29
   are given these examples from which they have to induce semantic
   parsers which can then map novel natural language queries into their
   formal forms. the query language used by the system chill is prolog
   while the rest of the systems use an equivalent variable-free
   functional query language.

   the training corpus can also be downloaded from [2]here.

  learning systems for geoquery

   following are the systems which learn semantic parsers for geoquery:

   chill is an inductive logic programming (ilp) framework for learning
   semantic parsers. it starts with a very simple, overly-general
   deterministic shift-reduce parser and uses ilp to refine the parser by
   inductively building rules to control the parser's actions. for details
   please refer to [3]this paper.

   krisp maps natural language sentences to their formal representations
   using string-kernel-based classifiers. formal representations for novel
   natural language sentences are obtained by finding the most probable
   semantic parse using these string classifiers. for details please refer
   to [4]this paper.

   scissor uses an integrated statistical parser to produce a semantically
   augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a
   syntactic and a semantic label. a compositional-semantics procedure is
   then used to map the augmented parse tree into a formal representation.
   for details please refer to [5]this paper.

   wasp uses state-of-the-art id151 techniques
   to map natural language sentences to their formal language
   representations. a word alignment model is used for lexical
   acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based
   translation model. for details please refer to [6]this paper.
