what it is?

   how can we create a recommendation engine that is based both on user
   browsing history and product reviews? can i create recommendations
   purely based on the 'intent' and 'context' of the search?

   this talk will showcase how a recommendation engine can be built with
   user browser history and user-generated reviews using a state of the
   art technique - id97. we will create something that not only
   matches the existing recommender systems deployed by websites, but goes
   one step ahead - incorporating context to generate valid and innovative
   recommendations. the beauty of such a framework is that not only does
   it support online learning, but is also sensitive to minor changes in
   user tone and behavior.

how it is done?

   the trick/secret sauce is - how do we account for the 'context' and
   build it in our systems? the talk will answer these questions and
   showcase effectiveness of such a recommender system.
     * first milestone      subset of the engine's functionality was
       completed during a project undertaken at iasnlp 2016 held by
       language technology research center (ltrc), iiit hyderabad

technologies used

     * google's id97
     * gensim
     * numpy
     * flask, redis.

data and models

     * rest of the models (user & metadata) can be downloaded from
       [63]https://s3.amazonaws.com/iasnlp-models/output_models.tar
     * amazon review data will be made available (for research purposes)
       on request. please contact julian mcauley
       ([64]julian.mcauley@gmail.com) to obtain a link. sample data files
       available at: [65]http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

installation

     * [66]lets do it !!

what is there inside the box?

   file function
   semsim_train.py main file to train models
   preprocessing.py methods to preprocess and clean data before feeding
   for training
   loadreviewmodel.py for loading review model
   loadredis.py for loading redis model
   loadmetamodel.py for loading meta model
