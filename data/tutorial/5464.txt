beginner   s guide to web scraping in python (using beautifulsoup)

   [97]sunil ray, october 22, 2015

introduction

   the need and importance of extracting data from the web is becoming
   increasingly loud and clear. every few weeks, i find myself in a
   situation where we need to extract data from the web to [98]build a
   machine learning model.

   for example, last week we were thinking of creating an index of hotness
   and sentiment about various [99]data science courses available on the
   internet. this would not only require finding new courses, but also
   scraping the web for their reviews and then summarizing them in a few
   metrics!

   this is one of the problems / products whose efficacy depends more on
   web scrapping and information extraction (data collection) than the
   techniques used to summarize the data.


ways to extract information from web

   there are several ways to extract information from the web. use
   of [100]apis being probably the best way to extract data from a
   website. almost all large websites like twitter, facebook, google,
   twitter, stackoverflow provide apis to access their data in a more
   structured manner. if you can get what you need through an api, it is
   almost always preferred approach over web scrapping. this is because if
   you are getting access to structured data from the provider, why would
   you want to create an engine to extract the same information.

   sadly, not all websites provide an api. some do it because they do not
   want the readers to extract huge information in a structured way, while
   others don   t provide apis due to lack of technical knowledge. what do
   you do in these cases? well, we need to scrape the website to fetch the
   information.

   there might be a few other ways like rss feeds, but they are limited in
   their use and hence i am not including them in the discussion here.


what is web scraping?

   web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information
   from websites. this technique mostly focuses on the transformation of
   unstructured data (html format) on the web into structured data
   (database or spreadsheet).

   you can perform web scrapping in various ways, including use of google
   docs to almost every programming language. i would resort to python
   because of its ease and rich eocsystem. it has a library known as
      beautifulsoup    which assists this task. in this article, i   ll show you
   the easiest way to learn web scraping using python programming.

   for those of you, who need a non-programming way to extract information
   out of web pages, you can also look at [101]import.io . it provides a
   gui driven interface to perform all basic web scraping operations. the
   hackers can continue to read this article!


libraries required for web scraping

   as we know, [102]python is an open source programming language. you may
   find many libraries to perform one function. hence, it is necessary to
   find the best to use library. i prefer beautifulsoup (python library),
   since it is easy and intuitive to work on. precisely, i   ll use two
   python modules for scraping data:
     * urllib2: it is a python module which can be used for fetching
       urls. it defines functions and classes to help with url actions
       (basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies, etc). for
       more detail refer to the [103]documentation page. note: urllib2 is
       the name of the library included in python 2. you can use the
       urllib.request library included with python 3, instead. the
       urllib.request library works the same way urllib.request works in
       python 2. because it is already included you don   t need to install
       it.
     * beautifulsoup: it is an incredible tool for pulling out information
       from a webpage. you can use it to extract tables, lists, paragraph
       and you can also put filters to extract information from web pages.
       in this article, we will use latest version beautifulsoup 4. you
       can look at the installation instruction in its [104]documentation
       page.

   beautifulsoup does not fetch the web page for us. that   s why, i use
   urllib2 in combination with the beautifulsoup library.

   [105]python has several other options for html scraping in addition to
   beatifulsoup. here are some others:
     * [106]mechanize
     * [107]scrapemark
     * [108]scrapy


basics     get familiar with html (tags)

   while performing web scarping, we deal with html tags. thus, we must
   have good understanding of them. if you already know basics of html,
   you can skip this section. below is the basic syntax of html:[109] html
   this syntax has various tags as elaborated below:
    1. <!doctype html> : html documents must start with a type declaration
    2. html document is contained between <html> and </html>
    3. the visible part of the html document is between <body> and </body>
    4. html headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags
    5. html paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag

   other useful html tags are:
    1. html links are defined with the <a> tag,    <a
       href=   http://www.test.com   >this is a link for test.com</a>   
    2. html tables are defined with<table>, row as <tr> and rows are
       divided into data as <td>
       table
    3. html list starts with <ul> (unordered) and <ol> (ordered). each
       item of list starts with <li>
       [110]list

   if you are new to this html tags, i would also recommend you to
   refer [111]html tutorial from w3schools. this will give you a clear
   understanding about html tags.


scrapping a web page using beautifulsoup

   here, i am scraping data from a [112]wikipedia page. our final goal is
   to extract list of state, union territory capitals in india. and some
   basic detail like establishment, former capital and others form this
   [113]wikipedia page. let   s learn with doing this project step wise
   step:
    1. import necessary libraries:

#import the library used to query a website
import urllib2 #if you are using python3+ version, import urllib.request
#specify the url
wiki = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_state_and_union_territory_capitals
_in_india"
#query the website and return the html to the variable 'page'
page = urllib2.urlopen(wiki) #for python 3 use urllib.request.urlopen(wiki)
#import the beautiful soup functions to parse the data returned from the website
from bs4 import beautifulsoup
#parse the html in the 'page' variable, and store it in beautiful soup format
soup = beautifulsoup(page)
    2. use function    prettify    to look at nested structure of html page
       [114]firstp above, you can see that structure of the html tags.
       this will help you to know about different available tags and how
       can you play with these to extract information.


    3. work with html tags

    a. soup.<tag>: return content between opening and closing tag
       including tag.
in[30]:soup.title
out[30]:<title>list of state and union territory capitals in india - wikipedia,
the free encyclopedia</title>
    b. soup.<tag>.string: return string within given tag
in [38]:soup.title.string
out[38]:u'list of state and union territory capitals in india - wikipedia, the f
ree encyclopedia'

    c. find all the links within page   s <a> tags::  we know that, we can
       tag a link using tag    <a>   . so, we should go with option soup.a and
       it should return the links available in the web page. let   s do it.
in [40]:soup.a
out[40]:<a id="top"></a>
       above, you can see that, we have only one output. now to extract
       all the links within <a>, we will use    find_all().
       [115]all_links above, it is showing all links including titles,
       links and other information.  now to show only links, we need to
       iterate over each a tag and then return the link using attribute
          href    with get.
       [116]all_links2


    4. find the right table: as we are seeking a table to extract
       information about state capitals, we should identify the right
       table first. let   s write the command to extract information within
       all table tags.
all_tables=soup.find_all('table')

       now to identify the right table, we will use attribute    class    of
       table and use it to filter the right table. in chrome, you can
       check the class name by right click on the required table of web
       page    > inspect element    > copy the class name or go through the
       output of above command find the class name of right table.
right_table=soup.find('table', class_='wikitable sortable plainrowheaders')
right_table
[117] righttable above, we are able to identify right table.
    5. extract the information to dataframe: here, we need to iterate
       through each row (tr) and then assign each element of tr (td) to a
       variable and append it to a list. let   s first look at the html
       structure of the table (i am not going to extract information for
       table heading <th>)
       [118]structure above, you can notice that second element of <tr> is
       within tag <th> not <td> so we need to take care for this. now to
       access value of each element, we will use    find(text=true)    option
       with each element.  let   s look at the code:

#generate lists
a=[]
b=[]
c=[]
d=[]
e=[]
f=[]
g=[]
for row in right_table.findall("tr"):
    cells = row.findall('td')
    states=row.findall('th') #to store second column data
    if len(cells)==6: #only extract table body not heading
        a.append(cells[0].find(text=true))
        b.append(states[0].find(text=true))
        c.append(cells[1].find(text=true))
        d.append(cells[2].find(text=true))
        e.append(cells[3].find(text=true))
        f.append(cells[4].find(text=true))
        g.append(cells[5].find(text=true))
#import pandas to convert list to data frame
import pandas as pd
df=pd.dataframe(a,columns=['number'])
df['state/ut']=b
df['admin_capital']=c
df['legislative_capital']=d
df['judiciary_capital']=e
df['year_capital']=f
df['former_capital']=g
df

   finally, we have data in dataframe:
   [119]output
   similarly, you can perform various other types of web scraping using
      beautifulsoup   . this will reduce your manual efforts to collect data
   from web pages. you can also look at the other attributes like .parent,
   .contents, .descendants and .next_sibling, .prev_sibling and various
   attributes to navigate using tag name. these will help you to scrap the
   web pages effectively.-


but, why can   t i just use id157?

   now, if you know [120]id157, you might be thinking that
   you can write code using regular expression which can do the same thing
   for you. i definitely had this question. in my experience with
   beautifulsoup and id157 to do same thing i found out:
     * code written in beautifulsoup is usually more robust than the one
       written using id157. codes written with regular
       expressions need to be altered with any changes in pages. even
       beautifulsoup needs that in some cases, it is just that
       beautifulsoup is relatively better.
     * id157 are much faster than beautifulsoup, usually by
       a factor of 100 in giving the same outcome.

   so, it boils down to speed vs. robustness of the code and there is no
   universal winner here. if the information you are looking for can be
   extracted with simple regex statements, you should go ahead and use
   them. for almost any complex work, i usually recommend beautifulsoup
   more than regex.


end note

   in this article, we looked at web scraping methods using
      beautifulsoup    and    urllib2    in python. we also looked at the basics
   of html and perform the web scraping step by step while solving a
   challenge. i   d recommend you to practice this and use it for collecting
   data from web pages.

       hi sunil,
       nice explanation it helped me understand more about data scraping
       through python. just a little update i don   t know whether it   s some
       version issue or something else. you    ve mentioned    find_all    in
       the script, which when i ran has thrown an error, after exploring
       more on the web i found    findall    (underscore removed and a in
       caps) which worked for me.
       thanks

       excellent article. very concise, thorough and simple to understand.
       i would greatly appreciate other examples of grabbing data from a
       website and displaying results in a dataframe ( table )   
       if it   s not too much of an inconvenience, could you provide example
       similar to above for obtaining best gasoline / petroleum prices in
       a particular region or at least point us to some good reference
       material?
       i just have to figure out how to get pandas installed on my windows
       8.1 system.
       i installed portable python, which is basically running python from
       a folder. guess i   ll have to download pandas into that folder
       similar to how i did beautifulsoup4.
       thanks again

       beautifulsoup vs regex anology: web content is like money in a
       digital vault. beautiful soup is a clean and process driven way of
       opening the vault door. whereas, regex way is like breaking that
       door with a hammer!!
       both are good. i somehow prefer the hammer way.

       great list of plugins friend. the tables still serve a purpose.
       although in the era of responsive sites it is a must have to be
       able to display tables responsively.
       league table looks great! definitely look into this and it has come
       at the right time as i am working on a site to list statistics and
       a table like this will work perfectly.

       very good article. i would add a note about selenium. i like to use
       selenium and beautiful soup together though they overlap in
       functionality. selenium can click through webpage, submit
       passwords, and extract data but beautiful soup much easier to
       use   together they work very well for multiple use cases.

            hi,
            yes, you can use beautifulsoup to get this done. first, you
            have to understand document object model (dom). find the
            source code of the page by right clicking on the webpage and
            select source code. here you could look what is the id or
            class of heading you want to parse.
            later you can parse it using the following code.
            soup = beautifulsoup(   

               ) soup.find_all(   h2   , class_=   classname   )
