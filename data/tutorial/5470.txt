introduction to pseudo-labelling : a semi-supervised learning technique

   [97]shubham jain, september 21, 2017

introduction

   we have made huge progress in solving supervised machine learning
   problems. that also means that we need a lot of data to build our image
   classifiers or sales forecasters. the algorithms search patterns
   through the data again and again.

   but, that is not how human mind learns. a human brain does not require
   millions of data for training with multiple iterations of going through
   the same image for understanding a topic. all it needs is a few guiding
   points to train itself on the underlying patterns. clearly, we are
   missing something in current machine learning approaches.

   thankfully, there is a line of research which specifically caters to
   this question. can we build a system capable of requiring minimal
   amount of supervision which can learn majority of the tasks on its own.
   in this article, i would like to cover one such technique called
   pseudo-labelling. i will give an intuitive explanation of what
   pseudo-labelling is and then provide a hands-on implementation of it.

   are you ready?

   note: i assume you have clarity on the basic topics of machine
   learning. if not, i would suggest you to go through [98]a basic machine
   learning article first and then come back to this one.

    5. dependence on sampling rate
    6. applications of ssl


1. what is semi-supervised learning (ssl) ?

   let   s say, we have a simple image classification problem. so, our
   training data consists of two labelled images as shown below.

   so, we need to classify images of eclipse from the non-eclipse images.
   but, the problem is that we need to build our model on just a training
   set of just two images.

   therefore, in order to apply any supervised learning algorithm we need
   more data to build a robust model. to solve this purpose, we find a
   simple solution that we download some images from the web to increase
   our training data.

   but, for the supervised approach we also need labels for these images.
   so, we manually classify each image into a category as shown below.

   after running supervised algorithm on this data, our model will
   definitely out-perform the model just containing two images in the
   training data.

   but this approach is only valid for small purposes because human
   annotation to a large dataset can be very hard and expensive.

   so, to solve these type of problems, we define a different type of
   learning known as semi-supervised learning, which is used both labelled
   data (supervised learning) and unlabelled data (unsupervised learning).

   source: [99]link

   therefore, let us understand how unlabelled data can help to improve
   our model.


2. how unlabelled data can help?

   consider a situation as shown below.

   you have only two data points belonging to two different categories,
   and the line drawn is the decision boundary of any supervised model.

   now, let   s say we add some unlabelled data to this data as shown in the
   image below.

   images source: [100]link


   if we notice the difference between the above two images, you can say
   that after adding unlabelled data, the decision boundary of our model
   has become more accurate.

   so, the advantage of using unlabelled data are:
    1. labelled data is expensive and difficult to get while unlabelled is
       abundant and cheap.
    2. it improves the model robustness by more precise decision boundary.

   now, we have a basic understanding that what is semi-supervised
   learning. there are different techniques of applying ssl, in this
   article we will try to understand one such technique known as pseudo
   labeling.


3. introduction pseudo labeling

   in this technique, instead of manually labeling the unlabelled data, we
   give approximate labels on the basis of the labelled data. let   s make
   it simpler by breaking into steps as shown in the image below.

   source: [101]link

   i suppose, you understood the steps mentioned in the above image. so,
   the final model trained in the third step is used for the final
   predictions on the test data.

   for better understanding, i always prefer understanding a concept by
   its implementation on a real world problem.


4. implementation of ssl

   here, we will be using [102]big mart sales problem from av data hack
   platform. so, let   s get start by downloading the train and test file
   present in the data section.

   so, let   s get start by importing the basic libraries.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from sklearn.preprocessing import labelencoder

   now, let   s read train and test file that we have downloaded and do some
   basic preprocessing in order to form modelling.
train = pd.read_csv('/users/shubhamjain/downloads/av/big mart/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('/users/shubhamjain/downloads/av/big mart/test.csv')


# preprocessing

### mean imputations
train['item_weight'].fillna((train['item_weight'].mean()), inplace=true)
test['item_weight'].fillna((test['item_weight'].mean()), inplace=true)

### reducing fat content to only two categories
train['item_fat_content'] = train['item_fat_content'].replace(['low fat','lf'],
['low fat','low fat'])
train['item_fat_content'] = train['item_fat_content'].replace(['reg'], ['regular
'])
test['item_fat_content'] = test['item_fat_content'].replace(['low fat','lf'], ['
low fat','low fat'])
test['item_fat_content'] = test['item_fat_content'].replace(['reg'], ['regular']
)

## for calculating establishment year
train['outlet_establishment_year'] = 2013 - train['outlet_establishment_year']
test['outlet_establishment_year'] = 2013 - test['outlet_establishment_year']

### missing values for size
train['outlet_size'].fillna('small',inplace=true)
test['outlet_size'].fillna('small',inplace=true)

### label encoding cate. var.
col = ['outlet_size','outlet_location_type','outlet_type','item_fat_content']
test['item_outlet_sales'] = 0
combi = train.append(test)
number = labelencoder()
for i in col:
 combi[i] = number.fit_transform(combi[i].astype('str'))
 combi[i] = combi[i].astype('int')
train = combi[:train.shape[0]]
test = combi[train.shape[0]:]
test.drop('item_outlet_sales',axis=1,inplace=true)

## removing id variables
training = train.drop(['outlet_identifier','item_type','item_identifier'],axis=1
)
testing = test.drop(['outlet_identifier','item_type','item_identifier'],axis=1)
y_train = training['item_outlet_sales']
training.drop('item_outlet_sales',axis=1,inplace=true)

features = training.columns
target = 'item_outlet_sales'

x_train, x_test = training, testing

   starting with different supervised learning algorithm, let us check
   which algorithm gives us the best results.
from xgboost import xgbregressor
from sklearn.linear_model import bayesianridge, ridge, elasticnet
from sklearn.neighbors import kneighborsregressor
from sklearn.ensemble import randomforestregressor, extratreesregressor, gradien
tboostingregressor
#from sklearn.neural_network import mlpregressor

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
model_factory = [
 randomforestregressor(),
 xgbregressor(nthread=1),
 #mlpregressor(),
 ridge(),
 bayesianridge(),
 extratreesregressor(),
 elasticnet(),
 kneighborsregressor(),
 gradientboostingregressor()
]

for model in model_factory:
 model.seed = 42
 num_folds = 3

scores = cross_val_score(model, x_train, y_train, cv=num_folds, scoring='neg_mea
n_squared_error')
 score_description = " %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (np.sqrt(scores.mean()*-1), scores.s
td() * 2)

print('{model:25} cv-5 rmse: {score}'.format(
 model=model.__class__.__name__,
 score=score_description
 ))

   we can see xgb gives us the best model performance. note here, i have
   not tuned parameter of any algorithm for the simplicity of this
   article.

   now, let   s us implement pseudo-labelling, for this purpose i will be
   using test data as the unlabelled data.
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
 from sklearn.base import baseestimator, regressormixin

class pseudolabeler(baseestimator, regressormixin):
 '''
 sci-kit learn wrapper for creating pseudo-lebeled estimators.
 '''

def __init__(self, model, unlabled_data, features, target, sample_rate=0.2, seed
=42):
 '''
 @sample_rate - percent of samples used as pseudo-labelled data
 from the unlabelled dataset
 '''
 assert sample_rate <= 1.0, 'sample_rate should be between 0.0 and 1.0.'

self.sample_rate = sample_rate
 self.seed = seed
 self.model = model
 self.model.seed = seed

self.unlabled_data = unlabled_data
 self.features = features
 self.target = target

def get_params(self, deep=true):
 return {
 "sample_rate": self.sample_rate,
 "seed": self.seed,
 "model": self.model,
 "unlabled_data": self.unlabled_data,
 "features": self.features,
 "target": self.target
 }

def set_params(self, **parameters):
 for parameter, value in parameters.items():
 setattr(self, parameter, value)
 return self

def fit(self, x, y):
 '''
 fit the data using pseudo labeling.
 '''

augemented_train = self.__create_augmented_train(x, y)
 self.model.fit(
 augemented_train[self.features],
 augemented_train[self.target]
 )

return self



def __create_augmented_train(self, x, y):
 '''
 create and return the augmented_train set that consists
 of pseudo-labeled and labeled data.
 '''
 num_of_samples = int(len(self.unlabled_data) * self.sample_rate)

# train the model and creat the pseudo-labels
 self.model.fit(x, y)
 pseudo_labels = self.model.predict(self.unlabled_data[self.features])

# add the pseudo-labels to the test set
 pseudo_data = self.unlabled_data.copy(deep=true)
 pseudo_data[self.target] = pseudo_labels

# take a subset of the test set with pseudo-labels and append in onto
 # the training set
 sampled_pseudo_data = pseudo_data.sample(n=num_of_samples)
 temp_train = pd.concat([x, y], axis=1)
 augemented_train = pd.concat([sampled_pseudo_data, temp_train])

return shuffle(augemented_train)

def predict(self, x):
 '''
 returns the predicted values.
 '''
 return self.model.predict(x)

def get_model_name(self):
 return self.model.__class__.__name__


   this look quite complex, but you need not to worry about this as it is
   the same implementation of the method we learned above. so, copy the
   same code every time you need to perform pseudo labeling.

   so, now let   s us now check the results of pseudo labeling on the
   dataset.
model_factory = [
 xgbregressor(nthread=1),
 pseudolabeler(
 xgbregressor(nthread=1),
 test,
 features,
 target,
 sample_rate=0.3
 ),
]

for model in model_factory:
 model.seed = 42
 num_folds = 8

 scores = cross_val_score(model, x_train, y_train, cv=num_folds, scoring='neg_me
an_squared_error', n_jobs=8)
 score_description = "mse: %0.4f (+/- %0.4f)" % (np.sqrt(scores.mean()*-1), scor
es.std() * 2)

print('{model:25} cv-{num_folds} {score_cv}'.format(
 model=model.__class__.__name__,
 num_folds=num_folds,
 score_cv=score_description
 ))

   in this case, we a get rmse value which comes out to lesser than any of
   the supervised learning algorithm.

   if you have notice sample_rate was one of the parameter, which denotes
   the percentage of unlabelled data to be used as the pseudo labelled for
   the modelling purpose.

   therefore, let   s us check the dependance of sample_rate on the
   performance of the pseudo labelling.


5. dependence of sampling rate

   in order to find out the dependence of sample_rate on the performance
   of the pseudo labelling, let us plot a graph between those two.

   here, i am using only two algorithm to show you the dependence because
   of the time constraint, but you can try for other algorithms too.
sample_rates = np.linspace(0, 1, 10)

def pseudo_label_wrapper(model):
 return pseudolabeler(model, test, features, target)

# list of all models to test
model_factory = [
 randomforestregressor(n_jobs=1),
 xgbregressor(),
]

# apply the pseudolabeler class to each model
model_factory = map(pseudo_label_wrapper, model_factory)

# train each model with different sample rates
results = {}
num_folds = 5

for model in model_factory:
 model_name = model.get_model_name()
 print('%s' % model_name)

results[model_name] = list()
 for sample_rate in sample_rates:
 model.sample_rate = sample_rate

 # calculate the cv-3 r2 score and store it
 scores = cross_val_score(model, x_train, y_train, cv=num_folds, scoring='neg_me
an_squared_error', n_jobs=8)
 results[model_name].append(np.sqrt(scores.mean()*-1))


plt.figure(figsize=(16, 18))

i = 1
for model_name, performance in results.items():
 plt.subplot(3, 3, i)
 i += 1

 plt.plot(sample_rates, performance)
 plt.title(model_name)
 plt.xlabel('sample_rate')
 plt.ylabel('rmse')


plt.show()

   so, we can see that the rmse is minimum for a particular value of
   sample_rate, which is different for both the algorithm.

   therefore, it is important to tune sample_rate in order to achieve
   better results while using pseudo labeling.


6. applications of ssl

   in past, there are limited number of applications of semi-supervised
   learning, but currently there is lot of working going on in this field.

   some applications which i found interesting are listed below.

1. multimodal semi-supervised learning for image classification

   generally, in image categorisation, the goal is to classify an image
   whether it belongs to the category or not. in this paper, not only
   images are used for modelling but the keywords associated with labelled
   and unlabelled images are also used to improve the classifier using
   semi-supervised learning.

2. ssl for detecting human trafficking

   human trafficking is one of the most atrocious crimes and among the
   challenging problems facing law enforcement which demands attention of
   global magnitude. semi-supervised learning is to applied to use both
   labelled and unlabelled data in order to produce better results than
   the normal approaches.

   source: [104]link

end notes

   i hope that now you have a understanding what semi-supervised learning
   is and how to implement it in any real world problem. therefore, try to
   explore it further and learn other types of semi-supervised learning
   technique and share with the community in the comment section.

       indentation and space is off in your pseudolabeler class. would
       make it easier to copy and learn from if it was indented correctly.
       of course, the user can do it, but that presents challenges for
       some. can   t wait to format this code and see what pseudolabeler
       does! thanks for the great share.

            another comment for windows users: this code uses n_jobs=8 in
            cross_val_score. for whatever reason, any time i   ve ever tried
            to specify n_jobs as a parameter in cross_val_score or
            gridsearchcv (for instance), the script will never finish. the

       hi shubham,
       that is a great idea, but i have concern:
       if we train the model first with labeled data and suppose it is not
       perfect model, then we use it to predict un-labeled data, it leads
       to incorrect labeled data.
       finally, we combine correct labeled data and incorrect labeled data
       to train model second. incorrect labeled data makes a lot of noise
       and will lead model second worse.
       what do you think about that?

       hi shubham
       while importing xgboost , linear models and other lib , i have got
       the following warning

       .py:41: deprecationwarning: this module was deprecated in version
       0.18 in favor of the model_selection module into which all the
       refactored classes and functions are moved. also note that the
       interface of the new cv iterators are different from that of this
       module. this module will be removed in 0.20.
          this module will be removed in 0.20.   , deprecationwarning)
       due to which , for the normal submission of xgb , i got only three
       values in my array
       array([-1195820.4972537 , -1168271.94483117, -1166641.76414758])
