semantic image segmentation live demo

   our work allows computers to recognize objects in images, what is
   distinctive about our work is that we also recover the 2d outline of
   the object.

   currently we have trained this model to recognize 20 classes. the demo
   below allows you to test our algorithm on your own images     have a try
   and see if you can fool it, if you get some good examples you can send
   them to us.

   why are we doing this? this work is part of a project to build
   augmented reality glasses for the partially sighted. please read about
   it here [3]smart-specs.

   this demo is based on our iccv 2015 paper [4]id49
   as recurrent neural networks, which utilizes deep learning techniques
   and probabilistic id114 for semantic image segmentation.
