abstract

   transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a
   designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer
   in order to build customized software, websites, and mobile
   applications. in this paper, we show that deep learning methods can be
   leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically generate code
   from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different
   platforms (i.e. ios, android and web-based technologies).

setup

prerequisites

     * python 2 or 3
     * pip

install dependencies

pip install -r  requirements.txt

usage

   prepare the data:
# reassemble and unzip the data
cd datasets
zip -f pix2code_datasets.zip --out datasets.zip
unzip datasets.zip

cd ../model

# split training set and evaluation set while ensuring no training example in th
e evaluation set
# usage: build_datasets.py <input path> <distribution (default: 6)>
./build_datasets.py ../datasets/ios/all_data
./build_datasets.py ../datasets/android/all_data
./build_datasets.py ../datasets/web/all_data

# transform images (normalized pixel values and resized pictures) in training da
taset to numpy arrays (smaller files if you need to upload the set to train your
 model in the cloud)
# usage: convert_imgs_to_arrays.py <input path> <output path>
./convert_imgs_to_arrays.py ../datasets/ios/training_set ../datasets/ios/trainin

./convert_imgs_to_arrays.py ../datasets/android/training_set ../datasets/android
/training_features
./convert_imgs_to_arrays.py ../datasets/web/training_set ../datasets/web/trainin
g_features

   train the model:
mkdir bin
cd model

# provide input path to training data and output path to save trained model and
metadata
# usage: train.py <input path> <output path> <is memory intensive (default: 0)>
<pretrained weights (optional)>
./train.py ../datasets/web/training_set ../bin

# train on images pre-processed as arrays
./train.py ../datasets/web/training_features ../bin

# train with generator to avoid having to fit all the data in memory (recommende
d)
./train.py ../datasets/web/training_features ../bin 1

# train on top of pretrained weights
./train.py ../datasets/web/training_features ../bin 1 ../bin/pix2code.h5

   generate code for batch of guis:
mkdir code
cd model

# generate dsl code (.gui file), the default search method is greedy
# usage: generate.py <trained weights path> <trained model name> <input image> <
output path> <search method (default: greedy)>
./generate.py ../bin pix2code ../gui_screenshots ../code

# equivalent to command above
./generate.py ../bin pix2code ../gui_screenshots ../code greedy

# generate dsl code with id125 and a beam width of size 3
./generate.py ../bin pix2code ../gui_screenshots ../code 3

   generate code for a single gui image:
mkdir code
cd model

# generate dsl code (.gui file), the default search method is greedy
# usage: sample.py <trained weights path> <trained model name> <input image> <ou
tput path> <search method (default: greedy)>
./sample.py ../bin pix2code ../test_gui.png ../code

# equivalent to command above
./sample.py ../bin pix2code ../test_gui.png ../code greedy

# generate dsl code with id125 and a beam width of size 3
./sample.py ../bin pix2code ../test_gui.png ../code 3

   compile generated code to target language:
cd compiler

# compile .gui file to android xml ui
./android-compiler.py <input file path>.gui

# compile .gui file to ios storyboard
./ios-compiler.py <input file path>.gui

# compile .gui file to html/css (bootstrap style)
./web-compiler.py <input file path>.gui

faq

will pix2code supports other target platforms/languages?

   no, pix2code is only a research project and will stay in the state
   described in the paper for consistency reasons. this project is really
   just a toy example but you are of course more than welcome to fork the
   repo and experiment yourself with other target platforms/languages.

will i be able to use pix2code for my own frontend projects?

   no, pix2code is experimental and won't work for your specific use
   cases.

how is the model performance measured?

   the accuracy/error reported in the paper is measured at the dsl level
   by comparing each generated token with each expected token. any
   difference in length between the generated token sequence and the
   expected token sequence is also counted as error.

how long does it take to train the model?

   on a nvidia tesla k80 gpu, it takes a little less than 5 hours to
   optimize the 109 * 10^6 parameters for one dataset; so expect around 15
   hours if you want to train the model for the three target platforms.

i am a front-end developer, will i soon lose my job?

   (i have genuinely been asked this question multiple times)

   tl;dr not anytime soon will ai replace front-end developers.

   even assuming a mature version of pix2code able to generate gui code
   with 100% accuracy for every platforms/languages in the universe,
   front-enders will still be needed to implement the logic, the
   interactive parts, the advanced graphics and animations, and all the
   features users love. the product we are building at [88]uizard
   technologies is intended to bridge the gap between ui/ux designers and
   front-end developers, not replace any of them. we want to rethink the
   traditional workflow that too often results in more frustration than
   innovation. we want designers to be as creative as possible to better
   serve end users, and developers to dedicate their time programming the
   core functionality and forget about repetitive tasks such as ui
   implementation. we believe in a future where ai collaborate with
   humans, not replace humans.
