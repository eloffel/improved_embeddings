sorry

   coursera requested that i need to remove the coursera course material
   from my github site immediately as i'm in violation of our terms of
   use.

   so i removed all the files.

   but if you are over the age of 13 you can create an account on coursera
   and audit the courses to access the deep learning material.

you can visit [76]deeplearning.ai this link and create a account to get all
the material for free.

   thank you

deeplearning.ai

deep learning specialization

   master deep learning, and break into ai

pre trained models

   github only allows to share file less than 50mb. there is some
   pre-trained model like resnet etc. suggest you to download them from my
   [77]google drive (drive link removed) or download them from online (as
   they are so popular you can easily get them)

conclusion

everyone welcome to create pull request if new resource update or if i miss
anything :)

as coursera suggest to not to share solution online. so, request you not to
share solution for this notebook.

thank you
