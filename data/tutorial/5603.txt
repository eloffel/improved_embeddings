(d) let   s roll! (1/1) [10 points] 

tavla is a variant of backgammon played in turkey. in the game, two six-sided dice are thrown, resulting in 
two random numbers between 1 and 6. each possible outcome has a name, and these names consist of a cu-
rious mixture of persian and turkish. some letters used to write these languages are not used to write eng-
lish, such as   ,   , and   , but you do not need to know how these are pronounced to solve this problem. the ta-
ble on the left lists some of the possible outcomes, while the table on the right lists the names of those out-
comes, but the outcomes and their names are not given in the same order. answer these questions in the 
answer sheets. 
 
d1. match up which name goes with which outcome. write your answers in the answer sheets (that is, 
next to each outcome in the answer sheet, write the letter corresponding to that outcome   s name). note 
that the order of the dice does not matter for the naming scheme: for example, 2-6 and 6-2 have the same 
name.

for questions d2 through d4, your answer should be an element from the following list of possible out-
comes:  1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-3, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6, 6-6 
 
d2. what outcome has the name    penc   d     ? 
 
 
d3. what outcome has the name    c  hari se   ? 
 
 
d4. what outcome has the name    d    e     ? 
 
 
note: there is significant variation in the exact names used across different tavla players from different re-
gions. therefore, some tavla players use different sets of names than the ones given in this problem.
