bulgarian is a slavic language and, along with the closely related macedonian language, has several character-
istics that set it apart from all other slavic languages. old bulgarian was a highly synthetic language; synthetic 
languages express meaning by building complex words from smaller pieces. modern day bulgarian is a typical 
analytic language, one which expresses meaning more with word order, like english. bulgarian currently uses 
the cyrillic script, created after the older glagolitic alphabets. in this problem, a roman id68 is 
used. the letter          represents the vowel in the english word but.
