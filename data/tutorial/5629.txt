(l) the short hand of the law (1/3) 

shorthand machines, commonly known as stenotype machines, are used in many courts of law to record 
court proceedings.  they are a special kind of typewriter with an unusual keyboard, in which many keys can 
be punched simultaneously (   chorded   ), and the results are output onto a thin strip of paper.  court stenog-
raphers using stenotype machines can transcribe court proceedings very quickly; the world record is 375 
words per minute! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
below, we have taken an example of court stenography, 25 lines long, and divided it into five pieces.
