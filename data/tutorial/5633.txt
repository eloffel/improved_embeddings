(d) elder futhark runes (1/1) 

old norse was the language of the vikings, the language spoken in scandinavia and in the scandinavian settle-
ments found throughout the northern hemisphere from the 700s through the 1300s. much as latin was the 
forerunner of the romance languages, among them italian, spanish, and french, old norse was the ancestor 
of the north germanic languages: icelandic, faroese, norwegian, danish, and swedish. old norse was writ-
ten first in runic alphabets, then later in the roman alphabet. the first runic alphabet, found on inscriptions 
dating from throughout the first millennium ce, is known as    elder futhark    and was used for both proto-
norse and early old norse. 
 
below are nine anglicized names of old norse gods and the nine elder futhark names to which they corre-
spond. listed below are also two other runic names for gods.
