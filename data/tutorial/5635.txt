(f) my friend nomura from osaka (1/1) 

in japanese as in many languages, proper names (names of people and places) often have a literal translation 
that describes some local feature (e.g. littlefield, whitehill, longridge). here are some japanese personal or 
place names and their jumbled up literal translations into english.  
 
f1. your task is to match up the names and the translations. note that japanese distinguishes long and short 
vowels, but that vowel length distinction is not shown here. note also that in these examples,    mount    and 
   mountain    are different words, as are    field    and    rice-field   .
