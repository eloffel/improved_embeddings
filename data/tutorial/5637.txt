(h) ph  as  a and ph  asa  a (1/2) 

shan (native term: ph  as  a t  i,                            ) and lao (native term: ph  asa  a l  aw,                      ) are tai languages 
from southeast asia. shan is spoken in myanmar and thailand by about 3 million people, and lao is spoken in 
laos and thailand by about 20 million. they are quite closely related, but are essentially mutually incompre-
hensible due to grammatical changes in both languages. similarly, they are both written in writing systems that 
descend from the ancient sanskrit script brahmi, but these writing systems have rather different ways of 
marking the same sounds. the shan writing system is a modification of the alphabet used by burmese and 
mon, whereas the lao script is a streamlined form of the thai alphabet. 
 
note: the diacritics (accent marks) above the shan and lao vowels in the roman transcription of the native 
terms for the two languages shown above serve to mark tone. the doubled vowels indicate long vowels. 
 
h1. your task is to determine what goes in the blanks in the shan and lao columns. if you think that more 
than one answer is possible, write the likeliest one first, then the second-likeliest, and so on.
