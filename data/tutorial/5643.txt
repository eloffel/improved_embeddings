pronunciation notes: a tilde (~) above a vowel means that it is pronounced nasally. the letter <x> repre-
sents a sound like english    sh,    and the letter <   > represents a glottal stop, or a catch in the throat like that 
represented by the hyphen in    uh-oh.    other letters are reasonably similar to their equivalents in spanish, jap-
anese, or latin.
