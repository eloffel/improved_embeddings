(o) do-this-do-that (1/3) 

hmong is a language of southern china and southeast asia, especially the countries of vietnam, laos, and 
thailand. one dialect of hmong that is spoken in all of these countries is called hmong daw (or white 
hmong). the sentences and phrases that you see below are from hmong daw. they are written in a writing 
system called rpa (romanized popular alphabet). in this writing system, the initial consonant of a syllable is 
written first, followed by the vowel. if this vowel is doubled in writing, it is pronounced as nasalized or with a 
following    ng    sound. last of all, a consonant symbol is used to represent the tone of the syllable (tone is a 
meaningful difference in pitch; for instance, mandarin chinese differentiates syllables with high, low, rising, and 
falling pitch). hmong daw has seven tones, one of which is indicated by the absence of any symbol. in this 
system, hmong is written as hmoob.
