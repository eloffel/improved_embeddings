(a) intuitive inuit (1/3) [10 points] 

the inuit live in the arctic regions of canada and greenland, and speak a language called inuktitut. the in-
uit used to be known as eskimos, but this term is now considered insulting. the writing system used for the 
inuktitut language is based on the one devised for writing cree, a native american language not related to 
inuktitut. the writing system is highly regular and systematic, which should make your task all the easier. 

one area of canada where inuit is spoken is called nunavut and its capital is iqaluit. here is how these two 
words are written: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nunavut   knk5  

iqaluit   

wclw5  

english has borrowed some words from the inuit, such as    igloo    which in inuktitut is written as wl  and is 
pronounced    ihlu   : the    hl    is a lateral fricative, like the ll sound in welsh, a bit like an    s    combined with an 
   l   .1 the    hl    is treated as a single sound.  

your task is to look at the text below     it   s the first part of the universal declaration of human rights     and 
to transcribe the underlined words into roman letters on the basis of the first four words which have been 
done for you.

(a) intuitive inuit (2/3) 

note that inuktitut uses the same numerals as english, and has the same punctuation marks (only commas 
and fullstops in this text) as in english. there is no distinction between upper case (capitals) and lower case  
letters. a dot above a symbol indicates that the vowel is long, which can be represented in transcription by 

doubling the vowel letter. the sequence    rk    is used for the [q] sound, a uvular plosive (like a    k   , but further 

back in the throat) and should be transcribed as a    q   . the sequence    ng    should be thought of as a single 

sound  (a velar nasal, as in the english word "sing"). the letter    j    represents a    y    sound. (as in "yank").

2you may have heard that the inuit (or eskimos) have lots of different words for    snow   . in fact this is a kind of urban legend. inukti-
tut has two main words for    snow    although lots of shades of meaning can be expressed by adding endings     you will have noticed 
that inuktitut words are very long.
