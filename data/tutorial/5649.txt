(d) kwak   wala word search (2/2) 

notes: some two-character sequences, like tl, dl, kw, gw, and ts, are treated as single letters in the  
kwak   wala alphabet.  a represents an    uh    sound.  k and g are pronounced like    k    and hard    g   , but with 
the tongue further back in the mouth.  x is pronounced like the    h    in    human   , and x like the    ch    in 
   bach   .  an apostrophe indicates that the sound is pronounced with increased pressure at the back of the 
throat. 
enter one character as it appears in the word search per cell.
