(e) shaw business (1/2) [10 points] 

the author george bernard shaw (author of pygmalion,1 which was later adapted as the musical my fair lady) 
saw the use of the latin (or roman) alphabet for english as a waste of time     the alphabet simply was not 
suited to write english. 

an infamous example of english pronunciation being at odds with its use of the roman alphabet is the se-
quence    ough.  consider the different pronunciations of ough in the following words: rough, through, hiccough, 
though, and bough. this should give you an idea why a spelling reform may be needed. 

shaw left money in his will to the inventor of a new (and better) script for english. kingsley read, among 
many others, entered the competition, and his alphabet was chosen as the best response to shaw   s challenge 
in 1958. read named his invention the    shavian alphabet    in honor of  shaw. 

some of the rules of shavian:  

     the majority of its characters simply represent an individual english sound.  however, a few can be used 

as abbreviations for a word. 

     shavian is based on a rhotic english accent     an accent in which all the r symbols are pronounced (such 

as american english where the word    rarer    is pronounced with 3 r-sounds). 

     there are no capital    letters    in shavian.

1pygmalion is about a linguistics professor trying to correct the pronunciation of a cockney flower seller called eliza (cockney being 
a dialect of british english used by dick van dyke in mary poppins). one of the first artificial intelligence programs, a chatbot, was 
named eliza, after the character in pygmalion.

you may have noticed that shavian has characters that are like the roman alphabet   s ascenders (letters that 
stick out in an upwards direction from the line of writing such as    f    and    h   ) and descenders (letters that go 
below the line of writing such as    g   ). ascenders are known as    tall characters    and descenders as    deep 
characters    in shavian. some tall and deep characters make deliberate pairs, such as: 

   and    

  and
