(g) phoenician fun (1/2) [10 points] 

the phoenician script can be dated at around 1050 bce, and from it the arabic, hebrew and by extension 
greek, roman, and cyrillic scripts evolved. 
 
the phoenician civilization was centered along the mediterranean coast in an area known as cana   an. the 
map below shows a number of phoenician cities and nearby cities that were important trading partners. the 
spellings reflect their pronunciation in phoenician. however, two of the cities on the map are shown with 
their modern names which are very different from what they were called in phoenician times.
