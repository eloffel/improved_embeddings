(j) stockholms tunnelbana (1/2) [15 points] 

the following is a list of stockholm metro stations, translated into english. 
 
actually, a few of them are pretty loose translations, and some are a bit over-literal.  (we adapted them 
from a humorous map published by the english-language swedish newsmagazine the local.)  nonetheless, we 
think you   ll be able to match up most of them.   
 
put the appropriate station number next to its english translation.
