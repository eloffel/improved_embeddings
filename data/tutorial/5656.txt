soon after maya delgado was hired by accounting giant jensen & nakamura, she was sent on a consulting as-
signment abroad. once at her destination, she was given two boxes (yellow and green) of statements from 
jensen & nakamura's branch offices in two countries in the region. each box contained thirteen folders. maya 
immediately figured out what the labels on the folders meant. not only that, but she soon realized that one 
folder in each box was a fake.
