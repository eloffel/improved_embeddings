the warlpiri people in australia organize themselves into eight different groups, called    skins.    your skin, 
which influences your interactions with the warlpiri people around you, is determined by your parents' skins 
and does not change during your entire life. in the diagram above, the eight boxes correspond to the eight 
skins. the horizontal rows indicate marriage correspondences. the arrows point from mother to child.  
 
for example: 
 
 
 
 
you ask some members of the warlpiri community about their family relations and they give you the follow-
ing information. all the information is correct, including the spellings. based on the data, determine the female 
names for the eight skins.  
 
for skin number 1, the males are "jakamarra" and the females are "nakamarra."
