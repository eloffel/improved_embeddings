___  1. 

did you never know 
what happiness is? 

kule kuleq thapanpichus 
taytallayri churyawarqa 

for what, god, 
did you create my suffering? 

the following is a poem from the peruvian poet sisku apu rimac (   sisco who talks to the spirits   ).  apu  
rimac wrote in both spanish and in his native language, quechua. varieties of quechua are spoken by  
roughly 10 million people in the andes mountains of peru, ecuador, and bolivia.  like the traditional poems 
and song lyrics that served as apu rimac   s inspiration, his poetry is frequently melancholy and mournful, and 
common themes include yearning for a lost love and the nostalgia of urban quechua for their mountain 
homelands. 
 
p1. we have taken the eight couplets from the quechua version of the poem, on the right, and scrambled 
them into a random order.  can you match them up to their english translations on the left?   (note:  
vicunya, kule, and puku are kinds of animal.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p2. how would you say the following in quechua? 
 
 

perhaps my mother was a vicunya; 
perhaps my father was a deer; 

maybe in the nest of the pukus 
my dear mother gave birth to me. 

 and for these reasons i cry 
 wandering through the highlands. 

maybe in the cradle of the kules 
my dear father engendered me 

wikunyachus mamay karqa 
tarukachus taytay karqa 

puku unya hina 
chiri wayra muchunaypaq 

puku pukuq qesanpichus 
mamallayri wachawarqa 

manataqchu yacharqanki 
imaynas kawka kayta 

kunan kuna waqanaypaq 
urqun qasan purinaypaq 

like the poor puku 
i endure the cold winds. 

kule unya kaqlla 
nyak'arispa waqanaypaq 

imapaqmi apu tayta 
nyak'ariyta kamarqanki 

or the poor kule 
i cry as i suffer.
