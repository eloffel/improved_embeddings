a. cat and mouse story (1/1)  

[10 points] 

   okay, so my cat pombled gwee the trowby, and she pombled gwee the foba. she pombled ippip the foba and 
pombled gorch the foba, and eventually she pombled ippip the trowby.    
 
your friend has apparently joined some strange new subculture and is trying out the slang. either that or he 
hit his head. whatever the cause, it looks like your friend has replaced the words down, into, up, run, mouse, 
and street with the words gwee, ippip, trowby, foba, pomble, and gorch. you can   t yet tell which is which, so you 
have this conversation: 
 

you: so, it started off with the cat pombling the trowby gwee. 
him: that   s nonsense; that   s not even a good sentence. 
you: could i say    the cat pombled the foba gwee?    
him: that   s just as bad. 
you: it was gwee the foba that the cat pombled, right? 
him: correct. 
you: then the cat pombled gorch the foba and ippip the foba. 
him: yes. 
you: and the cat pombled gorch the foba and ippip the trowby? 
him: you   re talking nonsense again. 
you: but it was ippip the trowby that the cat pombled? 
him: you don   t know how to use words, do you? 
you: the cat pombled the trowby ippip. 
him: that sounds a lot better.   

 
a-1 what do the following words mean? context clues are useful to give you hints, but to prove which  
       words mean which, you should also use your friend   s judgments about your attempted sentences.  

 

foba 
 
gwee 
 
gorch 

 
 

ippip 
 
pomble 
 
trowby
