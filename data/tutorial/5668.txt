the language below looks like some strange relative of dutch or swedish... and it is! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it   s american english, as written in a phrasebook for foreign tourists. why? well, it   s difficult to know how 
an english word is pronounced from how it is written, and it   s doubly hard if you   re completely unfamiliar 
with the language. the relationship between how english words are pronounced and how they   re spelled can 
be pretty arbitrary! 
 
so to help readers with the unfamiliar language, this book used pronunciation guides that represent the actual 
sounds of english words more systematically, and made use of spelling conventions from their own language. 
 
the thirty words above are taken from various word-lists in the phrasebook, and can be sorted into six cate-
gories of five words each. your task is to sort them into six categories and then name the categories     using 
the same writing system! we   ve started you off with one of the category names; can you figure out the rest? 
please remember to write your answers in    freisbuk language    (e.g,    n  mb  rs   ) and not in real english.
