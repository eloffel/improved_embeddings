arrernte is an australian aboriginal language, spoken mainly in and around alice springs, in the center of the 
country.  it is one of the largest aboriginal languages, spoken by both adults and children and taught in 
schools such as the yipirinya school in alice springs.1 
 
when written, arrernte uses the same alphabet we use for english.  some combinations of letters signal spe-
cial sounds, in the same way that english 'th' represents a sound that is not a combination of the 't' and 'h' 
sounds. for example, 'rr' represents the single sound of a rolled r,  'rl' indicates an l with the tongue tip 
touching higher and further back, and 'th' indicates a t-like sound with the tongue further forward, touching 
the back of the upper teeth.
