spencer, a computational linguist trying to lessen the amount of time he spends on email, writes a simple 
find-and-replace script that he hopes will mean he spends a little less time typing out language names. 
 
the script goes through his emails before they   re sent and automatically replaces certain two letter iso 639-
1 language codes (like fr) with the full names of the languages (like french): 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

iso 639-1 

code 

language name 

ce 

ch 

en 

fr 

he 

is 

ro 

chechen 

chamorro 

english 

french 

hebrew 

icelandic 

romanian 

 
things seem to be going great    until he starts getting some very confused replies, like the following:
