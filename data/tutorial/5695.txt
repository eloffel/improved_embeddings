(n) stopping and flapping in warlpiri (1/3) 

(10 points) 

warlpiri is an australian language spoken in the tanami desert area of the northern territory of australia.  
approximately 2,000 people speak warlpiri as their first language, and at least another 1,000 speak it as their 
second or third language.  the traditional warlpiri country is as big as many european countries or american 
states, so it is not surprising to find that warlpiri spoken in one part of warlpiri country differs in various 
ways from the language spoken in another part. 
 
one of the ways in which warlpiri dialects differ is in the relationship between a 't'-like sound written using 
the digraph rt and a different 'r'-like sound written as rd. 
 
the table below shows how the 'same' words are pronounced in each of three distinct dialects of warlpiri, 
which are simply labeled a, b and c.  study the data in the table and then answer the questions which follow.  
the sounds written using the digraphs rt, rd, rl, and rn, as well as the monograph r, all belong to a class of 
sounds called 'retroflex', made by curling back the tongue tip so that the underside of the tongue tip makes 
contact with the hard palate.
