a frequent problem in computational linguistics is that passages often use words that the computer simply 
doesn   t have in its dictionary.  online slang evolves very fast, people use foreign words in english passages, 
people make typos and invent new abbreviations, etc.  you could add new words to the dictionary as fast as 
you can find them and the next day the program could still be stumped by a new one! 
 
but the program doesn   t have to give up     instead, it can try to work out as much as it can.  various clues 
can tell a program whether something is a noun or a verb, a person or an inanimate object, etc., and you can 
even work out more!  the following is a webpage where customers have rated their most recent experience 
at gelda   s house of gelbelgarg.  even if you   ve never heard of any of these dishes, you can still figure out 
some things about them

l: liquids, undifferentiated masses, or masses of uncountably small things 
c: containers or measurements 

 
you won   t be able to categorize them with 100% certainty, but use the category that you think is most  

probable for each. choose a single category for each word below.

a hidden gem in lower uptown!  get the f  rsel-f  rsel 
with gorse-weebel and you   ll have a happy stomach for a 
week.  and top it off with a flebba of sweet-bolger while 
you   re at it! 

the portions at this place are just too big!  i   d rather 
have half the portions at a lower price     they just bring 
out too many g  ngerplose and too much meembel for 
me.

membered from the old country.  but the service was a 
bit lacking     nana ordered four gelbelgarg and the wait-
ress only brought two!

i found the food confusing and disorienting.  where is 
this from?  i randomly ordered the f  rsel-f  rsel and had 
to send them back!  three words: weird, weird, and 
weird. 

i went to wolserl last year for a holiday, and this is the 
real thing.  if you order the gelbelgarg, though, make 
sure you also get at least one rolse of sweet-bolger     
it   s how the locals like it!

not a great date spot! i got a gelbelgarg and a rolse of 
meembel, but my date was so disoriented that she just 
ended up with some gorse-weebel. :/

the food was pretty good    but i would have liked 
more gorse-weebel and fewer g  ngerplose.  you really 
feel like the chef is skimping on the good stuff..
