minangkabau is an austronesian language spoken by about 7 million people around the west sumatran city of 
padang in indonesia. its speakers generally also speak indonesian but minangkabau is a distinct language.  

minangkabau has a number of 'play languages' that people use for fun, like pig latin in english. ordinary  

language words are changed into play language by following just a few rules. one of these 'play languages' is 
called sorba while another is called solabar. 

 
here are some examples of standard minangkabau words and their sorba play language equivalents:

h3 (4 points). the other 'play language' is called solabar. the rules for converting a standard minangkabau 
 

word to solabar can be worked out from the following examples: 

standard minangkabau

baso 

campua 

makan 

solabar 

pulacar 

kalamar 

 english 

'language' 

'mix' 

'eat' 

what is the solabar equivalent of the sorba word tirpi 'money'? how many different possible answers 
are there based on the evidence that you have? list all of these hypotheses, from most likely to least 
likely. 

what one or two other words in minangkabau would you like to see translated to solabar in order 
to rule out all of these hypotheses except for one? the remaining hypothesis may or may not be the 
likeliest one that you selected above.
