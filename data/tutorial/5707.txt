(l) real money (1/2) 

languages often have special systems for counting specific sorts of objects     and money is no exception! 
speakers of cuzco quechua, a widely-spoken indigenous language of peru, employed a money-counting  
system still based on the old colonial spanish and peruvian coins the real and the medio (worth half a real).1 
although peru hasn   t issued a coin based on the real in almost 150 years     the current peruvian currency, the 
nuevo sol (notated sl.), divides not into reales but into 100 c  ntimos     the counting system depicted below was 
still in use in recent times.

1historical footnote: eight spanish reales made up a peso de a ocho or real de a ocho.  in english these were 
known as "pieces of eight" or "spanish doubloons", and in parrot talk as "awk! pieces of eight! awk!".

species (and thousands of varieties) of potatoes and other tubers.
