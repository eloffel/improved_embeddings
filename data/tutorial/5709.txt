(n) tale of kieu (1/3) 

vietnamese is now written using a writing system consisting of roman letters   just like english, but with lots 
of special markers or    diacritics    to show many distinctions between the sounds of many different vowels 
and six different tones. that writing system, called qu   c ng   , was developed by european missionaries, 
which is why vietnamese is written with the same letters as european languages. 
 
however, writing first came to vietnam from china. at first, vietnamese scholars actually wrote in chinese, 
and because of the status of chinese   as a language of government, literature, and culture   many chinese 
words were borrowed into vietnamese. when vietnamese scholars started writing their own language, it 
was easy to see how to write these borrowed words: just use the same character that was used when 
writing chinese. the following table gives a number of such characters used to write borrowings from  
chinese into vietnamese, their pronunciations in vietnamese, and their approximate translation in english: 

 

       m   c tree; lumber; wood; wooden 

     thi  n sky; heaven; god  
     thuo ng top; highest; go up         ki   n see, observe, perceive 
     g   ng labor; work; laborer          c  o tell; announce; inform; accuse 
       l  ng do; play or fiddle with; alley 
     nam south  
 
     b   nh illness; sickness  
            u peas; beans 
     trong pour; infuse; wash out        m  c bathe; cleanse; wash 
     n  n year; person   s age  
     mi ch silk  
     nh  n man; human; mankind 

       t  m heart; mind; intelligence; soul 
       b  , b     skin; hide; fur 

 

 

in order to write native vietnamese words, however, these writers had to invent new characters. they did 
this by using a strategy that was already used, within the chinese writing system, for creating new characters 
out of existing characters. in the chinese writing system, new characters can be made by combining two or 
more simpler characters. these components provide hints regarding either the meaning of a character or its 
pronunciation. components may be stacked on top of one another, place beside one another, or even placed 
so one surrounds another. while most of the characters given above are simple characters (with only one 
component) a few are complex characters (with more than one component). the writing system in which 
chinese characters and components are used to write vietnamese words is called ch    n  m. it was through 
the spread of this ch    n  m that vietnamese literature finally came into its own. in fact, the vietnamese  
national epic, the tale of kieu, was composed in ch    n  m.
