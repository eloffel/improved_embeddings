(o) possessed in vanuatu (1/3) 

vanuatu is a south pacific country with 74 populated islands and more than 100 languages belonging to the 
oceanic language family made up of languages spoken from papua new guinea to hawaii to easter island. in 
vanuatu,  speakers  of  these  languages  have  developed  interesting  ways  of  saying  that  something  belongs  to 
someone.   you are invited to examine some examples from the language spoken on the island of tanna. 
 
take a look at the examples of how possession is expressed in this language (given on the next page) and 
then answer the questions which follow.
