(p) khipu (1/3) 

of all the major bronze age civilizations, there is only one for which we cannot (yet) find evidence of writing: 
the inca empire. instead, a scribe-like class called the khipukamayuq kept records on collections of intricate 
knotted strings called khipu. 

these knots are not random: there is a meaningful pattern that you can discover if you examine them closely.  
each of these three groups of strings (two on this page, one on the next) is independent, but the same pat-
tern is used in each. patterns similar to this are frequent on real khipu, but only about 2/3 of the "khipu code" 
has been deciphered.  the rest remains mysterious, and linguists, mathematicians, and computer scientists 
are still trying to uncover their secrets.
