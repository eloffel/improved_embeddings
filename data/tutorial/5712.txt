(a) tenji karaoke (1/1) 

braille is a tactile writing system, based on a series of raised dots, that 
is widely used by the blind.  it was invented in 1821 by louis braille to 
write french, but has since been adapted to many other languages.  
english, which uses the roman alphabet just as french does, required 
very little adaptation, but languages that do not use the roman alpha-
bet, such as japanese, korean, or chinese, are often organized in a very 
different manner! 

n 

to the right is a japanese word written in the tenji (   dot 
characters   ) writing system.  the large dots represent the 
raised bumps; the tiny dots represent empty positions.
