(c) letters for cuzco (1/4) 

orthography design is the process of developing an alphabet and spelling rules for a 
language.  a good orthography has several features: 
 
* given a spoken word, there   s no question of how to spell it. 
* given a written word, there   s no question of how to pronounce it. 
* in the modern world, it   s increasingly important that it be reasonably easy to type! 
 
quechua is spoken today by millions of people in peru, ecuador, and bolivia, the de-
scendents of the citizens of the incan empire.  quechua speakers are rapidly joining 
the information age, and both google and microsoft windows now come in 
quechua! 
 
like in english, there are more sounds in quechua than there are letters on a key-
board, but there are ways around that.  for example, we can assign one letter to multi-
ple sounds so long as a reader can always predict, from its position in the word or 
from other letters in the word, which sound is meant.  so if the sound [b] only ever oc-
curs right after [m], and [p] never occurs right after [m], we can just write    p    for 
both, since you   ll be able to predict from the previous letter whether    p    means [b] or 
[p]. 
 
this    phonemic principle    is the central principle of most orthographies, not just be-
cause it reduces letters but also because our minds categorize sounds in the same way.
