notes:    you    is always plural in the sentences above. a squiggle over a vowel indi-
cates that it is nasal (pronounced partly through the nose). the letter    is pronounced 
like the sound in the middle of    pi  ata    or    onion   . the letter y is pronounced like 
the    u    in    cut   . the letter j and the apostrophe (   ) are specific consonants. 
guaran   is one of the official languages (along with spanish) of paraguay, where it is 
spoken by 94% of the population.
