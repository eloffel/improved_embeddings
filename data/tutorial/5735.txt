(k) tzolk'in (1/3)  

central to mayan thought and religion was the concept of time, which was held to be cyclical 
and without beginning or end.  accurate reckoning of the day was highly important for cere-
monial, political, and agricultural reasons, and to this end the mayas kept several calendars of 
different length, all cycling simultaneously, while also keeping track of the exact number of 
days since august 11, 3114 bc. 
the tzolk   in ritual and ceremonial calendar is the oldest and most important of these, and is not 
exclusively mayan     it was shared by all of the ancient civilizations of mexico, and predates 
classical mayan civilization by hundreds of years.  it is also the main calendar to have sur-
vived, and is still in use today in some mayan villages. 
given the conception of time as cyclical, it is appropriate that the tzolk   in has no identifiable 
beginning or end, but simply assigns names to days in an infinite loop.  below we   ve taken a 
calendar for our august and september, but inserted the day names according to the tzolk   in. 

k1. what are the mayan names of the days labeled a and b on the calendar?  draw the appro-
priate glyphs in the boxes below. 

a. 
 
  
  
 

b. 
 

k2.  where on the calendar would the following days fall?  write a c and a d on the appropri-
ate days on the following page. 

c. 

d. 

         

 

          

 

k3.  the two months shown are completely representative of the workings of the tzolk   in; 
there are no special sub-cycles,    leap    days, periods with fewer days than other periods, etc.  
knowing that, how often does the following day occur?
