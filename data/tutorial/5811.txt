deep learning with tensorflow

   deep learning with tensorflow by packt

   this is the code repository for [84]deep learning with tensorflow,
   published by [85]packt. it contains all the supporting project files
   necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

about the book

   deep learning is the step that comes after machine learning, and has
   more advanced implementations. machine learning is not just for
   academics anymore, but is becoming a mainstream practice through wide
   adoption, and deep learning has taken the front seat. as a data
   scientist, if you want to explore data abstraction layers, this book
   will be your guide. this book shows how this can be exploited in the
   real world with complex raw data using tensorflow 1.x.

   throughout the book, you   ll learn how to implement deep learning
   algorithms for machine learning systems and integrate them into your
   product offerings, including search, image recognition, and language
   processing. additionally, you   ll learn how to analyze and improve the
   performance of deep learning models. this can be done by comparing
   algorithms against benchmarks, along with machine intelligence, to
   learn from the information and determine ideal behaviors within a
   specific context.

   after finishing the book, you will be familiar with machine learning
   techniques, in particular the use of tensorflow for deep learning, and
   will be ready to apply your knowledge to research or commercial
   projects.

instructions and navigation

   all of the code is organized into folders. each folder starts with a
   number followed by the application name. for example, chapter02.

   the code will look like the following:
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant("hello tensorflow!")
>>> sess=tf.session()

   all the examples have been implemented using python version 2.7 on a
   ubuntu linux 64 bit including the tensorflow library version 1.0.1. you
   will also need the following python modules (preferably the latest
   version): pip bazel matplotlib numpy pandas preface . only for chapter
   8, advanced tensorflow programming and chapter 9, reinforcement
   learning, you will need the following frameworks: keras pretty tensor
   tflearn openai gym
