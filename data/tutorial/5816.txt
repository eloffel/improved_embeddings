   the limits of my language means the limits of my world.   

(l. wittgenstein)


   when jacques lacan proposed his psychoanalytical theory based on the
   influence of language on human beings, many auditors remained initially
   astonished. is language an actual limitation? in the popular culture,
   it isn   t. it cannot be! but, in a world where we keep on working with
   internal representations, it   s much more than a limitation: it   s a
   golden cage without a way out.

   first of all, an internal representation needs an external environment
   and, under some conditions, it must also be shared by a concrete number
   of people. a jungle, just like any other natural place, is a perfect
   starting point. however, an internal representation is more than a
   placeholder. thinking this way drives to dramatic mistakes. the word
      tree    is not an actual tree and never will be, but the word    tree    is
   an entity that transforms an environmental element into a something
   else. let   s call it though. it doesn   t matter. the only important thing
   is that such a new entity is a brick for an intelligent line of
   reasoning.

   let   s consider another example:    the treachery of images    painted by
   ren   magritte. of course, the painting is not a pipe, but from a
   certain viewpoint, it is! it   s a    pipe    because it can trigger an
   internal representational chain. a line that can start from the color
   of the wood and ends in the face of a tobacconist that sells similar
   pipes. similar pipes? does he sell paintings or posters? no    of course.
   that   s the representational link! in our mind, that    pipe    is
   potentially any pipe (with any shape, any color, any material and so
   forth), therefore, it is much more than a singular object. language has
   turned it into an almost almighty abstract representation.

   now the first question that arises is:    what about artificial
   intelligence?    we can surely state that all these concepts cope with
   intelligence and, with a minimal effort, it   s possible to find hundreds
   of papers whose goals are related to the idea to model abstract
   representational entities and manipulate them in complex tasks. a
   chatbot is a clear example of this approach. of course i   m not talking
   about domain-specific bots (which are a little bit more flexible faqs),
   but of all those attempts to create a program to chat with. a program
   that can answer questions like:    how are you?    (maybe it could be more
   interesting a question like    which is the vbe of your 345365th
   transistor?   ) or    did you enjoy your last trip?    (where? does a    where   
   exist for the chatbot?).

   when a couple of months ago, a facebook experiments failed in
   reproducing a good english verbal interaction (a language where the
   abstraction of number regressed into the repetition of the same
   placeholder word       i give one one one things   . you have two two cards),
   a huge mass of (intelligent, though) people started tweeting and
   posting:    an artificial intelligence created his     maybe it would be
   better    its        own language    and thousands of comments appeared like
   mushrooms after a storm.

   well, don   t be surprised: an artificial intelligence created its own
   language. that   s true. if you train a [36]id97 model, the internal
   id27 is an artificial representation that a human being isn   t
   able to understand (when the number of dimensions is higher than 3).
   but what about the context? the environment? absolutely absent. the
   reason is simple: these models are trained with human-generated data
   and learn to map (think about a [37]id195 model) an input to an
   output. (un)fortunately, this process needs a background: magritte
   needed a real pipe (maybe different, but probably an object to smoke
   from) and the first cave-dwellers needed real trees, real animals,
   before painting the hunting scenes upon the rocks. a map based on
   external relationships (defined by some mysterious agent) can explain a
   pavlovian conditioning, but it   s not able to justify how the language
   can co-create the reality.

   i   m not a pessimist. i do believe in science and technology. but, at
   the same time, i hate marketing! even when it   s ai-marketing. do we
   really want to study how an artificial intelligence can develop a
   language? well, let   s first define the environment. a robot that can
   explore a park has many more chances than a program trained with a huge
   sentence dataset. again, the point is on the goal: do we expect the
   robot to explore because we need it? if so, a proto-language can emerge
   as a necessity (reinforcement signals can be encoded and stored in some
   way). does it have a semantic structure? yes, if we don   t pretend to
      export    our semantics. no, if we keep asking the robot:    do you like
   the grass?    (the situation can worsen when somebody thinks to find an
   ai friend to chat with).

   moreover, let   s forget about english or esperanto. a language must
   emerge with its own rules, its own alphabet and maybe with its own
      shades   . a translation (if such robots are really interested   ) can be
   a later job. trying to anticipate it, even if we are a conquering
   people, can only drive to    empty clones   , even worse than cellular
   automata (which are wonderful mathematical expressions).

   i always remember and repeat the dialogue between alan turing and the
   policeman in    the imitation game   . the officer asked:    can a machine
   think?    and he answered:    yes, it can. but in its own way   .

        science is a beautiful gift to humanity; we should not distort it.   
     (a. p. j. abdul kalam) machine learning copes with data. all
     scenarios: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and
     reinforcement-based extracts pieces of information from the data and
     tries to generalize the rules they learn when unseen samples are
     presented.
