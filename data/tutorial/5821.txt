   in this multi-part series, we will explore how to get started with
   tensorflow. this tensorflow tutorial will lay a solid foundation to
   this popular tool that everyone seems to be talking about. the first
   part will focus on introducing tensorflow, go through some applications
   and touch upon the architecture.

   this series is excerpts from a webinar tutorial series i have conducted
   as part of the [15]united network of professionals. time to time i will
   be referring to some of the slides that i used there as part of the
   talk to make it clearer.

   please don   t miss out on the live webinars where i talk about
   everything i write. register yourself with our [16]upcoming webinars to
   know about the topics we will be discussing.

   this post is the first part of the multi-part series on a complete
   tensorflow tutorial

why tensorflow?

   well, for starters, it is an open source library from google.
   tensorflow has been gaining a lot of traction in the market given the
   rising popularity of neural networks and deep learning.

   many applications as of today have tensorflow embedded as part of their
   machine learning applications. some broad applications have been listed
   below    

applications

   some of the most popular cutting edge real world applications are using
   tensorflow.

   [25]tensorflow tutorial - applications

   they have reported great accuracy scores which keeps on increasing over
   time.
    1. image recognition     ever since alex krizhevsky winning the id163
       challenge in 2012, convolutional neural networks have burst out in
       popularity and almost every month new architectures are surfacing
       with increased accuracy scores. tensorflow is one of the foremost
       implementation choices for these applications
    2. virtual assistant     chatbots have seen a significant rise in
       popularity in the year 2017. it is expected to maintain this trend.
       understanding computational linguistics and deliver a high-end deep
       learning algorithm that can process text is one of the most sought
       after skills as of today.
    3. self-driving cars     they use a variety of sensory inputs to
       determine every move, be it changing lanes to detecting traffic
       signals and stopping, detecting humans, other cars etc. tensorflow
       is used in almost all the current self-driving cars that we see.

what is tensorflow?

     an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms and an
     implementation for executing such algorithms; a framework for
     creating ensemble algorithms for today   s most challenging problems.

   [26]tensorflow tutorial - getting started

   tensorflow is not just a pre-defined library of algorithms that you can
   use out of the box. it is a low-level library where you can orchestrate
   and design complex algorithms. it is very flexible in the way it lets
   you define your own [27]computation graph.

   for people not wanting to leverage such low-level flexibilities,  there
   is a rich set of pre-defined algorithms that you can use off the shelf.
   these algorithms have been the architectures used in latest research
   papers known to push accuracies to new levels.

   so, in a way id21 (a feature of tensorflow to be discussed
   later in the series) brings the industry and academia together.

tensorflow environment

   let   s explore the tensorflow environment and how the flexible
   architecture makes implementation so easy.

language interface

   all technology components need an underlying programming language so
   that a programmer can talk to the technology. tensorflow is one such
   technologies that requires sdks in other programming languages to
   implement.

   right now, tensorflow supports the following only    
    1. python     tensorflow is available as a python library. most of the
       operating system dependencies have been resolved, so apart from
       windows (which required python 3.5), tensorflow supports all
       combinations of operating systems/python versions.
    2. c++     tensforflow is available in c++ in the form of an api.

   for all of this series, we will only be using the python
   implementations to build our solutions. i will happily willing to make
   c++ additions in case someone is willing to contribute.

   [28]tensorflow tutorial - environment

execution environment

   once the computation graph has been specified, it is sent to the
   execution environment to be executed. the execution master uses process
   execution device commands, to determine where to execute code.

   this means you can execute code locally in your laptop with a cpu of a
   gpu if you have one. it also means you can trigger remote execution to
   a distributed system with multiple nodes, cpus and gpus.

   [29]tensorflow tutorial - execution env

   this means you can build code and try it out with small data in your
   local machine. if it works out, you can easily scale it across large
   clusters with very little effort on your part.

computation graph

   a tensor is an n-dimensional structure    
     * n=0 : single value
     * n=1: list of values
     * n=2 : matrix of values


example: (a+b) * c

   [30]tensorflow tutorial - computation graph

   as in the above diagram, we start with two tensors a and b. since these
   can be multi-dimensional arrays of data, they can be taken to be
   complex data objects     such as images. therefore, it might produce an
   n-dimensional array     which might be the result of multiplying the
   pixels of the two images, although i am not sure what the output image
   might look like.

   the result is then added with another multi-dimensional array c, which
   might result in varying brightness of the images perhaps (depends on
   whether c is positive or negative).

   i will be referring to these computation graphs as simply graphs.

   these tensors flow through and are altered by operations (multiply and
   add for example). the flow of these tensors through these operations is
   what renders the name tensorflow.

pre-requisites

   skills required                              skills not required
   knowledge of at least 1 programming language expertise in tensorflow
   basic math and statistics                    expertise in python
   passion to understand                        advanced math and statistics

conclusion

   i hope this sets the expectations for what is about to come. in the
   next post we will talk about installing and a simple tensorflow
   implementation.

   please don   t miss out on the live webinars where i talk about
   everything i write. register yourself with our [31]upcoming webinars to
   know about the topics we will be discussing. happy coding!
