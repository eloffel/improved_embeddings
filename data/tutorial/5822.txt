   in this multi-part series, we will explore how to get started with
   tensorflow. this tensorflow tutorial will lay a solid foundation to
   this popular tool that everyone seems to be talking about. the second
   part is a tensorflow tutorial on getting started, installing and
   building a small use case.

   this series is excerpts from a webinar tutorial series i have conducted
   as part of the [15]united network of professionals. time to time i will
   be referring to some of the slides that i used there as part of the
   talk to make it clearer.

   please don   t miss out on the live webinars where i talk about
   everything i write. register yourself with our [16]upcoming webinars to
   know about the topics we will be discussing.

   this post is the first part of the multi-part series on a complete
   tensorflow tutorial    
     * [17]part 1: introduction
     * part 2: getting started
     * part 3: building the first model

installing tensorflow

   if you have tensorflow already installed, you can just skip to the next
   section.

1. operating system

   different operating systems have different means to install tensorflow.
   you can go through the [22]documentation for more details. i will just
   be discussing what is essential to get started.
     * click the install tab

   [23]tensorflow getting started
     * the following guides explain how to install a version of tensorflow
       that enables you to write applications in python.
          + [24]installing tensorflow on ubuntu
          + [25]installing tensorflow on mac os x
          + [26]installing tensorflow on windows
          + [27]installing tensorflow from sources

   try to follow the most basic structures with the best practices already
   mentioned in the documentation.

2. gpu

   installing tensorflow with gpu requires you to have nvidia gpu. amd
   video cards are not supported with tensorflow. nvidia uses low level
   gpu computing system called cuda. it is an nvidia proprietary software.

   one can go the opencl way with amd but as of now it won   t work with
   tensorflow.

   also, all nvidia devices are not supported. here is a list from the
   [28]nvidia documentation listing the supported gpus.

   [29]tensorflow tutorial - cuda

3. environment

   there are three environments you can leverage to setup tensorflow    
    1. direct     this is just a typical way of installing any software
       library. it directly interacts with the installed operating system
       and installs tensorflow like any other library. pip is the
       preferred way of direct installation
    2. virtual environment     to all who are unaware of the advantages of a
       python virtual environment, a virtualenv is like a parallel python
       installation apart from the default python that is already
       installed in our system. installing libraries in a virtual
       environment keeps the libraries separate and you will never have a
       clash of compatibility with the other libs that are installed
       directly. if anything goes wrong, you can just fire up a new
       virtual environment and start afresh
    3. docker container     this is another way of installing tensorflow.
       think of a typical vmware image of a guest operating system to be a
       docker container on steroids. docker can be used to start
       containers that have different environments at the operating
       system, thereby allowing you to have an environment completely
       separate to what you have on your host machine. all details are
       clearly labelled out in the tensorflow documentation

4. python version

   the 2.7 version from python 2 and 3.3 or later from python 3 are
   supported. this holds true for all operating systems.

     as of now, windows only supports version 3.5. python 2 with windows
     is a combination that is not supported

verifying the installation

   once tensorflow is installed, irrespective of the operating system,
   environment or the the python version, you should run the following
   script to verify tensorflow is up and running.
# import tensorflow
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.session()

# verify we can print a string
hello = tf.constant("hello unp from tensorflow")
print(sess.run(hello))

# perform some simple math
a = tf.constant(20)
b = tf.constant(22)
print('a + b = {0}'.format(sess.run(a + b)))

   once this code runs and prints the output successfully,
   congratulations! you have successfully installed tensorflow. let   s move
   to the next section to build our first application

before building your first tensorflow model

tensors

   the following are the three types of tensors we need to learn before
   getting started.
   type        description
   constant    constant values
   variable    values adjusted in the graph
   placeholder used to pass data in the graph

   before diving into the hands on, i just want to introduce a few more
   terms in the tensorflow terminologies along with their meanings.

   [30]tensorflow tutorial - tensor types
    1. rank     dimensionality of a tensor
    2. shape     shape of a tensor. related to rank

   the above diagram should help in understanding. below we have the
   different data types in supported by tensorflow.

   [31]tensorflow tutorial - getting started

   note: quantitized values [qint8, qint16 and quint8] are special values
   for tensorflow that help reduce the size of the data. in fact, google
   has gone to the extent of introducing tensorflow processing units
   (tpus) to speed up computation by leveraging quantitized values

prepare the data

   we will quickly generate some data to get started. in this case, we
   will generate house size to predict house prices. the goal here isn   t
   to build a sophisticated house price predictor, but to get things
   moving in tensorflow in the simplest possible way.

   we will generate some data using the below python code    
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#  generation some house sizes between 1000 and 3500 (typical sq ft of house)
num_house = 160
np.random.seed(42)
house_size = np.random.randint(low=1000, high=3500, size=num_house )

# generate house prices from house size with a random noise added.
np.random.seed(42)
house_price = house_size * 100.0 + np.random.randint(low=20000, high=70000, size
=num_house)

# plot generated house and size
plt.plot(house_size, house_price, "bx")  # bx = blue x
plt.ylabel("price")
plt.xlabel("size")
plt.show()

   this generates the below output [this is a plot of the generated data]
[32] tensorflow tutorial- house price plot

   next, we are going to normalize the data. this helps in bringing the
   data in the same scale which in turn can lead to faster convergence.

   we also split it into train and test data as part of the data science
   best practices. we will train our model on the training data and test
   our model on the test data to see how accurate our predictions are.
# you need to normalize values to prevent under/overflows.
def normalize(array):
    return (array - array.mean()) / array.std()

# define number of training samples, 0.7 = 70%.  we can take the first 70% since
 the values are randomized
num_train_samples = math.floor(num_house * 0.7)

# define training data
train_house_size = np.asarray(house_size[:num_train_samples])
train_price = np.asanyarray(house_price[:num_train_samples:])

train_house_size_norm = normalize(train_house_size)
train_price_norm = normalize(train_price)

# define test data
test_house_size = np.array(house_size[num_train_samples:])
test_house_price = np.array(house_price[num_train_samples:])

test_house_size_norm = normalize(test_house_size)
test_house_price_norm = normalize(test_house_price)

conclusion

   i hope this sets the expectations for what is about to come. in the
   next post we will build our first tensorflow model.

   please don   t miss out on the live webinars where i talk about
   everything i write. register yourself with our [33]upcoming webinars to
   know about the topics we will be discussing. happy coding!

   in the next part, we will finally be ready to train our first
   tensorflow model on house prices. it will give us our first hands on
   experience with tensorflow!
