prerequisites for this class

     * proficiency in python
       all class assignments will be in python (using numpy and tensorflow
       and optionally keras). there is a tutorial [22]here for those who
       aren't as familiar with python. if you have a lot of programming
       experience but in a different language (e.g. c/ c++/ matlab/
       javascript) you will probably be fine.
     * college calculus, id202 (e.g. math 51, cme 100)
       you should be comfortable taking derivatives and understanding
       matrix vector operations and notation.
     * basic id203 and statistics (e.g. cs 109 or other stats
       course)
       you should know basics of probabilities, gaussian distributions,
       mean, standard deviation, etc.
     * foundations of machine learning
       we will be formulating cost functions, taking derivatives and
       performing optimization with id119. either cs 221 or cs
       229 cover this background. some optimization tricks will be more
       intuitive with some knowledge of id76.

course description

   to realize the dreams and impact of ai requires autonomous systems that
   learn to make good decisions. id23 is one powerful
   paradigm for doing so, and it is relevant to an enormous range of
   tasks, including robotics, game playing, consumer modeling and
   healthcare. this class will provide a solid introduction to the field
   of id23 and students will learn about the core
   challenges and approaches, including generalization and exploration.
   through a combination of lectures, and written and coding assignments,
   students will become well versed in key ideas and techniques for rl.
   assignments will include the basics of id23 as well
   as deep id23     an extremely promising new area that
   combines deep learning techniques with id23. in
   addition, students will advance their understanding and the field of rl
   through a final project.
   you can find last year (winter 2018) materials [23]here.

learning outcomes

   by the end of the class students should be able to:
     * define the key features of id23 that
       distinguishes it from ai and non-interactive machine learning (as
       assessed by the exam).
     * given an application problem (e.g. from id161, robotics,
       etc), decide if it should be formulated as a rl problem; if yes be
       able to define it formally (in terms of the state space, action
       space, dynamics and reward model), state what algorithm (from
       class) is best suited for addressing it and justify your answer (as
       assessed by the project and the exam).
     * implement in code common rl algorithms (as assessed by the
       homeworks).
     * describe (list and define) multiple criteria for analyzing rl
       algorithms and evaluate algorithms on these metrics: e.g. regret,
       sample complexity, computational complexity, empirical performance,
       convergence, etc (as assessed by homeworks and the exam).
     * describe the exploration vs exploitation challenge and compare and
       contrast at least two approaches for addressing this challenge (in
       terms of performance, scalability, complexity of implementation,
       and theoretical guarantees) (as assessed by an assignment and the
       exam).

textbooks

   there is no official textbook for the class but a number of the
   supporting readings will come from:
     * id23: an introduction, sutton and barto, 2nd
       edition. this is available for free [26]here and references will
       refer to the final pdf version available [27]here.

   some other additional references that may be useful are listed below:
     * id23: state-of-the-art, marco wiering and martijn
       van otterlo, eds. [[28]link]
     * artificial intelligence: a modern approach, stuart j. russell and
       peter norvig.[[29]link]
     * deep learning, ian goodfellow, yoshua bengio, and aaron courville.

grade breakdown

     * assignment 1: 10%
     * assignment 2: 20%
     * assignment 3: 16%
     * midterm: 25%
     * quiz: 5%
          + individual: 4.5%
          + group: 0.5%
     * course project: 24%

     * proposal: 1%
     * milestone: 2%
     * poster presentation: 5%
     * paper: 16%
     * if you choose to do the default project/4th assignment, your
       breakdown will instead be
          + poster presentation: 5%
          + paper/assignment write up: 19%

late day policy

     * you can use 6 late days.
     * a late day extends the deadline by 24 hours.
     * you are allowed up to 2 late days per assignment. if you hand an
       assignment in after 48 hours, it will be worth at most 50%. no
       credit will be given to assignments handed in after 72 hours    
       contact us if you think you have an extremely rare circumstance for
       which we should make an exception. this policy is to ensure that
       feedback can be given in a timely manner.
     * you can use late days on the project proposal (up to 2) and
       milestone (up to 2). no late days are allowed for the poster
       presentation and final report. any late days on the project writeup
       will decrease the potential score on the project by 25%. to use a
       late day on the project proposal or milestone, group members cannot
       pool late days: in order words, to use 1 late day for project
       proposal/ milestone all gorup members must have at least 1 late day
       remaning.

exams & quizzes

     * there will be a midterm and quiz, both in class. see the
       [32]schedule for the dates
     * conflicts: if you are not able to attend the in class midterm and
       quizzes with an official reason, please email us at
       [33]cs234-qa@cs.stanford.edu, as soon as you can so that an
       accommodation can be scheduled. (historically this is either to ask
       you to take the exam remotely at the same time, or to schedule an
       alternate exam time).
     * notes for the exams: you are welcome to bring a 1-sided 1 (letter
       sized) page of handwritten or typed notes to the midterm. for the
       quiz you are welcome to bring a double sided (letter sized) page of
       handwritten or typed notes. no calculators, laptops, cell phones,
       tablets or other resources will be allowed.

assignments, course project and submission process

     * assignments: see [34]assignments page where all the assignments
       will be posted.
     * course project: see the [35]course project page for more details on
       the course project.
     * computing resources: we will have some cloud resources available
       for assignments 2 and 3 and the project. instructions for how to
       access these will be announced prior to assigment 2.
     * submission process: the submission instructions for the assignments
       and the project can also be found on the [36]assignments page.

office hours

   emma's office hours will be held in [37]gates 218. ca's office hours
   starts from thursday januray 10, please see [38]calendar for time and
   location.
   for both in-person and online scpd office hours, you will need to
   register an account on [39]queuestatus. when you wish to join the
   queue, click "sign up" at the [40]cs234-winter 2019 queue. be sure to
   enter your email when you "sign up"; this is a way for the ca to
   contact you. look for announcements on the left panel for more
   information. for online office hours, you will need to install zoom
   (instructions below) to video call with the ca: the ca will contact you
   via zoom when he/she reaches you in the queue.
   instructions for installing zoom:
     * linux
          + go to the [41]zoom client for linux page and download the
            correct linux package for your linux distribution type, os
            architecture and version.
          + follow the linux installation instructions [42]here.
     * mac
          + download zoom installer [43]here.
          + installation instructions can be found [44]here.
     * windows
          + go to [45]stanford zoom and select 'launch zoom'.
          + click 'host a meeting'; nothing will launch but this will give
            a link to 'download & run zoom'.
          + click on 'download & run zoom' to obtain and download
            'zoom_launcher.exe'.
          + run 'zoom_launcher.exe' to install.

attendance

   attendance is not required but is encouraged. sometimes we may do in
   class exercises or discussions and these are harder to do and benefit
   from by yourself. however, if you are not able to attend class, the
   class is recorded. it has previously been shown that watching lecture
   videos in small groups with one person pausing to facilitate discussion
   can yield student performance as high as attending lectures live. in
   prior years, some students have watched videos in small groups, so we
   encourage you to consider this if you are unable to attend a particular
   lecture or if you   re participating in the class as a scpd student. i am
   always excited to hear about new ways students find to effectively
   learn the material, so sharing such tips is always appreciated.

communication

   we believe students often learn an enormous amount from each other as
   well as from us, the course staff. therefore to facilitate discussion
   and peer learning, we request that you please use [46]piazza for all
   questions related to lectures, homeworks and projects.
   for scpd students, if you have generic scpd specific questions, please
   email [47]scpdsupport@stanford.edu or call 650-741-1542. in case you
   have specific questions related to being a scpd student for this
   particular class, please contact us at [48]cs234-qa@cs.stanford.edu.
   for exceptional circumstances that require us to make special
   arrangements, please email us at [49]cs234-qa@cs.stanford.edu. for
   example, such a situation may arise if a student requires extra days to
   submit a homework due to a medical emergency, or if a student needs to
   schedule an alternative midterm date due to events such as conference
   travel etc. they will be considered and approved on a case by case
   basis.
   you will be awarded with up to 2% extra credit if you answer other
   students' questions in a substantial and helpful way on piazza.

academic collaboration and misconduct

   i care about academic collaboration and misconduct because it is
   important both that we are able to evaluate your own work (independent
   of your peer   s) and because not claiming others    work as your own is an
   important part of integrity in your future career. i understand that
   different institutions and locations can have different definitions of
   what forms of collaborative behavior is considered acceptable. in this
   class, for written homework problems, you are welcome to discuss ideas
   with others, but you are expected to write up your own solutions
   independently (without referring to another   s solutions). for coding,
   you are allowed to do projects in groups of 2, but for any other
   collaborations, you may only share the input-output behavior of your
   programs. this encourages you to work separately but share ideas on how
   to test your implementation. please remember that if you share your
   solution with another student, even if you did not copy from another,
   you are still violating the honor code. in terms of the final project,
   you are welcome to combine this project with another class assuming
   that the project is relevant to both classes, given that you take prior
   permission of the class instructors. if your project is an extension of
   a previous class project, you are expected to make significant
   additional contributions to the project.
   we periodically run similarity-detection software over all submitted
   student programs, including programs from past quarters and any
   solutions found online on public websites. anyone violating the
   stanford university [50]honor code will be referred to the office of
   judicial affairs. if you think you made a mistake (it can happen,
   especially under stress or when time is short!), please reach out to
   emma or the head ca; the consequences will be much less severe than if
   we approach you.

students with documented disabilities

   students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of
   a disability must initiate the request with the office of accessible
   education (oae). professional staff will evaluate the request with
   required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and
   prepare an accommodation letter for faculty dated in the current
   quarter in which the request is being made. students should contact the
   oae as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate
   accommodations. the oae is located at 563 salvatierra walk
   (650-723-1066, [51]http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).

credit/no credit enrollment

   if you're enrolled in the class on credit/no credit status, you will be
   graded on work as usual per standard stanford rules. the only
   distinction with those taking the class for letter grade is that you
   must obtain a c- (c minus) grade or higher in the class, for you to be
   marked as cr. in practice, potential options to achieve this would be
   such as (a) doing well on all assignments, the exam and the quiz, but
   no completing a project, or (b) doing a c- average on all aspects of
   the course or (c) doing poorly on the exam but doing well on all the
   assignments and a project.
