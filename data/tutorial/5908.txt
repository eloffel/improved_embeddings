morphological-reinflection

   source code for the paper: [75]morphological inflection generation with
   hard monotonic attention.

   requires [76]dynet. you should compile the aligner before running
   hard_attention.py by running make while in the src directory.

   usage:
hard_attention.py [--dynet-mem mem][--input=input] [--hidden=hidden] [--feat-inp
ut=feat] [--epochs=epochs] [--layers=layers] [--optimization=optimization] [--re
g=id173][--learning=learning] [--plot] [--eval] [--ensemble=ensemble] t
rain_path dev_path test_path results_path sigmorphon_path...

   arguments:
     * train_path train set path
     * dev_path development set path
     * test_path test set path
     * results_path results file (to be written)
     * sigmorphon_path sigmorphon repository root containing data, src
       dirs (available here:
       [77]https://github.com/ryancotterell/sigmorphon2016)

   options:
     * -h --help show this help message and exit
     * --dynet-mem mem allocates mem bytes for dynet
     * --input=input input embeddings dimension
     * --hidden=hidden lstm hidden layer dimension
     * --feat-input=feat feature embeddings dimension
     * --epochs=epochs number of training epochs
     * --layers=layers number of layers in lstm
     * --optimization=optimization chosen optimization method
       adam/sgd/adagrad/momentum/adadelta
     * --reg=id173 id173 parameter for optimization
     * --learning=learning learning rate parameter for optimization
     * --plot draw a learning curve plot while training each model
     * --eval run evaluation on existing model (without training)
     * --ensemble=ensemble ensemble model paths, separated by comma

   for example:
python hard_attention.py --dynet-mem 4096 --input=100 --hidden=100 --feat-input=
20 --epochs=100 --layers=2 --optimization=adadelta  /users/roeeaharoni/research_

 which employs
    a hard attention mechanism, inspired by the nearly-monotonic alignment commo
nly
    found between the characters in a word and the characters in its inflection.
 we
    evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection
    generation datasets and show that it provides state of the art results in
    various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches. finall

    we present an analysis of the continuous representations learned by both the
    hard and soft (bahdanau, 2014) id12 for the task, shedding some
    light on the features such models extract.},
