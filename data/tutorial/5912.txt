welcome!

   the million song dataset is a freely-available collection of audio
   features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.

   its purposes are:
     * to encourage research on algorithms that scale to commercial sizes
     * to provide a reference dataset for evaluating research
     * as a shortcut alternative to creating a large dataset with apis
       (e.g. the echo nest's)
     * to help new researchers get started in the mir field

   the core of the dataset is the feature analysis and metadata for one
   million songs, provided by [15]the echo nest. the dataset does not
   include any audio, only the derived features. note, however, that
   sample audio can be fetched from services like [16]7digital, using
   [17]code we provide.

   the million song dataset is also a cluster of complementary datasets
   contributed by the community:
     * [18]secondhandsongs dataset -> cover songs
     * [19]musixmatch dataset -> lyrics
     * [20]last.fm dataset -> song-level tags and similarity
     * [21]taste profile subset -> user data
     * [22]thisismyjam-to-msd mapping -> more user data
     * [23]tagtraum genre annotations -> genre labels
     * [24]top magd dataset -> more genre labels

   the million song dataset started as a collaborative project between
   [25]the echo nest and [26]labrosa. it was supported in part by the nsf.

how to get started

   to get a sense of the dataset, you can look at this [27]description of
   one of the million songs.

   to start your own experiments, you can [28]download the entire dataset
   (280 gb). we also provide a [29]subset of 10,000 songs (1%, 1.8 gb
   compressed) for a quick taste.

   while waiting for the download, take a look at the [30]faq, which
   includes a list of all the fields in the database.

   we also have a set of suggested [31]tasks, including snippets of code
   to get you started.

   please [32]contact us if you have any questions about the dataset and
   how to use it. you can also try browsing and posting on our [33]forum
   (registration required).
