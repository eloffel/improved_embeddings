text summarization using single value decomposition

   by [107]bicorner.com on [108]march 28, 2016     ( [109]leave a comment )

   text sum in today   s world with such a tremendous amount of data
   available on the internet and with same amount of time to actually read
   everything, it has necessitated the need to explore techniques which
   can extract relevant summaries quickly and most efficiently. text
   summarization can be defined as a method to preserve the most important
   and relevant information from a single or multiple related documents in
   the most concise manner. over the past few years this problem has been
   handled from different perspectives using multiple paradigms.

   in this blog i am going to describe how to handle text summarization
   using single value decomposition (svd). there are a lot of papers
   published on this topic, but most of them are difficult to interpret
   for a beginner as a lot of mathematical formulas and jargons are used.
   i hope after reading this blog you will understand the theory behind
   text summarization using svd.

   let   s begin by briefly understanding some basic background of single
   value decomposition.

   img1


   consider the transformation (a[mxn]) shown on the left. this
   transformation helps us to go from a 2-dimensional space to a
   3-dimensional space. the a[mxn ]matrix does this transformation from a
   2-dimensional space (b[nx1]) to a 3-dimensional space (c[mx1]). let   s
   look at how this transformation is achieved.



   img2


   we achieve this by 1^st travelling to the appropriate space in the
   2-dimensional space (u matrix) then we travel across to the other space
   (s matrix) and then finally to the desired position in the
   3-dimensional space (v matrix). so any non-square matrix can be
   factorized as shown into u, s and v matrices.


   now we can factorize the given data matrix as follows:

   img3

   u matrix: matrix which explains what is happening in row-space
   v matrix: matrix which what is happening in column-space
   s matrix: matrix which achieves this transformation

   so by doing this we have divided the input space in 3 components, 1^st
   which only talks about the row-space, 2^nd which talks about the
   column-space and the 3^rd which actually brings about this
   transformation.

   you will shortly understand why we looked at this matrix transformation
   and how this is related to text summarization. but before we apply the
   above intuition of svd to text summarization context, let   s look at the
   different types of text summarization methods.

   img4

   in this bog we will discuss the single document, generic and extractive
   method of text summarization. following are the broad 5 steps on text
   summarization.

   img5

   let   s look at some of the most common pre-processing techniques that
   can be applied for any id111 algorithm. pre-processing is the
   structured representation of the original text.

   img6

   now that we have created the base dataset for the svd input by
   preprocessing the unstructured text data, the next step is to transform
   the data in a format that is suitable for the svd algorithm. the
   columns of the matrix represent the sentences of the input text and the
   rows represent the words.

   img7

   the skeleton of the input matrix is as shown above but the question at
   hand is to determine how we fill the individual cell values. the cells
   are filled to represent the importance of words in each of the
   sentences. this input matrix is a very sparse matrix with the number of
   words much higher than the number of sentences. the method used to fill
   the input matrix affects the performance of text summarization using
   svd. i have explained in brief some of the techniques for filling the
   input matrix below.

   img8

   once you decide the method of filling the input matrix, run svd on the
   input matrix. svd is a method that models the relationships among words
   and sentences by combing different words into concepts, along with
   reduction in noise.

   img9

   interpretation of svd:
    1. derives mapping between m-dimensional space and r-dimensional
       singular vector space (rank of input matrix = r)
    2. breaks down the original document into r linearly-independent base
       vectors or concepts
    3. svd can semantically cluster words and sentences by finding salient
       and recurring patterns and representing them by 1 of the singular
       vectors
    4. the magnitude of the corresponding singular vector indicates the
       degree of importance of the pattern (salient feature/concept)
       within the document
    5. the sentence that best represents this pattern will have the
       largest index value
    6. after you run svd and get the most salient concepts in the text, we
       need to select the sentences as summary.

   following are some of the sentence selection algorithms:

   a. gong & liu (gong and liu, 2001): from each row of v^t matrix which
   represents a concept, the sentence with the highest score is selected.
   this is repeated until a predefined number of sentences are collected.

   b. steinberger & jezek (steinberger and jezek 2004): for each row of v
   matrix, the lengths of sentences using n concepts are calculated. the
   value n is given as an input parameter.    matrix values are also used
   as importance parameters in the length calculations.

   c. murray & renals & carletta (murray et al., 2005):from each row of
   v^t matrix, for each concept, one or more sentences with the higher
   scores are selected. the number of sentences to be collected for each
   concept is determined by getting the percentage of the related singular
   value over the sum of all singular values, which are represented in the
      matrix.

   text summarization in itself is a vast topic, but i hope after reading
   this blog  you have got the jist of text summarization using single
   value decomposition.
