dynamic topic models and the document influence model

   this implements topics that change over time (dynamic topic models) and
   a model of how individual documents predict that change.

   this code is the result of work by david m. blei and sean m. gerrish.

   (c) copyright 2006, david m. blei

   (c) copyright 2011, sean m. gerrish

   it includes software corresponding to models described in the following
   papers:

   [1] [83]d. blei and j. lafferty. dynamic topic models. in proceedings
   of the 23rd international conference on machine learning, 2006.

   [2] [84]s. gerrish and d. blei. a language-based approach to measuring
   scholarly impact. in proceedings of the 27th international conference
   on machine learning, 2010.

     __________________________________________________________________

   a. compiling

   you will need to have several libraries installed to compile this
   package. one of these is gsl-devel. depending on your package manager,
   you may be able to install this with one of the following commands:

   sudo aptitude install libgsl0-dev # ubuntu 10.04 sudo zypper install
   gsl-devel # opensuse 11.2 sudo yum install gsl-devel # centos 5.5

   you can make the main program by changing your working directory to
   dtm/ and typing:

   make

   this software has been compiled on ubuntu 10.04, opensuse 11.2, and
   centos 5.5. depending on your environment, you may need to install
   additional libraries.

   b. running

   once everything is compiled, you can run this software by typing the
   command "./main ", where flags is a list of command-line options. an
   example command and a description of the input and output files is
   given in dtm/sample.sh. you can see all command-line options by typing

   ./main --help

   (although we suggest you start out with the example in dtm/sample.sh).

   c. support and questions

   this software is provided as-is, without any warranty or support,
   whatsoever. if you have any questions about running this software, you
   can post your question to the topic-models mailing list at
   [85]topic-models@lists.cs.princeton.edu. you are welcome to submit
   modifications or bug-fixes of this software to the authors, although
   not all submissions may be posted.

   d. usage

   this progam takes as input a collection of text documents and creates
   as output a list of topics over time, a description of each document as
   a mixture of these topics, and (possibly) a measure of how
   "influential" each document is, based on its language.

   we have provided an example dataset, instructions for formatting input
   data and processing output files, and example command lines for running
   this software in the file dtm/sample.sh.

   e. changes

   changes in this version include:
     * change the default top_obs_var flag to 0.5 (from -1.0)
     * change to use more iterations and a tighter convergence criterion
       in each doc's e-step.
     * change to initialize random topics to be a bit more "flat".
