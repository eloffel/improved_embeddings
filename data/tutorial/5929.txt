prophet: forecasting at scale

   by: [34]sean j. taylor, [35]ben letham

   today facebook is [36]open sourcing prophet, a forecasting tool
   available in python and r. forecasting is a data science task that is
   central to many activities within an organization. for instance, large
   organizations like facebook must engage in capacity planning to
   efficiently allocate scarce resources and goal setting in order to
   measure performance relative to a baseline. producing high quality
   forecasts is not an easy problem for either machines or for most
   analysts. we have observed two main themes in the practice of creating
   a variety of business forecasts:
     * completely automatic forecasting techniques can be brittle and they
       are often too inflexible to incorporate useful assumptions or
       heuristics.
     * analysts who can produce high quality forecasts are quite rare
       because forecasting is a specialized data science skill requiring
       substantial experience.

   the result of these themes is that the demand for high quality
   forecasts often far outstrips the pace at which analysts can produce
   them. this observation is the motivation for our work building prophet:
   we want to make it easier for experts and non-experts to make high
   quality forecasts that keep up with demand.

   the typical considerations that    scale    implies, computation and
   storage, aren   t as much of a concern for forecasting. we have found the
   computational and infrastructure problems of forecasting a large number
   of time series to be relatively straightforward     typically these
   fitting procedures parallelize quite easily and forecasts are not
   difficult to store in id208 such as mysql or data
   warehouses such as hive.

   the problems of scale we have observed in practice involve the
   complexity introduced by the variety of forecasting problems and
   building trust in a large number of forecasts once they have been
   produced. prophet has been a key piece to improving facebook   s ability
   to create a large number of trustworthy forecasts used for
   decision-making and even in product features.

where prophet shines

   not all forecasting problems can be solved by the same procedure.
   prophet is optimized for the business forecast tasks we have
   encountered at facebook, which typically have any of the following
   characteristics:
     * hourly, daily, or weekly observations with at least a few months
       (preferably a year) of history
     * strong multiple    human-scale    seasonalities: day of week and time
       of year
     * important holidays that occur at irregular intervals that are known
       in advance (e.g. the super bowl)
     * a reasonable number of missing observations or large outliers
     * historical trend changes, for instance due to product launches or
       logging changes
     * trends that are non-linear growth curves, where a trend hits a
       natural limit or saturates

   we have found prophet   s default settings to produce forecasts that are
   often accurate as those produced by skilled forecasters, with much less
   effort. with prophet, you are not stuck with the results of a
   completely automatic procedure if the forecast is not satisfactory     an
   analyst with no training in time series methods can improve or tweak
   forecasts using a variety of easily-interpretable parameters. we have
   found that by combining automatic forecasting with analyst-in-the-loop
   forecasts for special cases, it is possible to cover a wide variety of
   business use-cases. the following diagram illustrates the forecasting
   process we have found to work at scale:

   [image-2.png?w=884]

   for the modeling phase of the forecasting process, there are currently
   only a limited number of tools available. rob hyndman   s excellent
   [37]forecast package in r is probably the most popular option, and
   google and twitter have both released packages with more specific time
   series functionality     [38]causalimpact and [39]anomalydetection,
   respectively. as far as we can tell, there are few open source software
   packages for forecasting in python.

   we have frequently used prophet as a replacement for the forecast
   package in many settings because of two main advantages:
    1. prophet makes it much more straightforward to create a reasonable,
       accurate forecast. the forecast package includes many different
       forecasting techniques (arima, exponential smoothing, etc), each
       with their own strengths, weaknesses, and tuning parameters. we
       have found that choosing the wrong model or parameters can often
       yield poor results, and it is unlikely that even experienced
       analysts can choose the correct model and parameters efficiently
       given this array of choices.
    2. prophet forecasts are customizable in ways that are intuitive to
       non-experts. there are smoothing parameters for seasonality that
       allow you to adjust how closely to fit historical cycles, as well
       as smoothing parameters for trends that allow you to adjust how
       aggressively to follow historical trend changes. for growth curves,
       you can manually specify    [40]capacities    or the upper limit of the
       growth curve, allowing you to inject your own prior information
       about how your forecast will grow (or decline). finally, you can
       specify irregular holidays to model like the dates of the super
       bowl, thanksgiving and black friday.

how prophet works

   at its core, the prophet procedure is an [41]additive regression model
   with four main components:
     * a piecewise linear or logistic growth curve trend. prophet
       automatically detects changes in trends by selecting changepoints
       from the data.
     * a yearly seasonal component modeled using fourier series.
     * a weekly seasonal component using dummy variables.
     * a user-provided list of important holidays.

   as an example, here is a characteristic forecast: log-scale page views
   of [42]peyton manning   s wikipedia page that we downloaded using the
   [43]wikipediatrend package. since peyton manning is an american
   football player, you can see that yearly seasonality plays and
   important role, while weekly periodicity is also clearly present.
   finally you see certain events (like playoff games he appears in) may
   also be modeled.

   [prophet_example_for_post.png?w=720]

   prophet will provide a components plot which graphically describes the
   model it has fit:

   [prophet_example_for_post2.png?w=648]

   this plot more clearly shows the yearly seasonality associated with
   browsing to peyton manning   s page (football season and the playoffs),
   as well as the weekly seasonality: more visits on the day of and after
   games (sundays and mondays). you can also notice the downward
   adjustment to the trend component since he has retired recently.

   the important idea in prophet is that by doing a better job of fitting
   the trend component very flexibly, we more accurately model seasonality
   and the result is a more accurate forecast. we prefer to use a very
   flexible regression model (somewhat like curve-fitting) instead of a
   traditional time series model for this task because it gives us more
   modeling flexibility, makes it easier to fit the model, and handles
   missing data or outliers more gracefully.

   by default, prophet will provide uncertainty intervals for the trend
   component by simulating future trend changes to your time series. if
   you wish to model uncertainty about future seasonality or holiday
   effects, you can run a few hundred hmc iterations (which takes a few
   minutes) and your forecasts will include seasonal uncertainty
   estimates.

   we fit the prophet model using [44]stan, and have implemented the core
   of the prophet procedure in stan   s probabilistic programming language.
   stan performs the map optimization for parameters extremely quickly (<1
   second), gives us the option to estimate parameter uncertainty using
   the [45]hamiltonian monte carlo algorithm, and allows us to re-use the
   fitting procedure across multiple interface languages. currently we
   provide implementations of prophet in both python and r. they have
   exactly the same features and by providing both implementations we hope
   to make our forecasting approach more broadly useful in the data
   science communities.

how to use prophet

   the simplest way to use prophet is to install the package from pypi
   (python) or cran (r). you can read our [46]quick start guide and dive
   into our [47]comprehensive documentation. if you   re looking for a fun
   source of time series data, we recommend trying the [48]wikipediatrend
   package which will download historical page views on wikipedia pages.

help us improve prophet

   there are two main ways to help us improve prophet. first, you can try
   it yourself and tell us about your results. we   re always looking for
   more use cases in order to understand when prophet performs well and
   when it does not. second, there are plenty of features that are left to
   build! [49]we welcome pull requests with bugfixes and new features.
   check out [50]how to contribute, we look forward to engaging with the
   community to make prophet even more broadly useful.
