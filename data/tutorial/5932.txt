     tech giants google, microsoft and facebook are all applying the
     lessons of machine learning to translation, but a small company
     called deepl has outdone them all and raised the bar for the field.
     its translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition,
     but more accurate and nuanced than any we   ve tried.

   [21]techcrunch
   usa

     deepl has also outperformed other services, thanks to more
     "french-sounding" expressions.

   [22]le monde
   france

     even though the translations from english by google and microsoft
     are quite good, deepl still surpasses them. we have translated a
     report from a french daily newspaper - the deepl result was perfect.

   [23]golem.de
   germany

     a quick test carried out for the combination english-italian and
     vice versa, even without any statistical pretensions, allowed us to
     confirm that the quality of the translation is really good.
     especially from italian into english.

   [24]la stampa
   italy

     the system recognizes the language quickly and automatically,
     converting the words into the language you want and trying to add
     the particular linguistic nuances and expressions.

   [25]abc
   spain

     indeed, a few tests show that deepl translator offers better
     translations than google translate when it comes to dutch to english
     and vice versa.

   [26]rtl z
   netherlands

     in the first test - from english into italian - it proved to be very
     accurate, especially good at grasping the meaning of the sentence,
     rather than being derailed by a literal translation.

   [27]la repubblica
   italy

     personally, i'm very impressed by what deepl is able to do and yes,
     i think it's really great that this new stage in the evolution of
     machine translation was not achieved with software from facebook,
     microsoft, apple or google, but by a german company. we like to make
     ourselves a little bit small and pretend that there is no one in
     this country who can stand up to the big players. deepl is a good
     example that it is possible.

   [28]mobile geeks
   germany

     deepl from germany could surpass google translate
     wired's quick test shows that deepl's results are indeed in no way
     inferior to those of the high-ranking competitors and, in many
     cases, even surpass them. the translated texts often read much more
     fluently; where google translate forms completely meaningless word
     chains, deepl can at least guess a connection.
