ssds 2017 - 2^nd int'l summer school on data science

center of research excellence for data science and advanced cooperative
systems, research unit for data science

   hands-on sessions for [76]2nd international summer school on data
   science organized by the center of research excellence for data science
   and advanced cooperative systems, [77]research unit for data science,
   from september 25-29, 2017 in split, croatia.

table of contents

     * [78]day 1 - introduction to tensorflow
     * [79]day 2 - convolutional neural networks for image classification
     * [80]day 3 - character-wise id38 with lstms
     * [81]day 4 - image segmentation and id164
     * [82]day 5 - id3

installation instructions

   the hands-on sessions are organized as jupyter notebooks, which you can
   run on your local computer. they were tested on windows, linux and mac
   os x within [83]anaconda (python 3.6) environment (version 4.4.0) with
   [84]tensorflow (version 1.3). it is adequate and recommended to have
   installed tensorflow with cpu-support only, since it is much easier to
   install.

   please follow below the specific instructions for your os (windows,
   linux, mac os x) to:
     * download & install anaconda (from
       [85]https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
     * create conda environment with python 3.6 and standard anaconda
       python packages (see [86]conda-cheatsheet)
     * install tensorflow 1.3 with cpu-support only by using pip (follow
       [87]https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

windows

   tensorflow installation was tested on 64-bit windows 7 and windows 10
   (there is currently no support for tensorflow on 32-bit systems). we
   recommend to install tensorflow in an anaconda environment. download
   anaconda (python 3.6) for windows from
   [88]https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and install it by running setup
   in administrator mode.

   afterwards, run anaconda command prompt in administrator mode and
     * create conda environment named ssds:
conda create --name ssds python=3.6 anaconda

     * activate ssds with:
activate ssds

     * install tensorflow within ssds:
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow

   for more more details on how to install tensorflow on windows go to
   [89]https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows. if you already
   have older version of anaconda installed where python 3.6 is not
   available by default you can still follow the procedure above. it will
   install python 3.6 and make it available in the ssds environment.

linux/mac os x

   similarly as for windows, the most convenient way for tensorflow
   installation on linux or mac os x is to install tensorflow with
   'cpu-support only within anaconda environment' following the similar
   procedure to the above-described steps. for detailed instructions:
     * for linux go to
       [90]https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#installing_wit
       h_anaconda
     * or for mac os x go to
       [91]https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#installing_with_
       anaconda

clone the repository

   first make sure you have git versioning software, you can download and
   install it from [92]https://git-scm.com/downloads. using the command
   line (i.e. [anaconda] command prompt on windows or terminal on
   linux/mac os x) position to the directory of your choice and then clone
   the git repository with command:
git clone https://github.com/ssds-croatia/ssds-2017.git

   as an alternative, you can just download the zip file from
   [93]https://github.com/ssds-croatia/ssds-2017/archive/master.zip, but
   then you will have to do it all over again if there are any changes in
   the meantime!

using hands-on sessions jupyter notebooks:

   all the hands-on sessions are run as jupyter notebooks. to view and
   edit notebooks, in the command line (i.e. using anaconda command prompt
   on windows or terminal on linux/mac os x), run the following:
     * activate ssds conda environment (consult [94]conda-cheatsheet):
          + windows: activate ssds
          + linux/mac os x: source activate ssds
     * within ssds start jupyter notebook server (for [95]details):
jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=path-to-repository --port=number-of-unused-port

       this will open your default web browser at
       http://localhost:[number-of-unused-port] and you will be able to
       navigate the repository file structure and use notebooks for the
       hands-on sessions.
