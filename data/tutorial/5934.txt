clever computersthe dawn of artificial intelligence

   powerful computers will reshape humanity   s future. how to ensure the
   promise outweighs the perils

[120]print edition | leaders

   may 9th 2015





      the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of
   the human race,    stephen hawking warns. elon musk fears that the
   development of artificial intelligence, or ai, may be the biggest
   existential threat humanity faces. bill gates urges people to beware of
   it.

   dread that the abominations people create will become their masters, or
   their executioners, is hardly new. but voiced by a renowned
   cosmologist, a silicon valley entrepreneur and the founder of
   microsoft   hardly luddites   and set against the vast investment in ai by
   big firms like google and microsoft, such fears have taken on new
   weight. with supercomputers in every pocket and robots looking down on
   every battlefield, just dismissing them as science fiction seems like
   self-deception. the question is how to worry wisely.

you taught me language and...

   the first step is to understand what computers can now do and what they
   are likely to be able to do in the future. thanks to the rise in
   processing power and the growing abundance of digitally available data,
   ai is enjoying a boom in its capabilities (see [121]article). today   s
      deep learning    systems, by mimicking the layers of neurons in a human
   brain and crunching vast amounts of data, can teach themselves to
   perform some tasks, from pattern recognition to translation, almost as
   well as humans can. as a result, things that once called for a
   mind   from interpreting pictures to playing the video game    frogger      are
   now within the scope of computer programs. deepface, an algorithm
   unveiled by facebook in 2014, can recognise individual human faces in
   images 97% of the time.

   crucially, this capacity is narrow and specific. today   s ai produces
   the semblance of intelligence through brute number-crunching force,
   without any great interest in approximating how minds equip humans with
   autonomy, interests and desires. computers do not yet have anything
   approaching the wide, fluid ability to infer, judge and decide that is
   associated with intelligence in the conventional human sense.
   briefing: ai is improving rapidly, but remains more useful than
   terrifying

   yet ai is already powerful enough to make a dramatic difference to
   human life. it can already enhance human endeavour by complementing
   what people can do. think of chess, which computers now play better
   than any person. the best players in the world are not machines
   however, but what garry kasparov, a grandmaster, calls    centaurs   :
   amalgamated teams of humans and algorithms. such collectives will
   become the norm in all sorts of pursuits: supported by ai, doctors will
   have a vastly augmented ability to spot cancers in medical images;
   speech-recognition algorithms running on smartphones will bring the
   internet to many millions of illiterate people in developing countries;
   digital assistants will suggest promising hypotheses for academic
   research; image-classification algorithms will allow wearable computers
   to layer useful information onto people   s views of the real world.

   even in the short run, not all the consequences will be positive.
   consider, for instance, the power that ai brings to the apparatus of
   state security, in both autocracies and democracies. the capacity to
   monitor billions of conversations and to pick out every citizen from
   the crowd by his voice or her face poses grave threats to liberty.

   and even when there are broad gains for society, many individuals will
   lose out from ai. the original    computers    were drudges, often women,
   who performed endless calculations for their higher-ups. just as
   transistors took their place, so ai will probably turf out whole
   regiments of white-collar workers. education and training will help and
   the wealth produced with the aid of ai will be spent on new pursuits
   that generate new jobs. but workers are doomed to dislocations.

   surveillance and dislocations are not, though, what worries messrs
   hawking, musk and gates, or what inspires a phalanx of futuristic ai
   films that hollywood has recently unleashed onto cinema screens. their
   concern is altogether more distant and more apocalyptic: the threat of
   autonomous machines with superhuman cognitive capacity and interests
   that conflict with those of homo sapiens.

   such artificially intelligent beings are still a very long way off;
   indeed, it may never be possible to create them. despite a century of
   poking and prodding at the brain, psychologists, neurologists,
   sociologists and philosophers are still a long way from an
   understanding of how a mind might be made   or what one is. and the
   business case for even limited intelligence of the general sort   the
   sort that has interests and autonomy   is far from clear. a car that
   drives itself better than its owner sounds like a boon; a car with its
   own ideas about where to go, less so.

...i know how to curse

   but even if the prospect of what mr hawking calls    full    ai is still
   distant, it is prudent for societies to plan for how to cope. that is
   easier than it seems, not least because humans have been creating
   autonomous entities with superhuman capacities and unaligned interests
   for some time. government bureaucracies, markets and armies: all can do
   things which unaided, unorganised humans cannot. all need autonomy to
   function, all can take on life of their own and all can do great harm
   if not set up in a just manner and governed by laws and regulations.

   these parallels should comfort the fearful; they also suggest concrete
   ways for societies to develop ai safely. just as armies need civilian
   oversight, markets are regulated and bureaucracies must be transparent
   and accountable, so ai systems must be open to scrutiny. because
   systems designers cannot foresee every set of circumstances, there must
   also be an off-switch. these constraints can be put in place without
   compromising progress. from the nuclear bomb to traffic rules, mankind
   has used technical ingenuity and legal strictures to constrain other
   powerful innovations.

   the spectre of eventually creating an autonomous non-human intelligence
   is so extraordinary that it risks overshadowing the debate. yes, there
   are perils. but they should not obscure the huge benefits from the dawn
   of ai.
