    the street view house numbers (svhn) dataset
   _______________________________________________________________________

   svhn is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and
   object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data
   preprocessing and formatting. it can be seen as similar in flavor to
   [1]mnist (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but
   incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000
   digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real
   world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images).
   svhn is obtained from house numbers in google street view images.

   overview

     10 classes, 1 for each digit. digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9
   and '0' has label 10.

     73257 digits for training, 26032 digits for testing, and 531131
   additional, somewhat less difficult samples, to use as extra training
   data

     comes in two formats:

     1. original images with character level bounding boxes.
     2. mnist-like 32-by-32 images centered around a single character
     (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides).

   downloads

     format 1: full numbers: [2]train.tar.gz, [3]test.tar.gz ,
   [4]extra.tar.gz (note: for non-commercial use only)

   [examples_new.png]
   these are the original, variable-resolution, color house-number images
   with character level bounding boxes, as shown in the examples images
   above. (the blue bounding boxes here are just for illustration
   purposes. the bounding box information are stored in digitstruct.mat
   instead of drawn directly on the images in the dataset.) each tar.gz
   file contains the orignal images in png format, together with a
   digitstruct.mat file, which can be loaded using matlab. the
   digitstruct.mat file contains a struct called digitstruct with the same
   length as the number of original images. each element in digitstruct
   has the following fields: name which is a string containing the
   filename of the corresponding image. bbox which is a struct array that
   contains the position, size and label of each digit bounding box in the
   image. eg: digitstruct(300).bbox(2).height gives height of the 2nd
   digit bounding box in the 300th image.

     format 2: cropped digits: [5]train_32x32.mat, [6]test_32x32.mat ,
   [7]extra_32x32.mat (note: for non-commercial use only)

   [32x32eg.png]
   character level ground truth in an mnist-like format. all digits have
   been resized to a fixed resolution of 32-by-32 pixels. the original
   character bounding boxes are extended in the appropriate dimension to
   become square windows, so that resizing them to 32-by-32 pixels does
   not introduce aspect ratio distortions. nevertheless this preprocessing
   introduces some distracting digits to the sides of the digit of
   interest. loading the .mat files creates 2 variables: x which is a 4-d
   matrix containing the images, and y which is a vector of class labels.
   to access the images, x(:,:,:,i) gives the i-th 32-by-32 rgb image,
   with class label y(i).
