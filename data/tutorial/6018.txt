agents that imagine and plan

   imagining the consequences of your actions before you take them is a
   powerful tool of human cognition. when placing a glass on the edge of a
   table, for example, we will likely pause to consider how stable it is
   and whether it might fall. on the basis of that imagined consequence we
   might readjust the glass to prevent it from falling and breaking. this
   form of deliberative reasoning is essentially    [35]imagination   , it is
   a distinctly human ability and is a crucial tool in our everyday lives.

   if our algorithms are to develop equally sophisticated behaviours, they
   too must have the capability to    imagine    and reason about the future.
   beyond that they must be able to construct a plan using this knowledge.
   we have seen some tremendous results in this area - particularly in
   programs like alphago, which use an    internal model    to analyse how
   actions lead to future outcomes in order to to reason and plan. these
   internal models work so well because environments like go are    perfect   
   - they have clearly defined rules which allow outcomes to be predicted
   very accurately in almost every circumstance. but the real world is
   complex, rules are not so clearly defined and unpredictable problems
   often arise. even for the most intelligent agents, imagining in these
   complex environments is a long and costly process.

   being able to deal with imperfect models and learning to adapt a
   planning strategy to current state are important research questions

   in [36]two [37]new papers, we describe a new family of approaches for
   imagination-based planning. we also introduce architectures which
   provide new ways for agents to learn and construct plans to maximise
   the efficiency of a task. these architectures are efficient, robust to
   complex and imperfect models, and can adopt flexible strategies for
   exploiting their imagination.

   imagination-augmented agents

   the agents we introduce benefit from an    imagination encoder   - a neural
   network which learns to extract any information useful for the agent   s
   future decisions, but ignore that which is not relevant. these agents
   have a number of distinct features:
     * they learn to interpret their internal simulations. this allows
       them to use models which coarsely capture the environmental
       dynamics, even when those dynamics are not perfect.

     * they use their imagination efficiently. they do this by adapting
       the number of imagined trajectories to suit the problem. efficiency
       is also enhanced by the encoder, which is able to extract
       additional information from imagination beyond rewards - these
       trajectories may contain useful clues even if they do not
       necessarily result in high reward.

     * they can learn different strategies to construct plans. they do
       this by choosing between continuing a current imagined trajectory
       or restarting from scratch. alternatively, they can use different
       imagination models, with different accuracies and computational
       costs. this offers them a broad spectrum of effective planning
       strategies, rather than being restricted to a one-size-fits-all
       approach which might limit adaptability in imperfect environments.

   testing our architectures

   we tested our proposed architectures on multiple tasks, including the
   puzzle game sokoban and a spaceship navigation game. both games require
   forward planning and reasoning, making them the perfect environment to
   test our agents' abilities.
     * in sokoban the agent has to push boxes onto targets. because boxes
       can only be pushed, many moves are irreversible (for instance a box
       in a corner cannot be pulled out of it).

     * in the spaceship task, the agent must stabilise a craft by
       activating its thrusters a fixed number of times. it must contend
       with the gravitational pull of several planets, making it a highly
       nonlinear complex continuous control task.

   to limit trial-and-error for both tasks, each level is procedurally
   generated and the agent can only try it once; this encourages the agent
   to try different strategies 'in its head' before testing them in the
   real environment.

   [sokoban%2520.width-320_jtflhsg.png]

   above, an agent plays sokoban from a pixel representation, not knowing
   the rules of the game. at specific points in time, we visualise the
   agent's imagination of five possible futures. based on that
   information, the agent decides what action to take. the corresponding
   trajectory is highlighted.
   the spaceship task | imagination and planning
   an agent playing the spaceship task. the red lines indicate
   trajectories that are executed in the environment while blue and green
   depict imagined trajectories.

   for both tasks, the imagination-augmented agents outperform the
   imagination-less baselines considerably: they learn with less
   experience and are able to deal with the imperfections in modelling the
   environment. because agents are able to extract more knowledge from
   internal simulations they can solve tasks more with fewer imagination
   steps than conventional search methods, like the monte carlo tree
   search.

   when we add an additional    manager    component, which helps to construct
   a plan, the agent learns to solve tasks even more efficiently with
   fewer steps. in the spaceship task it can distinguish between
   situations where the gravitational pull of its environment is strong or
   weak, meaning different numbers of these imagination steps are
   required. when an agent is presented with multiple models of an
   environment, each varying in quality and cost-benefit, it learns to
   make a meaningful trade-off. finally, if the computational cost of
   imagination increases with each action taken, the agent imagines the
   effect of multiple chained actions early, and relies on this plan later
   without invoking imagination again.

   being able to deal with imperfect models and learning to adapt a
   planning strategy to current state are important research questions.
   our two new papers, alongside previous work by [38]hamrick et al.
   consider these questions. while model-based id23 and
   planning are active areas of research (papers by [39]silver et al.;
   [40]henaff et al.; and [41]kansky et al. are a just a few examples of
   related lines of enquiry), further analysis and consideration is
   required to provide scalable solutions to rich model-based agents that
   can use their imaginations to reason about - and plan - for the future.
