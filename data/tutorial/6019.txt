innovations of alphago

   one of the great promises of ai is its potential to help us unearth new
   knowledge in complex domains. we   ve already seen exciting glimpses of
   this, when our algorithms found ways to dramatically improve energy use
   in [35]data centres - as well as of course with our program alphago.

   since its historic success in seoul last march, alphago has heralded a
   new era for the ancient game of go. thanks to alphago's creative and
   intriguing revelations, players of all levels have been inspired to
   test out new moves and strategies of their own, often re-evaluating
   centuries of inherited knowledge in the process.

   ahead of    [36]the future of go summit in wuzhen   , we summarise some
   recent examples of alphago   s strategic and tactical innovations, and
   the new insights they have revealed.

   "alphago   s game last year transformed the industry of go and its
   players. the way alphago showed its level was far above our
   expectations and brought many new elements to the game."

       shi yue, 9 dan professional, world champion

      i believe players more or less have all been affected by professor
   alpha. alphago   s play makes us feel more free and no move is impossible
   to play anymore. now everyone is trying to play in a style that hasn   t
   been tried before.   

       zhou ruiyang, 9 dan professional, world champion

   alphago style

   alphago's greatest strength is not any one move or sequence, but rather
   the unique perspective that it brings to every game. while go style is
   difficult to encapsulate, one could say that alphago's strategy
   embodies a spirit of flexibility and open-mindedness: a lack of
   preconceptions that allows it to find the most effective line of play.
   as the following two games will show, this philosophy often leads
   alphago to discover counterintuitive yet powerful moves.

   although go is a game of territory, most decisive battles hinge on the
   balance of power between groups, and alphago excels in shaping this
   balance. specifically, alphago makes masterful use of "influence," or
   the effect of existing stones on surrounding areas. although influence
   cannot be measured exactly, alphago's value network enables it to
   consider all stones on the board at once, endowing its judgment with
   subtlety and precision. these abilities let alphago convert local
   regions of influence into coordinated global advantages.

   in this game (dia. 1), black (alphago) has little secure territory,
   while white has three corners, but black's influence radiates across
   the entire board. in particular, while the marked exchange solidifies
   white, it also improves black's potential. go players usually shy from
   such exchanges, which pay a definite price for uncertain profit, but
   alphago combines its sterling judgment with a keen sense of risk and
   reward to make such moves possible.
   [dia1.width-400_bgivwde.png]
   dia. 1

   however, the value of influence depends entirely on context, and
   alphago relinquishes influence freely when it can be effectively
   mitigated. in the the game displayed in dia. 2, one of the most
   surprising in its oeuvre, alphago has just played an incredible six
   stones along the second line. go players have a saying: on the fourth
   line there is influence, and on the third line there is territory, but
   on the second line there is only defeat. alphago's play at first looks
   deserving of such censure, as these moves give white both strength and
   influence in exchange for black's paltry 4 points of side territory.
   most players, unwilling to bear the ignominy of playing the marked
   stones, would reject this line in an instant. yet alphago judges it
   worthwhile to keep white's stones separated, and in the following
   exchanges, slowly erodes white's influence from the top and bottom to
   secure a winning advantage.
   [dia2.width-400_buc5gif.png]
   dia. 2

   new moves, new patterns

   alphago has also played several opening novelties in its recent games,
   the most salient being the early 3-3 invasion and a new variation of
   the "magic sword". each defies conventional theory, but proves sound on
   deeper inspection.

   the early 3-3 invasion

   one of the most territorial joseki (corner sequences) in go is the 3-3
   point invasion, shown in dia. 3.
   [dia3.width-400_pvj0umo.png]
   dia. 3

   this invasion immediately secures the corner, but the textbook sequence
   shown in dia. 4 has long been disparaged as unsuitable for the opening,
   as it gives too much influence.
   [dia4.width-400_q6u3lfb.png]
   dia. 4

   alphago's innovation is to omit the marked exchanges, leaving the
   corner unsettled as shown in dia. 5.
   [dia5.width-400_krpbaui.png]
   dia. 5

   though slightly less secure, black retains miai (options) to escape on
   the left or finish the joseki later, and has gained territory while
   ceding only moderate influence. this strategy has created a great stir
   among professionals, and at least one has already tried it in an
   official game (dia. 6).
   [dia6.width-400_1g6bza3.png]
   dia. 6

   the new magic sword

   originally trained on human data, alphago knows modern joseki and
   usually plays accordingly. however, in the "magic sword," a famously
   complex joseki family named for the cursed sword of muramasa, it
   diverges.

   starting from the position in dia. 7, the usual result exchanges the
   corner for the side as shown in dia. 8.
   [dia7.width-400_hh3f8qe.png]
   dia. 7

   [dia8.width-400_qsn9be7.png]

   dia. 8

   however, alphago often prefers to sacrifice outside access for
   territorial compensation (dia. 9).
   [dia9.width-400_h2meiww.png]
   dia. 9

   most go players would not consider playing this variation, as it gives
   black a powerful wall, but white's follow-up approach declares that
   black's influence is not as valuable as it looks. if black does not
   reinforce the wall, it may even become a target. kim jiseok, one of
   korea's top professionals, recently played this line in a tournament
   game (dia. 10), which he went on to win.

   more to come

   alphago's innovations show great potential for impact in the world of
   professional go, and we hope to present many more opportunities for
   collaborative research at the upcoming future of go summit in wuzhen.
   we look forward with great excitement to alphago and human
   professionals striving together to discover the true nature of go!
