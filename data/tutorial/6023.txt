alphatoe

   applying the deep learning techniques from alpha go to play tic-tac-toe

   these are the code examples to with my talk, the slide for which are in
   alphatoe.pdf

   as well as the slides, the file script/policy_gradient.py is a good
   starting point for the project. all networks are built using
   tensorflow.

setup

   to get running start by creating a virtual env/conda env with
   tensorflow installed. current instructions for this are at:
   [84]https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html
   #anaconda-installation

   i've also found this useful:
   [85]https://anaconda.org/jjhelmus/tensorflow

   then run the file file policy_gradient.py

   this has been tested with python 2.7 and 3.5
