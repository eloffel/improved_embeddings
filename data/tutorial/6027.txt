readme.md

   rllab is no longer under active development, but an [109]alliance of
   researchers from several universities has adopted it, and now maintains
   it under the name [110]garage.

   we recommend you develop new projects, and rebase old ones, onto the
   actively-maintained [111]garage codebase, to promote reproducibility
   and code-sharing in rl research. the new codebase shares almost all of
   its code with rllab, so most conversions only need to edit package
   import paths and perhaps update some renamed functions.

   [112]garage is always looking for new users and contributors, so please
   consider contributing your rllab-based projects and improvements to the
   new codebase! recent improvements include first-class support for
   tensorflow, tensorboard integration, new algorithms including ppo and
   ddpg, updated docker images, new environment wrappers, many updated
   dependencies, and stability improvements.

rllab

   rllab is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement
   learning algorithms. it includes a wide range of continuous control
   tasks plus implementations of the following algorithms:
     * [117]reinforce
     * [118]truncated natural policy gradient
     * [119]reward-weighted regression
     * [120]relative id178 policy search
     * [121]trust region policy optimization
     * [122]cross id178 method
     * [123]covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy
     * [124]deep deterministic policy gradient

   rllab is fully compatible with [125]openai gym. see [126]here for
   instructions and examples.

   rllab only officially supports python 3.5+. for an older snapshot of
   rllab sitting on python 2, please use the [127]py2 branch.

   rllab comes with support for running id23 experiments
   on an ec2 cluster, and tools for visualizing the results. see the
   [128]documentation for details.

   the main modules use [129]theano as the underlying framework, and we
   have support for tensorflow under [130]sandbox/rocky/tf.

documentation

   documentation is available online:

citing rllab

   if you use rllab for academic research, you are highly encouraged to
   cite the following paper:
     * yan duan, xi chen, rein houthooft, john schulman, pieter abbeel.
       "[132]benchmarking deep id23 for continuous
       control". proceedings of the 33rd international conference on
       machine learning (icml), 2016.

credits

   rllab was originally developed by rocky duan (uc berkeley / openai),
   peter chen (uc berkeley), rein houthooft (uc berkeley / openai), john
   schulman (uc berkeley / openai), and pieter abbeel (uc berkeley /
   openai). the library is continued to be jointly developed by people at
   openai and uc berkeley.
