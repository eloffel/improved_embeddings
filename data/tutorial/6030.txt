   [103]self-driving car

we   re building an open source self-driving car

and we want your help!

   at [104]udacity, we believe in democratizing education. how can we
   provide opportunity to everyone on the planet? we also believe in
   teaching really amazing and useful subject matter. when we decided to
   build the [105]self-driving car nanodegree program, to teach the world
   to build autonomous vehicles, we instantly knew we had to tackle our
   own self-driving car too.

   together with [106]google self-driving car founder and [107]udacity
   president sebastian thrun, we formed our core self-driving car team.
   one of the first decisions we made? open source code, written by
   hundreds of students from across the globe!

   [108]you can read more about our plans for this project.

contributions

   here's a list of the projects we've open sourced:
     * [109]deep learning steering models     many different neural networks
       trained to predict steering angles of the car. more information
       [110]here.
     * [111]camera mount by [112]@spartanhaden     a mount to support a lens
       and camera body that can be mounted using standard gopro hardware
     * [113]annotated driving datasets     many hours of labelled driving
       data
     * [114]driving datasets     over 10 hours of driving data (lidar,
       camera frames and more)
     * [115]ros steering node     useful to enable the deep learning models
       to interact with ros

how to contribute

   like any open source project, this code base will require a certain
   amount of thoughtfulness. however, when you add a 2-ton vehicle into
   the equation, we also need to make safety our absolute top priority,
   and pull requests just don   t cut it. to really optimize for safety,
   we   re breaking down the problem of making the car autonomous into
   [116]udacity challenges.

challenges

   each challenge will contain awesome prizes (cash and others) for the
   most effective contributions, but more importantly, the challenge
   format enables us to benchmark the safety of the code before we ever
   think of running it in the car. we believe challenges to be the best
   medium for us to build a level-4 autonomous vehicle, while at the same
   time offering our contributors a valuable and exciting learning
   experience.

   you can find a current list of challenges, with lots of information, on
   the [117]udacity self-driving car page. this is the primary way to
   contribute to this open source self-driving car project.
