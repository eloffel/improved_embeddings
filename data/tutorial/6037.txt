what   s all this fuss about the ai alphago   s recent victory against
the masters?

   while it   s seemed like ai had hit a dead-end as much as a decade ago,
   if you   re like many of us sci-fi enthusiasts and have always wanted an
   ai best friend, the recent victory of alphago has brought us much
   closer than you may have thought was possible.

ai is finally moving forward

   we   re not surprised if you haven   t been following the recent
   developments in ai all that closely because, for the most part, it   s
   seemed like nothing exciting has happened for quite a long time. sci-fi
   dreams about computer powered best friends aside, ai for the general
   public has come to mean reasonably responsive and well-programmed
   computer assistance rather than independent thinking machines. concepts
   like    smart    chatbots somehow seem to pull us further from the star
   trek or heinlinian dream of fully sentient and intuitive computers
   while many products and services that claim to integrate ai seem to be
   nothing more than a fast way to analyze large amounts of data. in fact,
   the last time most of us heard something hopeful about ai was when deep
   blue beat the world chess champion, but what ever came of that ai?
   surely it hasn   t used that incredible logical power to take over the
   world or begin making friends, so what do we even care?

not all ais are equal

   the answer lies in the fact that there many forms of artificial
   intelligence and most of them are limited by the tasks they were made
   to perform. that   s what makes alphago so special, because while it was
   designed, named, and trained to play go against the masters, its
   potential functionalities go well beyond the realm of board games
   unlike most of its ai contemporaries.

   while practical applications for specifically built ai are growing, the
   tradition of training your ai programming skills on classic strategy
   games has existed since the 1950s when a computer was programmed to
   play and was able to win a game of tic-tac-toe. since then a large
   variety of games and custom built ais have been tested against each
   other to the great entertainment of experts in the field and curious
   nerds like us who care about that sort of thing. the real difference is
   not what they   re programmed for but how they are programmed to start
   with and, in fact, this is also what most profoundly distinguishes
   alpha go from its older-generation relative, the chess champion deep
   blue.

chess is a closed game

   you may not know this, but there is a standard way to program an ai to
   play a board game known as the search tree in which the computer
   analyzes all the pieces and spaces in a game and determines which move
   during its turn is most likely to result in victory. however, for games
   with a limited total number of moves and responses, you don   t even have
   to spend too much time on programming good judgment, all you need is a
   complete understanding of the game. that said, consider how long people
   have been playing, analyzing, and writing down their analysis for
   chess.

   every possible arrangement of the limited and highly specialized pieces
   on the board has been replicated and studied in-depth. do you know what
   they found? there is a finite number of possible piece arrangements on
   the board and each one of these finite arrangements has a finite number
   of moves that can be made and each of these moves can then be judged as
   a good or bad idea. in other words, you can contain every possible
   chess move and the best move for each board arrangement into a single
   database. that   s right, the quick and dirty way to make a chess    ai   
   doesn   t even require any thought, simply a database containing a
   complete knowledge of the game. therefore ais were always destined to
   master chess because it can simply store everything there is to know
   and reference it at will.

   so how did deep blue win back in the 90s? you can breath easy knowing
   that the famous ai did not use the database method but instead relied
   on a parallel system designed to run a complex tree search. at each
   point in the game it would analyze the board and run an assessment on
   the possible moves it detected and which could move it closer toward a
   win. defeating the world chess champion was a huge victory for deep
   blue by more than just capturing a king piece. it indicated that the
   ai   s board assessment program could be faster and smarter than a human
   strategy expert, but it was not what most of us sci-fi enthusiasts
   would think of as the beginning of independent computer thought. the
   only thing deep blue can do is play chess and because chess is a finite
   game, deep blue never needs to get smarter.

go is not a closed game

   people have been trying to define go for thousands of years. with
   computer analysis in hand, they have tried to discover if it is a
   finite game, like chess, and it simply cannot be done. with a
   near-infinite number of pieces available to each player and the
   complexities of the game itself, there are too many possibilities,
   board arrangements, and good or bad placement choices for any
   reasonable purpose-built program to handle. while you can make a
   program that plays go, until alphago computer opponents only ever
   reached an intermediate level of capability and trying to fill a
   database with all the possible board arrangements and possible moves
   might well catch your servers on fire.

alphago learns to play

   it is for this reason that many people, go masters included, were
   certain that a computer could never learn to beat the human champions
   of the game and for this reason that deepmind decided to try. why has
   alphago succeeded where other ais were judged to not even have a
   chance? the difference was that deepmind decided to try something new
   in the world of games vs ais: machine learning and neural networks
   instead of custom built search trees. alphago doesn   t just judge the
   board, it learns from its mistakes. like a go expert who has been
   playing since their early childhood, they ran alphago through thousands
   of games against itself and it learned from every one of those games
   how to be a better player, improve its strategy, and it never gets
   bored, frustrated, or tired during practice.

alphago teaches the masters

   two years ago, deepmind felt that alphago was ready to start playing
   against expert human opponents and invited the european go champion mr.
   fan hui to a closed-door five-game test. to their surprise and delight,
   it won every single game and became the first computer program to
   defeat a professional go player. they then set it against the legendary
   winner of 18 world titles, mr. lee sedol in seoul in which it won 4   1
   and earned a 9-dan professional ranking, the highest certification
   available. if this wasn   t awesome enough, during these games alphago
   dazzled the audience and its opponent with creative winning moves, one
   of which effectively overturned hundreds of years of cumulative go
   wisdom.

deepblue was columbus discovering america and alphago is the moon landing

   any computer scientist or programmer will admit that deepblue achieved
   something incredible when it beat kasparov. but the amazing feat was in
   the computational power that deepblue had. it did not learn to play
   chess. it was programmed to search through thousands of chess games and
   evaluate the best move it had. once deepblue had won the game and
   proven its strength, it was packed away and it has not been seen since.
   everyone knew that its only purpose was to play chess and its
   programming could not be applied to much of anything else. alphago, on
   the other hand, took the idea of computational power and added human
   reasoning or intuition         this combination makes it incredibly
   applicable to countless purposes.

computer scientists versus chess masters

   another very unique aspect of how alphago was created versus how
   deepblue was created is who the experts relied on. with deepblue, the
   computer scientists heavily relied on chess experts, professionals, and
   masters to help the program have as many chess games programmed into it
   as possible. and the thing is, even after deepblue had strutted its
   stuff, it did not change much for the world of chess. chess players did
   not learn anything from it. with alphago, however, the computer
   scientists simply used lots and lots of games from a myriad of players,
   who were all at different levels of go knowledge and experience. and
   unlike when deepblue was unveiled, when alphago was first shown to the
   world, go players paid attention. they saw that alphago was playing in
   innovative ways. it has taught them to think and play more creatively.

alphago   s intuitive factor

   it is easy to say that alphago has intuition, which deepblue was
   missing. it is much more difficult to explain where that intuition
   comes from. to put it simply, it built on deepblue   s search and
   optimize idea. the deepmind team programmed alphago with 150,000 go
   games that had been played by good players. it would then search
   through those games to base its next move on id203. to take
   alphago to the next level, though, deepmind used a neural network, or
   machine learning, so that through self-play and play against humans it
   could slowly make millions of tiny adjustments, allowing it to obtain
   something as close to intuition as possible.

   and it is this intuition factor of recognizing good patterns and
   learning them that will have a much deeper impact on artificial
   intelligence. in the world of art, this type of artificial intelligence
   will expose a neural network to a specific artistic style, it will then
   show the network an image, and the network will replicate that image in
   the artistic style it was shown. in the world of language, the same
   neural networks are being used to recognize natural language. in the
   world of games, these networks are employed to improve video game
   experiences. and the list of future possibilities for expanding the
   impact of neural networks, machine learning, and artificial
   intelligence to provide the ability of intuition to computers is
   growing by the day         think healthcare, smartphone assistants, and
   robotics. in fact, uk   s national health service has already signed a
   deal with deepmind.

it was not supposed to be this easy

   go is a game that has been around for 3000 years. it is widely accepted
   as the most challenging strategy game that exists. individuals,
   especially in countries like south korea and china, are sent to private
   school specifically to learn how to play the game at an expert level.
   it takes years of playing for several hours every day to master the
   game. in other words, even though it has simple rules, it is not a
   simple game to excel at. and due to its complexity, and how long it had
   taken computer scientists to create a machine that could win at chess,
   experts estimated that a machine that could effectively play go would
   only be created in about 10 years.

   surprise! deep mind managed to create a machine that could master the
   game, without being programmed with explicit rules and without being
   taught by a professional go player. alphago mainly played against
   itself and learned from this self-play. at its core, it learned like a
   human learns, by looking at the board, evaluating the options, making
   moves, and learning from mistakes         it just did it a lot faster than
   any human can.

   this is extremely exciting because, at its core, what it means is that
   computer scientists have had all the tools they needed to do this for
   years. neural networks have been known about and discussed since the
   middle of the last century. all it really took was simply getting
   creative with them, applying them in new ways. alphago beating the
   world   s best go player proves that ai has the potential to do anything.
   it can learn anything and understand anything, and from that learning
   and understanding it can accomplish what humans can accomplish in a
   much shorter period of time.

   you   re probably wondering what this all means. the good news is that
   we   re much closer to the dream of an ai best friend than most of us
   would have dared to imagine a few years ago. let it sink in for a
   moment: alphago can learn the most complex, intuition and creativity
   based logic game known to man and it didn   t do so through a finite
   database or search trees alone. it learned from practice and
   experience, just like we do, and the ability to create amazing new
   solutions to ancient puzzles suggests a realm of digital creativity
   never before fathomed.

   alphago is not like other game playing ais that have come before it. it
   is the future of intelligent and intuitive machines, one that we plan
   to turn toward more than just board games. from practical applications
   to that friend you   ve been hoping for, alphago is sure to be the first
   of a new generation of self-learning intuitive ais that go above and
   beyond the limited calculating capacities of its older siblings and
   contemporaries. if you love ai like i do, keep your eyes open for new
   practical applications for very real artificial intelligence popping up
   in places you may not have even imagined. [10]the ai winter is over.
