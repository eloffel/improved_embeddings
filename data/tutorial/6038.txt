high time to regulate face recognition a.i.

   we   ve reached a tipping point where it is now high time that we start
   the conversation of regulating face recognition artificial intelligence
   (ai).

   in a [14]previous post, i explored some ideas of how we may regulate
   ai. i looked at several regulations in other fields and explored how
   they might apply for ai. the most compelling argument against ai
   regulation has been that it isn   t clear for many as to precisely what
   needs to be regulated. however, in recent days, it has come to my
   attention that a specific kind of ai algorithm needs serious thought
   for regulation.

   [15]stanford researchers have trained a deep learning system to
   recognize a person   s sexual orientation. i don   t doubt the
   effectiveness of the system that they   ve built. many however questioned
   the interpretations of the researchers. i am however very concerned
   about the potential for misuse of this kind of technology.

   detecting sexual orientation from facial images.

   in may this year, chinese researchers developed an even more dubious
   face classification system that determined if someone was likely to be
   a criminal or not.

   we now urgently need to analyze the benefits of facial recognition
   against the risks. i am going to take a stab at this and will
   eventually make the argument that the risks outweigh the benefits.

   here are some of the benefits of facial recognition:

   security         facial recognition is now built into the iphone x (see:
   [18]face id) and is used as an authentication mechanism to unlock one   s
   phone. previously, the iphone (an other smart phones) used one   s
   fingerprint for unlocking a device. facial recognition can also be used
   for monitoring people visiting homes or offices.

   social engagement         facebook can automatically tag faces found in
   photographs. the value of this feature is to increase engagement by
   people who are tagged as well as from people who follow other people.
   facebook has added additional security features that allow a user to
   opt-out of the automatic face tagging feature.

   safety- in car face monitoring devices can determine if a driver is
   distracted momentarily. this application can be employed in any
   work-related activity that requires focused attention from the employed
   worker.

   healthcare         monitoring devices for people who are sick or disabled may
   be useful in providing more responsive care to their needs.

   entertainment         virtual reality or augmented reality games may react to
   the emotions of its participants.

   productivity         face recognition is used by google photos to
   automatically organize and search one   s personal photos.

   law enforcement         face recognition can be used to identify suspects in
   a criminal investigation. this can also be used to track and find
   missing persons.

   here are the potential risks:

   police state         facial recognition allows states to track the movement
   and behavior of its citizens. this allows the states to enforce
   compliance to its agenda.

   biological identification         facial recognition may recognize a person   s
   sexual orientation. in many countries, one   s sexual orientation is
   punishable as a crime. it may be debatable how accurate a system like
   this can become. however, if governments are satisfied with its
   accuracy, then people will be persecuted for being who they are and not
   what they had done. recognizing a person   s heritage or race is another
   area where this can be abused.

   behavioral manipulation         this involves the identification of a person
   facial responses in different contexts. identification of reactions
   like disgust or awe may indicate to the observer the inner personal
   views of a person. exploiting this information allows other parties
   (i.e., marketing, sales, government, employer, etc.) to execute
   behavioral manipulation techniques that may be in conflict with a
   person   s well being. we have already been witness to these behavioral
   techniques in social networks to influence one   s actions.

   behavioral enforcement         workers can be monitored to asses their
   continued focus on a task at hand. day dreaming will be penalized with
   wage garnishment.

   i am going to stop here now with regards to the risks. there are many
   more risks that i am deliberately failing to mention here. one can even
   extrapolate far in the future, and it is easy to envision a scenario
   that we would regret ever allow machines to recognize us.

   however, what is the general overarching principle here why facial
   recognition is such a dangerous idea? the first problem is that because
   it is performed by automation, it can be done at scale and
   relentlessly. this leads to the same privacy concerns we have with
   large internet companies. the second concern is also that of privacy;
   that is, our inner thoughts and preferences should remain private. the
   third problem is the potential for summary judgment by a machine. it is
   all too easy for humans to lazily rely on an algorithm to perform
   judgment rather than to do so themselves. furthermore, having an
   algorithm make a judgment, in many ways washes one clean of any
   responsibility for the consequences. this judgment is made much worse
   when the criteria are based on how you look.

   photo copier machines are regulated from being able to copy and print
   legal paper currencies. the software in any printer is hardwired to
   detect specific signatures in money and thus preventing facsimile copy.
   similarly, it may perhaps be possible to require that any new deep
   learning silicon (of sufficient performance) be required to invalidate
   any facial recognition task. alternatively, it should be illegal to
   hook up a deep learning device with an image capture system without the
   necessary    safeguard chip    in place.

   a lighter form of regulation should allow any person to opt-out from
   facial recognition. it could be implemented with the use of a kind of
   marker or code that is worn by the user (perhaps a barcode on the
   forehead?). this is analogous with the self-identification race forms
   found in the us. a person should, by law, be always allowed to opt-out
   from facial recognition software. the alternative will be a new kind of
   fashion:

   i am absolutely certain that many ai researchers will be up in arms
   with this proposal for regulation. however, you will need to be able to
   make the case that the benefits of facial recognition capabilities
   absolutely outweigh the risks. the risks are very real and it is about
   time that we begin serious discussion.
