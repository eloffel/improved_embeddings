   today i will show you very simple but powerful example of how to count
   traffic capacity with the algorithm that you can run on devices.

   [18]as always, here is full code of this project

   also, i recommend you to read my first article about road traffic
   classification, cause it cool and also maintains part of base pipeline
   architecture that we will you in this project.
   [19]tutorial: making road traffic counting app based on id161
   and opencv
   today we will learn how to count road traffic based on id161
   and without heavy deep learning algorithms.
   for   hackernoon.com

   so this algorithm works in 4 steps:
   1. get frame edges.
   2. blur them to get the more filled area.
   3. binary threshold blurred the image.
   4. overlap threshold image with roi(you mask where you count) and count
   black pixels/white pixels which gives you traffic capacity.

   you can see each step on image below:

edges

   here we use [21]clahe equalization to remove noise from the image that
   can occur on cheap/old cameras at night. it not the best thing, but
   gives a better result.

   then we use [22]canny edge detector to get edges from the image. we
   invert it to get white background(just for visual convenient)

blur

   we use [23]basic blur with bilateral filtering which removes some color
   noise and gives better segmentation.

threshold

   the last filter is a [24]binary threshold which we use to get only
   white and black pixels which give as our segmentation on car/not car.

counting

   and the last simple step just divides the number of black pixels with
   the number of white pixels to get traffic capacity.

problems

   because of some camera noise and different outdoor conditions, accuracy
   may not so big ~ 70   85%.
   but that is not a big problem because we can set min/max limits, or use
   additional filtering based on light conditions and for example amount
   of edges on some test roi(for example some white rectangle).
   and also this data mainly used as additional data, so only relative
   values are needed.

why is this data needed?

   all data is needed, even if you don   t know how to use it right now :)
   in our case with this data, we can say why traffic was limited at some
   point in time.

why not use one big algorithm that will do all the work?

   the main thing that you must remember working on data science projects
   that they should not only be effective in the domain but also
   cost-effective for business which includes speed, memory usage,
   scalability, one hour runtime costs for one task and in scale.
   there are no algorithms that run efficiently in any conditions, for
   example, sort algorithms that used for local projects will never be
   used in big data projects because will be slow, and big data algorithms
   will not be used for local projects cause also will be slow(cause they
   faster only on big amount of data).
   so you should build your pipeline with understanding your projects and
   business limitation.

   if you have questions/ideas don   t hesitate to post them in comments.

   ps: also i got few emails where people asked me if it   s ok to critic my
   code/ideas. so yes, it   s ok, and moreover, i ask you to do so, so we
   all can get benefit from this.
