image recognition on the road

   when google announced that they open-sourced their internal object
   detection system, the [18]tensorflow id164 api, i knew had
   to try it. detecting objects in images is a long-standing challenge
   that has seen huge advances in recent years, thanks to a flurry of
   research in deep learning. it   s the sort of task that lends itself well
   to deep learning: easy to describe and intuitive to grasp, but hard to
   solve formally.

   google   s api offers five state-of-the-art tensorflow models that
   identify and localize multiple objects in an image. the models run the
   gamut from lightweight, meant to work in realtime on cellphones, to
   heavy duty, which are more computationally expensive but more accurate.
   they also pre-trained each model on the [19]coco dataset so that they
   detect 90 common object categories right off the shelf. a [20]jupyter
   notebook is included to demonstrate how to use their pre-trained
   models.

   i managed to get some images of a traffic intersection in south bay.
   there are several promising applications for detecting the motor
   vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians flowing through an intersection:
   smarter traffic light signal timing based on the observed count of
   cars, accident prevention by alerting drivers to oncoming vehicles, and
   identifying areas where traffic jams commonly happen.

   since the objects to be detected in an intersection fell into the
   common categories of coco, i was able to use a pre-trained model. this
   meant i didn   t have to endure the tedium of collecting a labeled
   dataset and spinning gpu clock cycles to train. below is the (rather
   grainy) original image.

   and here is the output after running the most accurate model,
   [21]faster_rid98_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco.

   box colors and their classifications: {light green: car, purple: truck,
   neon green: person, pink: vase, white: motorcycle, darker green:
   traffic light}

   i was very impressed with the results! it overcame several obstacles:
   low resolution, ghosting, occlusion, and lack of color, yet still
   managed to identify every car, a motorcycle, and the person riding it.
   it also found a pedestrian on the sidewalk. it did make the mistake of
   classifying a tree trunk as a vase (pink box).

   all in all, the tensorflow id164 api is a neat system for
   id164 and localization. it   s robust to poor image quality
   and simple to use.
