   data available on [18]github

   a necessity in building an [19]open source self-driving car is data.
   lots and lots of data. we recently [20]open sourced 40gb of driving
   data to assist the participants of the [21]udacity self-driving car
   challenge #2, but now we   re going much bigger with a 183gb release.
   this data is free for anyone to use, anywhere in the world.

what   s included

   223gb of image frames and log data from 70 minutes of driving in
   mountain view on two separate days, with one day being sunny, and the
   other overcast. here is a sample of the log included in the dataset.

   note: along with an image frame from our cameras, we also include
   latitude, longitude, gear, brake, throttle, steering angles and speed.
