   so-so semantics

stop pretending you really know what ai is and read this instead

   john pavlus
   by [9]john pavlusseptember 6, 2017

   you   ve probably heard the news: [10]ai is going to take your job. wait,
   no: it   s going to [11]create a new job for you. ai is [12]going to kill
   us all! wait, [13]no it   s not. ai is [14]already totally smarter than
   us at, like, all the [15]smart [16]things. but that [17]probably
   doesn   t matter? [18]neural networks. [19]machine learning. [20]deep
   learning. omg. wtf. help.

   take a deep breath. let   s consider for a second what we talk about when
   we talk about ai. because i   m not sure many of us really know   or, at
   the very least, we   re not talking/[21]arguing/worrying about the same
   things.

      you are right to be confused,    says [22]harvard computer scientist
   leslie valiant, because the terms artificial intelligence and machine
   learning    are suddenly being used interchangeably in the popular
   press.    even trevor darrell, [23]a leading artificial-intelligence
   researcher at uc berkeley who   s also part of a darpa-funded project on
   (wait for it) [24]   explainable ai    admits that    there is no precise
   distinction   they overlap greatly.   

   after surveying half a dozen leading experts, i was able to triangulate
   a reasonable answer as to what the hell these words actually mean:

     artificial intelligence (ai) is the general label for a field of
     study   specifically, the study of whatever might answer the question
        what is required for a machine to exhibit intelligence?   

   if that doesn   t sound very satisfying, the experts don   t disagree.    at
   this point, ai is an aspirational term reflecting a goal,    darrell
   says. what he means is that    ai    isn   t, technically speaking, a thing.
   it   s not in your phone. it isn   t going to eat the world or do anything
   to your job. it   s not even an    it    at all: it   s just a [25]suitcase
   word enclosing a foggy constellation of    things      plural   that do have
   real definitions and edges to them. all the other stuff you hear
   about   machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, what have
   you   are much more precise names for the various scientific,
   mathematical, and engineering methods that people employ within the
   field of ai.

   but what   s so terrible about using the phrase    artificial intelligence   
   to enclose all that confusing detail   especially for all us non-phds?
   the words    artificial    and    intelligent    sound soothingly
   commonsensical when put together. but in practice, the phrase has an
   uncanny almost-meaning that sucks adjacent ideas and images into its
   orbit and [26]spaghettifies them. when google ceo sundar pichai says
   the company is now    [27]ai-first,    does that mean he   s    summoning the
   demon,    [28]like elon musk calls ai? is he hinting at an
   [29]automation-uber-alles rebooting of capitalism itself, with
   universal basic income as the fig leaf? or is he just talking about
   incrementally improving the [30]consumer-facing products and services
   we   re already familiar with   whose version of    artificial intelligence   
   falls somewhere between [31]   be as smart as a puppy    and [32]   some
   subset of a cockroach   s brain   ?

   this may all seem like semantic hair-splitting. but george orwell was
   on to something when [33]he famously wrote that    the slovenliness of
   our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.    using
   the same science-fictional shorthand to describe anything from
   self-driving cars to [34]slightly better ad targeting surely inhibits
   basic comprehension. but its potential for seeding both magical
   thinking and abject confusion about real economic, social, and
   political changes also seems bottoid113ss. if the experts don   t really
   know what they talk about when they talk about ai, is it any wonder
   that you and i don   t, either?

   it therefore might be worth our while to apply a bit more effort when
   referring to    ai   -ish subjects. at the very least, we might want to
   avoid the word    intelligence    when referring to software, because
   nobody really knows what it means. for example, google   s go-playing
   computer system was    smart    enough to beat the world   s best human
   players   but if you try to get it to generalize what it    learned    about
   go to any other domain, you   ll find [35]it   s dumber than a houseplant.
   even alan turing, the genius who mathematically defined what a computer
   is, [36]considered the question of defining intelligence too hard; his
   eponymous turing test dodges it, essentially saying    intelligence is as
   intelligence does.   

   so what should we call    ai   , if not that? orwell suggests that the cure
   for words that cloud our thinking is better words: simpler ones,
   crisper ones. some commentators suggest merely using [37]   software   ;
   personally, i think    automation    does the trick. instead of priming our
   minds with visions of inchoate software-spirits possessed of strange
   powers and inscrutable intentions, being more conscious of the words we
   choose might allow us to more clearly grasp the technologies around us.
