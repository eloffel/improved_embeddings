[18]keras: multiple outputs and multiple losses

   by [19]adrian rosebrock on june 4, 2018 in [20]deep learning,
   [21]keras, [22]tutorials

   a couple weeks ago we discussed how to perform multi-label
   classification using keras and deep learning. today we are going to
   discuss a more advanced technique called multi-output classification.
   so, what   s the difference between the two? and how are you supposed to
   keep track of all these terms? while it can be a bit confusing, [   ]

   today   s blog post is inspired by pyimagesearch reader ezekiel, who
   emailed me last week and asked: hey adrian, i went through your
   previous blog post on deep learning id164 along with the
   followup tutorial for real-time deep learning id164. thanks
   for those. i   ve been using your source code in my example projects but

   today   s blog post on multi-label classification with keras was inspired
   from an email i received last week from pyimagesearch reader, switaj.

   in last week   s blog post, you learned how to train a convolutional
   neural network (id98) with keras. today, we   re going to take this
   trained keras model and deploy it to an iphone and ios app using what
   apple has dubbed    coreml   , an easy-to-use machine learning framework
   for apple applications: to recap, thus far in this three-part series,

   when i was a kid, i was a huge pokemon nerd. i collected the trading
   cards, played the game boy games, and watched the tv show. if it
   involved pokemon, i was probably interested in it. pokemon made a

   [75]faces, [76]opencv 3, [77]tutorials

   today i   m going to share a little known secret with you regarding the
   opencv library: you can perform fast, accurate face detection with
   opencv using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped
   with the library. you may already know that opencv ships out-of-the-box
   with pre-trained haar cascades that can be used for face detection    [   ]
