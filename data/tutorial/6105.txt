   thank you for picking up a copy of [23]deep learning for computer
   vision with python!

   i appreciate your support of both myself and the pyimagesearch blog.
   without you, pyimagesearch would not be possible.

   my goal is to ensure you receive a huge return on both your investment
   of time and finances. to ensure you get off on the right foot, this
   guide will help you get started with your brand new copy of deep

   this is your purchase page and where you will be able to download your
   files. left click on each file and your download will start.

   all files that start with the prefix sb  are part of the starter
   bundle. files that start with pb  are part of the practitioner bundle.
   and finally, file names that start with ib  are part of the id163
   bundle.

   file names that include *_book.zip  contain the pdf of the respective
   bundle. file names that include *_videos.zip  contain the videos for
   the bundle. file names including *_code.zip  contain your code/datasets
   associated for the bundle. for example, the file name sb_code.zip
   contains all code/datasets associated with the starter bundle. the file
   name sb_book.zip  contains your pdf of the starter bundle.

   finally, the virtualmachine.zip  file contains your [24]pre-configured
   ubuntu virtualbox virtual machine.

   note: at this time only the starter bundle contents have been released.

       hi adrian,
       is it possible to upgrade from the practitioner bundle, which i
       purchased, to the id163 bundle? if so, how much will it cost and
       how to place the order?
       thanks!

            hi chris     you can always upgrade from a lower tier bundle to
            a higher tier bundle simply by paying the price difference. if
            you ever want to upgrade just [54]send me a message, let me
            know which bundle you would like to upgrade to, and from there
            i can get you the upgrade link.

            it   s probably going to be a few weeks/months until i can get
            the mobi/epub versions out. getting all three volumes of the
            pdf available are my number one priority. the mobi/epub
            versions require a lot more formatting and that   s not
            something i can take on until all of the pdf versions are
            complete.

            it should be able to yes, provide your processor supports
            virtualization (the vast majority do). if possible i would
            suggest using a machine with a little more processor speed and
            ram, but yes, it will be enough to get you started.

       hello adrian! i am really liking your new book i read only 30 pages
       so far but i can already tell it is very well structured and
       detailed, cant wait to continue my studies!
       but before i do then could you please help me understand what does
          quantifying the content of the image    actually mean?
       one more thing. could you please tell me if statement below is
       correct or not:
       feature extraction is a process where we take an image from which
       we want to extract features and then apply hand-designed image
       descriptor algorithm which results in vector of numbers, where that
       vector represent the    hand-designed features   .

          + adrian rosebrock october 2, 2017 at 10:02 am [76]#
            hi stefan     it   s great to hear that you are enjoying deep
            learning for id161 with python, that   s awesome!
            to address your questions:
            1.    quantifying the contents of an image    means that we apply
            an algorithm to takes an input image and spits out a list of
            numbers that represent the contents of an image. if we are
            quantifying color we might use color histograms. for texture
            we might use haralick or lbps. for structural features we
            might use hog. you can even treat pre-trained deep learning
            models as feature extractors by taking the outputs of
            arbitrary layers. basically, image quantification is taking an
            input image, applying some algorithm designed to characterize
            the image, and obtaining a feature vector.
            2. you are correct; however, keep in mind that while we
            typically use hand-designed features we may also use
            pre-trained feature extractors as well.

            for id161 with python! i hope you are enjoying it so
            far.
            as for your question, you can run the vm on your pc, but keep
            in mind that by definition a vm is not allowed to access
            peripherals such as your gpu. a vm abstracts the physical
            hardware. which os is your pc running?
            if you wanted to use your pc for training you certainly can
            but you would need to configure your local environment or run
            a docker instance. additionally, you may want to use my
            [95]pre-configured amazon ami.

       hi adrian,
       i couldn   t resist myself from buying the deep learning for computer
       vision practitioner bundle book. hope my lack of knowledge in
       opencv doesn   t hinder my learning.
       but i am determined to learn it using your book. couldn   t resist
       purchasing the book.
       hoping to learn a lot.
       thanks & regards,
       ratish

            thank you so much for picking up a copy of deep learning for
            id161 with python, ratish! thank you for supporting
            both myself and the pyimagesearch blog.
            i do use opencv occasionally in the book but honestly not very
            much. opencv is only used for basic operations, such as
            loading an image from disk. don   t worry if you don   t have much
            experience with opencv, you   ll still be successful when
            working through the book.

       i   m experimenting with things and am running into some cases i   d
       like to discuss     is there a pyimagesearch forum anywhere? if not,
       that would be an awesome place to compare notes. for example, i   m
       trying out a 2 category classifier modified off of the shallownet
       id98 in chapter 12 and am seeing 100% precision in the cat class and
       0% in the dog class. i   m doing something wrong and would love to
       pick the brains of other folks.

            hey matt,
            1. deep learning for id161 with python contains an
            issue/question reporter in the companion website. you can find
            the link to join the site in the pdf of the book.
            2. i include forums inside the [130]pyimagesearch gurus
            course. that is another great option as well.
            as far as your question goes, you likely forgot to change your
            categorical cross-id178 to binary cross-id178.
