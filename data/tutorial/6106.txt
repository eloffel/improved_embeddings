your deep learning + python ubuntu virtual machine

   by [18]adrian rosebrock on september 22, 2017 in [19]deep learning,
   [20]dl4cv

   [deep_learning_vm_header.png]

   when it comes to working with deep learning + python i highly recommend
   that you use a linux environment.

   deep learning tools can be more easily configured and installed on
   linux, allowing you to develop and run neural networks quickly.

   of course, configuring your own deep learning + python + linux
   development environment can be quite the tedious task, especially if
   you are new to linux, a beginner at working the command line/terminal,
   or a novice when compiling and installing packages by hand.

   in order to help you jump start your deep learning + python education,
   i have created an ubuntu virtual machine with all necessary deep
   learning libraries you need to successful (including keras, tensorflow,
   scikit-learn, scikit-image, opencv, and others) pre-configured and
   pre-installed.

   this virtual machine is part of all three bundles of my book, [21]deep
   learning for id161 with python. after you purchase your copy
   you   ll be able to download the virtual machine and get started with
   deep learning immediately.

   in the remainder of this tutorial i   ll show you:
     * how to download and install virtualbox for managing, creating, and
       importing virtual machines.
     * how to import the pre-configured ubuntu virtual machine for deep
       learning.
     * how to access the pre-installed deep learning libraries on the
       virtual machine.

   let   s go ahead and get started.

your deep learning + python virtual machine

   your purchase of [22]deep learning for id161 with python
   includes a pre-configured ubuntu virtual machine for deep learning. in
   the following sections i   ll show you how easy it is to import your
   ubuntu deep learning virtual machine.

   this tutorial is broken down into three parts to make it easy to digest
   and understand:
    1. download and install virtualbox.
    2. download and import your pre-configured ubuntu deep learning
       virtual machine.
    3. access the python development environment inside the deep learning
       virtual machine.

step #1: download and install virtualbox

   the first step is to download [23]virtualbox, a free open source
   platform for managing virtual machines.

   virtualbox will run on macos, linux, and windows.

   we call the physical hardware virtualbox is running on your host
   machine. the virtual machine that will be imported into virtualbox is
   the guest machine.

   to install virtualbox, first visit the [24]downloads page and then
   select the appropriate binaries for your operating system:

   figure 1: virtualbox downloads.

   from there install the software on your system following the provided
   instructions     i   ll be using macos in this example, but again, these
   instructions will also work on linux and windows as well:
   [deep_learning_vm_virtualbox_install.png]

   figure 2: installing virtualbox on macos

step #2: download your deep learning virtual machine

   now that virtualbox is installed you need to download the
   pre-configured ubuntu virtual machine associated with your purchase of
   [25]deep learning for id161 with python:

   figure 3: downloading the pre-configured ubuntu deep learning virtual
   machine.

   the file is approximately 4gb so depending on your internet connection
   this download make take some time to complete.

   once you have downloaded the virtualmachine.zip  file, unarchive it and
   you   ll find a file named dl4cv ubuntu vm.ova . i have placed this file
   on my desktop:

   figure 4: the dl4cv ubuntu vm.ova file.

   this is the actual file that you will be importing into the virtualbox
   manager.

step #3: import the deep learning virtual machine into virtualbox

   go ahead and open up the virtualbox manager.

   from there select file => import appliance... :

   figure 5: importing the pre-configured ubuntu deep learning virtual
   machine.

   once the dialog opens you   ll want to navigate to where the dl4cv ubuntu
   vm.ova  file resides on disk:

   figure 6: selecting the pre-configured ubuntu deep learning virtual
   machine.

   finally, you can click    import    and allow the virtual machine to
   import:

   figure 7: importing the ubuntu deep learning virtual machine may take
   3-4 minutes depending on your system.

   the entire import process should take only a few minutes.

step #4: boot the deep learning virtual machine

   now that the deep learning virtual machine has been imported we need to
   boot it.

   from the virtualbox manager  select the    dl4cv ubuntu vm    on the left
   pane of the window and then click    start   :

   figure 8: booting the pre-configured ubuntu deep learning virtual
   machine.

   once the virtual machine has booted you can login using the following
   credentials:
     * username: pyimagesearch
     * password: deeplearning

   figure 9: logging into the deep learning virtual machine.

step #5: access the deep learning python virtual environment

   the next step after logging into the vm is to launch a terminal:

   figure 10: launching a terminal window.

   from there, execute workon dl4cv  to access the python + deep learning
   development environment:
   [deep_learning_vm_python_env.png]

   figure 11: accessing the dl4cv deep learning + python development
   environment.

   notice that my prompt now has the text (dl4cv)  preceding it, implying
   that i am inside the dl4cv  python virtual environment.

   you can run pip freeze  to see all the python libraries installed.

   i have included a screenshot below demonstrating how to import keras,
   tensorflow, and opencv from a python shell:
   [deep_learning_vm_python_imports.png]

   figure 12: importing keras, tensorflow, and opencv into our deep
   learning python virtual environment.

step #6: (optional) install guest additions on virtual machine

   an optional step you may wish to perform is installing the virtualbox
   guest additions on your machine.

   the guest additions package allow you to:
     * copy and paste from the virtual machine to your host (and vice
       versa)
     * share folders between the virtual machine and host
     * adjust screen resolution
     * etc.

   you can install the guest additions by selecting devices => install
   guest additions...  from the virtualbox menu at the top of your screen.

executing code from deep learning for id161 with python on your
virtual machine

   there are multiple methods to access the deep learning for computer
   vision with python source code + datasets from your virtual machine.

   by far the easiest method is to simply open firefox and download the
   .zip archives from the    your purchase    page after buying your copy of
   deep learning for id161 with python. i would recommend
   forwarding the receipt email to yourself so you can login to your inbox
   via firefox and then download the code + datasets.

   you may also use your favorite sftp/ftp client to transfer the code
   from your host machine to the virtual machine.

   of course, you can always manually write the code inside ubuntu virtual
   machine using the built-in text editor as you follow along with the
   book.

tips for using the deep learning virtual machine

   when using the ubuntu virtualbox virtual machine for deep learning i
   recommend the following:
     * use [26]sublime text as a lightweight code editor. sublime text is
       my favorite code editor for linux. it   s simple, easy to use, and
       very lightweight, making it ideal for a virtual machine.
     * use [27]pycharm as a full blown ide. when it comes to python ides,
       it   s hard to beat pycharm. i personally don   t like using pycharm
       inside a virtual machine as it   s quite resource hungry. you   ll also
       need to configure pycharm to use the dl4cv  python environment once
       installed.

troubleshooting and faq

   in this section i detail answers to frequently asked questions and
   problems regarding the pre-configured ubuntu deep learning virtual
   machine.

how do i boot my deep learning virtual machine?

   once your vm has been imported, select the    dl4cv ubuntu vm    on the
   left-hand side of the virtualbox software, then click the    start   
   button. your vm will then boot.

what is the username and password for the ubuntu deep learning virtual
machine?

   the username is pyimagesearch  and the password is deeplearning .

the username and password is not working for me.

   the keyboard layout chosen for the ubuntu virtual machine is the
   standard english layout. if you are using a keyboard in a different
   language than english please add the keyboard layout for your specific
   language.

   to accomplish this, first open the system settings application and
   select    keyboard   . from there, click the    text entry    button at the
   bottom of the panel:

   figure 13: selecting    text entry    in the deep learning virtual image.

   lastly, click the    +    icon, select your keyboard layout, and
   click    add   :

   figure 14: updating the keyboard layout in the ubuntu virtual machine.

   you may need to reboot your system for these changes to take effect.

how do i run python scripts that access deep learning libraries?

   the deep learning for id161 with python virtual machine uses
   [28]python virtual environments to help organize python modules and
   keep them separate from the system install of python.

   to access the virtual environment simply execute workon dl4cv  from the
   shell. form there you   ll have access to deep learning/id161
   libraries such as tensorflow, keras, opencv, scikit-learn,
   scikit-image, etc.

how can i access my gpu from the ubuntu virtual machine?

   the short answer is that you cannot access your gpu from the virtual
   machine.

   a virtual machine abstracts your hardware and creates an artificial
   barrier between your host machine and your guest machine. peripherals
   such as your gpu, usb ports, etc. on your physical computer cannot be
   accessed by the virtual machine.

   if you would like to use your gpu for deep learning i would suggest
   configuring your native development environment.

i am receiving an error message related to    vt-x/amd-v hardware acceleration
is not available for your system   . what do i do?

   if you are getting an error message similar to the following:

   figure 13: resolving    vt-x/amd-v hardware acceleration is not available
   for your system    errors.

   then you likely need to check your bios and ensure virtualization is
   enabled. if you   re on windows you might also need to disable hyper-v
   mode.

   to resolve the problem:
    1. disable hyper-v mode from the windows control panel (if using the
       windows operating system). take a look at the answers to this
       [29]question, which is the same problem you are having. disabling
       hyper-v is different on different windows versions, but following
       the answer to the question above you should be able to find your
       solution. that said, also make sure you do step 2 below as well.
    2. check your bios. the next time you boot your system, go into the
       bios and ensure that virtualization is enabled (normally it   s under
       some sort of    advanced setting   ). if virtualization is not enabled,
       then the vm will not be able to boot.

summary

   in today   s tutorial i demonstrated:
     * how to download and install virtualbox, the software used to manage
       virtual machines.
     * how to import and launch your ubuntu deep learning virtual machine.
     * how to access the deep learning development environment once ubuntu
       has booted.

   all purchases of my book, [30]deep learning for id161 with
   python, include a copy of my pre-configured virtual machine.

   this virtual machine is by far the fastest way to get up and running
   with deep learning and id161 using the python programming
   language.

            use virtualbox (especially if they are new to id161,
            deep learning, or the command line).
            there are also many moving parts for the release of the new

            the vm will work just fine if you are getting started with
            deep learning and going through the    starter bundle   . yes,
            running on the cpu does take considerably longer. however, if
            you are just learning the basics (similar to learning the
            basics of programming) a cpu is sufficient. once you get to
            the point where you are training larger, deeper networks you
            would want to use a gpu.

            hi naushad     thanks for your question. you should make a    host
            only network    in virtual box. this will allow your host to
            connect to your vm. from there, restart the vm and run
            ifconfig on the vm to figure out what its ip address is. on
            mine it is 192.168.56.102. so then to scp files to my vm from
            the terminal (you   ll have to adapt to winscp), i type scp
            files.zip pyimagesearch@192.168.56.102:~ and enter the
            password when prompted. the files will then reside on your vm
            in your home folder. let me know if this helps!

            hi grishma     david here. my suggestion is to take a look at
            your mac security settings     you might have to enable file
            sharing. you should also review [107]section 4.3 of the
            virtualbox manual. there are also a lot of virtualbox forums
            with help on this feature that you can review. that being
            said, i   ve used this feature in the past and i found it to be
            unreliable (requiring restarts of the vm, etc.). for file
            sharing my preferred method is scp. if you setup a    host only
            network    via virtualbox vm settings, you can then scp files
            from your host os (mac) to your guest os (ubuntu). for dl4cv,
            you can zip individual chapters and datasets and scp them to
            the vm. give both a shot and see which you like better.

       hey adrian,
       i have installed the vm and everything runs perfectly.
       but i have a windows system with a partition running ubuntu.can i
       run the similar development environment with all the libraries in
       the ubuntu partition , because at times the vm tends to be slow.
       would this be advisable or should i stick with the vm?

            yes, you can absolutely run the code on your ubuntu partition.

       hey adrian, i am grateful for your kind reply every time.
       i am taking your pyimagesearch gurus course.( i also purchased a
       deep learning course. )
       so i have already built a virtual machine once.
       (
       [115]https://gurus.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-virtual-machine/
       )
       i think it is wasteful to build a virtual machine again.
       is there a way i can install only the deep learning
       module(tensorflow?) in my existing virtual machine?

            hi yoon-soo     the gurus course vm and dl4cv vm actually has
            different libraries installed on it. i do that to ensure the
            vms work out of the box with no errors for you. yes, having
            two vms will require slightly more hard drive space for you
            but it also guarantees that they will work regardless on your
            machine. please make sure you download both.

       hey adrian!
       i was wondering, why do i need a virtual machine to run this? i
       have conda installed and i can import keras, tensorflow or any
       other package with a simple pip install or conda install, why the
       virtual machine? are things configured differently there, do you
       really recommend linux or can i just run like this on my mac os?

            if your local machine is properly configured than you can by
            all means use it     you don   t need the vm. i provide the vm as
            an easy way to get readers started, but if your machine is
            properly configured you can skip the vm.

                 congrats on resolving the issue, niko. the vm does assume
                 an english keyboard layout. if you are using a
                 non-english keyboard layout then the key mappings will be
                 different.

       i installed the virtual machine to make it easier to get started,
       and ran the first test program, the default knn classifier, and got
       the expected output. however, going forward, to learn anything at
       all about the algorithms, i will need to step through the code,
       being able to see lots of context and easily examine all the values
       at once. especially when writing anything original. the native pdb
       would be ok if the issue were debugging, but it isn   t. the issue is
       understanding, and pdb is no good at all for that, at least from my
       attempted use of it before. the spyder ide worked ok for that
       purpose on some other projects i tried. you mentioned pycharm, so
       maybe that has a good    debugger    also? is there already a gui
       interfaced debugger installed in the dl4cv box? what do you use
       when writing some original code for the first time, and you are
       exploring how it works?

          + adrian rosebrock february 14, 2019 at 1:57 pm [139]#
            pycharm is a really nice ide and i highly recommend it. if you
            like working with the gui then absolutely go with pycharm.
            there is no gui interface debugger on the vm, you would need
            to install whichever one you want to try.
            as far as writing code for the first time i use a lot of print
            statements and pdb. that   s honestly about it.

                 i did manage to install pycharm in the vm, though it
                 required an unexpected fix for that to happen: in trying
                 to install pycharm, at some point i encountered    failed
                 to load module canberra-gtk-module   , and would not
                 proceed. thanks to stackexchange or some other online
                 help (i forget) i ran sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk*,
                 whatever that means or does, and then pycharm would
                 indeed install. so now i can step through your code and
                 see what happens and see the values, etc, so am off and
                 running. my son however didn   t mess with the vm and
                 simply used his anaconda/spyder setup he already had with
                 the tools like keras and tensorflow, so he just added
                 opencv, and then your code ran fine in spyder, which also
                 has a nice    debugger    (not really debugging, just code
                 tracking and exploring, that   s the point). so i think
                 that it what i will end up doing, just because that was
                 familiar from the past, not saying it is any better than
                 pycharm. anything that works. thanks.
