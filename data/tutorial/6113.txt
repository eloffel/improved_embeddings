apache tika - a content analysis toolkit

   the apache tika    toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from
   over a thousand different file types (such as ppt, xls, and pdf). all
   of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making
   tika useful for id120, content analysis, translation,
   and much more. you can find the latest release on the [3]download page.
   please see the [4]getting started page for more information on how to
   start using tika.

   the [5]parser and [6]detector pages describe the main interfaces of
   tika and how they work.

   if you're interested in contributing to tika, please see the
   [7]contributing page or send an email to the [8]tika development list.

   tika is a project of the [9]apache software foundation, and was
   formerly a subproject of [10]apache lucene.
