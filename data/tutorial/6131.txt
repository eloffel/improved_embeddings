can convolutional neural networks crack sudoku puzzles?

   sudoku is a popular number puzzle that requires you to fill blanks in a
   9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the
   nine 3  3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. there have
   been various approaches to solving that, including computational ones.
   in this project, i show that simple convolutional neural networks have
   the potential to crack sudoku without any rule-based postprocessing.

requirements

     * numpy >= 1.11.1
     * tensorflow == 1.1

background

     * to see what sudoku is, check the [84]wikipedia
     * to investigate this task comprehensively, read through [85]mcguire
       et al. 2013.

dataset

     * 1m games were generated using generate_sudoku.py for training. i've
       uploaded them on the kaggle dataset storage. they are available
       [86]here.
     * 30 authentic games were collected from [87]http://1sudoku.com.

model description

     * 10 blocks of convolution layers of kernel size 3.

file description

     * generate_sudoku.py create sudoku games. you don't have to run this.
       instead, download [88]pre-generated games.
     * hyperparams.py includes all adjustable hyper parameters.
     * data_load.py loads data and put them in queues so multiple
       mini-bach data are generated in parallel.
     * modules.py contains some wrapper functions.
     * train.py is for training.
     * test.py is for test.

training

     * step 1. download and extract [89]training data.
     * step 2. run python train.py. or download the [90]pretrained file.

test

     * run python test.py.

evaluation metric

   accuracy is defined as

   number of blanks where the prediction matched the solution / number of
   blanks.

results

   after a couple of hours of training, the training curve seems to reach
   the optimum.

   [91][training_curve.png]
   i use a simple trick in id136. instead of cracking the whole blanks
   all at once, i fill in a single blank where the prediction is the most
   probable among the all predictions. as can be seen below, my model
   scored 0.86 in accuracy. details are available in the `results` folder.
