numpy exercises

   in numerical computing in python, numpy is essential. i'm writing
   simple (a few lines for each problem) but hopefully helpful exercises
   based on each of numpy's functions. the outline will be as follows.
     * array creation routines (done)
     * array manipulation routines (done)
     * string operations (done)
     * numpy-specific help functions (done)
     * input and output (done)
     * id202 (done)
     * discrete fourier transform (done)
     * logic functions (done)
     * mathematical functions (done)
     * random sampling (numpy.random) (done)
     * set routines (done)
     * sorting, searching, and counting (done)
     * statistics (done)
