tensorflow exercises

   tensorflow is arugably the most popular deep learning library as of
   2017.

   this is designed to help those who want to familiarize themselves with
   tensorflow functions. particulary, i focus on comparing tensorflow
   functions with the equivalent functions in numpy, the de facto standard
   numerical computation library. i hope this will help you get
   comfortable with tensorflow quickly.

   the basic outline will be as follows, though this is not 100% fixed.
     * constants, sequences, and random values (done)
     * graphs (done)
     * variables (done)
     * reading data (done)
     * tensor transformations (done)
     * math part 1 (done)
     * math part 2 (done)
     * math part 3 (done)
     * strings (wip)
     * control flow (done)
     * images (wip)
     * sparse tensors (done)
     * neural network part 1 (done)
     * neural network part 2 (done)
     * neural network part 3 (wip)
     * id195 (done)
     * audio_processing (done)

   enjoy!
