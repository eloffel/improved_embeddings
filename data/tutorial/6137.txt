   [75]practical pytorch

   learn pytorch with project-based tutorials. these tutorials demonstrate
   modern techniques with readable code and use regular data from the
   internet.

tutorials

series 1: id56s for nlp

   applying recurrent neural networks to natural language tasks, from
   classification to generation.
     * [76]classifying names with a character-level id56
     * [77]generating shakespeare with a character-level id56
     * [78]generating names with a conditional character-level id56
     * [79]translation with a sequence to sequence network and attention
     * [80]exploring word vectors with glove
     * wip id31 with a word-level id56 and glove embeddings

series 2: id56s for timeseries data

     * wip predicting discrete events with an id56

get started

   the quickest way to run these on a fresh linux or mac machine is to
   install [81]anaconda:
curl -lo https://repo.continuum.io/archive/anaconda3-4.3.0-linux-x86_64.sh
bash anaconda3-4.3.0-linux-x86_64.sh

   then install pytorch:
conda install pytorch -c soumith

   then clone this repo and start jupyter notebook:
git clone http://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch
cd practical-pytorch
jupyter notebook

recommended reading

pytorch basics

     * [82]http://pytorch.org/ for installation instructions
     * [83]offical pytorch tutorials for more tutorials (some of these
       tutorials are included there)
     * [84]deep learning with pytorch: a 60-minute blitz to get started
       with pytorch in general
     * [85]introduction to pytorch for former torchies if you are a former
       lua torch user
     * [86]jcjohnson's pytorch examples for a more in depth overview
       (including custom modules and autograd functions)

recurrent neural networks

     * [87]the unreasonable effectiveness of recurrent neural networks
       shows a bunch of real life examples
     * [88]deep learning, nlp, and representations for an overview on word
       embeddings and id56s for nlp
     * [89]understanding id137 is about lstms work specifically,
       but also informative about id56s in general

machine translation

     * [90]learning phrase representations using id56 encoder-decoder for
       id151
     * [91]sequence to sequence learning with neural networks

id12

     * [92]id4 by jointly learning to align and
       translate
     * [93]effective approaches to attention-based neural machine
       translation

other id56 uses

     * [94]a neural conversational model

other pytorch tutorials

     * [95]deep learning for nlp in pytorch
