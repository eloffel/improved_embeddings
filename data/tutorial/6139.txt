   this article is part of cmo.com   s march/april series about emerging
   technology. [28]click here for more.

   artificial intelligence has the potential to [29]change business
   forever.

   its promise? to take care of all the mundane tasks employees currently
   handle, freeing their time to be more creative and perform the work
   that machines cannot. today, the emerging technology is used mostly by
   large enterprises through machine learning and predictive analytics.

   here   s a look at the current state of ai and what lies ahead.

   1. today, just 15% of enterprises are using ai. but 31% said it is on
   the agenda for the next 12 months. ([30]source: adobe)

   2. for those enterprises already in the ai fray, top-performing
   companies said they are more than twice as likely as their peers to be
   using the technology for marketing (28% vs. 12%). unsurprisingly,
   analysis of data is a key ai focus for businesses, with on-site
   personalization the second most commonly cited use case for
   ai. ([31]source: adobe)

   3. when asked about the next big marketing trend, survey respondents
   identified consumer personalization (29%), ai (26%), and voice search
   (21.23%). these top three responses, which total 75% of all ai
   applications, demonstrate that ai is more pervasive and prominent than
   respondents realize. ([32]source: brightedge)

   4. forty-seven percent of digitally mature organizations, or those that
   have advanced digital practices, said they have a defined ai strategy.
   ([33]source: adobe)

   5. business leaders said they believe ai is going to be fundamental in
   the future. in fact, 72% termed it a    business advantage.    ([34]source:
   pwc)

   6. sixty-one percent of those who have an innovation strategy said they
   are using ai to identify opportunities in data that would otherwise be
   missed. only 22% without a strategy said the same. ([35]source:
   narrative science)

   7. consumers use more ai than they realize. while only 33% think they
   use ai-enabled technology, 77% actually use an ai-pwered service or
   device. ([36]source: pega)

   8. thirty-eight percent of consumers said they believe ai is going to
   improve customer service. ([37]source: pega)

   9. sixty-one percent of 6,000 people surveyed said they believe ai will
   make the world a better place. ([38]source: arm)

   10. in a survey of over 1,600 marketing professionals, 61%, regardless
   of company size, pointed to machine learning and ai as their company   s
   most significant data initiative for next year. ([39]source: memsql)

   11. the impact of ai technologies on business is projected to increase
   labor productivity by up to 40% and enable people to make more
   efficient use of their time. ([40]source: accenture)

   12. the largest companies   those with at least 100,000 employees   are the
   most likely to have an ai strategy, but only half have one.
   ([41]source: mit sloan management review)

   13. more than 80% of executives surveyed are    eyeing the peaks    and
   view ai as a strategic opportunity. ([42]source: mit sloan management
   review)

   14. voice assistants are being incorporated into a wide range of
   consumer products; nearly half of u.s. adults (46%) said they now use
   these applications to interact with smartphones and other devices.
   ([43]source: pew research center)

   15. when asked about expectations for marketing technology providers to
   have native ai capabilities, more than 50% of respondents said it was
   important or a must-have. ([44]source: brightedge)
