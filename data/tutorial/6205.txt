getting started

   first, get the code on your system! the simplest method is via git
   ([149]git installation instructions):
     * cd ~/
     * git clone https://github.com/mycroftai/mycroft-core.git
     * cd mycroft-core
     * bash dev_setup.sh

   this script sets up dependencies and a [150]virtualenv. if running in
   an environment besides ubuntu/debian, arch or fedora you may need to
   manually install packages as instructed by dev_setup.sh.

   note: the default branch for this repository is 'dev', which should be
   considered a work-in-progress. if you want to clone a more stable
   version, switch over to the 'master' branch.

running mycroft

   mycroft provides start-mycroft.sh to perform common tasks. this script
   uses a virtualenv created by dev_setup.sh. assuming you installed
   mycroft-core in your home directory run:
     * cd ~/mycroft-core
     * ./start-mycroft.sh debug

   the "debug" command will start the background services (microphone
   listener, skill, messagebus, and audio subsystems) as well as bringing
   up a text-based command line interface (cli) you can use to interact
   with mycroft and see the contents of the various logs. alternatively
   you can run ./start-mycroft.sh all to begin the services without the
   command line interface. later you can bring up the cli using
   ./start-mycroft.sh cli.

   the background services can be stopped as a group with:
     * ./stop-mycroft.sh

using mycroft

home device and account manager

   mycroft ai, inc. maintains a device and account management system known
   as mycroft home. developers may sign up at:
   [151]https://home.mycroft.ai

   by default, mycroft-core is configured to use home. by saying "hey
   mycroft, pair my device" (or any other request verbal request) you will
   be informed that your device needs to be paired. mycroft will speak a
   6-digit code which you can entered into the pairing page within the
   [152]mycroft home site.

   once paired, your unit will use mycroft api keys for services such as
   speech-to-text (stt), weather and various other skills.

skills

   mycroft is nothing without skills. there are a handful of default
   skills that are downloaded automatically to your /opt/mycroft/skills
   directory, but most need to be installed explicitly. see the [153]skill
   repo to discover skills made by others. and please share your own
   interesting work!

behind the scenes

pairing information

   pairing information generated by registering with home is stored in:
   ~/.mycroft/identity/identity2.json <-- do not share this with others!

configuration

   mycroft configuration consists of 4 possible locations:
     * mycroft-core/mycroft/configuration/mycroft.conf(defaults)
     * [154]mycroft home (remote)
     * /etc/mycroft/mycroft.conf(machine)
     * $home/.mycroft/mycroft.conf(user)

   when the configuration loader starts, it looks in these locations in
   this order, and loads all configurations. keys that exist in multiple
   configuration files will be overridden by the last file to contain the
   value. this process results in a minimal amount being written for a
   specific device and user, without modifying default distribution files.

using mycroft without home

   if you do not wish to use the mycroft home service, you may insert your
   own api keys into the configuration files listed below in
   configuration.

   the place to insert the api key looks like the following:

   [weatherskill] api_key = ""

   put a relevant key inside the quotes and mycroft-core should begin to
   use the key immediately.

api key services

   these are the keys currently used in mycroft core:
     * [155]stt api, google stt, google cloud speech
     * [156]weather skill api, openweathermap
     * [157]wolfram-alpha skill

using mycroft behind a proxy

   many schools, universities and workplaces run a proxy on their network.
   if you need to type in a username and password to access the external
   internet, then you are likely behind a proxy.

   if you plan to use mycroft behind a proxy, then you will need to do an
   additional configuration step.

   note: in order to complete this step, you will need to know the
   hostname and port for the proxy server. your network administrator will
   be able to provide these details. your network administrator may want
   information on what type of traffic mycroft will be using. we use https
   traffic on port 443, primarily for accessing rest-based apis.

using mycroft behind a proxy without authentication

   if you are using mycroft behind a proxy without authentication, add the
   following environment variables, changing the proxy_hostname.com and
   proxy_port for the values for your network. these commands are executed
   from the linux command line interface (cli).
$ export http_proxy=http://proxy_hostname.com:proxy_port
$ export https_port=http://proxy_hostname.com:proxy_port
$ export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com,0.0.0.0,::1
"

using mycroft behind an authenticated proxy

   if you are behind a proxy which requires authentication, add the
   following environment variables, changing the proxy_hostname.com and
   proxy_port for the values for your network. these commands are executed
   from the linux command line interface (cli).
$ export http_proxy=http://user:password@proxy_hostname.com:proxy_port
$ export https_port=http://user:password@proxy_hostname.com:proxy_port
$ export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com,0.0.0.0,::1
"
