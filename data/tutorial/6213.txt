pdfanno

   pdfanno is a browser-based linguistic annotation tool for pdf
   documents.
   it offers functions for annotating pdf with labels and relations.
   for natural language processing and machine learning, it is suitable
   for development of gold-standard data with named entity spans,
   dependency relations, and coreference chains.

   if you use pdfanno, please cite the following paper:
hiroyuki shindo, yohei munesada and yuji matsumoto,
"pdfanno: a web-based linguistic annotation tool for pdf documents",
in proceedings of lrec, 2018.

     * [98]online demo (v0.4.1)

   it is highly recommended to use the latest version of chrome. (firefox
   will also be supported in future.)

installation

   if you install pdfanno locally,
git clone https://github.com/paperai/pdfanno.git
cd pdfanno
npm install
cp .env.example .env

   then, edit .env as you like.
   the default values are:
server_port=1000

run server

npm run server

usage

    1. visit the [99]online demo with the latest version of chrome.
    2. load your pdf and annotation file (if any). sample pdfs and
       annotations are downloadable from [100]here.
          + for pdfs located on your computer:
            put the pdfs and annotation files (if any) in the same
            directory, then specify the directory via browse button.
          + for pdf available on the web:
            access '[101]https://paperai.github.io/pdfanno/latest/?pdf=' +
            <url of the pdf>
            for example,
            [102]https://paperai.github.io/pdfanno/latest/?pdf=http://www.
            aclweb.org/anthology/p12-1046.pdf.
    3. annotate the pdf as you like.
    4. save your annotations via [103][fa-download.png] button.
       if you continue the annotation, respecify your directory via browse
       button to reload the pdf and anno file.

   for security reasons, pdfanno does not automatically save your
   annotations.
   don't forget to download your current annotations!

annotation tools

   icon description
   [104][fa-pencil.png] span highlighting. it is disallowed to cross page
   boundaries.
   [105][fa-long-arrow-right.png] one-way relation. this is used for
   annotating dependency relation between spans.
   [106][fa-square-o.png] rectangle. it is disallowed to cross page
   boundaries.

annotation file (.anno)

   in pdfanno, an annotation file (.anno) follows [107]toml format.
   here is an example of anno file:
pdfanno = "0.4.1"
pdfextract = "0.2.4"

[[spans]]
id = "1"
page = 1
label = "label1"
text = "agbi 0.05 sb 0.95 te 2"
textrange = [1422,1438]

[[spans]]
id = "2"
page = 1
label = "label1"
text = "0.48 wm [no_unicode] 1 k [no_unicode] 1 )"
textrange = [1386,1397]

[[relations]]
head = "1"
tail = "2"
label = "relation1"

   where textrange corresponds to the start and end token id of pdftxt.
   pdftxt is a text file extracted from the original pdf file.
   you can download pdftxt via pdf.txt button at the top right of the
   screen.

reference anno file

   to support multi-user annotation, pdfanno allows to load reference anno
   file.
   for example, if you create a.anno and an another annotator creates
   b.anno for the same pdf, load a.anno as usual, and load b.anno as a
   reference file. then pdfanno renders a.anno and b.anno with different
   colors each other. rendering more than one reference file is also
   supported.
   this is useful to check inter-annotator agreement and resolving
   annotation conflicts.
   note that the reference files are rendered as read-only.
