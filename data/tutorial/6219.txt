automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language

   repository for thomas davidson, dana warmsley, michael macy, and ingmar
   weber. 2017. "automated hate speech detection and the problem of
   offensive language." icwsm. you read the paper [92]here.

   warning: the data, lexicons, and notebooks all contain content that is
   racist, sexist, homophobic, and offensive in many other ways.

   you can find our labeled data in the data directory. we have included
   them as a pickle file (python 2.7) and as a csv. you will also find a
   notebook in the src directory containing python 2.7 code to replicate
   our analyses in the paper and a lexicon in the lexicons directory that
   we generated to try to more accurately classify hate speech. the
   classifier directory contains a script, instructions, and the necessary
   files to run our classifier on new data, a test case is provided.

   please cite our paper in any published work that uses any of these
   resources.
