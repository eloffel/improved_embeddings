news-please

announcement

   if you're interested in news analysis, you might also want to check out
   our new project, [101]giveme5w1h - a tool that extracts phrases
   answering the journalistic five w and one h questions to describe an
   article's main event, i.e., who did what, when, where, why, and how.

   [102]pypi version [103]donate

   [104][logo-256.png]

   news-please is an open source, easy-to-use news crawler that extracts
   structured information from almost any news website. it can follow
   recursively internal hyperlinks and read rss feeds to fetch both most
   recent and also old, archived articles. you only need to provide the
   root url of the news website to crawl it completely. news-please
   combines the power of multiple state-of-the-art libraries and tools,
   such as [105]scrapy, [106]newspaper, and [107]readability. news-please
   also features a library mode, which allows python developers to use the
   crawling and extraction functionality within their own program.
   moreover, news-please allows to conveniently [108]crawl and extract
   articles from commoncrawl.org.

extracted information

     * headline
     * lead paragraph
     * main content (textual)
     * main image
     * author's name
     * publication date
     * language

features

     * works out of the box: install with pip, add urls of your pages, run
       :-)
     * run news-please conveniently with the [109]cli or use it as a
       [110]library within your own software or to extract articles from
       [111]the news archive of commoncrawl.org
     * runs on your favorite python version (2.7 and 3+)

modes and use cases

   news-please supports three use cases, which are explained in more
   detail in the following.

cli mode

     * stores extracted results in json files or elasticsearch (you can
       implement other storages easily)
     * simple but extensive configuration (if you want to tweak the
       results)
     * revisions: crawl articles multiple times and track changes

library mode

     * crawl and extract information given a list of article urls
     * to use news-please within your own python code

news archive from commoncrawl.org

     * commoncrawl.org provides an extensive, free-to-use archive of news
       articles from small and major publishers world wide
     * news-please enables users to conveniently download and extract
       articles from commoncrawl.org
     * you can optionally define filter criteria, such as news
       publisher(s) or the date period, within which articles need to be
       published
     * clone the news-please repository, [112]install the awscli tool,
       adapt the config section in
       [113]newsplease/examples/commoncrawl.py, and execute python3 -m
       newsplease.examples.commoncrawl

getting started

   it's super easy, we promise!

installation

   we prefer python 3, but python 2.7 is supported, too!
$ pip3 install news-please

use within your own code (as a library)

   you can access the core functionality of news-please, i.e. extraction
   of semi-structured information from one or more news articles, in your
   own code by using news-please in library mode. if you want to use
   news-please's full website extraction (given only the root url) or
   continuous crawling mode (using rss), you'll need to use the cli mode.
from newsplease import newsplease
article = newsplease.from_url('https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/politics/cp
ac-stephen-bannon-reince-priebus.html?hp')
print(article.title)

   a sample of an extracted article can be found [114]here (as a json
   file).

   if you want to crawl multiple articles at a time, optionally with a
   timeout in seconds
newsplease.from_urls([url1, url2, ...], timeout=6)

   or if you have a file containing all urls (each line containing a
   single url)
newsplease.from_file(path)

   or if you have raw html data (you can also provide the original url to
   increase the accuracy of extracting the publishing date)
newsplease.from_html(html, url=none)

   or if you have a [115]warc file (also check out our [116]commoncrawl
   workflow, which provides convenient methods to filter commoncrawl's
   archive for specific hosts and dates)
newsplease.from_warc(warc_record)

   in library mode, news-please will attempt to download and extract
   information from each url. the previously described functions are
   blocking, i.e., will return once news-please has attempted all urls.
   the resulting list contains all successfully extracted articles.

run the crawler (via the cli)

$ news-please

   news-please will then start crawling a few examples pages. to terminate
   the process press ctrl+c. news-please will then shut down within 5-60
   seconds. you can also press ctrl+c twice, which will immediately kill
   the process (not recommended, though).

   the results are stored by default in json files in the data folder. in
   the default configuration, news-please also stores the original html
   files.

crawl other pages

   most likely, you will not want to crawl from the websites provided in
   our example configuration. simply head over to the [117]sitelist.hjson
   file and add the root urls of the news outlets' web pages of your
   choice. news-please also can extract the most recent events from the
   [118]gdelt project, see [119]here.

elasticsearch

   news-please also supports export to elasticsearch. using elasticsearch
   will also enable the versioning feature. first, enable it in the
   [120]config.id18 at the config directory, which is by default
   ~/news-please/config but can also be changed with the -c parameter to a
   custom location. in case the directory does not exist, a default
   directory will be created at the specified location.
[scrapy]

item_pipelines = {
                   'newsplease.pipeline.pipelines.articlemasterextractor':100,
                   'newsplease.pipeline.pipelines.elasticsearchstorage':350
                 }

   that's it! except, if your elasticsearch database is not located at
   http://localhost:9200, uses a different username/password or
   ca-certificate authentication. in these cases, you will also need to
   change the following.
[elasticsearch]

host = localhost
port = 9200

...

# credentials used  for authentication (supports ca-certificates):

use_ca_certificates = false           # true if authentification needs to be per
formed
ca_cert_path = '/path/to/cacert.pem'
client_cert_path = '/path/to/client_cert.pem'
client_key_path = '/path/to/client_key.pem'
username = 'root'
secret = 'password'

what's next?

   we have collected a bunch of useful information for both [121]users and
   [122]developers. as a user, you will most likely only deal with two
   files: [123]sitelist.hjson (to define sites to be crawled) and
   [124]config.id18 (probably only rarely, in case you want to tweak the
   configuration).

wiki and support (also, how to open an issue)

   you can find more information on usage and development in our
   [125]wiki! before contacting us, please check out the wiki. if you
   still have questions on how to use news-please, please create a new
   [126]issue on github.
