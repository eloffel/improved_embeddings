python wrapper for stanford openie

   the unofficial cross-platform python wrapper for the state-of-art
   information extraction library from stanford university.
note: windows is not currently supported! works on unix systems like linux and m
ac os.

about stanford ie

   id10 (open ie) refers to the extraction of
   structured relation triples from plain text, such that the schema for
   these relations does not need to be specified in advance. for example,
   barack obama was born in hawaii would create a triple (barack obama;
   was born in; hawaii), corresponding to the open domain relation "was
   born in". this software is a java implementation of an open ie system
   as described in the paper:

   gabor angeli, melvin johnson premkumar, and christopher d. manning.
   leveraging linguistic structure for open domain information extraction.
   in proceedings of the association of computational linguistics (acl),
   2015. the system first splits each sentence into a set of entailed
   clauses. each clause is then maximally shortened, producing a set of
   entailed shorter sentence fragments. these fragments are then segmented
   into openie triples, and output by the system.

   more information can be found here :
   [91]http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html

usage

   first of all, make sure java 1.8 is installed. open a terminal and run
   this command to check:
java -version

   if this is not the case and if your os is ubuntu, you can install it
   this way:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

   the code can be invoked either programmatically or through the command
   line. the program can be invoked with the following command. it will
   display [['barack obama', ' was', ' born'], ['barack obama', ' was born
   in', ' hawaii']]
git clone https://github.com/philipperemy/stanford-openie-python.git
cd stanford-openie-python
echo "barack obama was born in hawaii." > samples.txt
python main.py -f samples.txt

   the output should be something like:
barack obama | was | born
barack obama | was born in | hawaii

large corpus

   sometimes you just want to run the information extraction tool on
   something larger than just a couple of sentences. i provide a bash
   script for that. this example runs the tool on the book: [92]the iliad
   by homer, composed of 1.2m characters and 26k lines.
./process_large_corpus.sh corpus/pg6130.txt corpus/pg6130.txt.out

wc -l corpus/pg6130.txt.out
> 23888

generate graph

echo "barack obama was born in hawaii." > samples.txt
python main.py -f samples.txt -g

   will generate a [93]graphviz dot graph and its related png file in
   /tmp/openie/

                                [94][out.png]

   note: make sure graphviz is installed beforehand. try to run the dot
   command to see if this is the case. if not, run sudo apt-get install
   graphviz if you're running on ubuntu.
