   colibri core is software to quickly and efficiently count and extract
   patterns from large corpus data, to extract various statistics on the
   extracted patterns, and to compute relations between the extracted
   patterns. the employed notion of pattern or construction encompasses
   the following categories:
     * id165 -- n consecutive words
     * skipgram -- an abstract pattern of predetermined length with one or
       multiple gaps (of specific size).
     * flexgram -- an abstract pattern with one or more gaps of
       variable-size.

   id165 extraction may seem fairly trivial at first, with a few lines in
   your favourite scripting language, you can move a simple sliding window
   of size n over your corpus and store the results in some kind of
   hashmap. this trivial approach however makes an unnecessarily high
   demand on memory resources, this often becomes prohibitive if unleashed
   on large corpora. colibri core tries to minimise these space
   requirements in several ways:
     * compressed binary representation -- each word type is assigned a
       numeric class, which is encoded in a compact binary format in which
       highly frequent classes take less space than less frequent classes.
       colibri core always uses this representation rather than a full
       string representation, both on disk and in memory.
     * informed iterative counting -- counting is performed more
       intelligently by iteratively processing the corpus in several
       passes and quickly discarding patterns that won't reach the desired
       occurrence threshold.

   skipgram and flexgram extraction are computationally more demanding but
   have been implemented with similar optimisations. skipgrams are
   computed by abstracting over id165s, and flexgrams in turn are
   computed either by abstracting over skipgrams, or directly from id165s
   on the basis of co-occurrence information (mutual pointwise
   information).

   at the heart of the sofware is the notion of pattern models. the core
   tool, to be used from the command-line, is colibri-patternmodeller
   which enables you to build pattern models, generate statistical
   reports, query for specific patterns and relations, and manipulate
   models.

   a pattern model is simply a collection of extracted patterns (any of
   the three categories) and their counts from a specific corpus. pattern
   models come in two varieties:
     * unindexed pattern model -- the simplest form, which simply stores
       the patterns and their count.
     * indexed pattern model -- the more informed form, which retains all
       indices to the original corpus, at the cost of more
       memory/diskspace.

   the indexed pattern model is much more powerful, and allows more
   statistics and relations to be inferred.

   the generation of pattern models is optionally parametrised by a
   minimum occurrence threshold, a maximum pattern length, and a
   lower-boundary on the different types that may instantiate a skipgram
   (i.e. possible fillings of the gaps).

technical details
