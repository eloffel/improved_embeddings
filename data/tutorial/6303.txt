paraphrase-id-tensorflow

   various models and code for paraphrase identification implemented in
   tensorflow (1.1.0).

   i took great care to document the code and explain what i'm doing at
   various steps throughout the models; hopefully it'll be didactic
   example code for those looking to get started with tensorflow!

   so far, this repo has implemented:
     * a basic siamese lstm baseline, loosely based on the model in
       [98]mueller, jonas and aditya thyagarajan. "siamese recurrent
       architectures for learning sentence similarity." aaai (2016).
     * a siamese lstm model with an added "matching layer", as described
       in [99]liu, yang et al. "learning natural language id136 using
       bidirectional lstm model and inner-attention." corr abs/1605.09090
       (2016).
     * the more-or-less state of the art bilateral multi-perspective
       matching model from [100]wang, zhiguo et al. "bilateral
       multi-perspective matching for natural language sentences." corr
       abs/1702.03814 (2017).

   pr's to add more models / optimize or patch existing ones are more than
   welcome! the bulk of the model code resides in
   [101]duplicate_questions/models

   a lot of the data processing code is taken from / inspired by
   [102]allenai/deep_qa, go check them out if you like how this project is
   structured!

installation

   this project was developed in and has been tested on python 3.5 (it
   likely doesn't work with other versions of python), and the package
   requirements are in [103]requirements.txt.

   to install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

   note that after installing the requirements, you have to download the
   necessary nltk data by running (in your shell):
python -m nltk.downloader punkt

gpu training and id136

   note that the [104]requirements.txt file specify tensorflow as a
   dependency, which is a cpu-bound version of tensorflow. if you have a
   gpu, you should uninstall this cpu tensorflow and install the gpu
   version by running:
pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu

getting / processing the data

   to begin, run the following to generate the auxiliary directories for
   storing data, trained models, and logs:
make aux_dirs

   in addition, if you want to use pretrained glove vectors, run:
make glove

   which will download pretrained glove vectors to data/external/. extract
   the files in that same directory.

quora question pairs

   to use the quora question pairs data, download the dataset from
   [105]kaggle (may require an account). place the downloaded zip archives
   in data/raw/, and extract the files to that same directory.

   then, run:
make quora_data

   to automatically clean and process the data with the scripts in
   scripts/data/quora.

running models

   to train a model or load + predict with a model, then run the scripts
   in scripts/run_model/ with python <script_path>. you can get additional
   documentation about the parameters they take by running python
   <script_path> -h

   here's an example run command for the baseline siamese bilstm:
python scripts/run_model/run_siamese.py train --share_encoder_weights --model_na
me=baseline_siamese --run_id=0

   here's an example run command for the siamese bilstm with matching
   layer:
python scripts/run_model/run_siamese_matching_bilstm.py train --share_encoder_we
ights --model_name=siamese_matching --run_id=0

   here's an example run command for the bimpm model:
python scripts/run_model/run_bimpm.py train --early_stopping_patience=5 --model_
name=bimpm --run_id=0

   note that the defaults might not be ideal for your use, so feel free to
   turn the knobs however you like.
