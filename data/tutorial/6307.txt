   ## accurately generate all possible forms of an english word

   word forms can accurately generate all possible forms of an english
   word. it can conjugate verbs. it can connect different parts of
   speeches e.g noun to adjective, adjective to adverb, noun to verb etc.
   it can pluralize singular nouns. it does this all in one function.
   enjoy!

examples

   some very timely examples :-p
>>> from word_forms.word_forms import get_word_forms
>>> get_word_forms("president")
>>> {'n': {'president', 'presidents', 'president', 'presidentship', 'presidencie
s', 'presidency', 'presidentships', 'presidents'},
     'r': {'presidentially'},
     'a': {'presidential'},
     'v': {'presiding', 'presides', 'preside', 'presided'}}
>>> get_word_forms("elect")
>>> {'n': {'elector', 'elects', 'electors', 'elective', 'electorates', 'elect',
'electives', 'elections', 'electorate', 'eligibility', 'election', 'eligibilitie
s'},
     'r': set(),
     'a': {'elect', 'electoral', 'elective', 'eligible'},
     'v': {'elect', 'elects', 'electing', 'elected'}}
>>> get_word_forms("politician")
>>> {'r': {'politically'},
     'a': {'political'},
     'n': {'politicss', 'politician', 'politicians', 'politics'},
     'v': set()}
>>> get_word_forms("trump")
>>> {'n': {'trump', 'trumps', 'trumping', 'trumpings'},
     'r': set(),
     'a': set(),
     'v': {'trumped', 'trump', 'trumps', 'trumping'}}

   as you can see, the output is a dictionary with four keys. "r" stands
   for adverb, "a" for adjective, "n" for noun and "v" for verb. don't ask
   me why "r" stands for adverb. this is what id138 uses, so this is why
   i use it too :-)

   help can be obtained at any time by typing the following:
>>> help(get_word_forms)

why?

   in natural language processing and search, one often needs to treat
   words like "run" and "ran", "love" and "lovable" or "politician" and
   "politics" as the same word. this is usually done by algorithmically
   reducing each word into a base word and then comparing the base words.
   the process is called id30. for example, the [84]porter stemmer
   reduces both "love" and "lovely" into the base word "love".

   stemmers have several shortcomings. firstly, the base word produced by
   the stemmer is not always a valid english word. for example, the porter
   stemmer reduces the word "operation" to "oper". secondly, the stemmers
   have a high false negative rate. for example, "run" is reduced to "run"
   and "ran" is reduced to "ran". this happens because the stemmers use a
   set of rational rules for finding the base words, and as we all know,
   the english language does not always behave very rationally.

   lemmatizers are more accurate than stemmers because they produce a base
   form that is present in the dictionary (also called the lemma). so the
   reduced word is always a valid english word. however, lemmatizers also
   have false negatives because they are not very good at connecting words
   across different parts of speeches. the [85]id138 lemmatizer included
   with nltk fails at almost all such examples. "operations" is reduced to
   "operation" and "operate" is reduced to "operate".

   word forms tries to solve this problem by finding all possible forms of
   a given english word. it can perform verb conjugations, connect noun
   forms to verb forms, adjective forms, adverb forms, plularize singular
   forms etc.

compatibility

   hi, i am dibya and i maintain this repository. i would love to hear
   from you. feel free to get in touch with me at

contributions

   word forms is not perfect. in particular, a couple of aspects can be
   improved.
    1. it sometimes generates non dictionary words like "politicss"
       because the pluralization/singularization algorithm is not perfect.
       at the moment, i am using [90]inflect for it.
    2. a function has_same_base_form for comparing two words can be added.
       at the moment, the information that "run" and "ran" are connected
       can only be figured out by querying get_word_forms("run") and not
       get_word_forms("ran"). this could be solved by creating a database
       of equivalence classes using this package (if word forms is an
       equivalence relation).

   if you like this package, feel free to contribute. your pull requests
   are most welcome.
