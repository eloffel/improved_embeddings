whatlanggo

   [97]build status [98]go report card [99]godoc [100]coverage status

   natural language detection for go.

features

     * supports [101]84 languages
     * 100% written in go
     * no external dependencies
     * fast
     * recognizes not only a language, but also a script (latin, cyrillic,
       etc)

getting started

   installation:
    go get -u github.com/abadojack/whatlanggo

   simple usage example:
package main

import (
        "fmt"

        "github.com/abadojack/whatlanggo"
)

func main() {
        info := whatlanggo.detect("foje funkcias kaj foje ne funkcias")
        fmt.println("language:", info.lang.string(), " script:", whatlanggo.scri
pts[info.script], " confidence: ", info.confidence)
}

blacklisting and whitelisting

package main

import (
        "fmt"

        "github.com/abadojack/whatlanggo"
)

func main() {
        //blacklist
        options := whatlanggo.options{
                blacklist: map[whatlanggo.lang]bool{
                        whatlanggo.ydd: true,
                },
        }

        info := whatlanggo.detectwithoptions("                                      ", options)

        fmt.println("language:", info.lang.string(), "script:", whatlanggo.scrip
ts[info.script])

        //whitelist
        options1 := whatlanggo.options{
                whitelist: map[whatlanggo.lang]bool{
                        whatlanggo.epo: true,
                        whatlanggo.ukr: true,
                },
        }

        info = whatlanggo.detectwithoptions("mi ne scias", options1)
        fmt.println("language:", info.lang.string(), " script:", whatlanggo.scri
pts[info.script])
}

   for more details, please check the [102]documentation.

requirements

   go 1.8 or higher

how does it work?

how does the language recognition work?

   the algorithm is based on the trigram language models, which is a
   particular case of id165s. to understand the idea, please check the
   original whitepaper [103]cavnar and trenkle '94: id165-based text
   categorization'.

how isreliable calculated?

   it is based on the following factors:
     * how many unique trigrams are in the given text
     * how big is the difference between the first and the second(not
       returned) detected languages? this metric is called rate in the
       code base.

   therefore, it can be presented as 2d space with threshold functions,
   that splits it into "reliable" and "not reliable" areas. this function
   is a hyperbola and it looks like the following one:
