about

   the classical language toolkit (cltk) offers natural language
   processing (nlp) support for the languages of ancient, classical, and
   medieval eurasia. greek, latin, akkadian, and the germanic languages
   are currently most complete. the goals of the cltk are to:
     * compile analysis-friendly corpora;
     * collect and generate linguistic data;
     * act as a free and open platform for generating scientific research.

documentation

   the docs are at [93]docs.cltk.org.

installation

   cltk supports python version 3.6. the software only runs on
   posix   compliant operating systems (linux, mac os x, freebsd, etc.).
$ pip install cltk

   see docs for [94]complete installation instructions.

   the [95]cltk organization curates corpora which can be downloaded
   directly or, better, [96]imported by the toolkit.

tutorials

   for interactive tutorials, in the form of jupyter notebooks, see
   [97]https://github.com/cltk/tutorials.

contributing

   see the [98]quickstart for contributors for an overview of the process.
   if you're looking to start with a small contribution, see the [99]issue
   tracker for "easy" jobs needing to be done. bigger projects may be
   found at [100]project ideas page. of course, new ideas are always
   welcome.

citation

   each major release of the cltk is given a [101]doi, a type of unique
   identity for digital documents. this doi ought to be included in your
   citation, as it will allow researchers to reproduce your results should
   the cltk's api or codebase change. to find the cltk's current doi,
   observe the blue doi button in the repository's home on github. to the
   end of your bibliographic entry, append doi plus the current
   identifier. you may also add version/release number, located in the
   pypi button at the project's github repository homepage.

   thus, please cite core software as something like:
kyle p. johnson et al.. (2014-2019). cltk: the classical language toolkit. doi 1
0.5281/zenodo.<current_release_id>

   a style-neutral bibtex entry would look like this:
@misc{johnson2014,
author = {kyle p. johnson et al.},
title = {cltk: the classical language toolkit},
howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/cltk/cltk}},
note = {{doi} 10.5281/zenodo.<current_release_id>},
year = {2014--2019},
}

   [102]many contributors have made substantial contributions to the cltk.
   for scholarship about particular code, it might be proper to cite these
   individuals as authors of the work under discussion.
