what is it?

   explaintome is a automatic text summarizer, that utilizes
   [106]textrank, a graph based algorithm to scans through the contents of
   a website to extract a concise machine generated summary. the
   methodology is similar to the way search engines return the most
   relevant web pages from a users search query.

support

   here   s a list of python platforms that are officially supported.
     * python 2.7
     * python 3.4
     * python 3.5
     * pypy 2.5.0 -> 2.7.9

     we are working on python 3.6

quickstart

install

clone repository

$ git clone https://github.com/jjangsangy/explaintome.git

create a virtualenv

$ virtualenv -p python venv

source virtualenv

$ source venv/bin/activate

install python dependencies

$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

run server

$ python manage.py runserver
running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (press ctrl+c to quit)

   now go to your browser and point it towards http://127.0.0.1:5000

docker

   running explaintome via the [107]official docker image is an easy way
   to start a server if you don't want to install python.

   we assume here you have already installed docker for your system.

   if you are getting started on os x, the [108]docker toolbox is the
   first thing to checkout.
$ docker run -it -p 5000:5000 jjangsangy/explaintome:latest

   once the server is running, navigate to either localhost:5000 (on
   linux) or hostname:5000 (on mac os x), where hostname is the ip
   addresses of your virtual machine, obtained using
$ docker-machine ip my-vm-name

   now access your docker machine ip at port docker-machine-ip:5000

kitematic

   you might also want to try [109]kitematic on os x which provides a gui
   for running docker images. running explaintome through kitematic is
   easy, just search for the jjangsangy/explaintome image, start it, and
   you should see it running

   [110]kitematic

things to look forward to:

     * summaries of documents in other languages than english!
