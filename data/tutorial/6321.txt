troll

language id31 and neural networks... for trolls.

   [76]build status

   troll is a tool for performing id31 (ie: "is this naughty
   or nice") on arbitrary blocks of text and associating it with a unique
   user. using this data, combined with a rather na  ve neural network and
   some training data, users can be indentified as "trolls".

installation

   troll uses [77]redis for data storage. once redis is up and running,
   you can install troll using npm:
npm install troll

string analysis

var troll   = require('troll');

troll.analyze('this is totally awesome!', 'user123', function (err, result) {
    console.log(result);    // 2.5
});

troll.analyze('this is lame.', 'user456', function (err, result) {
    console.log(result);    // -1.333
});

training

   before attempting to classify a user, you'll need to train troll. you
   can specify your own training data or use a basic set that is included.
   to load the included training set:
troll.train(function (err, result) {
    console.dir(result);    // { error: 0.0049931996067587685, iterations: 802 }
});

user classification

   once trained, now you can classify:
troll.classify('user123', function (err, result) {
    console.dir(result);    // { total: 9, sum: 36, troll: 0.010294962292857838
}
});

   the value returned for the troll key represents the id203 of that
   user being a troll. in other words, a value of 0 would likely represent
   a particularly friendly user, while a value of 1 would be... uh, ted
   dziuba?
     __________________________________________________________________

modifing the sentiment engine

   the underlying [78]id31 module supports "injecting"
   additional key/value pairs. this is useful in certain situations where
   you may want to exclude or even blacklist certain words based on a
   particular use case. for example:
troll.inject({
    'stupid': -5,
    'lame': -5
});

troll.analyze('this is totally stupid and lame!', 'user123', function (err, resu
lt) {
    console.log(result);    // -5.833
});

redis connection options

   troll uses your environment by looking at process.env for connection
   settings. if none are found, default [79]redis connection settings are
   used:
troll_host: null
troll_port: null
troll_pass: null
