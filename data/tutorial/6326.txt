textacy: nlp, before and after spacy

   textacy is a python library for performing a variety of natural
   language processing (nlp) tasks, built on the high-performance spacy
   library. with the fundamentals --- id121, part-of-speech
   tagging, id33, etc. --- delegated to another library,
   textacy focuses on the tasks that come before and follow after.

features

     * provide a convenient entry point and interface to one or many
       documents, with the core processing delegated to spacy
     * stream text, json, csv, spacy binary, and other data to and from
       disk
     * download and explore a variety of included datasets with both text
       content and metadata, from congressional speeches to historical
       literature to reddit comments
     * clean and normalize raw text, before analyzing it
     * access and filter basic linguistic elements, such as words, ngrams,
       and noun chunks; extract named entities, acronyms and their
       definitions, and key terms
     * flexibly tokenize and vectorize documents and corpora, then train,
       interpret, and visualize topic models using lsa, lda, or nmf
       methods
     * compare strings, sets, and documents by a variety of similarity
       metrics
     * calculate common text statistics, including flesch-kincaid grade
       level, smog index, and multilingual flesch reading ease

   ... and more!

     * pypi project: [100]https://pypi.org/project/textacy

     * documentation: [102]https://chartbeat-labs.github.io/textacy

   note: docs used to be hosted on readthedocs, but the builds stopped
   working many months ago, and now those docs are out-of-date. this is
   unfortunate, especially since readthedocs allows for multiple versions
   while github pages does not. i'll keep trying on readthedocs; if the
   build issues ever get resolved, i'll switch the docs back.
