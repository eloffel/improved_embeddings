heterogeneous supervision for id36: a representation learning
approach

   source code and data for [77]heterogeneous supervision for relation
   extraction: a representation learning approach

                             [78][framework.png]
     __________________________________________________________________

   rehession conducts id36 with heterogeneous supervision,
   e.g., the labeling functions at left corner.

   rehession conducts id36, featuring:
     * employ heterogeneous supervision, e.g., knowledge base and
       heuristic patterns, to train the model (as picked in left corner)
     * infers true label from noisy labels in a context-aware manner
     * true label discovery and id36 can mutually enhance
       each other

quick start

   a demo is provided and can be execurated by:
bash demo_kbp.sh

pipeline overview

   and the pipeline of rehession is:
     * recognize entities for labeling functions
     * apply labeling functions to get heterogeneous supervision
     * generate pos-tagging and brown id91
     * encoding training / testing corpus
     * training and evaluation

data

   we include corpus, labeling functions and knowledge base in the data
   folder.

corpus

   we stored kbp[1] corpus under the path data/source/kbp/corpus.txt.zip,
   and nyt[2] corpus under the folder data/source/nyt/corpus.txt.zip.
   pos-tagging and entity detection has been conducted by stanford ner
   tools.

patterns

   we stored the pattern-based labeling functions in the folder of the
   corpus, named nlf.json. these files stored one pattern-based labeling
   function at one line in the json format.

knowledge base

   we stored the annotations generated by kb-based labeling functions in
   the folder of the corpus, named train.json. it's also used as the
   training file adopted by [95]cotype

labeling functions

   we adopted three kinds of labeling functions in rehession: kb-based,
   pattern-based and inversed. and the annotations generated by those
   labeling functions are save in the path data/intermediate/.

kb based

   kb based labeling functions are adopted to encode information of kb.
   accordingly, we adopted the training file generated by distant
   supervision, by treating annotations of the same relation type are
   generated by the same labeling function (in the form of if r(e1, e2) in
   kb: return r).

pattern based

   pattern-based labeling functions would annotate entity pairs with
   matched entity type and texture pattern with preset relation types. and
   each pattern-based labeling functions (as stored in nlf.json) has the
   following fields:
     * reserved: whether entity 1 is before entity 2
     * pid: pattern id
     * rule: the rule of matching multiple entities
     * texture: texture pattern
     * relationtype: the detected type of this labeling function
     * type1: the type of entity 1
     * type2: the type of entity 2

   the rule field has value in the format of [a,b], while a and b can be
   any number or n. it indicates how many entities would the labeling
   function try to match (n indicates matching all entities). for example,
   {"reserved": "1", "pid": 0, "rule": ["1", "1"], "texture": "founder
   of", "relationtype": "/business/company/founders", "type1":
   "organization", "type2": "person"} requires the entity before texture
   pattern (indicated by reserved) to be person (indicated by type2), and
   entity after texture pattern to be organization (indicated by type1).
   also this labeling function would only annotate the entity pair most
   close to the texture pattern (indicated by ["1", "1"])

inverse

   in order to annotate none type, we designed another type of labeling
   function, i.e., if a set of labeling functions not annotate a instance,
   it would annotate it as none.

   specifically, for kbp dataset, we adopted a reverse labeling function
   who reserved all pattern-based labeling functions; for nyt dataset, a
   reverse labeling function reserving all kb-based labeling functions is
   adopted.

kbp dataset

   we now proceed to use kbp dataset as an example (also save as
   labelgeneration.sh) to demonstrate the pipeline of generating
   heterogeneous supervision.
python labelgeneration/uidextractkb.py
python labelgeneration/post_process_chunked_corpus.py
python labelgeneration/applying_labelling_func.py --save_all
python labelgeneration/applying_kb.py
python labelgeneration/recodefuncs.py
python labelgeneration/mergelfs.py
python labelgeneration/cal_mention_distance.py
python labelgeneration/applyinginverse.py

   these commands requires original data to be stored in data/source/kbp/,
   while the specific requirements are stored in the default setting.

feature extraction

   we provided the training files used in our experiments, which is saved
   in the path data/intermediate/. also we wrote a demo scripts for the
   whole feature extraction, model learning and evaluation pipeline. you
   can simply execute it by
bash demo_kbp.sh

   with dataset with annotation and brown id91 file stored in the
   path data/intermediate/kbp/, the feature extraction can be performed by
python dataprocessor/relation_feature_generation.py

model learning and evaluation

encoding

   the model is designed to run on encoded training / evaluation / testing
   corpus. each line in the encoded file is an instance, which is in the
   format of
insid   featurenum      annotationnum   featurelist     annotationlist

   insid, featurenum and annotationnum are integers; featurelist is in the
   format of featureid,featureid; annotationlist is in the format of lfid
   typeid. for example, an instance in kbp dataset is like:
10      78      2       457984,153472,646018,120323,1119382,739279,152889,199945
