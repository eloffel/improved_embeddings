how to root out hidden biases in ai

algorithms are making life-changing decisions like denying parole or granting
loans. cynthia dwork, a computer scientist at harvard, is developing ways of
making sure the machines are operating fairly.

   why is it hard for algorithm designers or data scientists to account
   for bias and unfairness?

   take a work environment that   s hostile to women. suppose that you
   define success as the fact that someone holds a job for two to three
   years and gets a promotion. then your predictor   based on the historical
   data   will accurately predict that it   s not a good idea to hire women.
   what   s interesting here is that we   re not talking about historical
   hiring decisions. even if the hiring decisions were totally unbiased,
   the reality   the real discrimination in the hostile
   environment   persists. it   s deeper, more structural, more ingrained and
   harder to overcome.

   i believe the great use for machine learning and ai will be in
   conjunction with really knowledgeable people who know history and
   sociology and psychology to figure out who should be treated similarly
   to whom.

   i   m not saying computers will never be able to do it, but i don   t see
   it now. how do you know when you have the right model, and when it   s
   capturing what really happened in society? you need to have an
   understanding of what you   re talking about. there   s the famous saying
      all models are wrong and some are useful.
