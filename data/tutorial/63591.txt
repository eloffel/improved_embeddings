aqua-rat (algebra id53 with rationales) dataset

   this dataset contains the algebraic word problems with rationales
   described in our paper:

   [75]wang ling, dani yogatama, chris dyer, and phil blunsom. (2017)
   program induction by rationale generation: learning to solve and
   explain algebraic word problems. in proc. acl.

   the dataset consists of about 100,000 algebraic word problems with
   natural language rationales. each problem is a json object consisting
   of four parts:
     * question - a natural language definition of the problem to solve
     * options - 5 possible options (a, b, c, d and e), among which one is
       correct
     * rationale - a natural language description of the solution to the
       problem
     * correct - the correct option

   here is an example of a problem object:
{
"question": "a grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. if it
 sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?",
"options": ["a)125", "b)150", "c)225", "d)250", "e)275"],
"rationale": "profit per bag = 1.25 * 0.20 = 0.25\ntotal profit = 500 * 0.25 = 1
25\nanswer is a.",
"correct": "a"
}

note

   this dataset has been fully crowdsourced, as described using the
   technique in the paper (ling et al., 2017). the initial published
   results included in the paper were derived from a previous version of
   this dataset that cannot be released in full, and results using the
   published system will differ. results using our published system will
   be forthcoming.
