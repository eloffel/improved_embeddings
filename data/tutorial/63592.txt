a library for probabilistic modeling, id136, and criticism.

   edward is a python library for probabilistic modeling, id136, and
   criticism. it is a testbed for fast experimentation and research with
   probabilistic models, ranging from classical id187 on
   small data sets to complex deep probabilistic models on large data
   sets. edward fuses three fields: bayesian statistics and machine
   learning, deep learning, and probabilistic programming.

   it supports modeling with
     * directed id114
     * neural networks (via libraries such as [8]tf.layers and [9]keras)
     * implicit generative models
     * bayesian nonparametrics and probabilistic programs

   it supports id136 with
     * variational id136
          + black box variational id136
          + stochastic variational id136
          + id3
          + maximum a posteriori estimation
     * monte carlo
          + id150
          + hamiltonian monte carlo
          + stochastic gradient langevin dynamics
     * compositions of id136
          + expectation-maximization
          + pseudo-marginal and abc methods
          + message passing algorithms

   it supports criticism of the model and id136 with
     * point-based evaluations
     * posterior predictive checks

   edward is built on [10]tensorflow. it enables features such as
   computational graphs, distributed training, cpu/gpu integration,
   automatic differentiation, and visualization with tensorboard.
