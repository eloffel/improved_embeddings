in the name of allah

   the following package consists of a rule-based verb inflector in
   persian developed by [75]mohammad sadegh rasooli. the code was mainly
   used for preprocessing the [76]persian dependency treebank.

note!

how to use the code

   the code is compatible with c# 3.5 or upper versions.

   there are two options for getting a verb analyzed sentence:
    1. without part of speech tags (without disambiguation, considering
       all the words as potential verbs). in sentenceanalyzer.cs:
 public static verbbasedsentence makeverbbasedsentence(string sentence)

       or
 public static verbbasedsentence makeverbbasedsentence(string[] sentence)

    2. with part of speech and morphosyntactic tags (with a good
       accuracy): the pos tags are the same as [79]bijankhan corpus:
 public static verbbasedsentence makeverbbasedsentence(string[] sentence, string
[] possentence, string[] lemmas, morphosyntacticfeatures[] morphosyntacticfeatur
eses)

sample code

   in the program.cs file there is a test output of a persian sentence
   that can be used as a starting point.
var analyzer = new sentenceanalyzer("../../../data/verblist.txt");
var sentence = "                                                                                                                   
                                                    .";
var result = sentenceanalyzer.makeverbbasedsentence(sentence);
var output = new stringbuilder();
foreach (var dependencybasedtoken in result.sentencetokens)
{
    output.appendline(dependencybasedtoken.wordform + "\t" + dependencybasedtoke
n.lemma + "\t" +
                      dependencybasedtoken.cpostag
                      + "\t" + (dependencybasedtoken.headnumber+1).tostring() +
"\t" +
                      dependencybasedtoken.dependencyrelation);
}
file.writealltext("../../../testoutput.txt",output.tostring());

   output in testoutput.txt:
          _       _       0       _
                    #              v       5       prog

some points

   i assumed the character set is being refined when you pass array
   argument to the methods. as shown in the follwoing code, i used
   [80]virastyar library for refining characters and tokenizing strings.
public static verbbasedsentence makeverbbasedsentence(string sentence)
{
    sentence = stringutil.refineandfilterpersianword(sentence); // using the ref
iner of virastyar software
    var tokenized = persianwordtokenizer.tokenize(sentence,true); // using the t
okenizer of virastyar software
    return makeverbbasedsentence(tokenized.toarray());
}

   you can go to virastyar official site in order to know more about its
   options [81]http://virastyar.ir.

   if you do not want to use it for your purposes you can clean the
   mentioned lines from the code

   you can find a morphological-based pos tagger that can be used in your
   code. you can also use the tagger to help improve learner pos taggers
   such as id48 tagger.

   i assumed that the writers use semi-space for verb inflections. in
   bijankhan corpus, you can replace space with semi-space in words with
   verb tag.
