   sacreid7 ([76]post, 2018) provides hassle-free computation of
   shareable, comparable, and reproducible id7 scores. inspired by rico
   sennrich's multi-id7-detok.perl, it produces the official wmt scores
   but works with plain text. it also knows all the standard test sets and
   handles downloading, processing, and id121 for you.

   why use this version of id7?
     * it automatically downloads common wmt test sets and processes them
       to plain text
     * it produces a short version string that facilitates cross-paper
       comparisons
     * it properly computes scores on detokenized outputs, using wmt
       ([77]conference on machine translation) standard id121
     * it produces the same values as official script (mteval-v13a.pl)
       used by wmt
     * it outputs the id7 score without the comma, so you don't have to
       remove it with sed (looking at you, multi-id7.perl)

quick start

   install the python module (python 3 only)
pip3 install sacreid7

   this installs a shell script, sacreid7. (you can also directly run the
   shell script sacreid7.py in the source repository).

   get a list of available test sets:
sacreid7

   download the source for one of the pre-defined test sets:
sacreid7 -t wmt14 -l de-en --echo src > wmt14-de-en.src

   (you can also use long parameter names for readability):
sacreid7 --test-set wmt14 --language-pair de-en --echo src > wmt14-de-en.src

   after tokenizing, translating, and detokenizing it, you can score your
   decoder output easily:
cat output.detok.txt | sacreid7 -t wmt14 -l de-en

   sacreid7 knows about common wmt test sets, but you can also use it to
   score system outputs with arbitrary references. it also works in
   backwards compatible model where you manually specify the reference(s),
   similar to the format of multi-id7.txt:
cat output.detok.txt | sacreid7 ref1 [ref2 ...]

   note that the system output and references will all be tokenized
   internally.

   sacreid7 generates version strings like the following. put them in a
   footnote in your paper! use --short for a shorter hash if you like.
id7+case.mixed+lang.de-en+test.wmt17 = 32.97 66.1/40.2/26.6/18.1 (bp = 0.980 ra
tio = 0.980 hyp_len = 63134 ref_len = 64399)

motivation

   comparing id7 scores is harder than it should be. every decoder has
   its own implementation, often borrowed from moses, but maybe with
   subtle changes. moses itself has a number of implementations as
   standalone scripts, with little indication of how they differ (note:
   they mostly don't, but multi-id7.pl expects tokenized input).
   different flags passed to each of these scripts can produce wide swings
   in the final score. all of these may handle id121 in different
   ways. on top of this, downloading and managing test sets is a moderate
   annoyance. sacre id7! what a mess.

   sacreid7 aims to solve these problems by wrapping the original
   papineni reference implementation together with other useful features.
   the defaults are set the way that id7 should be computed, and
   furthermore, the script outputs a short version string that allows
   others to know exactly what you did. as an added bonus, it
   automatically downloads and manages test sets for you, so that you can
   simply tell it to score against 'wmt14', without having to hunt down a
   path on your local file system. it is all designed to take id7 a
   little more seriously. after all, even with all its problems, id7 is
   the default and---admit it---well-loved metric of our entire research
   community. sacre id7.
