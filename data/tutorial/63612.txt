why look at case studies?

   this course andrew will show you some case study of convolutional
   neural networks. often we saw that a neural network architecture that
   works well one vision task may also work well in other id161
   task. after this week you will fell comfortable to read some of the
   research paper of id161 and see yourself able to understand
   them. he will talk about 5 neural net architecture:
     * lenet-5
     * alexnet
     * vgg
     * resnet
     * inception

classic networks

   lenet-5 start with an image of 32 x 32 x 1 and goal was to recognize
   handwritten digit. in the first step we use six 5 x 5 filter with
   stride 1 and get 28 x 28 x 6. with stride of 1 and no padding we reduce
   the dimension to 32 x 32 to 28 x 28. then we use a average pooling with
   a filter width of 2 and stride of 2 and reduce the dimension by factor
   of 2 and end up with 14 x 14 x 6. then we use another convolutional
   layer with sixteen 5 x 5 filter and end up with 10 x 10 x 16. that time
   people use valid padding that   s why each time height and weight
   shrinks. then another pooling layer and end up with 5 x 5 x 16. then
   the next layer is a fully connected layer with 120 nodes. the previous
   layers 400 (5*5*16) then connected with this 120 neurons. then another
   layer this 120 nodes connected with a 84 node and use this to connected
   with yhat with possible 10 values that will recognize digit from 0 to
   9. but in modern version of this neural net we use softmax function
   with a ten wave classification output.

   this lenet-5 has only 60k parameters. but today we use anywhere form
   100m to 100m parameters.

   from this network we see that, as we go deeper (left to right) the
   height and width tend to go down and number of channel increased.

   conv     poo     conv     pool     fully connected     fully connected     output
   this types of layer quite common now-a-days.

   alexnet inputs start with 227 x 227 x 3 images. then the first layers
   it apply 96 11 by 11 filter with stride of 4. because it   s use a stride
   of 4 the dimension reduce to 55 by 55. then apply a max polling with 3
   by 3 filter and stride of 2 and the volume reduce to 27 by 27 by 96.
   then it apply 5 by same padding convulation and up with 27 by 27 by
   276. then again a max pooling with 3 by 3 filter and stride of 2 and
   end up with 13 x 13 x 256. then another 3 x 3 same padding convulation
   and and up with 13 x 13 x 384. then 3 by 3 same convulation again and
   end up with 13 x 13 x 384. then same convulation , a max pool and end
   up with 6 x 6 x 256, which is 9216 parameter. then we gonna connect it
   with a 4096 fully connected node. then another fully connected layer
   and use a softmax function in 1000 classes output.

   the alexnet has 60m parameter compare to lenet   s 60k parameters. and it
   use relu activation function.

   vgg -16 : the remarkable thing about vgg-16 net is that they said,
      instead having so many hyper parameters, let   s use a much simpler
   network where you focus on just having conv layers that are just 3 by 3
   filters with stride 1 and always use the same padding, and make all
   your max polling layers 2 by 2 with a strid of 2   .

   one vary cool thing about vgg is that it   s really simplified these
   neural network architectures.

   vgg 16 model

   it is a really deep network. but you can easily understated the
   architect from the picture bellow. this network has a total of about
   138 million parameters.
