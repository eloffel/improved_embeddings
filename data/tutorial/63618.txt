solving multi-label classification problems (case studies included)

   [97]shubham jain, august 26, 2017

introduction

   for some reason, regression and classification problems end up taking
   most of the attention in machine learning world. people don   t realize
   the wide variety of machine learning problems which can exist.

   i, on the other hand, love exploring different variety of problems and
   sharing my learning with the community here.

   previously, i [98]shared my learnings on id107 with the
   community. continuing on with my search, i intend to cover a topic
   which has much less widespread but a nagging problem in the data
   science community     which is multi-label classification.

   in this article, i will give you an intuitive explanation of what
   multi-label classification entails, along with illustration of how to
   solve the problem. i hope it will show you the horizon of what data
   science encompasses. so lets get on with it!


table of contents

    1. what is multi-label classification?
    2. multi-class v/s multi-label
    3. loading and generating multi-label datasets
    4. techniques for solving a multi-label classification problem
         1. problem transformation method
         2. adapted algorithm method
         3. ensemble approaches
    5. case studies


1. what is multi-label classification?

   let us take a look at the image below.


   what if i ask you that does this image contains a house? the option
   will be yes or no.

   consider another case, like what all things (or labels) are relevant to
   this picture?

   these types of problems, where we have a set of target variables, are
   known as multi-label classification problems. so, is there any
   difference between these two cases? clearly, yes because in the second
   case any image may contain a different set of these multiple labels for
   different images.

   but before going deep into multi-label, i just wanted to clear one
   thing as many of you might be confused that how this is different from
   the multi-class problem.

   so, let   s us try to understand the difference between these two sets of
   problems.


2. multi-label v/s multi-class

   consider an example to understand the difference between these two. for
   this, i hope that below image makes things quite clear. let   s try to
   understand it.

   for any movie, central board of film certification, issue a certificate
   depending on the contents of the movie.

   for example, if you look above, this movie has been rated as    u/a   
   (meaning    parental guidance for children below the age of 12 years   )
   certificate. there are other types of certificates classes like    a   
   (restricted to adults) or    u    (unrestricted public exhibition), but it
   is sure that each movie can only be categorized with only one out of
   those three type of certificates.

   in short, there are multiple categories but each instance is assigned
   only one, therefore such problems are known as multi-class
   classification problem.

   again, if you look back at the image, this movie has been categorized
   into comedy and romance genre. but there is a difference that this time
   each movie could fall into one or more different sets of categories.

   therefore, each instance can be assigned with multiple categories, so
   these types of problems are known as multi-label classification
   problem, where we have a set of target labels.

   great! now you can distinguish between a multi-label and multi-class
   problem. so, let   s start how to deal with these types of problems.


3. loading and generating multi-label datasets

   scikit-learn has provided a separate library [99]scikit-multilearn for
   multi label classification.

   for better understanding, let us start practicing on a multi-label
   dataset. you can find a real-world data set from the [100]repository
   provided by mulan package. these datasets are present in arff format.

   so, for getting started with any of these datasets, look at the python
   code below for loading it onto your jupyter notebook. here i have
   downloaded the yeast data set from the repository.
import scipy
from scipy.io import arff
data, meta = scipy.io.arff.loadarff('/users/shubhamjain/documents/yeast/yeast-tr
ain.arff')
df = pd.dataframe(data)

   there is how the data set looks like.

   here, att represents the attributes or the independent variables and
   class represents the target variables.

   for practice purpose, we have another option to generate an artificial
   multi-label dataset.
from sklearn.datasets import make_multilabel_classification

# this will generate a random multi-label dataset
x, y = make_multilabel_classification(sparse = true, n_labels = 20,
return_indicator = 'sparse', allow_unlabeled = false)


   let us understand the parameters used above.

   sparse: if true, returns a sparse matrix, where sparse matrix means a
   matrix having a large number of zero elements.

   n_labels:  the average number of labels for each instance.

   return_indicator: if    sparse    return y in the sparse binary indicator
   format.

   allow_unlabeled: if true, some instances might not belong to any class.

   you must have noticed that we have used sparse matrix everywhere, and
   scikit-multilearn also recommends to use data in the sparse form
   because it is very rare for a real-world data set to be dense.
   generally, the number of labels assigned to each instance is very less.

   okay, now we have our datasets ready so let us quickly learn the
   techniques to solve a multi-label problem.


4. techniques for solving a multi-label classification problem

   basically, there are three methods to solve a multi-label
   classification problem, namely:
    1. problem transformation
    2. adapted algorithm
    3. ensemble approaches


4.1 problem transformation

   in this method, we will try to transform our multi-label problem into
   single-label problem(s).

   this method can be carried out in three different ways as:
    1. binary relevance
    2. classifier chains
    3. label powerset

4.1.1 binary relevance

   this is the simplest technique, which basically treats each label as a
   separate single class classification problem.

   for example, let us consider a case as shown below. we have the data
   set like this, where x is the independent feature and y   s are the
   target variable.

   in binary relevance, this problem is broken into 4 different single
   class classification problems as shown in the figure below.

   we don   t have to do this manually, the multi-learn library provides its
   implementation in python. so, let   s us quickly look at its
   implementation on the randomly generated data.
# using binary relevance
from skmultilearn.problem_transform import binaryrelevance
from sklearn.naive_bayes import gaussiannb

# initialize binary relevance multi-label classifier
# with a gaussian naive bayes base classifier
classifier = binaryrelevance(gaussiannb())

# train
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)

# predict
predictions = classifier.predict(x_test)

   note: here, we have used naive bayes algorithm but you can use any
   other classification algorithm.

   now, in a multi-label classification problem, we can   t simply use our
   normal metrics to calculate the accuracy of our predictions. for that
   purpose, we will use accuracy score metric. this function calculates
   subset accuracy meaning the predicted set of labels should exactly
   match with the true set of labels.

   so, let us calculate the accuracy of the predictions.
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy_score(y_test,predictions)

0.45454545454545453

   so, we have attained an accuracy score of 45%, which is not too bad.
   let   s us quickly look at its pros and cons.

   it is most simple and efficient method but the only drawback of this
   method is that it doesn   t consider labels correlation because it treats
   every target variable independently.

4.1.2 classifier chains

   in this, the first classifier is trained just on the input data and
   then each next classifier is trained on the input space and all the
   previous classifiers in the chain.

   let   s try to this understand this by an example. in the dataset given
   below, we have x as the input space and y   s as the labels.

   in classifier chains, this problem would be transformed into 4
   different single label problems, just like shown below. here yellow
   colored is the input space and the white part represent the target
   variable.

   this is quite similar to binary relevance, the only difference being it
   forms chains in order to preserve label correlation. so, let   s try to
   implement this using multi-learn library.
# using classifier chains
from skmultilearn.problem_transform import classifierchain
from sklearn.naive_bayes import gaussiannb

# initialize classifier chains multi-label classifier
# with a gaussian naive bayes base classifier
classifier = classifierchain(gaussiannb())

# train
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)

# predict
predictions = classifier.predict(x_test)

accuracy_score(y_test,predictions)
0.21212121212121213

   we can see that using this we obtained an accuracy of about 21%, which
   is very less than binary relevance. this is maybe due to the absence of
   label correlation since we have randomly generated the data.

4.1.3 label powerset

   in this, we transform the problem into a multi-class problem with one
   multi-class classifier is trained on all unique label combinations
   found in the training data.

   let   s understand it by an example.

   in this, we find that x1 and x4 have the same labels, similarly, x3 and
   x6 have the same set of labels. so, label powerset transforms this
   problem into a single multi-class problem as shown below.

   so, label powerset has given a unique class to every possible label
   combination that is present in the training set.

   let   s us look at its implementation in python.
# using label powerset
from skmultilearn.problem_transform import labelpowerset
from sklearn.naive_bayes import gaussiannb

# initialize label powerset multi-label classifier
# with a gaussian naive bayes base classifier
classifier = labelpowerset(gaussiannb())

# train
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)

# predict
predictions = classifier.predict(x_test)

accuracy_score(y_test,predictions)
0.5757575757575758

   this gives us the highest accuracy among all the three we have
   discussed till now. the only disadvantage of this is that as the
   training data increases, number of classes become more. thus,
   increasing the model complexity, and would result in a lower accuracy.

   now, let us look at the second method to solve multi-label
   classification problem.


4.2 adapted algorithm

   adapted algorithm, as the name suggests, adapting the algorithm to
   directly perform multi-label classification, rather than transforming
   the problem into different subsets of problems.

   for example, multi-label version of knn is represented by mlknn. so,
   let us quickly implement this on our randomly generated data set.
from skmultilearn.adapt import mlknn

classifier = mlknn(k=20)

# train
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)

# predict
predictions = classifier.predict(x_test)

accuracy_score(y_test,predictions)
0.69


   great! you have achieved an accuracy score of 69% on your test data.

   sci-kit learn provides inbuilt support of multi-label classification in
   some of the algorithm like id79 and ridge regression. so, you
   can directly call them and predict the output.

   you can check the [101]multi-learn library if you wish to learn more
   about other types of adapted algorithm.


4.3 ensemble approaches

   ensemble always produces better results. scikit-multilearn library
   provides different ensembling classification functions, which you can
   use for obtaining better results.

   for the direct implementation, you can check out [102]here.


5. case studies

   multi-label classification problems are very common in the real world.
   so, let us look at some of the areas where we can find the use of them.

1. audio categorization

   we have already seen songs being classified into different genres. they
   are also been classified on the basis of emotions or moods like
      relaxing-calm   , or    sad-lonely    etc.

   source: [103]link

2. image categorization

   multi-label classification using image has also a wide range of
   applications. images can be labeled to indicate different objects,
   people or concepts.

3. bioinformatics

   multi-label classification has a lot of use in the field of
   bioinformatics, for example, classification of genes in the yeast data
   set.

   it is also used to predict multiple functions of proteins using several
   unlabeled proteins. you can check this [104]paper for more information.


4. text categorization

   you all must once check out google news. so, what google news does is,
   it labels every news to one or more categories such that it is
   displayed under different categories. for example, take a look at the
   image below.


   image source: [105]google news

   that same news is present under the categories of india, technology,
   latest etc. because it has been classified into these different labels.
   thus making it a multi label classification problem.

   there are plenty of other areas, so explore and comment down below if
   you wish to share it with the community.


6. end notes

       hi, shubham great article.
       in the label power set method. once the problem is transformed to
       single multi class problem you have drawn a table with x and y1
       column. i didn   t get how you got the values in y1 column. can you
       explain?
       moreover, being a ceramic engineer you have great knowledge in ml.
       great!!

            in label power set, every unique combination of labels has
            been a separate category. thus, transforming it into a
            multi-class problem. for example, in the above problem:
            x1 and x4 have the same set of labels, so they are given same
            class. further x3 and x6 also have the same set, so they are
            also given same class. rest all the other are unique, so they
            are given different classes.
            hope this clears your doubt.
            cheers

       thank you, shubham, for making this concept so easy for us to
       understand.
       i just have a suggestion: could you please include your code
       sufficiently so that we could quickly copy/paste it and see the
       result ? for example, your are using    x_train    and    y_train   , but
       haven   t defined them. or, some    import   s are missing.
       it also took me a while to install skmultilearn. it would have been
       useful if you would had given a quick hint.
       many thanks once more.

            yes, thank you for bringing in the notice.    x_train    and
               y_train    are formed by using the train_test_split method on
            the randomly generated data.
            for the installation part, you can simply do    pip install
            scikit-multilearn    on the terminal.
            can you tell me any other thing that i have missed out and i
            will definitely take care of this next time.

       associated attributes stored in a mysql table into the form as the
       yeast datasets (atr1 ,atr2     arn     class1, class2     class n) ?

       hi shubham jain,
       awesome tutorial. i   m working on a multi-label classification model
       and i   m using label power set. i have used your code but when i
       call    fit()    method i get following error.
       [[[typeerror: no supported conversion for types: (dtype(   o   ),)]]]]
       i haven   t used any column with dtype (string/object). all the
       columns are either category,int,float. can you help me with this?
       my total target labels are y (1,2,3,4,5,6). total 6 unique columns
