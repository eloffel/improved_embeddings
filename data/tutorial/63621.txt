   [hand.jpg] behold the beast! the magnificent 2d matrix! [hand2.jpg]

   i used to believe mathematics was discovered, not invented. mathematics
   was the elegant language the universe was written in! yeeeeeah. that
   changed when i first learnt about matrices, coz sure, they're useful,
   but oh my god are they ugly like a carnival freakshow. who would wanna
   write a universe in this crap?!

   several years later, i was coding a videogame, when i bumped into
   matrices again. these matrices were transformation matrices, which
   affected the size, position, and rotation of my game's images. now,
   when i changed a matrix, i could actually see what the matrix did. i
   could actually see what a matrix was! it was intuitive. kind of
   charming. a majestic creature, finally freed from its n x m rectangular
   cage.

   so, i made this little matrix toy. hopefully this helps someone else
   figure out matrices, or maybe everyone else except me already found
   matrices intuitive. at the very least, i made this as a tribute to you,
   2d matrix...

   ...you beautiful, beautiful bastard.
   [hand.jpg] this was an explorable explanation! golly! [hand2.jpg]

   a bunch of peeps, including me, are making things that help others
   learn by doing. we call 'em explorable explanations. we're a loose &
   informal "movement", and if you'd like to play with more interactive
   edu-things, check out [1]explorableexplanations.com!

   this was a side project, just to get something out while i'm working on
   my bigger project, i'd like to be a machine. coming soon-ish. it's an
   explorable explanation on neurons & anxiety - hopefully it helps people
   on a deeper level. it also features a baby dinosaur. if you'd like to
   keep up with my work, [2]here's my twitter. and if you'd like to
   support me making free/open-source ed-stuff, you're awesome, and
   [3]here's my patreon!

   oh! right, almost forgot to say, this thing is open source. [4]public
   domain, specifically. in fact, all my work is public domain, so
   teachers can use it freely in their classrooms, and others can dissect
   and build upon this. you can fork this project's repo [5]on github.

   welp, that's all i got for today. thanks for reading!
