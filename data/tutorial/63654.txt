burlap_examples

   example code for burlap ([71]http://burlap.cs.brown.edu)

   this repository contains example code for using burlap as well as the
   code for the written tutorials on the website. versions will track the
   burlap release version for which it is associated (see the pom.xml
   burlap dependency to verify) and we will maintain a branch for each
   version. the master branch will point to latest release version on
   maven central, so the master branch code should work as is without
   having to manually install burlap, but we may also create other
   branches for later version still in development if you have manually
   installed a snapshot of burlap.

   for more information on using burlap, see our website at
   [72]http://burlap.cs.brown.edu. for the burlap repository, go to
   [73]https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap.
