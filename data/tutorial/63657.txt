[68]markov decision process

markov decision process

introduction
     __________________________________________________________________

   markov decision process(mdp) is a framework used to help to make
   decisions on a stochastic environment. our goal is to find a policy,
   which is a map that gives us all optimal actions on each state on our
   environment.

   mdp is somehow more powerful than simple planning, because your policy
   will allow you to do optimal actions even if something went wrong along
   the way. simple planning just follow the plan after you find the best
   strategy.

what is a state
     __________________________________________________________________

   consider state as a summary (then called state-space) of all
   information needed to determine what happens next. there are 2 types of
   state space:
     * world-state: normally huge, and not available to the agent.
     * agent-state: smaller, have all variables needed to make a decision
       related to the agent expected utility.

markovian property
     __________________________________________________________________

   basically you don  t need past states to do a optimal decision, all you
   need is the current state . this is because you could encode on your
   current state everything you need from the past to do a good decision.
   still history matters...

environment
     __________________________________________________________________

   to simplify our universe imagine the grid world, here your agent
   objective is to arrive on the green block, and avoid the red block.
   your available actions are:

   the problem is that we don  t live on a perfect deterministic world, so
   our actions could have have different outcomes:

   for instance when we choose the up action we have 80% id203 of
   actually going up, and 10% of going left or right. also if you choose
   to go left or right you have 80% chance of going left and 10% going up
   or down.

   here are the most important parts:
     * states: a set of possible states
     * model: id203 to go to state when you do the action while you
       were on state , is also called transition model.
     * action: , things that you can do on a particular state
     * reward: , scalar value that you get for been on a state.
     * policy: , our goal, is a map that tells the optimal action for
       every state
     * optimal policy: , is a policy that maximize your expected reward

   in id23 we  re going to learn a optimal policy by
   trial and error.

solving mdps with id145
     __________________________________________________________________

   as stated earlier mdps are the tools for modelling decision problems,
   but how we solve them? in order to solve mdps we need dynamic
   programming, more specifically the bellman equation.

   but first what is id145? basically it  s a method that
   divides a problem into simpler sub-problems easier to solve, it  s just
   really a divide and conquer strategy.

   id145 is both a mathematical optimization method and a
   computer programming method, but both of them follow this divide and
   conquer mechanism. but on mathematics it  s often used as an
   optimization tool. on programming is often implemented with recursion
   and is used on problems like find the shortest path on a graph and
   generation sequences.

   also you may find a term called memoization which is something that
   computer people use to improve the performance of those
   divide-and-conquer algorithms by memorizing sub problems that were
   already calculated.
