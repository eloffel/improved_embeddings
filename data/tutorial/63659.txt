deep learning cars

   a 2d simulation in which cars learn to maneuver through a course by
   themselves, using a neural network and evolutionary algorithms. the
   entire source code of this project is open-source and can be found on
   my [12]github repository.

description

   at the start of each generation 20 cars are spawned. each car has its
   own neural network, which makes up the "intelligence" of the car. the
   cars also have 5 front facing sensors, which measure the distance to
   obstacles and serve as the input of the neural network. if a car hits
   an obstacle, it dies.

   once all cars have died, a new generation is formed using an
   evolutionary algorithm. the "genes" of the two cars with the best
   fitness are crossed and 20 new "children" are born. additionally these
   children get slightly mutated. finally these newborn children try to
   maneuver through the course.

   the fitness of a car is calculated by its progress throughout the
   course. a car's "genes" are the weights of its neural network. the
   neural networks are simple feed-forward networks and consist of 5 input
   nodes, 2 output nodes and 2 hidden layers with 4 and 3 nodes.

display

   the crosses in front of each car symbolize its sensors' current
   readings. the camera always follows the car with the best current
   fitness. the best car is drawn in green, the second best in beige.

   in the top left corner the current outputs and fitness of the targeted
   car are displayed. in the top right corner the neural network of the
   target is visualized. the width of a connection between nodes
   symbolizes the magnitude of its weight, the color its sign (green:
   positive, red: negative).

   in the bottom left corner the current generation count is displayed.
