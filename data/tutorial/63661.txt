structured translation and analysis of low-resource languages

   project overview: of the many diverse world languages, very few are
   within reach of current natural language processing (nlp) and machine
   translation (mt) techniques. while mainstream approaches fail to
   generalize for most languages due to the lack of resources (e.g. text,
   annotations ...etc), our approach is designed to discover and leverage
   deep syntactic and semantic structures elicited from human experts.
   focus languages: malagasy, kinyarwanda, swahili and yoruba.
