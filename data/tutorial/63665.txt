endangered languages

     resources for conservation, development, and documentation of
     endangered, minority, and low or under-resourced human languages.

   there is no centralized list of open-source code that would be useful
   for documenting, conserving, developing, preserving, or working with
   endangered languages. according to some estimates, half of the 7,000~
   currently spoken languages are expected to become extinct this century
   ([76]wikipedia). however, there is a lot of work by academics,
   independent scholars, organizations, communities, and individuals which
   goes towards stopping or slowing this trend. this list is intended to
   provide a central location to document those efforts.

   slack group

   we have a slack group for live discussion. [77]join us here!

   publication

   a white paper describing this repository was published at the lrec 2016
   ccurl workshop (collaboration and computing for under-resourced
   languages). the paper is in this repository, in the papers folder.
   download the raw paper here: [78]open source code serving endangered
   languages.

definitions

   endangered languages are human languages that are in danger of
   extinction. this list also encompasses minority languages - languages
   which are spoken by a stable, but small, population (for example,
   maltese or hawai'ian); and low- or under-resourced languages, which are
   spoken by a significant population but under-represented on the web
   (for instance, quechua). these languages share certain characteristics
   in common; the most pertinent is sparse data and a lack of resources,
   ranging from spell-checkers to grammars to machine translation corpora.
   other under-resourced languages that do not fall under this list
   include constructed languages (for instance, klingon or na'vi),
   computer languages (for instance, javascript or lua), and extinct
   languages that are so sparse as to be rendered computationally
   irrelevant for most purposes (for instance, tocharian).

   open source "promotes a universal access via a free license to a
   product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that
   design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by
   anyone." ([150]wiki). this is important because money and resources
   allocated towards a language or project that are not open source is
   spent at the expense of possible extensibility elsewhere.

   regarding the name, endangered languages may not be the best term, as
   many low resource languages are not necessarily endangered. but this
   term is the most accessible to the widest amount of people. low
   resource languages would also suit this list.

   awesome lists collection.

       general philosophy is to provide a universal inventory of
       categories and guidelines to facilitate consistent annotation of
       similar constructions across languages, while allowing
       language-specific extensions when necessary.
