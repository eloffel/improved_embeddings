    allow using batch norm scale parameters for inception models.

221391590  by sergio guadarrama:

    add support for group id172 in the id164 api. just adding
 mobilenet-v1 ssd currently. this may serve as a road map for other models that
wish to support group id172 as an option.

216005108  by sergio guadarrama:

    introduce hparam `use_bounded_activation` for nasnet. the hparam decides whe
ther to use
    1. bounded activation
    2. clip_by_value for the add operands and bounded activation after add opera
tor.
    3. bounded activation before 'none' and 'pooling' branch
    the restriction on the tensor value range makes it compatible with quantized
 id136.

tensorflow-slim nasnet-a implementation/checkpoints

   this directory contains the code for the nasnet-a model from the paper
   [68]learning transferable architectures for scalable image recognition
   by zoph et al. in nasnet.py there are three different configurations of
   nasnet-a that are implementented. one of the models is the nasnet-a
   built for cifar-10 and the other two are variants of nasnet-a trained
   on id163, which are listed below.

pre-trained models

   two nasnet-a checkpoints are available that have been trained on the
   [69]ilsvrc-2012-cls image classification dataset. accuracies were
   computed by evaluating using a single image crop.
   model checkpoint million macs million parameters top-1 accuracy top-5
   accuracy
   [70]nasnet-a_mobile_224 564 5.3 74.0 91.6
   [71]nasnet-a_large_331 23800 88.9 82.7 96.2

   here is an example of how to download the nasnet-a_mobile_224
   checkpoint. the way to download the nasnet-a_large_331 is the same.
checkpoint_dir=/tmp/checkpoints
mkdir ${checkpoint_dir}
cd ${checkpoint_dir}
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/nasnet-a_mobi
le_04_10_2017.tar.gz
tar -xvf nasnet-a_mobile_04_10_2017.tar.gz
rm nasnet-a_mobile_04_10_2017.tar.gz

   more information on integrating nasnet models into your project can be
   found at the [72]tf-slim image classification library.

   to get started running models on-device go to [73]tensorflow mobile.

sample commands for using nasnet-a mobile and large checkpoints for id136
