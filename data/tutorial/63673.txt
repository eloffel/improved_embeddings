   continuing from a previous post [18]what does un talk about when it
   talks about refugees, i   ll be analyzing the action-driven words in
   [19]unhcr speeches and also touch on the tv coverage among news media,
   using [20]cleannlp and [21]newsflash package in r.

   mentions in intergovernmental organization

   i started by annotating the part of speech of the words and extract
   direct object dependencies where the target noun is not a very common
   word.

   zooming into top nouns, we can see asylum, repatriation and
   displacement appear often, and much ado about persecution, plight and
   crisis.

   as for the top verb-noun pairs,    seek asylum    is the most frequent.

   unhcr speeches

   next i   ll look into what   s covered in the news. different from print
   news, we can expect the transcript text to be more colloquial.

   mentions in news media

   i leveraged the immensely powerful [22]gdelt project that monitors
   print, broadcast, and web news media in over 100 languages from across
   every country in the world. i used the newflash package in r. it works
   with gdelt television explorer and thus captures only us tv news at the
   moment.

   we can see id98 has the most coverage on this topic, and the more
   business-focused channels apparently covered less.

   in terms of verb-noun pairs, there are many words associated with
   refugee more than the other nouns, as tv news might use many different
   ways to describe situations like plight, displacement, and repatriation
   instead of using those words directly. top nouns mentioned also include
   border, syria, camp.

   text processing with r

   after getting a hang of classical packages like tm, i started dipping
   my toes into nlp when tidytext come around, which makes the conversion
   of corpus to table easy and is handy when need to do something simple.
   then i chanced upon spacyr which is amazingly fast and robust,
   providing simple syntax for id39 . today i learnt
   about opennlp (which sits on the shoulder all these other great
   packages) and used it for id33. while there   s a lot more
   to explore, it only gets better.
