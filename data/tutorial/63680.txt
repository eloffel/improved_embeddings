text-summarization-with-amazon-reviews

   the objective of this project is to build a id195 model that can
   create relevant summaries for reviews written about fine foods sold on
   amazon. this dataset contains above 500,000 reviews, and is hosted on
   [71]kaggle. it's too large to host here, it's over 300mb.

   to build our model we will use a two-layered bidirectional id56 with
   lstms on the input data and two layers, each with an lstm using
   bahdanau attention on the target data. [72]jaemin cho's tutorial for
   id195 was really helpful to get the code in working order because
   this is my first project with tensorflow 1.1; some of the functions are
   very different from 1.0. the architecture for this model is similar to
   xin pan's and peter liu's, here's their [73]github page.

   this model uses [74]conceptnet numberbatch's pre-trained word vectors.

   here are some examples of reviews and their generated summaries:
     * description(1): the coffee tasted great and was at such a good
       price! i highly recommend this to everyone!
     * summary(1): great coffee
     * description(2): this is the worst cheese that i have ever bought! i
       will never buy it again and i hope you won   t either!
     * summary(2): omg gross gross
     * description(3): love individual oatmeal cups found years ago sam
       quit selling sound big lots quit selling found target expensive buy
       individually trilled get entire case time go anywhere need water
       microwave spoon know quaker flavor packets
     * summary(3): love it

   i wrote an [75]article about this project that explains parts of it in
   detail.
