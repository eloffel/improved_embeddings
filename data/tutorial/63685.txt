evaluating id27s using a representative suite of practical tasks

motivation

   more about this evaluation can be found in the related workshop
   [5]paper.

   intrinsic evaluations such as word similarity or analogy evaluations
   have become the de-facto proving ground for new id27s.
   however, these evaluations are almost always accompanied by extrinsic
   evaluations on tasks such as sentiment classification. this reflects
   the fact that id27s are usually intended to be used as
   components in an evaluation for a downstream task of some sort.

   in spite of this disconnect between intrinsic evaluations and the
   purpose of id27s, such evaluations endure as a standard. this
   is due, in part, to the fact that intrinsic evaluations have three
   properties which are difficult to achieve in extrinsic evaluations    
   they are fast, replicable, and unbiased.

   we attempt to bring these three properties to a standard extrinsic
   evaluation. in this evalution, embeddings are used as initializations
   in simple neural models for six popular downstream tasks. the
   embeddings are tested in two settings -- first, keeping the embeddings
   fixed to measure their intrinsic qualities, and second, fine-tuning the
   embeddings to test their performance as initializations.

upload

   this evaluation can be used in two ways.

   first, to compare embedding methods, you can download a standard corpus
   on which to train embeddings, then upload them for evaluation. the
   recommended corpus is that used in [6]evaluation methods for
   unsupervised id27s (schnabel et al. 2015).

                   (corpus              ) download corpus

   alternatively, to simply evaluate the quality of a set of embeddings
   trained on an arbitrary corpus, you can upload any set of embeddings in
   the correct format, indicating this in the upload form.

   to ensure that the embedding file is in the correct format, run this
   [7]validation script.
