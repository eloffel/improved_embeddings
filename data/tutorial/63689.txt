   how a movie character is written or portrayed influences a viewer's
   impression, which can in turn influence people's stereotypes on gender
   norms. we develop a computational framework, called connotation frames,
   to measure the power and agency given to characters in movies. our new
   tool allows for in-depth analyses of subtle nuances in how characters
   are written about in movie screenplays.

what are connotation frames? [9][expand]

   connotation frames measure the implications verbs have on the
   characters they describe. for instance, someone who "accepts" something
   is implied to be more passive (negative agency) than someone who
   "assesses" things (positive agency). we collect the following two
   connotations for roughly 2000 verbs, through id104:
     * power (vs. submissiveness) connotations capture implied authority
       differentials between the subject and the object of the verb. for
       instance, in the sentence "he implored the tribunal to show mercy",
       "he" is implied to be in a submissive position compared to "the
       tribunal", as signaled by the verb "implore". conversely, in "he
       demanded mercy from the tribunal", "he" is described with much more
       authority over "the tribunal".
     * agency (vs. passiveness) connotation frames uncover the implied
       agency given to the subject by the verb. for example in "she
       searched for her prince", "she" is the driver of her own life
       (positive agency), which isn't the case in "she waited for her
       prince", where "she" much more passive.

how do we study movie characters? [11][expand]

   in our project, we look at a set of ~700 modern movie [12]screenplays,
   which contain both scene descriptions and stage direcions for
   characters ("narratives") and the words spoken by characters
   ("dialogue"). screenplays are neatly formatted, allowing us to easily
   find which lines are spoken by or written about specific characters in
   the movie. using a simple gender identification tool, we find whether
   characters in the movie were male or female.*

   we then apply our connotation frame tool to these movie characters,
   giving each character four connotation scores (high power,
   submissiveness, positive agency and passiveness). for instance, think
   of a submissiveness score as measuring the amount of subordination
   displayed for a character in the screenplay. with scores computed for
   all characters, we used statistical tools to uncover bias in how much
   power and agency female and male characters have.
   *we acknowledge that this is over-simplifying the construct of gender,
   which lies on a spectrum.

how much bias is there in our movies? [13][expand]

   through our statistical analyses, we found that women were consistently
   portrayed in more submissive positions and with less agency than men,
   in ways that reinforce gender stereotypes. we also find that men tend
   to speak more in imperative sentences (e.g., "bring me my horse."), and
   women tend to hedge their statements more (e.g., "maybe i am wrong.").

   we also compare our connotation scores for each movie to its
   [14]bechdel rating, finding that movies with positive-agency,
   plot-driving women tend to fail the bechdel test. perhaps movies are
   less likely to contain a lot of positive-agency female characters.
   (similar observations inspired the [15]mako mori test).

   power

   how much power do female/male characters have in this movie?

   [16]what does this graph mean?

   bars show how much power (or submissiveness) male (in blue) and female
   (in red) characters have in this movie.

   high power scores represent how often verbs imply that a character has
   more authority, averaged across characters in the movie. for example,
   "she handcuffs y", where "she" is implied to have more power than y,
   counts towards the female high power score. more high power for male
   characters indicates that the movie represents men with more
   power/authority than women.

   submissiveness scores represent how many times verbs put characters in
   a subordinate position, averaged across characters in the movie. for
   instance, "he apologizes to y" implies "he" is in a submissive status
   compared to y, and counts towards the male submissiveness score. more
   submissiveness for male characters indicates that men are represented
   in more subordinate situations than women.

   note: a movie can have both more high power and more submissiveness for
   male characters. it just means that, generally, male characters were
   involved in more actions than women.
   agency

   how much agency do female/male characters have in this movie?

   [17]what does this graph mean?

   bars show how much agency (or passiveness) male (in blue) and female
   (in red) characters have in this movie.

   positive agency scores represent how often verbs imply positive agency
   (or decisiveness) for a character, averaged across characters in the
   movie. for example, "she beat the enemy" counts towards female positive
   agency, since it implies "she" has positive agency, is decisive and
   driving her destiny. more positive agency for women means women are
   driving the plot more often than men are in this movie.

   passiveness scores represent how many verbs imply negative agency and
   passiveness for a character, averaged across characters in the movie.
   for instance, "she experienced a change" implies "she" has little to do
   with why "a change" is happening, and counts towards the female
   passiveness score. more passiveness for women implies the movie
   represents them as experiencing the plot more than men.

   note: a movie can have both more positive agency and more passiveness
   for female characters. this indicates that there's a tendency in the
   movie for women to be involved in more actions.
   also note that passiveness scores are often lower than positive agency
   scores, because verbs are more often used to describe active
   situations, leaving out explicit passiveness descriptions.
