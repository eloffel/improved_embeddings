     huge amount of data generated every second and it is necessary to
     have knowledge of different tools that can be utilized to handle
     this huge data and apply interesting data mining algorithms and
     visualizations in quick time.

   data mining is the set of methodologies used in analyzing data from
   various dimensions and perspectives, finding previously unknown hidden
   patterns, classifying and grouping the data and summarizing the
   identified relationships.
   [0*ocb1mfvrjmmxlzuz.jpg]

   the tasks of data mining are twofold:
    1. create predictive power using features to predict unknown or future
       values of the same or other feature         and
    2. create a descriptive power, find interesting, human-interpretable
       patterns that describe the data.

   four most useful data mining techniques:
     * regression (predictive)
     * association rule discovery (descriptive)
     * classification (predictive)
     * id91 (descriptive) and there are many more       

   for doing quick analysis on data using any data mining technique it is
   important to have hands on knowledge of different tools. all the tools
   mentioned below has its own peculiarity in terms of implementation and
   each has its own merits. it all boils down to the requirement of task.
   most important thing is to know that tools exist which can immensely
   enhance the efficiency of a data scientist or a student working on some
   project, so that you can focus more the things that matter that is is
   gaining useful insights and making projections. it also takes the pain
   of implementing any standard algorithm from scratch but at the same
   time gives you the power to modify the code of tool (open source ) as
   per requirements.

   there are many tools apart from mentioned below and i encourage you to
   check that out as well. the list i have provided are the one that are
   most common and used widely in leading companies as well as academia.
   also most of them are open source == awesome :)

comprehensive list of tools for data mining

     rapid miner

   [0*onvarkn5pptv8fbu.png]

   this is very popular since it is a ready made, open source, no-coding
   required software, which gives advanced analytics. written in java, it
   incorporates multifaceted data mining functions such as data
   pre-processing, visualization, predictive analysis, and can be easily
   integrated with weka and r-tool to directly give models from scripts
   written in the former two. besides the standard data mining features
   like data cleansing, filtering, id91, etc, the software also
   features built-in templates, repeatable work flows, a professional
   visualisation environment, and seaid113ss integration with languages like
   python and r into work flows that aid in rapid prototyping.

     weka

   [0*oyxkymptoqruyice.jpg]

   weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
   tasks. the algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or
   called from your own java code. weka contains tools for data
   pre-processing, classification, regression, id91, association
   rules, and visualization. it is also well-suited for developing new
   machine learning schemes.

     orange

   [0*rlryekdomcs9_ugd.]

   python users playing around with data sciences might be familiar with
   orange. it is a python library that powers python scripts with its rich
   compilation of mining and machine learning algorithms for data
   pre-processing, classification, modelling, regression, id91 and
   other miscellaneous functions. orange also comes with a visual
   programming environment and its workbench consists of tools for
   importing data, and dragging and dropping widgets and links to connect
   different widgets for completing the workflow.

     r

   [0*gpiyuohujg2pny_o.png]

   r is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
   written in c++. r studio is ide specially designed for r language.it is
   one of the leading tools used to do data mining tasks and comes with
   huge community support as well as packaged with hundreds of libraries
   built specifically for data mining.

     knime

   [0*1gqbzmjmyl6anxjk.jpg]

   primarily used for id174         i.e. data extraction,
   transformation and loading, knime is a powerful tool with gui that
   shows the network of data nodes. popular amongst financial data
   analysts, it has modular data pipe lining, leveraging machine learning,
   and data mining concepts liberally for building business intelligence
   reports.

     rattle

   rattle, expanded to    r analytical tool to learn easily   , has been
   developed using the r statistical programming language. the software
   can run on linux, mac os and windows, and features statistics,
   id91, modelling and visualisation with the computing power of r.
   rattle is currently being used in business, commercial enterprises and
   for teaching purposes in australian and american universities.

     tanagra

   [0*ks3k9tsm82571xbt.jpg]

   tanagra is a free open source data mining software for academic and
   research purposes. it proposes several data mining methods from
   exploratory data analysis, statistical learning, machine learning and
   databases area. tanagra is more powerful, it contains some supervised
   learning but also other paradigms such as id91, factorial
   analysis, parametric and non parametric statistics, association rule,
   feature selection and construction algorithms.the main purpose of
   tanagra project is to give researchers and students an easy-to-use data
   mining software, conforming to the present norms of the software
   development in this domain (especially in the design of its gui and the
   way to use it), and allowing to analyse either real or synthetic data.

     xl miner

   [0*qj7rabmudbe09ftp.gif]

   xlminer is the only comprehensive data mining add-in for excel, with
   neural nets, classification and regression trees, id28,
   id75, bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors, discriminant
   analysis, association rules, id91, principal components, and
   more.

   xlminer provides everything you need to sample data from many
   sources         powerpivot, microsoft/ibm/oracle databases, or spreadsheets;
   explore and visualize your data with multiple linked charts; preprocess
   and    clean    your data, fit data mining models, and evaluate your
   models    predictive power.

   the drawback of xl miner is that is paid add in for excel but there is
   15 day free trial option. the software has great features and its
   integration in excel makes life easier.
