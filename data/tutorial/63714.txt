research text summarization

   system for extractive summarization of research text using deep
   learning

approach

   we consider the task of summarization as a sequence-to-sequence mapping
   task where,

   source sequence: research text

   target sequence: extractive summary of the text

   hence, we use lstm (long short term memory) based id56s (recurrent
   neural networks) with attention mechanism for the task since research
   text has lot of long-term dependencies among the various sections of
   the paper. attention mechanism models focussing on some portion of the
   input text more than the others at different instances of time. during
   training, the abstract of the input research paper is the target
   output.

major challenge

   scientific articles are too long to be processed for current gpus using
   lstms. hence we need to get to a compressed representation of the paper
   retaining important information conveyed by the paper, before applying
   the sequence-to-sequence mapping task.

dataset used

   latex sources of articles from arxiv.org.

variations tested

    1. using extractive summarization: we first generate a 2000 word
       summary of the input research text using lex-rank algorithm (and
       others also), then pass this extractive summary to a
       sequence-to-sequence model to furthur generate its summary.
    2. using paragraph embeddings: we first use para2vec algorithm to
       generate embeddings for individual sections of the input research
       paper then pass these as inputs to the sequence-to-sequence model.
    3. using gru (id149): we first use lex-rank to
       generate single sentence summary for individual paragraphs of the
       input research text, then concatenate these representative
       sentences and pass to a gru based model.

evaluation

   for checking the goodness of the summary generated by our system, we
   use the id8 (recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation)
   metrics.

   the results and examples generated using different approaches can be
   found in the presentation, in the root directory of the project.
