   pymc3 logo

   [43]build status [44]coverage [45]numfocus_badge [46]binder

   pymc3 is a python package for bayesian statistical modeling and
   probabilistic machine learning focusing on advanced markov chain monte
   carlo (mcmc) and variational id136 (vi) algorithms. its flexibility
   and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems.

   check out the [47]getting started guide, or [48]interact with live
   examples using binder!

features

     * intuitive model specification syntax, for example, x ~ n(0,1)
       translates to x = normal('x',0,1)
     * powerful sampling algorithms, such as the [49]no u-turn sampler,
       allow complex models with thousands of parameters with little
       specialized knowledge of fitting algorithms.
     * variational id136: [50]advi for fast approximate posterior
       estimation as well as mini-batch advi for large data sets.
     *

        relies on [51]theano which provides:

               o computation optimization and dynamic c compilation
               o numpy broadcasting and advanced indexing
               o id202 operators
               o simple extensibility

     * transparent support for missing value imputation

getting started

if you already know about bayesian statistics:

     * [52]api quickstart guide
     * the [53]pymc3 tutorial
     * [54]pymc3 examples and the [55]api reference

learn bayesian statistics with a book together with pymc3:

     * [56]probabilistic programming and bayesian methods for hackers:
       fantastic book with many applied code examples.
     * [57]pymc3 port of the book    doing bayesian data analysis    by john
       kruschke as well as the [58]second edition: principled introduction
       to bayesian data analysis.
     * [59]pymc3 port of the book    statistical rethinking a bayesian
       course with examples in r and stan    by richard mcelreath
     * [60]pymc3 port of the book    bayesian cognitive modeling    by michael
       lee and ej wagenmakers: focused on using bayesian statistics in
       cognitive modeling.
     * [61]bayesian analysis with python (second edition) by osvaldo
       martin: great introductory book. ([62]code and errata).

pymc3 talks

   there are also several talks on pymc3 which are gathered in this
   [63]youtube playlist

installation

   the latest release of pymc3 can be installed from pypi using pip:
pip install pymc3

   note: running pip install pymc will install pymc 2.3, not pymc3, from
   pypi.

   or via conda-forge:
conda install -c conda-forge pymc3

   the current development branch of pymc3 can be installed from github,
   also using pip:
pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3

   to ensure the development branch of theano is installed alongside pymc3
   (recommended), you can install pymc3 using the requirements.txt file.
   this requires cloning the repository to your computer:
git clone https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3
cd pymc3
pip install -r requirements.txt

   however, if a recent version of theano has already been installed on
   your system, you can install pymc3 directly from github.

   another option is to clone the repository and install pymc3 using
   python setup.py install or python setup.py develop.

dependencies

   pymc3 is tested on python 2.7 and 3.6 and depends on theano, numpy,
   scipy, pandas, and matplotlib (see requirements.txt for version
   information).

optional

   in addtion to the above dependencies, the glm submodule relies on
   [64]patsy.
