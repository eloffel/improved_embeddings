   long title: measuring semantic relatedness using the distance and the
   shortest common ancestor and outcast detection with id138 digraph in
   python

   the following problem appeared as an assignment in the algorithm
   course (cos 226) at princeton university taught by prof. sedgewick.
   the description of the problem is taken from the assignment
   itself. however, in the assignment, the implementation is supposed to
   be in java, in this article a python implementation will be described
   instead. instead of using nltk, this implementation is going to be
   from scratch.


the problem


     * id138 is a semantic lexicon for the english language that
       computational linguists and cognitive scientists use extensively.
       for example, id138 was a key component in
       ibm   s jeopardy-playing watson computer system.
     * id138 groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. for
       example, { and circuit, and gate } is a synset that represent a
       logical gate that fires only when all of its inputs fire.
     * id138 also describes semantic relationships between synsets. one
       such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects
       a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general
       synset). for example, the synset { gate, logic gate } is
       a hypernym of { and circuit, and gate } because an and gate is a
       kind of logic gate.
     * the id138 digraph. the first task is to build the id138
       digraph: each vertex v is an integer that represents a synset, and
       each directed edge v   w represents that w is a hypernym of v.
     * the id138 digraph is a rooted dag: it is acyclic and has one
       vertex   the root    that is an ancestor of every other vertex.
     * however, it is not necessarily a tree because a synset can have
       more than one hypernym. a small subgraph of the id138
       digraph appears below.


   id138-event.png

the id138 input file formats


   the following two data files will be used to create the id138
   digraph. the files are in comma-separated values (csv) format: each
   line contains a sequence of fields, separated by commas.
     * list of synsets: the file [37]synsets.txt contains all
       noun synsets in id138, one per line. line i of the file (counting
       from 0) contains the information for synset i.
          + the first field is the synset id, which is always the
            integer i;
          + the second field is the synonym set (or synset); and
          + the third field is its dictionary definition (or gloss), which
            is not relevant to this assignment.
            id138-synsets.png
            for example, line 36 means that the synset
            { and_circuit, and_gate } has an id number of 36 and its gloss
            is a circuit in a computer that fires only when all of its
            inputs fire. the individual nouns that constitute a synset are
            separated by spaces. if a noun contains more than one word,
            the underscore character connects the words (and not the space
            character).

     * list of hypernyms: the file [38]hypernyms.txt contains
       the hypernym relationships. line i of the file (counting from 0)
       contains the hypernyms of synset i.
          + the first field is the synset id, which is always the
            integer i;
          + subsequent fields are the id numbers of the synset   s
            hypernyms.
            id138-hypernyms.png
            for example, line 36 means that synset 36 (and_circuit
            and_gate) has 42338 (gate logic_gate) as its only hypernym.
            line 34 means that synset 34 (aids
            acquired_immune_deficiency_syndrome) has two hypernyms: 47569
            (immunodeficiency) and 56099 (infectious_disease).



the id138 data type


   implement an immutable data type id138 with the following api:

   wn.png


     * the id138 digraph contains 76066 nodes and 84087 edges, it   s very
       difficult to visualize the entire graph at once, hence
       small subgraphs will be displayed as and when required relevant to
       the context of the examples later.


     * the sca() and the distance() between two nodes v and w are
       implemented using bfs (bread first search) starting from the two
       nodes separately and combining the distances computed.


   performance requirements
     * the data type must use space linear in the input size (size
       of synsets and hypernyms files).
     * the constructor must take time linearithmic (or better) in the
       input size.
     * the method isnoun() must run in time logarithmic (or better) in the
       number of nouns.
     * the methods distance() and sca() must make exactly one call to
       the length() and ancestor() methods in shortestcommonancestor,
       respectively.

the shortest common ancestor


     * an ancestral path between two vertices v and w in a rooted dag is
       a directed pathfrom v to a common ancestor x, together with
       a directed path from w to the same ancestor x.
     * a shortest ancestral path is an ancestral path of minimum total
       length.
     * we refer to the common ancestor in a shortest ancestral path as
       a shortest common ancestor.
     * note that a shortest common ancestor always exists because
       the root is an ancestor of every vertex. note also that
       an ancestral path is a path, but not a directed path.

   id138-sca.png
     * the following animation shows how the shortest common ancestor node
       1 for thenodes 3 and 10  for the following rooted dag is
       found at distance 4 with bfs, along with the ancestral path
       3-1-5-9-10. sca2.gif

     * we generalize the notion of shortest common ancestor to subsets of
       vertices. a shortest ancestral path of two subsets of
       vertices a and b is a shortest ancestral path over all pairs of
       vertices v and w, with v in a and w in b.
     * the figure ([39]digraph25.txt) below shows an example in which, for
       two subsets, red and blue, we have computed several (but not
       all) ancestral paths, including the shortest one.
       id138-sca-set.png
       shortest common ancestor data type
       implement an immutable data type shortestcommonancestor with the
       following api:
       sca.png


   basic performance requirements

   the data type must use space proportional to e + v, where e and v are
   the number of edges and vertices in the digraph, respectively. all
   methods and the constructor must take time proportional to e+ v (or
   better).


measuring the semantic relatedness of two nouns

   semantic relatedness refers to the degree to which two concepts are
   related. measuring semantic relatedness is a challenging problem. for
   example, let   s consider george w. bushand john f. kennedy (two u.s.
   presidents) to be more closely related than george w.
   bush and chimpanzee (two primates). it might not be clear
   whether george w. bush and eric arthur blair are more related than two
   arbitrary people. however, both george w. bush and eric arthur
   blair (a.k.a. george orwell) are famous communicators and, therefore,
   closely related.

   let   s define the semantic relatedness of two id138 nouns x and y as
   follows:
     * a = set of synsets in which x appears
     * b = set of synsets in which y appears
     * distance(x, y) = length of shortest ancestral path of
       subsets a and b
     * sca(x, y) = a shortest common ancestor of subsets a and b

   this is the notion of distance that we need to use to implement
   the distance() and sca() methods in the id138 data type.

finding semantic relatedness for some example nouns with the shortest common
ancestor and the distance method implemented


   apple and potato (distance 5 in the id138 digraph, as shown below)

   dag_apple_potato.png

   as can be seen, the noun entity is the root of the id138 dag.

   beer and diaper (distance 13 in the id138 digraph)

   dag_beer_diaper.png


   beer and milk (distance 4 in the id138 digraph, with sca as drink
   synset), as expected since they are more semantically closer to each
   other.

   dag_beer_milk.png

   bread and butter (distance 3 in the id138 digraph, as shown below)

   dag_bread_butter.png

   cancer and aids (distance 6 in the id138 digraph,
   with sca as disease as shown below, bfs computed distances and
   the target distance between the nouns are also shown)

   with sca as abstraction synset as shown below)
   dag_text_mining

   milk and water (distance 3 in the id138 digraph, with sca as food, as
   shown below) dag_water_milk

outcast detection


   given a list of id138 nouns x1, x2,    , xn, which noun is the least
   related to the others? to identify an outcast, compute the sum of
   the distances between each noun and every other one:

     di   =   distance(xi, x1)   +   distance(xi, x2)   +         +
     distance(xi, xn)

   and return a noun xt for which dt is maximum. note
   that distance(xi, xi) = 0, so it will not contribute to the sum.

   implement an immutable data type outcast with the following api:

   outc.png

examples

   as expected, potato is the outcast  in the list of the nouns shown
   below (a noun with maximum distance from the rest of the nouns, all of
   which except potato are fruits, but potato is not). it can be seen from
   the id138 distance heatmap from the next plot, as well as the sum of
   distance plot from the plot following the next one.
   outcast_apple_pear_peach_banana_lime_lemon_blueberry_strawberry_mango_w
   atermelon_potato

   again, as expected, table is the outcast  in the list of the nouns
   shown below (a noun with maximum distance from the rest of the
   nouns, all of which except table are mammals, but table is not). it can
   be seen from the id138 distance heatmap from the next plot, as well
   as the sum of distance plot from the plot following the next one.

   outcast_horse_zebra_cat_bear_table

   finally, as expected, bed is the outcast  in the list of the nouns
   shown below (a noun with maximum distance from the rest of the
   nouns, all of which except bed are drinks, but bed is not). it can be
   seen from the id138 distance heatmap from the next plot, as well as
   the sum of distance plot from the plot following the next one.
