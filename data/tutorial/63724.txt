acl2017

   code to train models from "revisiting recurrent networks for
   paraphrastic sentence embeddings".

   the code is written in python and requires numpy, scipy, theano, and
   the lasagne libraries.

   to get started, run setup.sh to download a trained gated recurrent
   averaging network (gran) model and required files such as training data
   and evaluation data. there is a demo script that takes the model that
   you would like to train as a command line argument (check the script to
   see available choices). check main/train.py for command line options.

   if you use our code for your work please cite:

   @inproceedings{wieting-17-recurrent, author = {john wieting and kevin
   gimpel}, title = {revisiting recurrent networks for paraphrastic
   sentence embeddings}, booktitle = {proceedings of the annual meeting of
   the association for computational linguistics}, year = {2017}, }
