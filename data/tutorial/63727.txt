structuredinf

   code to fully reproduce benchmark results (and to extend for your own
   purposes) from the paper:

       krishnan, shalit, sontag. [90]structured id136 networks for
                  nonlinear state space models, aaai 2017.
   see [91]here for a simplified and easier to use version of the code.

goal

   the goal of this package is to provide a black box id136 algorithm
   for learning models of time-series data. id136 during learning and
   at test time is based on compiled recognition or [92]id136 network.

model

   the figure below describes a simple model of time-series data.

   this method is a good fit if:
     * you have an arbitrarily specified state space model whose
       parameters you're interested in fitting.
     * you would like to have a method for fast posterior id136 at
       train and test time
     * your temporal generative model has gaussian latent variables
       (mean/variance can be a nonlinear function of previous timestep's
       variables).

                           [93]deep kalman filter

   the code uses variational id136 during learning to maximize the
   likelihood of the observed data:

                          [94]evidence lower bound

   generative model
     * the latent variables z1...zt and the observations x1...xt describe
       the generative process for the data.
     * the figure depicts a state space model for time-varying data.
     * the emission and transition functions may be pre-specified to have
       a fixed functional form, a parametric functional form, a function
       parameterized by a deep neural networks or some combination
       thereof.

   id136 model

   the box q(z1..zt | x1...xt) represents the id136 network. there are
   several supported id136 networks within this package.
     * id136 implemented with a bi-directional lstm
     * id136 implemented with an lstm conditioned on observations in
       the future
     * id136 implemented with an lstm conditioned on observations from
       the past

installation

requirements

   this package has the following requirements:

   python2.7

   [95]theano used for automatic differentiations

   [theanomodels] ([96]https://github.com/clinicalml/theanomodels) wrapper
   around theano that takes care of bookkeeping, saving/loading models
   etc. clone the github repository and add its location to the pythonpath
   environment variable so that it is accessible by python.

   [pykalman] ([97]https://pykalman.github.io/) [optional: for running
   baseline ukfs/kfs]

   an nvidia gpu w/ atleast 6g of memory is recommended.

   once the requirements have been met, clone this repository and it's
   ready to run.

folder structure

   the following folders contain code to reproduct the results reported in
   our paper:
     * expt-synthetic, expt-polyphonic: contains code and instructions for
       reproducing results from the paper.
     * baselines/: contains to run some of the baseline algorithms on the
       synthetic data
     * ipynb/: ipython notebooks for visualizing saved checkpoints and
       building plots

   the main files of interest are:
     * parse_args_dkf.py: arguments that the model expects to be present.
       looking through it is useful to understand the different knobs
       available to tune the model.
     * stinfmodel/dkf.py: code to construct the id136 and generative
       model. the code is commented to enable easy modification for
       different scenarios.
     * stinfmodel/evaluate.py: code to evaluate the deep kalman filter's
       performance during learning.
     * stinfmodel/learning.py: code for performing stochastic gradient
       ascent in the evidence lower bound.

dataset

   we use numpy tensors to store the datasets with binary numpy masks to
   allow batch sizes comprising sequences of variable length. we train the
   models using mini-batch id119 on negative elbo.

format

   the code to run on polyphonic and synthetic datasets has already been
   created in the theanomodels repository. see
   theanomodels/datasets/load.py for how the dataset is created and
   loaded.

   the datasets are stored in three dimensional numpy tensors. to deal
   with datapoints of different lengths, we use numpy matrices comprised
   of binary masks. there may be different choices to manipulate data that
   you may adopt depending on your needs and this is merely a guideline.
assert type(dataset) is dict,'expecting dictionary'
dataset['train'] # n_train x t_train_max x dim_observation : training data
dataset['test']  # n_test  x t_test_max  x dim_observation : validation data
dataset['valid'] # n_valid x t_valid_max x dim_observation : test data
dataset['mask_train'] # n_train x t_train_max : training masks
dataset['mask_test']  # n_test  x t_test_max  : validation masks
dataset['mask_valid'] # n_valid x t_valid_max : test masks
dataset['data_type'] # real/binary
dataset['has_masks'] # true/false

   during learning, we select a minibatch of these tensors to update the
   weights of the model.

running on different datasets

   see the folder expt-template for an example of how to setup your data
   and run the code on your data
