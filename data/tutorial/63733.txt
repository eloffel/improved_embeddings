                  the ai that has nothing to learn from humans

   deepmind   s new self-taught go-playing program is making moves that
   other players describe as    alien    and    from an alternate dimension.

   a man slumps in defeat over a go board. a go match between alphago and
   ke jie in which the machine came out the alphachina stringer network /
   reuters

   it was a tense summer day in 1835 japan. the country   s reigning go
   player, honinbo jowa, took his seat across a board from a 25-year-old
   prodigy by the name of akaboshi intetsu. both men had spent their lives
   mastering the two-player strategy game that   s long been popular in east
   asia. their face-off, that day, was high-stakes: honinbo and akaboshi
   represented two go houses fighting for power, and the rivalry between
   the two camps had lately exploded into accusations of foul play.

   little did they know that the match   now remembered by go historians as
   the    blood-vomiting game      would last for several grueling days. or that
   it would lead to a grisly end.

   early on, the young akaboshi took a lead. but then, according to lore,
      ghosts    appeared and showed honinbo three crucial moves. his comeback
   was so overwhelming that, as the story goes, his junior opponent keeled
   over and began coughing up blood. weeks later, akaboshi was found dead.
   historians have speculated that he might have had an undiagnosed
   respiratory disease.

   it makes a certain kind of sense that the game   s connoisseurs might
   have wondered if they   d seen glimpses of the occult in those three
   so-called ghost moves. unlike something like tic-tac-toe, which is
   straightforward enough that the optimal strategy is always clear-cut,
   go is so complex that new, unfamiliar strategies can feel astonishing,
   revolutionary, or even uncanny.

   unfortunately for ghosts, now it   s computers that are revealing these
   goosebump-inducing moves.

   as many will remember, alphago   a program that used machine learning to
   master go   decimated world champion ke jie earlier this year. then, the
   program   s creators at google   s deepmind let the program continue to
   train by playing millions of games against itself. in a paper published
   in nature [63]earlier this week, deepmind revealed that a new version
   of alphago (which they christened alphago zero) picked up go from
   scratch, without studying any human games at all. alphago zero took a
   mere three days to reach the point where it was pitted against an older
   version of itself and won 100 games to zero.

   now that alphago   s arguably got nothing left to learn from humans   now
   that its continued progress takes the form of endless training games
   against itself   what do its tactics look like, in the eyes of
   experienced human players? we might have some early glimpses into an
   answer.

   alphago zero   s latest games haven   t been disclosed yet. but several
   months ago, the company publicly released 55 games that an older
   version of alphago played against itself. (note that this is the
   incarnation of alphago that had already made quick work of the world   s
   champions.) deepmind called its offering a    special gift to fans of go
   around the world.   

   since may, experts have been painstakingly analyzing the 55
   machine-versus-machine games. and their descriptions of alphago   s moves
   often seem to keep circling back to the same several words: amazing.
   strange. alien.

      they   re how i imagine games from far in the future,    shi yue, a top go
   player from china, has told the press. a go enthusiast named jonathan
   hop who   s been reviewing the games on youtube calls the
   alphago-versus-alphago face-offs    go from an alternate dimension.    from
   all accounts, one gets the sense that an alien civilization has dropped
   a cryptic guidebook in our midst: a manual that   s brilliant   or at
   least, the parts of it we can understand.

   will lockhart, a physics grad student and avid go player who codirected
   the surrounding game (a documentary about the pastime   s history and
   devotees) tried to describe the difference between watching alphago   s
   games against top human players, on the one hand, and its self-paired
   games, on the other. (i interviewed will   s go-playing brother ben about
   asia   s intensive go schools in 2016.) according to will, alphago   s
   moves against ke jie made it seem to be    inevitably marching toward
   victory,    while ke seemed to be    punching a brick wall.    any time the
   chinese player had perhaps found a way forward, said lockhart,    10
   moves later alphago had resolved it in such a simple way, and it was
   like,    poof, well that didn   t lead anywhere!      

   by contrast, alphago   s self-paired games might have seemed more
   frenetic. more complex. lockhart compares them to    people
   sword-fighting on a tightrope.   

   expert players are also noticing alphago   s idiosyncrasies. lockhart and
   others mention that it almost fights various battles simultaneously,
   adopting an approach that might seem a bit madcap to human players,
   who   d probably spend more energy focusing on smaller areas of the board
   at a time. according to michael redmond, the highest-ranked go player
   from the western world (he relocated to japan at the age of 14 to study
   go), humans have accumulated knowledge that might tend to be more
   useful on the sides and corners of the board. alphago    has less of that
   bias,    he noted,    so it can make impressive moves in the center that
   are harder for us to grasp.   

   also, it   s been making unorthodox opening moves. some of those gambits,
   just two years ago, might have seemed ill-conceived to experts. but now
   pro players are copying certain of these unfamiliar tactics in
   tournaments, even if no one fully understands how certain of these
   tactics lead to victory. for example, people have noticed that some
   versions of alphago seem to like playing what   s called a three-three
   invasion on a star point, and they   re experimenting with that move in
   tournaments now too. no one   s seeing these experiments lead to clearly
   consistent victories yet, maybe because human players don   t understand
   how best to follow through.

   some moves alphago likes to make against its clone are downright
   incomprehensible, even to the world   s best players. (these tend to
   happen early on in the games   probably because that phase is already
   mysterious, being farthest away from any final game outcome.) one
   opening move in game one has many players stumped. says redmond,    i
   think a natural reaction (and the reaction i   m mostly seeing) is that
   they just sort of give up, and sort of throw their hands up in the
   opening. because it   s so hard to try to attach a story about what
   alphago is doing. you have to be ready to deny a lot of the things that
   we   ve believed and that have worked for us.   

   like others, redmond notes that the games somehow feel    alien.   
      there   s some inhuman element in the way alphago plays,    he says,
      which makes it very difficult for us to just even sort of get into the
   game.   

   still, redmond thinks there are moments when alphago (at least its
   older version) might not necessarily be enigmatically, transcendently
   good. moments when it might possibly be making mistakes, even. there
   are patterns of play called joseki   series of locally confined attacks
   and responses, in which players essentially battle to a standstill
   until it only makes sense for them to move to another part of the
   board. some of these joseki have been analyzed and memorized and honed
   over generations. redmond suspects that people may still be better at
   responding in a few of these patterns, because people have analyzed
   them so intensely. (it   s hard to tell though, because in the
   alphago-versus-alphago games, both    copies    of the program seem to
   avoid getting into these joseki in the first place.)

   it   s not far-fetched that alphago may still be choosing suboptimal
   moves   making    mistakes,    if you will. you can see go as a massive tree
   made of thousands of branches representing possible moves and
   countermoves. over generations, go players have identified certain
   clusters of branches that seem to work really well. and now that
   alphago   s come along, it   s finding even better options. still, huge
   swaths of the tree might yet be unexplored. as lockhart put it,    it
   could be possible that a perfect god plays [alphago] and crushes it. or
   maybe not. maybe it   s already there. we don't know.   

                                    * * *

   from his home base in chiba, japan, redmond says, he has been studying
   alphago   s self-paired games more or less nonstop for the past four
   months. he   s been videotaping his commentaries on each game and putting
   out one video per week on the american go association   s youtube
   channel. one of his biggest challenges in these videos, he says, is to
      attach stories    to alphago   s moves.

      generally the way humans learn go is that we have a story,    he points
   out.    that   s the way we communicate. it   s a very human thing.   

   after all, people can identify and discuss shapes and patterns. or we
   can argue with each other about the reasons a killer move won the game.
   take a basic example: when teaching beginners, a go instructor might
   point out an odd-looking formation of stones resembling a lion   s mouth
   or a tortoiseshell (among other patterns) and discuss how best to play
   in these situations. in theory, alphago could have something akin to
   that knowledge: a portion of its neural network might hypothetically be
      sounding an alarm,    so to speak, whenever that lion   s-mouth pattern
   appears on the board. but even if that were the case, alphago isn   t
   equipped to turn this sort of knowledge into any kind of a shareable
   story. so far, that task is one that still falls to people.
