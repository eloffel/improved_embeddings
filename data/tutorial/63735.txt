learning language representations for typology prediction

   code accompanying the paper learning language representations for
   typology prediction (to appear at emnlp 2017)

abstract

   one central mystery of neural nlp is what neural models ``know'' about
   their subject matter. when a id4 system learns
   to translate from one language to another, does it learn the syntax or
   semantics of the languages? can this knowledge be extracted from the
   system to fill holes in human scientific knowledge? existing
   typological databases contain relatively full feature specifications
   for only a few hundred languages. exploiting the existance of parallel
   texts in more than a thousand languages, we build a massive many-to-one
   id4 system from 1017 languages into english, and use this to predict
   information missing from typological databases. experiments show that
   the proposed method is able to infer not only syntactic, but also
   phonological and phonetic inventory features, and improves over a
   baseline that has access to information about the languages' geographic
   and phylogenetic neighbors.

   the uriel database is available at
   [79]http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/uriel.html

   after downloading and unzipping the above file, you may access the
   learned vectors as below:
import numpy as np
# language vectors
vecs = np.load("lang_vecs.npy")
vecs.item()['optsrc'+'fra']  # for french
vecs.item()['optsrc'+'ita']  # for italian

# language cell states
cell_states = np.load("lang_cell_states.npy")
cell_states.item()['fra'][0]  # for french
cell_states.item()['ita'][0]  # for italian
