id25 3.0

   this project contains the source code of id25 3.0, a lua-based deep
   id23 architecture, necessary to reproduce the
   experiments described in the paper [73]"human-level control through
   deep id23", nature 518, 529   533 (26 february 2015)
   doi:10.1038/nature14236.

   to replicate the experiment results, a number of dependencies need to
   be installed, namely:
     * luajit and torch 7.0
     * nngraph
     * xitari (fork of the arcade learning environment (bellemare et al.,
       2013))
     * alewrap (a lua interface to xitari)

   an install script for these dependencies is provided.

   two run scripts are provided: run_cpu and run_gpu. as the names imply,
   the former trains the id25 network using regular cpus, while the latter
   uses gpus (cuda), which typically results in a significant speed-up.

installation instructions

   the installation requires linux with apt-get.

   note: in order to run the gpu version of id25, you should additionally
   have the nvidia   cuda   (version 5.5 or later) toolkit installed prior
   to the torch installation below. this can be downloaded from
   [74]https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit and installation
   instructions can be found in
   [75]http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux

   to train id25 on atari games, the following components must be
   installed:
     * luajit and torch 7.0
     * nngraph
     * xitari
     * alewrap

   to install all of the above in a subdirectory called 'torch', it should
   be enough to run
./install_dependencies.sh

   from the base directory of the package.

   note: the above install script will install the following packages via
   apt-get: build-essential, gcc, g++, cmake, curl, libreadline-dev,
   git-core, libjpeg-dev, libpng-dev, ncurses-dev, imagemagick, unzip

training id25 on atari games

   prior to running id25 on a game, you should copy its rom in the 'roms'
   subdirectory. it should then be sufficient to run the script
./run_cpu <game name>

   or, if gpu support is enabled,
./run_gpu <game name>

   note: on a system with more than one gpu, id25 training can be launched
   on a specified gpu by setting the environment variable gpu_id, e.g. by
gpu_id=2 ./run_gpu <game name>

   if gpu_id is not specified, the first available gpu (id 0) will be used
   by default.

options

   options to id25 are set within run_cpu (respectively, run_gpu). you may,
   for example, want to change the frequency at which information is
   output to stdout by setting 'prog_freq' to a different value.
