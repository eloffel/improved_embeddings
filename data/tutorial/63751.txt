   climate [99]test coverage

   tslearn is a python package that provides machine learning tools for
   the analysis of time series. this package builds on scikit-learn, numpy
   and scipy libraries.

   if you would like to contribute to tslearn, please have a look at
   [100]our contribution guidelines.

dependencies

cython
numpy
scipy
scikit-learn

   if you plan to use the shapelets module, keras and tensorflow should
   also be installed.

installation

using conda

   the easiest way to install tslearn is probably via conda:
conda install -c conda-forge tslearn

using pypi

   using pip should also work fine:
pip install tslearn

using latest github-hosted version

   if you want to get tslearn's latest version, you can refer to the
   repository hosted at github:
pip install git+https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn.git

troubleshooting

   it seems on some platforms cython dependency does not install properly.
   if you experiment such an issue, try installing it with the following
   command:
pip install cython

   or (depending on your preferred python package manager):
conda install -c anaconda cython

   before you start installing tslearn.

documentation and api reference

   the documentation, including a gallery of examples, is hosted at
   [101]readthedocs.

already available

     * a generators module provides id93 generators
     * a datasets module provides access to the famous ucr/uea datasets
       through the ucr_uea_datasets class
     * a preprocessing module provides standard time series scalers
     * a metrics module provides:
          + dynamic time warping (dtw) (with sakoe-chiba band and itakura
            parallelogram variants)
          + lb_keogh
          + global alignment kernel
          + soft-dtw from cuturi and blondel
     * a neighbors module includes nearest neighbor algorithms to be used
       with time series
     * an id166 module includes support vector machine algorithms with:
          + standard kernels offered in sklearn (with adequate array
            reshaping done for you)
          + global alignment kernel
     * a id91 module includes the following time series id91
       algorithms:
          + standard euclidean id116 (with adequate array reshaping done
            for you)
               o based on tslearn.barycenters
          + dba id116 from petitjean et al.
               o based on tslearn.barycenters that offers dba facility
                 that could be used for other applications than just
                 id116
          + global alignment kernel id116
          + kshape id91 from paparizzos and gravano
          + soft-dtw id116 from cuturi and blondel
               o based on tslearn.barycenters that offers soft-dtw
                 barycenter computation
          + it also provides a way to compute the silhouette coefficient
            for given id91 and metric
     * a shapelets module includes an efficient implementation of the
       learning time-series method from grabocka et al.
          + warning: to use the shapelets module, two extra dependencies
            are required: keras and tensorflow
     * a piecewise module includes standard time series transformations,
       as well as the corresponding distances:
          + piecewise aggregate approximation (paa)
          + symbolic aggregate approximation (sax)
          + 1d-symbolic aggregate approximation (1d-sax)

todo list

   have a look [102]there for a list of suggested features. if you want
   other ml methods for time series to be added to this todo list, do not
   hesitate to open an issue! see [103]our contribution guidelines for
   more information about how to proceed.

acknowledgments

   authors would like to thank mathieu blondel for providing code for
   [104]kernel id116 and [105]soft-dtw (both distributed under bsd
   license) that are used in the id91 and metrics modules of this
   library.
