   at [12]untapt, all of our models involve natural language processing
   (nlp) in one way or another. our algorithms consider the natural,
   written language of our users    work experience and, based on real-world
   decisions that hiring managers have made, we can assign a id203
   that any given job applicant will be invited to interview for a given
   job opportunity.

   with the breadth and nuance of natural language that job-seekers
   provide, these are computationally complex problems. we have found deep
   learning approaches to be uniquely well-suited to solving them. deep
   learning algorithms:
    1. trivially include millions of model parameters that are free to
       interact non-linearly;
    2. can incorporate learning units designed specifically for use with
       sequential data, like natural language or financial time series
       data; and,
    3. are typically far more efficient in production environments than
       traditional machine learning approaches for nlp.

   to share my love of deep learning for nlp, i have created five hours of
   video tutorial content paired with [13]hands-on jupyter notebooks.
   following on from my acclaimed [14]deep learning with tensorflow
   livelessons, which introduced the fundamentals of artificial neural
   networks, my [15]deep learning for natural language processing
   livelessons similarly embrace interactivity and intuition, enabling you
   to rapidly develop a specialization in state-of-the-art nlp.

   operator characteristic curve

   these tutorials are for you if you   d like to learn how to:
     * preprocess natural language data for use in machine learning
       applications;
     * transform natural language into numerical representations (with
       [16]id97);
     * make predictions with deep learning models trained on natural
       language;
     * apply advanced nlp approaches with keras, the high-level tensorflow
       api; or
     * improve deep learning model performance by tuning hyperparameters.

   below is a summary of the topics covered over the course of my five
   deep learning for nlp lessons (full breakdown detailed in [17]my github
   repository):

   lesson one: introduction to deep learning for natural language
   processing
     * high-level overview of deep learning as it pertains to nlp
       specifically
     * how to train deep learning models on an nvidia gpu if you fancy
       quicker model-training times
     * summarize the key concepts introduced in my [18]deep learning with
       tensorflow livelessons, which serve as a foundation for the
       material introduced in these nlp-focused livelessons

   lesson two: word vectors
     * leverage demos to enable an intuitive understanding of vector-space
       embeddings of words, i.e., nuanced, quantitative representations of
       word meaning
     * discover resources for pre-trained word vectors as well as natural
       language data sets
     * create your own vector-space embeddings with id97, including
       bespoke, interactive visualizations of the resulting word vectors

   [1*5uxhqa0wo0u9d3aanpy7ww.png]
   word vectors enable meaning to be represented quantitatively, as
   illustrated here by jon krohn. the more similar the meaning of two
   words, the closer their representation in space, creating, e.g., a
   cluster of software languages, which here contains functional
   programming and object-oriented programming subclusters. another
   feature of word vectors is that their distance and direction in space
   maps to meaning: in this cartoon, the green vectors represent gender
   while the brown vectors represent country-capital relationships.

   lesson three: modelling natural language data
     * best practices for preprocessing natural language data
     * calculating the roc curve to evaluate the performance of
       classification models
     * pair vector-space embedding with the fundamentals of deep learning
       introduced in my [19]deep learning with tensorflow livelessons to
       build dense and convolutional neural networks for classifying
       documents by their sentiment

   [1*8ykezdqtbm1lpmvobcpkng.png]
   lesson 4.3 introduces long short-term memory units (lstms)

   lesson four: recurrent neural networks
     * provide an intuitive understanding of recurrent neural networks
       (id56s), which permit id26 through time over sequential
       data, such as natural language and financial time series data
     * develop familiarity with the long short-term memory (lstm) and
       gated recurrent unit (gru) varieties of id56s which provide markedly
       more productive modelling of sequential data
     * straightforwardly build lstm and gru deep learning architectures
       through the keras high-level api

   lesson five: advanced models
     * discover bidirectional-lstms, an especially potent lstm variant,
       then leverage them in practice
     * stack bidirectional-lstms to enable deep learning networks to model
       increasingly abstract representations of language
     * develop advanced data-modelling capabilities with non-sequential
       neural network architectures

   in january, i   ll be heading into the studio again to record my third
   set of lessons in this series; these will cover the exciting world of
   deep id23. to stay up-to-date, watch this space!
