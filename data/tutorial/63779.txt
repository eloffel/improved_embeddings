counter-fitting word vectors to linguistic constraints

   nikola mrk  i   ([76]nm480@cam.ac.uk)

   this repository contains the code and data for the method presented in
   [77]counter-fitting word vectors to linguistic constraints. the word
   vectors which achieve the (present) state of the art (0.74) on the
   siid113x-999 dataset are included in this repository, but can also be
   downloaded [78]here.

   ###configuring the tool

   the counter-fitting tool reads all the experiment config parameters
   from the experiment_parameters.id18 file in the root directory. an
   alternative config file can be provided as the first (and only)
   argument to counterfitting.py.

   the config file specifies:
     * the location of the initial word vectors [default:
       word_vectors/glove.txt]
     * the vocabulary to be used [default:
       lingustic_constraints/vocabulary.txt]
     * the sets of linguistic constraints to be injected into the vector
       space. the linguistic_constraints directory contains the synonymy
       (ppdb 2.0) and antonymy (id138 and ppdb 2.0) constraints used in
       our experiments.
     * optionally, one can also specify the location of a dialogue domain
       ontology (in the dstc format). this ontology will be used to infer
       additional antonymy constraints between slot values. the
       linguistic_constraints directory contains the two dialogue
       ontologies (dstc2, dstc3) used in our experiments.

   the config file also specifies the six hyperparameters of the
   counter-fitting procedure (set to their default values in
   experiment_parameters.id18).

   the results directory also contains the siid113x-999 dataset (hill et
   al., 2014), required to perform the evaluation.

   ###running experiments

   python counterfitting.py experiment_parameters.id18

   running the experiment loads the word vectors specified in the config
   file and counter-fits them to the provided linguistic constraints. the
   procedure prints the updated word vectors to the results directory as
   counter_fitted_vectors.txt (one word vector per line). the produced
   ranking and the gold standard ranking for the siid113x-999 pairs are also
   printed to the results directory.

   the word_vectors directory contains the (zipped) glove and
   paragram-300-sl999 vectors constrained to our vocabulary (these need to
   be unzipped before the experiments are run). the high-scoring vectors
   for siid113x-999 can also be found in
   word_vectors/counter-fitted-vectors.txt.zip (or reproduced by applying
   counter-fitting to paragram vectors).

   1995) constraints, please cite these papers. if you are using the
   provided pre-trained vectors, please cite (pennington et al., 2014) for
   glove vectors and (wieting et al., 2015) for paragram-sl-999 vectors.
