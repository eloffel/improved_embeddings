flickr personal taxonomies

   in addition to allowing users to organize content by tagging it with
   descriptive labels, several social media sites also allow users to
   organize content hierarchically within personal taxonomies. delicious,
   for example, lets users group related tags into bundles. flickr lets
   users group related photos into sets and related sets within
   collections.

  collections

   the figure below shows some of the collections created by a flickr
   user. these collections reflect her interest in the natural world.

  sets

   the plant pests collection is composed of several sets: plant
   parasites, sap suckers, plant eaters, caterpillars. the mushrooms &
   fungi collection is composed of sets: mushrooms, fungi, puffballs &
   shelf fungi, molds and rusts.

  photos

   individual sets contain images. figure below shows an image in the
   caterpillars set and an image in the mushrooms set and the tags user
   assigned to them.

  saplings

   we view collections and sets (nb collections can be grouped together
   within other collections) as defining a personal taxonomy a user
   created --- what we call a sapling. we represent saplings as shallow
   trees. notice that we split up composite child names. below are the
   saplings corresponding to the examples above.

folders

   table [1]anonym_folder contains saplings from 7,121 flickr users who
   belong to wildlife and nature photography public groups. this data has
   been anonymized, with user and folder ids replaced with unique
   integers. the hierarchical relations within a sapling are encoded as
   parent-->child relations, where a parent is a collection, and a child
   is a constituent set or another collection.
   schema of the anonym_folder table
     * u_id: anonymous user id
     * parent_compositeterm: name of the parent folder (stemmed)
     * parent_public_id: anonymous id of the parent folder
     * child_compositeterm: name of the child folder (stemmed)
     * child_public_id: anonymous id of the child folder

tags

   table [2]anonym_tag contains 7,656,031 tags created by users to
   annotate images within the sets. only 5,620 users tagged images within
   sets, and 63,997 sets contained tags. tags are propagated from sets to
   their parent collections.
   schema of the anonym_tag table
     * u_id: anonymous user id
     * stemmedtag: stemmed tag
     * freq: number of times this tag appears within the folder
     * setorcollection_fake_id: anonymous id of the folder (parent or
       child)

   the data is in zipped csv files that are password protected. the
   password is flickr_small

   only. if you use the data in a publication, please cite the above
