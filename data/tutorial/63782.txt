reinforcement-learning

   this repository contains code for id23 that i go on
   learning and implementing as i dwelve further into this field.

   this repository contains two major parts as of now -
     * sutton-book- implementation of codes from the [77]book by sutton
       and barto.
     * cs294-berkeley- assignment from the course on [78]deep
       id23 offered at berkeley
