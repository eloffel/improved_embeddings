id123 with tensorflow

   this repo hosts the code associated with my o'reilly article, "textual
   entailment with tensorflow: using neural networks to explore natural
   language," published on july 17, 2017.

   this article serves as an introduction to id123, a simple
   natural language processing machine learning task, and guides you
   through creating a model that will accomplish this task. in natural
   language processing, the task of id123 attempts to answer
   the question of whether, given one text that is accepted as truth,
   another text is true, false, or indeterminable. the article, with the
   help of the code contained within this notebook, uses textual
   entailment as a practical example of the uses of word vectorization,
   recurrence in neural networks, lstms, and dropout as a id173
   method.

requirements and installation

   in order to run this notebook, you'll need to install [73]tensorflow
   v1.0, [74]jupyter, [75]numpy, and [76]matplotlib.

   the notebook also uses [77]tqdm to display friendly progress bars
   during training.

   note: the first time you run this notebook, it will download the snli
   and glove datasets from stanford university. together these total just
   under 1 gigabyte of data and may take several minutes to download,
   depending on the speed of your connection. after the first run, the
   notebook will use local copies of the datasets cached on your machine.

   there are two easy ways to install these libraries and their
   dependencies:

option a: use the provided dockerfile configured for this notebook

    1. download and unzip [78]this entire repo from github, either
       interactively, or by entering
git clone https://github.com/steven-hewitt/entailment-with-tensorflow.git
    2. open your terminal and use cd to navigate into the top directory of
       the repo on your machine
    3. to build the dockerfile, enter
docker build -t entailment_dockerfile -f dockerfile .
       if you get a permissions error on running this command, you may
       need to run it with sudo:
sudo docker build -t entailment_dockerfile -f dockerfile .
    4. run docker from the dockerfile you've just built
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 entailment_dockerfile bash
       or
sudo docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 entailment_dockerfile bash
       if you run into permission problems.
    5. launch jupyter by entering
jupyter notebook
       and, using your browser, navigate to the url shown in the terminal
       output (usually [79]http://localhost:8888/)

option b: install anaconda python, tensorflow, and tqdm manually

   numpy can be tricky to install manually, so we recommend using the
   managed anaconda python distribution, which includes numpy, matplotlib,
   and jupyter in a single installation. the docker-based method above is
   much easier, but if you have a compatible nvidia gpu, manual
   installation makes it possible to use gpu acceleration to speed up
   training.
    1. follow the [80]installation instructions for anaconda python. we
       recommend using python 3.6.
    2. follow the platform-specific [81]tensorflow installation
       instructions. be sure to follow the "installing with anaconda"
       process, and create a conda environment named tensorflow.
    3. if you aren't still inside your conda tensorflow environment, enter
       it by typing
source activate tensorflow
    4. install tqdm by entering
pip install tqdm
    5. download and unzip [82]this entire repo from github, either
       interactively, or by entering
git clone https://github.com/steven-hewitt/entailment-with-tensorflow.git
    6. use cd to navigate into the top directory of the repo on your
       machine
    7. launch jupyter by entering
jupyter notebook
       and, using your browser, navigate to the url shown in the terminal
       output (usually [83]http://localhost:8888/)
