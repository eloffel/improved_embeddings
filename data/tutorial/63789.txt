simple training

   train your model by just typing lumi train. do it locally or using
   luminoth's built-in google cloud platform support to train in the
   cloud.

   once training is done, you can use our tensorboard integration to
   visualize progress and intermediate results. also, evaluate using
   different data splits.

understand results

   the ability to visualize results is always important and more so in the
   id161 field. after training a model you can get an easy to
   understand summary and image visualizations to spot results, using
   either our ui where you can adjust the id203 threshold on the
   fly, or the command line interface.

talks

   since the release of the library, the luminoth core team has been
   invited to talk about deep learning for id164 in several
   events. the talks outlined the challenges, inner workings and learnings
   from building a toolkit.

   find next a talk titled "building an id164 toolkit with
   tensorflow: from academic papers to open source implementation". it was
   hosted by alan descoins (tryolabs cto) and javier rey (tryolabs lead
   research engineer) and given at the [10]odsc london.
