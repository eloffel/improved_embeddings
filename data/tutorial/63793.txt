deeplearning.ai courses notes

   this repository contains my personal notes and summaries on
   [89]deeplearning.ai specialization courses. i've enjoyed every little
   bit of the course hope you enjoy my notes too.

   [90]deeplearning.ai contains five courses which can be taken on
   [91]coursera. the five courses titles are:
    1. neural networks and deep learning.
    2. improving deep neural networks: hyperparameter tuning,
       id173 and optimization.
    3. structuring machine learning projects.
    4. convolutional neural networks.
    5. sequence models.

   this is by far the best course series on deep learning that i've taken.
   enjoy!

about this specialization (from the official deep learning specialization
page)

     if you want to break into ai, this specialization will help you do
     so. deep learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in
     tech. we will help you become good at deep learning.

     in five courses, you will learn the foundations of deep learning,
     understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead
     successful machine learning projects. you will learn about
     convolutional networks, id56s, lstm, adam, dropout, batchnorm,
     xavier/he initialization, and more. you will work on case studies
     from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music
     generation, and natural language processing. you will master not
     only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. you
     will practice all these ideas in python and in tensorflow, which we
     will teach.

     you will also hear from many top leaders in deep learning, who will
     share with you their personal stories and give you career advice.

     ai is transforming multiple industries. after finishing this
     specialization, you will likely find creative ways to apply it to
     your work.

     we will help you master deep learning, understand how to apply it,
     and build a career in ai.

specialization certificate

   at last i've successfully completed the specialization and earned my
   [92]certificate!

   a good facebook group that discusses the courses are here:
   [105]https://www.facebook.com/groups/deeplearningaispecialization/.

   group description:

     this group is for current, past or future students of prof andrew
     ng's deeplearning.ai class in coursera. the purpose is for students
     to get to know each other, ask questions, and share insights.
     however, remember the coursera honor code - please do not post any
     solution in the forum!

next steps

   taking [106]fast.ai courses series as it focuses more on the practical
   works.
