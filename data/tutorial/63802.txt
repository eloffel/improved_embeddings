dynamic routing between capsules - pytorch implementation

   pytorch implementation of nips 2017 paper [77]dynamic routing between
   capsules from sara sabour, nicholas frosst and geoffrey e. hinton.

   the hyperparameters and data augmentation strategy strictly follow the
   paper.

requirements

   only [78]pytorch with torchvision is required (tested on pytorch 0.2.0
   and 0.3.0). jupyter and matplotlib is required to run the notebook with
   visualizations.

usage

   train the model by running
python net.py

   optional arguments and default values:
  --batch-size n          input batch size for training (default: 128)
  --test-batch-size n     input batch size for testing (default: 1000)
  --epochs n              number of epochs to train (default: 250)
  --lr lr                 learning rate (default: 0.001)
  --no-cuda               disables cuda training
  --seed s                random seed (default: 1)
  --log-interval n        how many batches to wait before logging training
                          status (default: 10)
  --routing_iterations    number of iterations for routing algorithm (default: 3
)
  --with_reconstruction   should reconstruction layers be used

   mnist dataset will be downloaded automatically.

results

   the network trained with reconstruction and 3 routing iterations on
   mnist dataset achieves 99.65% accuracy on test set. the test loss is
   still slightly decreasing, so the accuracy could probably be improved
   with more training and more careful learning rate schedule.

visualizations

   we can create visualizations of digit reconstructions from digitcaps
   (e.g. figure 3 in the paper)

   [79]reconstructions

   we can also visualize what each dimension of digit capsule represents
   (section 5.1, figure 4 in the paper).

   below, each row shows the reconstruction when one of the 16 dimensions
   in the digitcaps representation is tweaked by intervals of 0.05 in the
   range [   0.25, 0.25].

   [80]perturbations

   we can see what individual dimensions represent for digit 7, e.g. dim6
   - stroke thickness, dim11 - digit width, dim 15 - vertical shift.

   visualization examples are provided in a [81]jupyter notebook
