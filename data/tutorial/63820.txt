researchcyc

   cycorp is pleased to offer the cyc software and knowledgebase at no
   cost to the research community.

   as of release 1.1, the complete (non-proprietary) content of the cyc
   knowledge base is being made available to the research community (for
   research-only purposes) under a researchcyc license. yes, cyc, the
   world   s largest and most complete general knowledge base and
   commonsense reasoning engine, is at your disposal!

   the cyc platform

   cyc can be used as the basis for a wide variety of intelligent
   applications such as :
     * information extraction and concept tagging
     * content/knowledge management
     * business intelligence
     * support of analysis tasks
     * semantic database integration
     * natural language understanding and generation
     * rapid ontology and taxonomy development
     * learning and knowledge acquisition
     * game ais
     * decision supports and workflow management
     * filtering, prioritizing, routing, summarization, and annotating of
       electronic communications

       to name just a few.

   the latest release of cyc includes:
     * 630,000+ concepts, forming an ontology in the domain of human
       consensus reality.
     * over 7,000,000 assertions (facts and rules), using 38,000+
       relations, that interrelate, constrain, and, in effect, (partially)
       define the concepts.
     * a compiled version of the cyc id136 engine and the cyc
       knowledge base browser.
     * natural language parsers and cycl-to-english generation functions.
     * a natural language query tool, enabling users to specify powerful,
       flexible queries without the need to understand formal logic or
       complex id99s.
     * an ontology exporter that makes it simple to export specified
       portions of the knowledge base to owl files.
     * documentation and self-paced learning materials to help users
       achieve a basic- to intermediate-level understanding of the issues
       of id99 and application development using cyc.
     * a specification of cycl, the language in which cyc (and hence
       researchcyc) is written. there are cycl-to-lisp, cycl-to-c, etc.
       translators.
     * a specification of the cyc api, by calling which a programmer can
       build an researchcyc application.

   if you already have a researchcyc license, see [20]researchcyc releases
