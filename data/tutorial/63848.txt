   the new paper [11]dynamic routing between capsules is the first
   published technical description of id22, a neural net
   approach which hinton has been [12]hinting at for at least five years.

   many discussions of the paper focus on a big picture view of how
   id22 are improvements over standard neural nets: they
   represent more nuanced part-whole relationships at each layer by using
   vectors in place of scalars. the idea is that a vector can model the
      pose    of an entity, and entities with similar poses belong together.
   as an analogy: if you see two eyes, a mouth, and nose in a particular
   spacial relationship and oriented in the same direction, that   s pretty
   good evidence for a face with the same orientation. standard
   convolutional neural nets are capable of modeling similar
   relationships. but they do so less compactly, with a larger number of
   parameters or layers (and with less ability to generalize, the paper
   argues).

   to get a better feel for exactly what id22 compute, i made
   a diagram of the capsule-to-capsule connections in the paper. this
   diagram is intended for those who have read the paper and are looking
   for a summary reference image.
