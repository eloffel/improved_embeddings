   tensorflow.js is a library for developing and training ml models in
   javascript, and deploying in browser or on node.js
   [70]see tutorials

   tutorials show you how to use tensorflow.js with complete, end-to-end
   examples.
   [71]see the guide

   guides explain the concepts and components of tensorflow.js.
   [72]see demos

   live demos and examples run in your browser using tensorflow.js.

   how it works
   run existing models

   use off-the-shelf javascript models or convert python tensorflow models
   to run in the browser or under node.js.
     * [73]use official tensorflow.js models
     * [74]convert python models

   retrain existing models

   retrain pre-existing ml models using your own data.
   [75]use id21 to customize models
   develop ml with javascript

   build and train models directly in javascript using flexible and
   intuitive apis.
   [76]get started with tensorflow.js
