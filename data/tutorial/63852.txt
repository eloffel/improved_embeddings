introduction to altair     a declarative visualization library in python

   [99]shubham jain, december 4, 2017

introduction

   visualization is one of the most exciting parts of data science.
   plotting huge amounts of data to unveil underlying relationships has
   its own fun.

   whether you   re identifying relationships between features or simply
   understanding the working of a model, visualizations are usually the
   best way to go about it. visualizations also help explain your work to
   your customers and stakeholders.

   python provides a lot of libraries, specifically for plotting and
   visualization and i usually have a tough time picking out which one to
   use for my problem statement.

   i recently come across with altair, a visualization library in python
   and i was amazed by its capabilities. it is a very user-friendly
   library which actually performs a lot of things with the minimal amount
   of code.

   please note that altair is still in development phase, so things might
   change over time. we can still do a lot of exciting work on it and the
   future potential really excites me     hence this article!

   so, let   s get started.

         1. what is altair?
         2. installation
    2. exploring a real world problem
    3. pros and cons
    4. end notes


1. overview of altair

1.1 what is altair?

     altair is a declarative statistical visualization library in python,
     based on [100]vega-lite .

   i am sure many of you would be asking these two questions by now:
     * what is meant by declarative?
     * why is another library required for visualization?

   by declarative, we mean that while plotting any chart, you only need to
   declare links between data columns to the encoding channels, such as
   x-axis, y-axis, colour, etc. and rest all of the plot details are
   handled automatically. let   s understand it by an example.

   take a look at the plot below and above that is the code required for
   generating that plot in altair.

   so, if you notice, we just mentioned x,y and color and rest of the
   things like legend, axis labels, range etc. all are automatically set.

   now, take a look at the image below which is the matplotlib
   implementation of the same visualization we previously did with altair.


   here, we need to explicitly use groupby function, define axis names,
   legends etc. which becomes a lot of extra work while you are doing an
   exploratory analysis.

   therefore being declarative makes altair simple, friendly and
   consistent. it produces beautiful and effective visualizations with the
   minimal amount of code. therefore you can spend more time understanding
   your data rather than spending your time on setting the legends,
   defining axes and so on.

   i suppose by now you must have got the answer to the second question
   also.


1.2 installation

   altair can be installed via conda as follows:
 conda install altair --channel conda-forge

   or we can also install it via pip with the following:
 pip install altair
 pip install --upgrade notebook

   great, now you have altair installed on your system. i always feel that
   the best way to learn a library is to practice it on a real-life
   problem. so, without any further delay, let us quickly begin!


2. exploring a real world problem

   for this purpose, i am using [101]the big mart sales dataset. download
   the training file and load it into your working environment.

   in the data set, we have product wise sales for multiple outlets of a
   chain.  let   s take a look at the dataset.


2.1 understanding the dataset

df = pd.read_csv('/users/shubhamjain/downloads/av/big mart/train.csv')
df.head()

   the total data frame consists of 12 columns, out of which 7 are
   categorical and rest are numerical. here, we have item_outlet_sales as
   the target feature.

   note: i have only used the first 1000 rows, just to provide you with
   the sense of different plots using altair.


2.2 histograms

   during the exploration journey, we generally start with the univariate
   analysis using histograms.

   so, let   s start with the item_outlet_sales feature, by plotting its
   histogram using altair.
chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
 x('item_outlet_sales',bin=true),
 y('count(*):q'),
)

   to understand the code, let   s understand some basic terminologies, to
   begin with.
     * chart: it is the basic fundamental object in altair, which takes
       data frame as the single argument.
     * mark: it is an attribute to visualize your data points from the
       chart object. there are different forms of mark objects as shown
       below.

   here, we have shown bar mark in order to visualization our data points
   as a bar chart.
     * encode: it is a function which helps in mapping with different
       features from the data with the visualization. you can define
       features for the x-axis, y-axis, color etc.
     * export as png: you can directly download and save the plot by using
       this link.

   above defined are the common parameters which are used in every altair
   visualization. let   s take a look at some specific attributes which are
   used in the above code.
     * bin: it is set true to discretized a continuous feature, in order
       to produce a bar plot.
     * count: it is a data transformation parameter, which is provided by
       altair in order to customize our plots. we can also use other
       parameters like max, min, average, etc.
     * q: here, q denotes that the count will a quantitative feature. we
       can also use n for nominal data or o for ordinal data.

   that was seriously very difficult to grasp after reading it for the
   first time. but, surely we will get hands-on it by the end of this
   article.

   okay, now if you look at the above chart, the label for x-axis is not
   defined properly by the altair, and we wish to change it. you can do
   this by defining another parameter called axis.
chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
 x('item_outlet_sales',bin=true, axis= axis(title='item_outlet_sales (in bins)')
),
 y('count(*):q'),
)

   it comes out to be a right-skewed distribution for the sales in our
   dataset. if i wish to do the same visualization using matplotlib, the
   implementation is shown below.

   you may consider the above code simple, but the visualization obtained
   from altair is far more appealing than the one obtained from
   matplotlib.

   we can also change the color of the histogram in altair by simply
   adding a color attribute.
chart(df).mark_bar(color='lightblue').encode(
 x('item_outlet_sales',bin=true, axis= axis(title='item_outlet_sales (in bins)')
),
 y('count(*):q'),
)


2.3 scatterplot

   now, let   s try to do some bivariate analysis using altair.

   now, let us look at the relationship between mrp and sales features.
chart(df).mark_point().encode(
 x='item_mrp',
 y='item_outlet_sales',
)

   we can clearly see a linear relationship between mrp and sales in the
   above plot. let   s introduce some other encoding of altair in order to
   draw more id136s from the visualizations.
chart(df).mark_point().encode(
 x='item_mrp',
 y='item_outlet_sales',
 color='outlet_type'
)

   here, we have defined another encoding called color, which is used to
   differentiate the data points and helps us to understand the
   relationship better.

   we can see that the sales for the grocery stores are pretty low as
   compared to sales in supermarkets, where supermarket type3 showing the
   highest sales.

   to draw more information from the above plot, let   s add another
   encoding called row.
chart(df).mark_point().encode(
 x='item_mrp',
 y='item_outlet_sales',
 color='item_weight',
 row='outlet_type'
).configure_cell(width=300, height=150)


   so, we can now notice that items in supermarket type 1 have
   comparatively more weight than the grocery store and supermarket type
   2.

   these were different variates of scatter plot that can be drawn using
   the altair. let   s now look at some barplot charts to do some bivariate
   analysis.


2.4 stacked bar plot

   for this, let   s look at the relationship between outlet_location_type
   and size of the outlet.
chart(df).mark_bar(stacked='normalize').encode(
 y('outlet_location_type'),
 x('count(*):q', sort='descending'),
 color('outlet_size:n')
)

   above drawn is the stacked bar plot, which denotes that the outlets in
   tier 2 cities only have outlets of small size, while only tier 3 cities
   have outlets which are high in size.

   notice that here we have defined the count aggregator in the x
   encoding, in order to produce a horizontal stack chart.


2.5 line chart

   now, let us look at the price of the item across the years. generally,
   for the time series related visualizations, we prefer the use of line
   charts which is provided by altair by using the line mark.

   altair supports date and discretization of dates when setting the type
   of it as temporal (t).
chart(df).mark_line().encode(
 x('outlet_establishment_year:t', timeunit='year'),
 y('item_mrp:q', aggregate='mean'),
)

   notice: here, we have separately defined our transformation using the
   aggregate attribute.


2.6 heatmap

   altair provides another type of chart known as heat map, which uses
   text mark attribute.
chart(df).mark_text(applycolortobackground=true).encode(
 row('outlet_type:n'),
 column('outlet_size:n'),
 color('mean(item_outlet_sales):q', sort='descending'),
 text('mean(item_outlet_sales):q')
)

   similarly, you can draw more patterns in data by this and you can also
   try some other data transformations and plots to find various trends
   and relationships between features.

   note that, altair is currently in the development phase and sooner it
   will include more and better visualizations in the coming time.


3. pros and cons

   pros:
    1. it is simple and produces more beautiful and effective
       visualizations.
    2. the framework of code remains the same, i.e., just by changing the
       mark attribute you can produce different plots.
    3. data transformations like using count, min, max aggregator
       functions, is great to have in order to understand your data
       better.

   cons:
    1. it doesn   t produce interactive visualizations like bokeh or d3.js
    2. some of the major plots like boxplot are missing from altair.


4. end notes

   i hope that you had a fun time learning this new library where you can
   do a lot of things with the minimal amount of code. so, try using it
   yourself on the dataset you are working on, and share your experience
   or doubts in the comment section below.

   i would also recommend you to once the visit the [102]gallery page of
   the altair documentation for getting more idea about the type of
   visualizations possible using altair.

       nice article on altair and thank you for bringing up something that
       is still under production and explaining it extremely well.

       piqued my interest but right before the first example you should
       have shown how you are importing altair. for example, altair.chart,
       altair.x, and altair.y are all classes.
       sometimes it   s nice to do detective work like this on our own as
       readers but when it   s a tutorial-style post, it   s not very smooth
       for the reader whose interested in getting started. my 2 cents.
