artificial intelligence demystified

   [96]guest blog, december 23, 2016

introduction

   artificial intelligence has become a very popular term today. there is
   sure to be at least one article in the newspaper daily on the
   revolutionary advancements made in the field. but, there seems to be
   some confusion about what ai really is.

   is it robotics? will the terminator movie actually come true? or is it
   something that has crept into our daily lives without us even realizing
   it?

   this article will give you a broad understanding on the buzzwords
   associated with ai, its applications, the careers & opportunities it
   has and its future.

   [fi.jpg]

what is artificial intelligence?

   artificial intelligence is simply the ability of a computer to exhibit
      intelligence   . this intelligence can either mimic human intelligence
   or observe real world problems and intelligently find solutions for it.


10 major milestones in the history of ai

   [image-1.png]

   did you know? chef watson- a part of ibm   s watson program-can now cook
   for you! this ai cooking app uses algorithms to choose a quirky set of
   ingredients (this can be done by the user too) and comes up with the
   perfect recipe. so, bon app  tit!


buzzwords associated with ai

1. machine learning

   machine learning is a field in data science, where machines can    learn   
   themselves, without being explicitly programmed by humans. by analyzing
   past data called    training data   , the machine learning model forms
   patterns and uses these patterns to learn and make future predictions.
   the precision of predictions made using ml models has been increasing
   every day.

the 5 steps in the machine learning process

   [image-2.png]

machine learning techniques

   machine learning is used in practically every field these days, even
   though some of the uses may not always be very obvious. the main
   techniques of machine learning are:
     * classification: based on training data having observations with
       known categories, classification predicts the category to which a
       new observation belongs. eg: predicting whether the price of a
       house would fall under which class- very costly, costly,
       affordable, cheap or very cheap.
     * regression: predicting a value from a continuous data set. eg:
       predicting the price of a house based on various factors such as
       location, size, time of buying, etc.
     * id91: assigning a set of observations into subsets
       (i.e.clusters) so that the observations in the same cluster are
       similar in some sense. eg: netflix (an online movie company) having
       different clusters of viewers, where people with similar viewing
       habits fall in the same cluster.
     * id126s: uses ml algorithms to help users find new
       products / services based on data of the user or product / service.
       eg: netflix recommending you a certain movie based on watching
       patterns of the people in your cluster or amazon suggesting you
       products based on popularity

     * anomaly detection: identifying observations that do not conform to
       an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. eg: an outlier
       (i.e. an anomaly) in credit card transactions could be a potential
       banking fraud.
     * id84: the process of reducing the number of
       random variables under consideration to obtain a set of variables
       that are significant.

types of machine learning

   [image-3.jpg]

popular machine learning algorithms

   today, machine learning is probably the most important field in ai.
   hence, several machine learning algorithms have been devised each
   solving a particular type of problem. each algorithm falls into one of
   the 3 types of learning. the most popular machine learning algorithms
   are :
    1. id75
    2. id28
    3. support vector machines
    4. id90
    5. id79
    6. id158s
    7. id116 id91
    8. k-nearest neighbour
    9. naive bayes classifier
   10. id108

   did you know? a scottish cartoonist has taken machine learning to an
   all new level by creating an intelligent program that can write scripts
   for    friends   ! through gathering big data (dialogues from all the 10
   seasons) and using recurrent neural networks, he could create all-new
   episodes for this popular sitcom series!


2. deep learning

what is deep learning?

   deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is producing
   life-changing results. deep learning means neural networks with a large
   number of hidden layers. it is an attempt to replicate the functioning
   of a human brain. just like the exact functioning of a human brain is
   unknown, not much is known about the exact working of deep learning
   too. it is like a black box, i.e. where the input and output can be
   seen and are known, but the internal working is a mystery!
   interestingly, data scientists believe that if we crack the working of
   deep nets, we will be closer to understanding how a human brain works!


where & how is deep learning used?

   today, deep learning has applications in natural language processing,
   image recognition (explained in the later section), spam filtering,
   fraud detection, etc. this is just a fraction of what deep learning can
   do! google   s search engine, facebook   s photo tagging feature, baidu   s
   id103     all involve deep learning behind the scenes. as
   these companies invest more and more in this area, the advancements in
   the field are mind-boggling!

   1. google: apart from optimizing search results, google uses deep
   learning in a variety of immensely vital but slightly lesser-known
   fields. google brain and google deepmind, the two brainchildren of
   google are working quite furiously to achieve greater heights in ai.
   google has been actively researching and exploring virtually all
   aspects of machine learning, including deep learning and more classical
   algorithms.

   alphago, a project of google   s deepmind, is perhaps one of the most
   popular breakthroughs in deep learning. go is a game of stones on-board
   where you try to make points of territory. it   s a game of intense
   complexity- it is 10^100 times more complex than chess! the algorithm
   in alpha-go combines monte-carlo tree search with deep neural networks
   and uses id23 approach to better its result.

   how alphago works: alphago is built using two different neural-network
      brains    that cooperate to choose its moves. these brains are
   multi-layer neural networks which are almost identical in structure to
   the ones used for classifying pictures for image search engines like
   google image search. they start with several hierarchical layers of 2d
   filters that process a go board position just like the way an
   image-classifying network processes an image. roughly speaking, these
   filters identify patterns and shapes. after this filtering, 13
   fully-connected neural network layers produce judgments about the
   position they see. broadly, these layers perform classification or
   logical reasoning.

   the networks are trained by repeatedly checking their results and
   feeding back corrections that adjust the numbers to make the network
   perform better. this process has a large element of randomness, so it   s
   impossible to know exactly how the network does its    thinking   , only
   that it tends to improve after more training.

   did you know? in march 2016, alphago beat the legendary go player-lee
   sedol-with a score of 4-1, a feat previously believed to be at least a
   decade away.


   2. facebook: facebook ai research (fair) focuses on using deep learning
   to improve the social networking experience. fb is trying to build more
   than 1.5 billion ai agents, one agent for every facebook user. the
   social media giant formed the applied machine learning team called
   fblearner flow. it combines several machine learning models to process
   several billion data points drawn from the activities of its 1.5
   billion users to make predictions about user behaviour and keep them
   glued to facebook for hours!

   for example: the algorithms created from fblearner flow   s models help
   to define your news feed, the advertisements you see, the people you
   may know and many more!

   therefore, in the ai war between facebook and google, there isn   t a
   winner, as the research concentrations and applications are quite
   different in nature.


3. natural language processing

   natural language processing is the process by which computers translate
   human language into a language that the computer can understand. siri,
   cortana and alexa are all examples of nlp that we use every day. so how
   does artificial intelligence fit into nlp? here   s how. consider this.
   you want to learn a new language. how do you go about doing so? you
   start by learning new words in the language and understanding the
   usage. but, you will not really understand what works and what doesn   t,
   unless you are exposed to the language and learn from the usage. this
   is exactly how deep learning is used in nlp. the computer    learns    by
   using a technique called    embeddings   , which deep learning implements.
   in this technique, words and phrases are mapped to vectors of real
   numbers. this mapping is carried out by neural networks.


how does siri use natural language processing?

   nlp forms the heart and soul of siri. when a user asks siri something,
   the sequence of actions taking place is as follows. through voice
   recognition, siri first uses a discretization algorithm to turn your
   voice into digital data. next, your question is routed through apple
   servers, and a flowchart is run on it to find a possible solution. this
   step is easy enough for simple sentences like    what is the weather like
   today?   . but it becomes difficult when sentences like    will larry be
   attending the meeting today?    are asked because it is quite difficult
   for a machine to understand such a complex thought process. this is
   where nlp comes into play. nlp breaks the command down into tokens and
   uses syntactic analyzers to parse through and understand the sentence.
   in addition to this, machine learning algorithms are used to optimize
   the results and learn from the past results. finally, the results are
   produced to the user.

   did you know? robots can now socialize! kismet, an emotionally
   intelligent robot from mit   s ai lab affective computing experiment, can
   interact by recognizing human body language and voice tone.


4. pattern recognition

   as the name suggests, pattern recognition is a part of artificial
   intelligence which deals with recognizing patterns in data. it   s used
   for quality and process control. applications includes self-driving
   cars, neuroscience, cancer treatment and energy physics.


how do self-driving cars use pattern recognition?

   the much talked about    self-driving cars    collects and analyzes big
   data from sensors and maps to identify pedestrians, vehicles and other
   objects based on their shape, size and pattern. after predicting what
   all the objects around it might do next, it is then designed to safely
   drive around them. the technologies used are radar, lidar, gps,
   odometry, and id161.


how energy physics uses pattern recognition?

   it is used to associate the energy depositions in a multi-component,
   non-magnetic high-energy particle detector. higgs detection is a great
   example of pattern recognition in particle-physics.

   did you know? self-driving cars have many versions. google has removed
   steering wheels and pedals and is improving on the different levels of
   autonomy that can be achieved. whereas, tesla and baidu are making
   advancements in this technology by slowly adding autonomous features
   that enable efficient driving in different environments. tesla has come
   up with a conventional car having autopilot (i.e. self-driving)
   capabilities at a safety level which is much greater than that of a
   human driver.


4. image analysis

   image analysis involves extracting meaningful information from images.
   the idea is to imitate the human visual cortex using machine learning
   algorithms like neural networks. handwriting recognition, automatic
   image recognition and geomorphologic (form or surface features of the
   earth or another celestial body) terrain feature classification are
   some popular forms.

   the id163 challenge is a competition started in 2010. here research
   teams submit programs that classify and detect objects and scenes.
   since then, there has been excellent progress in image processing. in
   2010, a good visual recognition program had around 40% classification
   error rate. in 2015, a deep convolutional neural net program for image
   recognition had about a 3.5% classification error rate!


how facebook uses image analysis?

   image analysis forms a big part of facebook   s auto-tagging feature. a
   facial recognition software is used to detect the categories of users   
   friends to match the newly uploaded pictures with the ones that have
   been tagged elsewhere. this software uses machine learning algorithms
   like neural nets. the algorithm is fed with large amounts of training
   data and the machine then learns to classify and recognize people in
   the uploaded images and suggests to you friends who could be there with
   you in the photo. so facebook is heavily investing in ai. they recently
   acquired faciometrics, a facial image analysis start-up-to delve deeper
   into ai research.

   these are the just some of the main advantages and applications of ai.
   the field is huge and has a lot more to this!


careers and opportunities in ai

   until a few years ago, artificial intelligence was mainly used by the
   military and the government with the help of a select few professionals
   in the field. but now more and more people are educating themselves and
   are becoming proficient in the field. they are now realizing the
   improvement that ai can make in a business. today, ai is used
   practically in every field. some of the possible career opportunities
   in ai include-
     * artificial general intelligence : in the hierarchy, this profession
       would be placed right on top. companies like deepmind are working
       on this field. generally, impeccable phd candidates that have a
       stellar research background are chosen.
     * data scientist : data science is probably the most sought-after
       profession in artificial intelligence. the plus point here is that
       it doesn   t have a learning curve that is too steep. machine
       learning forms the heart of data science. people wanting to join
       the field must learn statistics, some programming and obtain domain
       knowledge.
     * data mining and analysis : after a data scientist, a data analyst
       is probably the most popular job. similar to a data scientist, an
       analyst however places lesser emphasis on statistics. hence, most
       people with diverse backgrounds, with a strong desire and ability
       to learn could apply for these jobs.
     * machine learning researcher : a field that probably not many
       outside the computer science and electrical background could
       handle. in fact, without a phd, even a computer scientist would be
       quite handicapped here! it involves discovering new areas in
       machine learning to deal with an uncharted territory of complex
       problems. the job primarily involves a lot of research.
     * machine learning application : this involves applying machine
       learning effectively to areas where it is already being used. a
       graduate or a master   s student could apply for these jobs.

   while there are many other ai jobs, these are the most talked about
   ones under a broad umbrella. this is a wonderful time for anyone to
   start working in ai. the field is just getting started. even if you are
   a beginner, learning new things every day and scaling up is the key.


the future of ai

   artificial intelligence is undoubtedly changing the world. it is making
   lives easier. but, as the efficiency of ai increases, so does the
   growing concern that it is changing the world too much, with the fear
   that machine intelligence would soon surpass human intelligence. the
   fear that the terminator and matrix (movies on ai) will become a
   reality is increasing too. so, to what extent are these fears
   warranted? is there any truth to them at all?

   ominously, the answer is yes. don   t get us wrong. we don   t mean that
   there will be a machine uprising in the near future making humans
   obsolete, an inferior species. as of now, artificial general
   intelligence is a myth. it does not exist. ai still does not have the
   human cognitive abilities and may not so in the near future. but, we
   cannot entirely write off the possibility of this happening. it is
   certainly possible, even if it is very unlikely. maybe in a few
   decades, or by the end of this century or many centuries later.
   artificial general intelligence and superintelligence could become a
   reality.

   superintelligence is the ability of a machine to seaid113ssly perform
   every task that a human can perform, and better! thanks to their
   perfect recall (computers have an eidetic memory as opposed to humans),
   and ability to multitask, they will fare far better than humans at
   practically everything. the book    superintelligence: paths, dangers,
   strategies    by nick bostrom talks about exactly this- superintelligence
   as a possible concept.


does ai have the power to automate you?

   recently, there has been a lot of talk around ai automating humans and
   disrupting millions of jobs. as of now, machines are good at tasks that
   involve big data and a great amount of iteration. machines don   t have
   intuition and can   t match humans    ability to take decisions in tricky
   situations.

   example- machines can analyse huge amounts of data far more accurately
   and quickly than a human can, but the final decision that a data
   scientist is always a mix of data and intuition, which comes with
   experience.


end notes

   ai has been surrounded by quite a lot of controversy. on one hand,
   companies (not only limited to tech giants) are investing millions in
   ai research and development. on the other hand, stephen hawking has
   voiced his concern that ai could be the end of mankind. elon musk &
   bill gates have also agreed with this.

   however, in the debate of ai being a boon or a bane, we believe boon
   will always win. this isn   t because we are being ignorant about the
   catastrophic situations that will unfold if superintelligence is
   achieved. it is because steps are already being taken to prevent the
   potential hazards ai may bring along with it. ai   s progress will
   continue only if it is in alignment with general human interest. so,
   don   t fear it! go ahead and just enjoy the revolution.

   so which camp do you belong to? the pro-ai camp or the ai-against one?
   do you think ai will disrupt more jobs than it actually creates? we
   would love to hear your opinion.
