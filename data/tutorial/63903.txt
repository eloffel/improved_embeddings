adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems (emnlp
2017)

   this repository contains code for the paper:

     adversarial examples for evaluating reading comprehension systems.
     robin jia and percy liang
     empirical methods in natural language processing (emnlp), 2017.

   note: to download our adversarial data, view all of our experiments,
   and find instructions for running adversarial evaluation on your own
   squad model, please see [85]our codalab worksheet. this git repository
   just exposes the code that was used to generate some of the files on
   that codalab worksheet.

dependencies

   run pull-dependencies.sh to pull squad data, glove vectors, stanford
   corenlp, and some custom python utilities. other python requirements
   are in requirements.txt.

examples

   the following sequence of commmands generates the raw addsent training
   data described in section 4.6 of our paper.
mkdir out
# precompute nearby words in word vector space; takes roughly 1 hour
python src/py/find_squad_nearby_words.py glove/glove.6b.100d.txt -n 100 -f data/
squad/train-v1.1.json > out/nearby_n100_glove_6b_100d.json
# run corenlp on the squad training data; takes roughly 1 hour, uses ~18gb memor
y
python src/py/convert_questions.py corenlp -d train
# actually generate the raw addsent examples; takes roughly 7 minutes, uses ~15g
b memory
python src/py/convert_questions.py dump-highconf -d train -q

   the final script will generate three files with prefix
   train-convhighconf in the out directory, including
   train-convhighconf.json. train-convhighconf-mturk.tsv is in a format
   that can be processed by scripts in the mturk directory.

   other one-off scripts are described in their docstrings.
