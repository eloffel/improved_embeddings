introduction to computational linguistics and dependency trees in data
science

   [97]shivam bansal, december 14, 2017

introduction

   in recent years, the amalgam of deep learning fundamentals with natural
   language processing techniques has shown a great improvement in the
   information mining tasks on unstructured text data.

   the models are now able to recognize natural language and speech
   comparable to human levels. despite such improvements, discrepancies in
   the results still exist as sometimes the information is coded very deep
   in the syntaxes and syntactic structures of the corpus.

example     problem with neural networks

   for example, a conversation system which is trained using recurrent
   neural network produces the following results in two scenarios:

   user: hi, i took a horrible picture in a museum, can you tell where is
   it located?
   bot reply 1: the museum is located at a horrible place

   user: hi, i took a horrible picture in a museum, can you tell where is
   it located?
   bot reply 2: the horrible museum is located at this place

   the two responses have virtually similar tokens but different
   structures which completely changes the context. in this article, i
   will discuss the interdisciplinary field of computational linguistics
   which deals with the structural aspects of the text that are used to
   solve common text related problems. some examples are named entity
   extraction, coreference resolution, and machine translation.

computational linguistics

   computational linguistics often overlaps with the field of natural
   language processing as most of the tasks are common to both the fields.
   while natural language processing focuses on the tokens/tags and uses
   them as predictors in machine learning models, computational
   linguistics digs further deeper into the relationships and links among
   them.

   structural aspects of the text refer to the organization of tokens in a
   sentence and the how the contexts among them are interrelated. this
   organization is often depicted by the word-to-word grammar
   relationships which are also known as dependencies. dependency is the
   notion that syntactic units (words) are connected to each other by
   directed links which describe the relationship possessed by the
   connected words.

   these dependencies map directly onto a directed graph representation,
   in which words in the sentence are nodes in the graph and grammatical
   relations are edge labels. this directed graph representation is also
   called as the dependency tree. for example, the dependency tree of the
   sentence is shown in the figure below:

   analyticsvidhya is the largest community of data scientists and
   provides best resources for understanding data and analytics.

   another way to represent this tree is following:

   -> community-nn (root)
   -> analyticsvidhya-nnp (nsubj)
   -> is-vbz (cop)
   -> the-dt (det)
   -> largest-jjs (amod)
   -> scientists-nns (pobj)
   -> of-in (prep)
   -> data-nns (case)
   -> and-cc (cc)
   -> provides-vbz (conj)
   -> resources-nns (dobj)
   -> best-jjs (amod)
   -> understanding-vbg (pcomp)
   -> for-in (mark)
   -> data-nns (dobj)
   -> and-cc (cc)
   -> analytics-nns (conj)
    1. in this graphical representation of sentence, each term is
       represented in the pattern of       -> element_a     element_b
       (element_c)    .
    2. element_a represents the word, element_b represents the part of
       speech tag of word, element c represents the grammar relation among
       the word and its parent node, and the indentation before the symbol
           ->     represents the level of a word in the tree. [98]here is the
       reference list to understand the dependency relations.
    3. the tree shows that the term    community    is the structural centre
       of the sentence and is represented as root linked by 7 nodes
       (   analyticsvidhya   ,    is   ,    the   ,    largest   ,    and   ,    scientists   ,
          provides   ).
    4. out of these 7 connected nodes, the terms    scientists    and
          provides    are the root nodes of two other sub-trees.
    5. each subtree is a itself a dependency tree with relations such as    
       (   provides    <->    resources    <by>    dobj    relation), (   resources    <->
          best    <by>    amod    relation).

   these trees can be generated in python using libraries such as nltk,
   spacy or stanford-corenlp and can be used to obtain subject-verb-object
   triplets, noun and verb phrases, grammar dependency relationships, and
   part of speech tags etc for example    
   -> scientists-nns (pobj)

   -> of-in (prep)

   -> data-nns (nn)
   grammar: <prep> <nn> <pobj>

   pos: in     nns     nns

   phrase: of data scientist
   -> understanding-vbg (pcomp)

   -> for-in (prep)

   -> data-nns (dobj)

   -> and-cc (cc)

   -> analytics-nns (conj)
   grammar: <dobj> <cc> <conj>

   pos: nns     cc     nns

   phrase: data and analytics


   grammar: <prep> <pcomp> <prep> <dobj>

   pos: vbg     in     nns

   phrase: for understanding data and analytics


applications of dependency trees

id39

   named-entity recognition (ner) is the process of locating and
   classifying named entities in a textual data into predefined categories
   such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of
   times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

   to recognize the named entities, one needs to parse the dependency tree
   in a top to bottom manner and identify the noun phrases. noun phrases
   are the subtrees which are connected by a relation from nouns family
   such as nsubj, nobj, dobj etc nmod etc.  for example    

   donald trump will be visiting new delhi next summer for a conference at
   google

   -> visiting-vbg (root)
   -> trump-nnp (nsubj)
   -> donald-nnp (compound)
   -> will-md (aux)
   -> be-vb (aux)
   -> delhi-nnp (dobj)
   -> new-nnp (compound)
   -> summer-nn (tmod)
   -> next-jj (amod)
   -> conference-nn (nmod)
   -> for-in (case)
   -> a-dt (det)
   -> google-nnp (nmod)
   -> at-in (case)

   in the above trees, following noun phrases are are detected from the
   grammar relations of noun family such as:

   trump <-> visiting <by> nsubj
   delhi <-> visiting <by> dobj
   summer <-> delhi <by> nmod
   conference <-> visiting <by> nmod
   google <-> conference <by> nmod

   named entities can be obtained by identifying the nnp (proper noun)
   part of speech tag of the root node. example     trump, delhi, and google
   have the part of speech tag nnp. to generate the proper noun phrase
   linked with root node, one needs to parse the subtree linked with the
   root nodes.  using the grammar rules, following named entities are
   obtained:

   <compound> <nsubj> : donald trump
   <compound> <dsubj> : new delhi
   <nmod> : google

   other tasks such as phrase chunking and entity wise id31
   can be performed using similar processes. for example, one sentence may
   contain multiple sentiments, contexts and entities and dictionary based
   models may not perform well. in the following sentence, there are two
   contexts:

   sentence     his acting was good but the script was poor

   context 1: his acting was good
   context 2: the script was poor

   both of the contexts have different sentiments, one is negative while
   other is positive. in the dependency tree of this sentence, there are
   two sub-trees which correspond to different contexts and can be used to
   extract them. the dependency tree of the sentence is

   the subtrees can be extracted and evaluated individually from this
   dependency tree to compute the dependency tree. this [99]paper from
   stanford and this [100]paper from singapore university describes the
   efficient approaches to perform ner using dependencies.


coreference resolution or id2

   coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that
   refer to the same entity in a text. it is an important step for a lot
   of higher level nlp tasks that involve natural language understanding
   such as document summarization, id53, and information
   extraction.

   the coreference process
    1. the first step is to create dependency tree of the text. once a
       dependency tree is created, it needs to traversed recursively to
       create multiple features such as:

   john telephoned bill. he lost his laptop.

   np -> noun phrases nodes
   hw -> headwords
   rl -> grammar relations
   lv -> level in the tree
   pos -> part of speech tag
   gen -> gender of part of speech tag
    2. identify the tokens having the part of speech tag of pronoun
       family, (identified by prp tag) and the proper nouns or named
       entities. by going through different uses of the pronouns. they can
       be classified in different groups according to the usage.

   using named entity recognizer, identified named entities are bill, john

   using gender api such as this, gender of named entities are male
   entities.

   features of sentences:

    3. map the pronoun tokens with named entity tokens. start from the
       bottommost sentence features and identify part of speech tag and
       its gender. to properly map the tokens, the properties/features are
       exploited.

   3.1 map the tokens with same gender of pronoun and named entity

   3.2 map the tokens with same singularity / plurality

   3.3 map the tokens with same grammar relations

   this [101]paper from soochow university describes the use of dependency
   trees in coreference resolution.


id53

   another important task in which computational linguistics can help to
   obtain results with high relevance is the id53 which is
   treated as one of the hardest tasks involved with text data. question
   answering systems based on computational linguistics uses the syntactic
   structures of the query questions and matches them with the responses
   having similar syntactic structures. the similar syntactic structures
   contribute the answer set to a particular question. for example

   question: what is the capital of india?

   answer: new delhi is the capital of india

   -> capital-nn (root)
   -> what-wp (nsubj)
   -> is-vbz (cop)
   -> the-dt (det)
   -> of-in (prep)
   -> india-nnp (pobj)


   -> capital-nn (root)
   -> delhi-nnp (nsubj)
   -> new-nnp (nn)
   -> is-vbz (cop)
   -> the-dt (det)
   -> of-in (prep)
   -> india-nnp (pobj)


   both the question and answer dependency trees have similar patterns and
   can be used to generate the answer responses to specific queries. this
   [102]paper1 and [103]paper2 describe the approaches to perform question
   answering using dependency trees.


other tasks that uses computational linguistics

     * machine translation
     * text summarization
     * id86
     * natural language understanding
     * speech to text


generating dependency trees using stanford core nlp

from stanfordcorenlp import stanfordcorenlp as scn
nlp = scn(r'/path/to/stanford-corenlp-full-2017-06-09/')

sentence = 'his acting was good but script was poor'

print
print 'part of speech:'
print nlp.pos_tag(sentence)

print
print 'id33:'
print nlp.dependency_parse(sentence)

[(u'his', u'prp$'),
 (u'acting', u'nn'),
 (u'was', u'vbd'),
 (u'good', u'jj'),
 (u'but', u'cc'),
 (u'script', u'nn'),
 (u'was', u'vbd'),
 (u'poor', u'jj')]

[(u'root', 0, 4),
 (u'nmod:poss', 2, 1),
 (u'nsubj', 4, 2),
 (u'cop', 4, 3),
 (u'cc', 4, 5),
 (u'nsubj', 8, 6),
 (u'cop', 8, 7),
 (u'conj', 4, 8)]


dependency trees using spacy

import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en")

doc = nlp(u   the team is not performing well in the match   ')

for token in doc:
    print str(token.text),  str(token.lemma_),  str(token.pos_),  str(token.dep_
)


>>> the, the, noun, nsubj
>>> team, team, noun, nsubh
>>> is, is, verb, aux
>>> not, not, adv, neg
>>> performing, perform, verb, root
>>> well, well, adv, advmod
>>> in, in, adp, prep
>>> the, the, noun, pobj
>>> match, match ,noun, pobj

from spacy import displacy

displacy.serve(doc, style='dep')
