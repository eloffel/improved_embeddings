   using a deep convolutional neural network architecture to classify
   audio and how to effectively use id21 and
   data-augmentation to improve model accuracy using small datasets.

   by [41]narayan srinivasan.

   understanding sound is one of the basic tasks that our brain performs.
   this can be broadly classified into speech and non-speech sounds. we
   have noise robust id103 systems in place but there is
   still no general purpose acoustic scene classifier which can enable a
   computer to listen and interpret everyday sounds and take actions based
   on those like humans do, like moving out of the way when we listen to a
   horn or hear a dog barking behind us etc.

   our model is only as complex as our data, thus getting labelled    data
   is very important in machine learning   . the complexity of the machine
   learning systems arise from the data itself and not from the
   algorithms. in the past few years we   ve seen deep learning systems take
   over the field of image recognition and captioning, with architectures
   like [42]resnet, [43]googlenet shattering benchmarks in the id163
   competition with 1000 categories of images, classified at above 95%
   accuracy (top 5 accuracy). this was due to a large amount of labelled
   dataset that were available for the models to train on and also faster
   computers with gpu acceleration which makes it easier to train deep
   models.

   the problem we face with building a noise robust acoustic classifier is
   the lack of a large dataset, but google recently launched the
   [44]audioset - which is a large collection of labelled audio taken from
   youtube videos (10s excerpts). earlier, we had the [45]esc-50 dataset
   with 2000 recordings, 40 from each class covering many everyday sounds.

   step 1. extracting features

   although deep learning eliminates the need for hand-engineered
   features, we have to choose a representation model for our data.
   instead of directly using the sound file as an amplitude vs time signal
   we use a log-scaled mel-spectrogram with 128 components (bands)
   covering the audible frequency range (0-22050 hz), using a window size
   of 23 ms (1024 samples at 44.1 khz) and a hop size of the same
   duration. this conversion takes into account the fact that human ear
   hears sound on log-scale, and closely scaled frequency are not well
   distinguished by the human cochlea. the effect becomes stronger as
   frequency increases. hence we only take into account power in different
   frequency bands. this sample code gives an insight into converting
   audio files into spectrogram images. we use glob and librosa library -
   this code is a standard one for conversion into spectrogram and you   re
   free to make modifications to suit the needs.

   in the code that follows,
   parent_dir = string with name of main directory.
   sub_dirs = a list of directories inside parent we want to explore

   so all *.wav files in the area parent_dir/sub_dirs/*.wav are extracted,
   iterating through all subdirs.

   there is an interesting article about mel-scale and mfcc coefficients
   for people who are interested. [46]ref.

   now the audio file is represented as a 128(frames) x 128(bands)
   spectrogram image.


   audio classifier code



   the audio-classification problem is now transformed into an image
   classification problem. we need to detect presence of a particular
   entity (    dog   ,   cat   ,   car    etc) in this image.

   step 2. choosing an architecture

   we use a convolutional neural network, to classify the spectrogram
   images.this is because id98s work better in detecting local feature
   patterns (edges etc) in different parts of the image and are also good
   at capturing hierarchical features which become subsequently complex
   with every layer as illustrated in the image



   another way to think about this is to use a recurrent neural network to
   capture the sequential information in sound data by passing one frame
   at a time, but as in most cases id98s have outperformed standalone id56s
   - we haven   t used it in this particular experiment. in many cases id56s
   are used along with id98s to improve performance of networks and we
   would be experimenting with those architectures in the future.
   [47][ref]

   step 3. id21

   as the id98s learn features hierarchically, we can observe that the
   initial few layers learn basic features like various edges which are
   common to many different types of images. id21 is the
   concept of training the model on a dataset with large amounts of
   similar data and then modifying the network to perform well on the
   target task where we do not have a lot of data. this is also called
   fine-tuning - [48]this blog explains id21 very well.

   step 4. data augmentation

   while dealing with small datasets, learning complex representations of
   the data is very prone to overfitting as the model just memorises the
   dataset and fails to generalise. one way to beat this is to augment the
   audio files into producing many files each with a slight variation.

   the ones we used here are time-stretching and pitch-shifting -
   [49]rubberband is an easy to use library for this purpose.


rubberband -t 1.5 -p 2 input.wav output.wav


   this one line terminal command, gives us a new audio file which is 50%
   longer than original and has pitch shifted up by one octave.

   to visualise what this means, look at this image of a cat i took from
   the internet.



   if we only have the image on our right, we can use data augmentation to
   make a mirror image of that image and it   s still a cat (additional
   training data!). for a computer these are two completely different
   pixel distributions and helps it learn more general concepts (if a is a
   dog, mirror image of a is dog too).

   similarly we apply time-stretching (either slow down the sound or speed
   it up) , and
   pitch-shifting (make it more or less shrill) to get more generalised
   training data for our network (also improved the validation accuracy by
   8-9% in this case due to a small training set).

   we observed that the performance of the model for each sound class is
   influenced differently by each augmentation set, suggesting that the
   performance of the model could be improved further by applying
   class-conditional data augmentation.

   overfitting is a major problem in the field of deep learning and we can
   use data augmentation as one way to combat this problem , other ways of
   implicitly generalising include using dropout layers and l1,l2
   regularisation. [50][ref]

   so in this article we proposed a deep convolutional neural network
   architecture which helps us classify audio and how to effectively use
   id21 and data-augmentation to improve model accuracy in
   case of small datasets.
