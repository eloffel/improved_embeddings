vanishing gradient

   now let me tell you the story behind this whole tutorial on vanishing
   gradients. i wanted to write a tutorial on resnets paper, but when
   started i had this feeling that without giving a proper definition on
   the problem we are going to solve with resnets, the whole tutorial
   would be incomplete. so i started working on this tutorial, which you
   may find as a preamble to resnets tutorial :d

   github rendering on jupiter notebook sucks sometimes when it comes to
   latex equations. if you've problems regarding viewing the notebook,
   then please visit [67]this link.

   happy learning !
