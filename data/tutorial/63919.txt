   we are living our lives more in bits & bytes than in exchanging
   emotions. we transact and communicate more over the internet using our
   super intelligent machines called computer. so we now feel that our
   machines need to understand how we comprehend while we speak and are
   trying to give language to them using the filed of artificial
   intelligence called nlp : natural language processing. chatbots as an
   outcome are are becoming a reliable business tools to communicate with
   humans using this non-human dependent intelligent tool.

i strongly feel :

     until our machine learns to understand behaviour and emotions, jobs
     of data scientist and engineers are only half done. nlp in
     collaboration with deep learning (a field of ml science) are going
     to play a pivotal role in giving some sense to language being spoken
     by computer machines.

what is nlp :

     it   s a stream of artificial intelligence where machine meets human
     language giving them words to communicate with humans. it involves
     intelligent analysis of written language using nlp techniques to get
     insights from set of textual data like

    1. id31
    2. information extraction & retrieval
    3. smart search etc   

   it   s a confluence of artificial intelligence and computational
   linguistics which handles interactions between machines and natural
   languages of humans in which computers are entailed to analyze,
   understand, alter, or generate natural language. nlp helps computer
   machines to engage in communication using natural human language in all
   forms, including but not limited to speech, print, writing, and
   signing.

   nlp machine learning & deep learning : how are they connected :
   [1*w3eamtmjmicove4pibgaew.png]

   nlp is closely related to ml and deep learning all these are branched
   out as shown in image below from artificial intelligence : a field of
   computer science which engages in making machine intelligent. deep
   learning is one of the popular machine learning techniques like
   regression, id116 etc..

   machine learning type like unsupervised ml is often used in nlp
   techniques like lda(id44 which is a topic
   modeling algorithm)

   in-order to perform any nlp we need to deeply understand emotional and
   analytical aspect of how human being process language. also various
   data sources of language like social media where human share the
   content which directly or indirectly is an extension what they are
   feeling has to be intelligently analysed by machines using nlp. nlp
   machines need to build a human reasoning system and with the help of ml
   techniques they can automate nlp process and scale it.

     in a nutshell ml, deep learning and nlp are interconnected and
     interdependent to build a intelligent computer machines which can
     think, speak and act like humans.

   john rehling, an nlp expert at meltwater group, said in [14]how natural
   language processing helps uncover social media sentiment.

        by analyzing language for its meaning, nlp systems have long filled
     useful roles, such as correcting grammar, converting speech to text
     and automatically translating between languages.   

how nlp works :

   it become really relevant to understand how nlp works so that it
   becomes easy to grasp the nlp as a whole . generally nlp has got two
   main components
    1. nlu : natural language understandings
    2. id86 : id86s

let   s go deep into nlu :

     natural language understandings : it deals with the methodology
     which try to understands how to give relevant meaning to the natural
     language which is fed to the computer

   at the start computer gets an input of natural language ( natural
   language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through
   use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. natural
   languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing.)

   computer then converts them into artificial language like speech
   recognition and or speech to text conversion works. here we get the
   data into a textual form which nlu process to understand the meaning of
   the same.

id48 : hidden markov model (nlu example) :

   [1*iyy6wzu_4ynp1q4fw3jtdw.png]
   [15]image source

   it is a statistical id103 model which converts your speech
   into a text with the help of prebuilt mathematical techniques and try
   to infer what you said verbally.

   it tries to understand what you said by taking the voice data and
   breaking it down to small chunk of particular time duration mostly
   10   20 ms. these data sets are further compared to pre-fed speech to
   decode what you said in each unit of your speech. the purpose here is
   to find phoneme(a smallest unit of speech). then machine looks at the
   series of such phonemes and statistically determine the most likely
   words and sentences to spoke.

   then nlu gets to deeply understand each word where it tries to
   understand whether it is a noun or verb, what is the tense(past or
   future) and so on.. this process is defined as pos : part of speech
   tagging. nlp has inbuilt lexicon and a set of protocols related to
   grammar pre-coded into their system which is employed while processing
   the set of natural language data sets and decode what was said when nlp
   system processed the human speech.

   nlp systems also have a lexicon (a vocabulary) and a set of grammar
   rules coded into the system. modern nlp algorithms use statistical
   machine learning to apply these rules to the natural language and
   determine the most likely meaning behind what was said. there are
   several challenges in accomplishing this when considering problems such
   as words having several meanings (polysemy) or different words having
   similar meanings (synonymy), but software developers builds their own
   rules in their nlu systems which can handle this type of problems with
   proper training and learning

id86 :

   a compared to stage one nlu which does most of hard work on their part
   to understand what humans have said , id86 has quite an easier job to
   translates that artificial language of a computers to generate a
   meaningful text which can further be converted to audible speech using
   tex-to-speech conversion. the text-to-speech engine analyzes the text
   using a id144 model, which determines breaks, duration, and pitch.
   then, using a speech database, the engine puts together all the
   recorded phonemes to form one coherent string of speech.

   in a nutshell nlp employs nlu & id86 components to process the human
   natural language specially in id103 field and try to
   understand , decode and infer what was said by delivering string or
   audible speech as an output.

nlp applications : in the modern context

   [1*zdyvevmkytji54tijptqig.jpeg]

   in this computer age of digital revolution where most of the tasks are
   being accomplished by humans using machines which are internet
   connected.nlp has played a vital role in building some robust software
   tools for industry segments like media, publishing, advertising,
   healthcare, banking and insurance, helping them to operate efficiently
   and productively.

some of the modern usage of nlp :

    1. chatbots : its a trained software called bots which is capable of
       handling any scenario of dialog with humans. some of the popular
       nlp and ml platform for chatbots which you can used in your
       business (product or services ) are a[17]pi.ai, [18]microsoft
       language understanding intelligent service (luis) etc

2. spam filtering :

   [1*ru2fhcym7ttunl_xhihoga.png]
   [20]image source

   most of you must be quite familiar with spams. being a gmail user you
   can relate spam filtering techniques. google uses this ai based nlp
   techniques to keep your inbox clean and spam free. spam filters have
   become important as the first line of defense against our
   ever-increasing problem of unwanted email. a technology that has
   received much attention is bayesian spam filtering, a statistical
   technique in which the incidence of words in an email is measured
   against its typical occurrence in a corpus of spam and non-spam emails.

3. machine translations :

   [1*mwelswvg3yh8bkmykqxtnw.jpeg]
   [21]image source

   nlp is increasingly being used for machine translation programs, in
   which one human language is automatically translated into another human
   language. google is a pioneer in this which translates your text in one
   language into the text of the desired language.

     the challenge with machine translation technologies is not in
     translating words, but in preserving the meaning of sentences, a
     complex technological issue that is at the heart of nlp.

   4. named entity extraction:

   it is used in separating one item from the set of given item which are
   of similar nature and attribute. examples include first and last names,
   age, geographic locations, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses,
   company names, etc. named entity extraction, sometimes also called
   id39, makes it easier to mine data.

   5. id54:

   natural language processing can be used to produce a readable summary
   from a large chunk of text. for example, one might us automatic
   summarization to produce a short summary of a dense academic article.

   6. id103 : text-to-speech conversion etc as spoke at the
   start of the articles. is what nlp is being extensively used for.

   some other utilities of nlp are id31 which is used in
   algorithmic stock trading etc..

nlp algorithms & api   s :

   next in our series of nlp articles, we will go ever more deeper into
   technicalities of nlp keeping software developer who wants to pursue
   their career into this ai & ml field of computer science. till then you
