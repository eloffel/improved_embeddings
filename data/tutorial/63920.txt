ibm code patterns and the future of ai

   dzone 's guide to

ibm code patterns and the future of ai

a big push in 2018 is around conversations, reusable conversations, chats,
and chatbots. and in 2018, we   ll see these ai use cases reach even higher.

   thanks to [33]angel diaz, vice president, developer technology and
   advocacy at [34]ibm, for sharing information about ibm code patterns,
   the new way ibm is packaging code for developers around chatbots, ai,
   and various use cases.

   q: tell us about the rise of design    patterns    for developers.

   a: when you   re classically trained in computer science courses, you
   learn early on about [35]the gang of four and theory around
   object-oriented programming and software design patterns. we   re in a
   different world now. that book was created in the 1980s. gang of four
   still applies and is a very useful teaching instrument     but the
   concept of design patterns has really evolved.

   what   s starting to emerge now is what i call the    modern-day design
   pattern.    because of the level of abstraction that you get with the
   cloud, the level of abstraction you get with ai, and the level of
   abstraction you get with data     there   s less stuff you need to know as
   a developer. there are fewer o   reilly books you have to read. you don   t
   have to build or even install a speech-to-text engine     you just use
   the api. you don   t have to provision your infrastructure     you use a
   container inside of kubernetes. what   s emerging is a new set of
   computer design patterns that are higher levels of abstraction, and
   that accelerate developers    productivity.

   i think 2018 will be the year of design patterns. why is that
   important? if you look back at developer abstractions, they   ve led to
   quantum leaps in developer productivity. they allow writing more code
   and better code because they   re not rewriting low-level code. with
   design patterns in 2018, developers will be able to pull design
   patterns, take code they can fork, and innovate around the application
   logic that they want to build. and that   s going to be huge as
   applications continue to take advantage of cloud, data, and ai.

   q: what do you think has changed in recent years where there   s such a
   strong need for patterns with developers?

   a: it   s obviously an amazing time to be a developer     we   re living in a
   technology-driven business renaissance where technology has gone
   horizontal across every industry and whoever can deliver the best
   software wins.

   developers own this age of innovation. and equally exciting, there are
   so many choices at every layer     from programming languages to
   frameworks to deployment models. it   s truly a buyer   s market, and the
   developers are the most important buyers.

   but trends in cloud, data, and ai are causing so many major shifts in
   technology that developers basically have multi-layered, unlimited
   canvasses to build upon. they have access to as much compute, storage,
   and network as they need. they have paas; they have containers; they
   can build 12-factor applications, microservices, or
   event-driven/serverless. there is so much choice, and so many
   implementation details, that the real trick is picking the right layers
   of abstraction so that developers are focusing on writing their own
   applications and systems on top of the things that should be abstracted
   rather than worrying about all of the underlying details.

   q: tell us more about the ibm code patterns that you recently launched.

   a: to simplify the development process and streamline the search for
   free, open-source code, ibm has released more than 120 code patterns.
   these patterns do the dirty work for the developer. they are curated
   packages of code, one-click github repos, documentation, and resources
   that address some of the most popular areas of development, including
   ai, blockchain, containers, and iot. these patterns will help
   developers get right to the task at hand, giving them more time to
   innovate and build.

   for example, how do you create a chatbot for any industry that has a
   slack front-end and a transactional back end? that is a very common
   design pattern today. there   s an ibm code pattern for that, so you can
   start at the point of a slack front end and a transactional back end
   and focus on your application     and not what it takes to stand it up
   and make it work. the [36]star trek/ubisoft work that ibm did to
   basically voice-control the enterprise     we made that into a design
   pattern so that anyone that works with speech-to-text and wants to
   connect to the unity game engine can connect that. that   s another
   design pattern.

   q: as ibm keeps growing the list of code patterns, tell us how you see
   this effort evolving?

   you   ll see many more ibm patterns around data, ai, and industry and
   deployment models. we realize that you combine these patterns together
   into composites for larger applications     and we can even put them in
   the context of someone in retail or healthcare, for example. there are
   industry-specific patterns based on common use cases that we think are
   extensible to developers who want to share and reuse that type of
   institutional knowledge to further accelerate their development
   efforts. every developer wants to create new value. no one gets
   rewarded for solving problems that have already been solved, so we see
   the broader impact of ibm code patterns as raising that level of
   abstraction to give every developer the best starting point for
   building what they actually want to build.

   q: you have an interesting take on maslow   s hierarchy applied to the
   progression of ai use cases.

   a: in human psychology, maslow said humans need food and warmth and
   shelter at bottom of the triangle. at the top is a really nice car, a
   great house, wealth, power, etc. in maslow   s view of the world, as the
   needs on the bottom get fulfilled, humans move to the next tier of the
   triangle     because people always want more.

   it   s sort of an interesting way to look at where developers are today
   with ai. when you look the modern application     the modern app built
   for cloud, data, and ai     there   s a symbiotic tie between the three,
   and especially between data and ai. data gives you the insight but ai
   allows you to infer from the insight and act. on the maslow hierarchy
   of needs for developers around ai, the focus is shifting towards taking
   action on insight or recommending action on insight.

   at the bottom of the hierarchy are things like speech-to-text,
   annotating text, image recognition     the types of raw ai capabilities
   that the developer world has been playing with. but in 2017, we started
   to tackle more ambitious ai use cases. the next layer up for ai
   developers in 2018 is the notion of interactive chats (chatbots and
   interactive conversation). there are communities popping up all over
   the world that are saying that the ability to understand modalities is
   great, but now, what about augmenting interaction and then reusing
   those interactions?

   a big push in 2018 is around the arena of conversations, reusable
   conversations, chats, and chatbots     and we think we   re approaching a
   point where developers will consider human interaction as a key use
   case for all new applications, leveraging conversation frameworks and
   libraries. that   s where the next generation of the crank will go with
   ai. and in 2018, i think we   ll see these ai use cases reach even
   higher, using deep learning, machine learning, tensorflow, and apache
   spark use cases evolving as the building blocks.
