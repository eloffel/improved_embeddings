background

   if you   ve been following the latest developments in deep learning,
   you   ve probably come across [18]artistic style transfer. it   s a
   technique to create a new image with the content of image a, in the
   style of image b. for example, below is the result of style transfer
   from a kandinsky painting to a photo of neil degrasse tyson.

   rt-and.html

   deep learning has also had success in transferring verbal style. given
   a 1-minute audio clip of someone talking, [20]lyrebird is able to
   capture that person   s speaking style and make him say anything by
   mimicking his voice.

motivation

   i was curious to see if style transfer could also apply to the written
   word. the idea was to dress up english sentences in the styles of
   various authors, be it florid poetry or gruff prose, while preserving
   meaning. an internet search didn   t turn up any methods, but i found i
   could adapt id4 (id4) to my purposes.

   rather than translating between two different languages, i trained a
   neural net to translate from modern english to shakespeare   s english.
   training data was shakespeare   s plays and their corresponding modern
   english translations available at sparknotes.com and enotes.com.

results

   i applied the translator to taylor swift   s recent song,    look what you
   made me do.    the title translates to    what thou hast made me do?    which
   is in the antiquated shakespearian style and faithfully retains the
   original meaning. here is the full first stanza of the pop song and the
   translation.
song lyrics                        | shakespeare translation

i do not like your little games.   | i do not like your little dry .
do not like your tilted stage.     | do not like thy mind .

the role you made me play.         | the offence you made me .
of the fool, no, i do not like you.| no , no , i am not like you .
     i don't like your perfect crime.   | i do so much as thou art .

how you laugh when you lie.        | how thou dost lie .
you said the gun was mine.         | you say the seas was mine .

isn't cool, no, i don't like you.  | no cool , no , i protest you .
oh, look what you made me do       | o , look you , look you , what
                 >                                    you make me do ?
look what you made me do           | what thou hast made me do ?

methods

   google research blog published a [21]post 5 months ago introducing a
   tutorial that shows how to build a high-quality translation model in
   tensorflow. in their words,

     the tutorial is aimed at making the process as simple as possible,
     starting with some background knowledge on id4 and walking through
     code details to build a vanilla system. it then dives into the
     attention mechanism [3, 4], a key ingredient that allows id4 systems
     to handle long sentences. finally, the tutorial provides details on
     how to replicate key features in the google   s id4 (gid4) system [5]
     to train on multiple gpus.

   google makes good on its promise of a tutorial that is easy to follow.
   assuming you have the hardware, a translation model is a few python
   script executions away. using their default values, the translation
   model i trained was a 2-layer lstm id195 model with 128-dim hidden
   units, dropout, and an attention mechanism. here are my key takeaways
   from the section explaining how id4s work.
    1. their approach is to consume an entire sentence as a unit for
       translation. this is a departure from phrase-based translation,
       which splits sentences into phrases and translates them
       independently. because it considers the entire sentence, it can
       perform better on parts that have long-range dependencies, like
       gender agreement.
    2. they use an encoder-decoder architecture. in the encoding step, the
       network constructs a    thought vector    that encodes the meaning of a
       sentence from words in the source language. in the decoding step,
       the    thought vector    is projected to the target language one word
       at a time. a recurrent neural network (id56) is used for the encoder
       and decoder, a natural choice for sequential data.

   decoding. source: [22]https://github.com/tensorflow/id4

   3. if you think the diagram above has too many arrows, you   re not
   alone. it   s even worse for long sentences, where the single fixed-size
   hidden state becomes an information bottleneck and performance suffers.
   a workaround is to use an attention mechanism to make direct short-cut
   connections between the target and source words. attention is captured
   by a weighted distribution over the encoded source vectors that
   indicates relevancy to the target word.

conclusion

   the shakespeare translator is far from perfect, but is a potential
   avenue for writing style transfer, if the data is available. it calls
   for a pair of corpuses that convey the same content in two different
   writing styles, which is a major limitation on the number of available
   styles. [24]the course of true writing style transfer never did run
   smooth.
