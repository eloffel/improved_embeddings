   id4pytorch allows training of various end-to-end neural architectures
   including but not limited to id4, image
   captioning and automatic id103 systems. the initial
   codebase was in theano and was inspired from the famous
   [102]dl4mt-tutorial codebase.

   id4pytorch is mainly developed by the language and speech team of le
   mans university but receives valuable contributions from the
   [103]grounded sequence-to-sequence transduction team of frederick
   jelinek memorial summer workshop 2018:

   loic barrault, ozan caglayan, amanda duarte, desmond elliott, spandana
   gella, nils holzenberger, chirag lala, jasmine (sun jae) lee, jind  ich
   libovick  , pranava madhyastha, florian metze, karl mulligan, alissa
   ostapenko, shruti palaskar, ramon sanabria, lucia specia and josiah
   wang.

installation

   id4pytorch currently requires python>=3.6 and torch>=0.4.1. we are not
   planning to support python 2.x.

   important: after installing id4pytorch, you need to run
   id4py-install-extra to download meteor related files into your
   ${home}/.id4py folder. this step is only required once.

pip

   you can install id4pytorch from pypi using pip (or pip3 depending on
   your operating system and environment):
$ pip install id4pytorch

   this will automatically fetch and install the dependencies as well. for
   the torch dependency it will specifically install the torch 1.0.0
   package from pypi that ships cuda 9.0 within.

conda

   we provide an environment.yml file in the repository that you can use
   to create a ready-to-use anaconda environment for id4pytorch:
$ conda update --all
$ git clone https://github.com/lium-lst/id4pytorch.git
$ conda env create -f id4pytorch/environment.yml

development mode

   for continuous development and testing, it is sufficient to run python
   setup.py develop in the root folder of your git checkout. from now on,
   all modifications to the source tree are directly taken into account
   without requiring reinstallation.

documentation

   we currently only provide some preliminary documentation in our
   [105]wiki.
