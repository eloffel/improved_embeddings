goals

    1. make deep learning easier (minimal code).
    2. minimise required mathematics.
    3. make it practical (runs on laptops).
    4. open source deep learning learning.
    5. grow a collaborating practical community around dl.
    6. memes: no seriously. make dl fun and interactive, this means more
       trump tweets.

support us

   there's a few ways you can support this initiative:

    2. subscribe to our [102]youtube channel here.
    3. star this repository and share it!

contents

   the following contents are each contained within a folder:
    1. data science (eg. pandas)
    2. deep learning (keras)
    3. bayesian learning (pymc3)

installation

   we run all our notebooks on google colab. in order to do this:
    1. get a google account.
    2. click on this [103]link to take you to the google drive folder.
    3. go to the dl-keras folder (or any other topic that you wish to
       learn).
    4. double click on the notebook and click on, 'open with colaboratory'
       (you need to haved signed into google for this).
    5. click on the 'runtime' tab at the top and change to python3 and
       gpu. now you are all good to go.
