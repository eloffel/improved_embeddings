snap & eat (formerly deep139)

   deep learning hackathon 48h - cotidiano (first place project =d )

   we believe nutrition tracking should be as simple as taking a picture.

   snap & eat is a web application that tracks the user's food intake by
   pictures. we use state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to recognize
   dishes, making instant nutrition estimates from the user's meals.

   the app also suggests meals based on the user's income, and is capable
   of showing places nearby that serve those dishes.

   the system is implemented in pytorch using [90]fastai lib, relying on
   jupyter notebooks for prototyping purposes. for the web app, we use
   flask and node.js.

demo

   [91]test [92]alt text

our model

   we use an [93]aggregated residual convolutional neural network -
   resnext-101 with 101 layers, pretrained on [94]id163 dataset. we
   finetune the model on [95]food-101 dataset, with more than 100 thousand
   images of 101 types of dishes. we achieve a significant improvement on
   accuracy (71% in our work compared to 50.1% in [96]bossard et al.,
   2014).

   [97]test

   for recomending new dishes, we use minimum ditance in an n-dimensional
   space of nutritional information that describe each dish.

installation and usage

aws ami (amazon machine images)

   we provide a ready-to-go ami of a p2 instance on aws with all libraries
   and dependencies installed.
   ami id   ami-99442ee3
   ami name snap-n-eat-ami

   to launch an instance based on an ami, see the [98]aws reference. don't
   forget to git pull to get the the latest version of the code!
cd snapandeat
git pull origin master

   to run all the services, the following four comands need to be run in
   the aws instance, once in the snapandeat directory. we recommend using
   [99]tmux to organize the terminals.
python src/services/food_predictor.py

python src/services/food_descriptor.py

python src/services/top_food.py

node src/webapp/server.js

   to view and edit the jupyter notebooks, execute:
cd /home/ubuntu/snapandeat/src/notebooks
jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip='*'

   the default password for the notebooks is snapneat. don't forget to
   change it!

about the idea

   according to the [100]world health organization, worldwide obesity has
   nearly tripled since 1975. in the united states, almost 75% of the
   population is overweight and more than half of the population is obese
   ([101]oecd). today, many diseases that were preivously thought as
   hereditary are now shown to be seen conected to biological disfunction
   related to nutrition.

   although being healty and eating better is something the vast majority
   of the population want, doing so usually requires great effort and
   organization. the lack of an easy and simple way to track nutrition
   information about the food you eat can easily lead to low engagement.
   by providing a very easy and fun way to keep track of what the user
   eat, we can largely improve engagement, and directly atack on of the
   largest health problems in the world.
