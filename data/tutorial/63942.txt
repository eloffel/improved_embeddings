   the below post demonstrates the use of convolution operation for
   carrying out the back propagation in a id98.

   difference between convolution operation and correlation.

   let   s consider the input and the filter that is going to be used for
   carrying out the convolution as given above.

   then the correlation of the filter matrix with the input matrix is
   described in the figure below
   [1*444xukdtxwfxxaqq5yvkvg.jpeg]

   now, the convolution of the filter matrix with input image is same as
   rotating the filter by 180 degrees and then carrying out the
   correlation of the rotated filter matrix with the input matrix.

   as can be seen from the above image the convolution operation is same
   as that of the correlation operation but with rotated filter.

forward and backward propagation using convolution operation.

   note : to derive the equation of the gradients for the filter values
   and the input matrix values we will consider that the convolution
   operation is same as correlation operation, just for simplicity.

   therefore, the convolution operation can be written as described in the
   figure below.

   notice that here the filter is not rotated for sake of simplicity,
   therefore here convolution is same as correlation

   it can be visualized in the figure below.

   now, to calculate the gradients of filter    f    with respect to the error
      e   , following equations needs to solved.

   here, e is the error obtained.

   which evaluates to
   [1*2naf7_i4j7xltps8m_mxea.png]

   if we look closely this above equation can be written in form of our
   convolution operation.
   [1*auj7ulc2krca99_6u1qsna.jpeg]

   similarly we can find the gradients of the input matrix    x    with
   respect to the error    e   .
   [1*ndw3kqljw9ht_8zfjqohdw.png]

   now, the above computation can be obtained by a different type of
   convolution operation known as full convolution. in order to obtain the
   gradients of the input matrix we need to rotate the filter by 180
   degree and calculate the full convolution of the rotated filter by the
   gradients of the output with respect to error, as represented in the
   image below.
   [1*yx5cve6w7sopkqj8b2dvhg.jpeg]

   the full convolution can be visualized as carrying out the procedure as
   represented in the figure below.
   [1*oicxynavwohou36axzopgq.jpeg]
   here      x    represents the gradients of error with respect to x

   hence both the forward and backward propagation can be performed using
   the convolution operation.

   for calculating the gradients of the pooling and relu layers the
   gradients can be calculated by following the same procedure of using
   chain rule of derivatives.
