introduction to id155 and id47 for data science
professionals

   [96]dishashree gupta, march 14, 2017

introduction

   understanding of [97]id203 is must for a [98]data science
   professional. solutions to many data science problems are often
   probabilistic in nature. hence, a better understanding of id203
   will help you understand & implement these algorithms more efficiently.

   in this article, i will focus on id155. for
   [99]beginners in id203, i would strongly recommend that you go
   through [100]this article before proceeding further.

   a predictive model can easily be understood as a statement of
   id155. for example, the id203 of a customer
   from segment a buying a product of category z in next 10 days is 0.80.
   in other words, the id203 of a customer buying product from
   category z, given that the customer is from segment a is 0.80.

   in this article, i will walk you through id155 in
   detail. i   ll be using examples & real-life scenarios to help you
   improve your understanding.

    7. open challenges


1. events     union, intersection & disjoint events

   before we explore id155, let us define some basic
   common terminologies:


1.1 events

   an event is simply the outcome of a random experiment. getting a heads
   when we toss a coin is an event. getting a 6 when we roll a fair die is
   an event. we associate probabilities to these events by defining the
   event and the sample space.

   the sample space is nothing but the collection of all possible outcomes
   of an experiment. this means that if we perform a particular task again
   and again, all the possible results of the task are listed in the
   sample space.

   for example: a sample space for a single throw of a die will be
   {1,2,3,4,5,6}. one of these is bound to occur if we throw a die. the
   sample space exhausts all the possibilities that can happen when that
   experiment is performed.

   an event can also be a combination of different events.


1.2 union of events

   we can define an event (c) of getting a 4 or 6 when we roll a fair die.
   here event c is a union of two events:

   event a = getting a 4

   event b = getting a 6

   p (c) = p (a     b)

   [cp1.png]

   in simple words we can say that we should consider the id203 of
   (a     b) when we are interested in combined id203 of two (or
   more) events.


1.3. intersection of events

   let   s look at another example.

   let c be the event of getting a multiple of 2 and 3 when you throw a
   fair die.

   event a = getting a multiple of 2 when you throw a fair die

   event b = getting a multiple of 3 when you throw a fair die

   event c = getting a multiple of 2 and 3

   event c is an intersection of event a & b.

   probabilities are then defined as follows.

   p (c) = p (a     b)

   [cp2.png]

   we can now say that the shaded region is the id203 of both events
   a and b occurring together.


1.4 disjoint events

   what if, you come across a case when any two particular events cannot
   occur at the same time.

   for example: let   s say you have a fair die and you have only one throw.

   event a = getting a multiple of 3

   event b = getting a multiple of 5

   you want both event a & b should occur together.

   let   s find the sub space for event a & b.

   event a = {3,6}

   event b = {5}

   sample space= {1,2,3,4,5,6}

   as you can see, there is no case for which event a & b can occur
   together. such events are called disjoint event. to represent this
   using a venn diagram:

   [cp3.png] now that we are familiar with the terms union, intersection
   and disjoint events, we can talk about independence of events.


2. independent, dependent & exclusive events

   suppose we have two events     event a and event b.

   if the occurrence of event a doesn   t affect the occurrence of event b,
   these events are called independent events.

   let   s see some examples of independent events.
     * getting heads after tossing a coin and getting a 5 on a throw of a
       fair die.
     * choosing a marble from a jar and getting heads after tossing a
       coin.
     * choosing a 3 card from a deck of cards, replacing it, and then
       choosing an ace as the second card.
     * rolling a 4 on a fair die, and then rolling a 1 on a second roll of
       the die.

   in each of these cases the id203 of outcome of the second event
   is not affected at all by the outcome of the first event.

id203 of independent events

   in this case the id203 of p (a     b) = p (a) * p (b)

   let   s take an example here. suppose we win the game if we pick a red
   marble from a jar containing 4 red and 3 black marbles and we get heads
   on the toss of a coin. what is the id203 of winning?

   let   s define event a, as getting red marble from the jar

   event b is getting heads on the toss of a coin.

   we need to find the id203 of both getting a red marble and a
   heads in a coin toss.

   p (a) = 4/7

   p (b) = 1/2

   we know that there is no affect of the color of the marble on the
   outcome of the coin toss.

   p (a     b) = p (a) * p (b)

   p (a     b) = (4/7) * (1/2) = (2/7)

id203 of dependent events

   next, can you think of examples of dependent events ?

   in the above example, let   s define event a as getting a red marble from
   the jar. we then keep the marble out and then take another marble from
   the jar.

   will the probabilities in the second case still be the same as that in
   the first case?

   let   s see. so, for the first time there are 4/7 chances of getting a
   red marble. let   s assume you got a red marble on the first attempt.
   now, for second chance, to get a red marble we have 3/6 chances.

   if we didn   t get a red marble on the first attempt but a white marble
   instead. then, there were 4/6 chances to get the red marble second
   time. therefore the id203 in the second case was dependent on
   what happened the first time.

   quiz 1: if you have a jack and your next card is dealt with a new deck
   of cards the id203 of you obtaining a jack again is? are these
   events dependent or independent?


mutually exclusive and exhaustive events

   mutually exclusive events are those events where two events cannot
   happen together.

   the easiest example to understand this is the toss of a coin. getting a
   head and a tail are mutually exclusive because we can either get heads
   or tails but never both at the same in a single coin toss.

   a set of events is collectively exhaustive when the set should contain
   all the possible outcomes of the experiment. one of the events from the
   list must occur for sure when the experiment is performed.

   for example, in a throw of a die, {1,2,3,4,5,6} is an exhaustive
   collection because, it encompasses the entire range of the possible
   outcomes.

   consider the outcomes    even    (2,4 or 6) and    not-6    (1,2,3,4, or 5) in
   a throw of a fair die. they are collectively exhaustive but not
   mutually exclusive.

   quiz 2: check whether the below events are mutually exclusive:
    1. drawing a red card or a jack from a given 52 cards deck.
    2. getting three heads or three tails when three coins are flipped.


3. id155

   conditional probabilities arise naturally in the investigation of
   experiments where an outcome of a trial may affect the outcomes of the
   subsequent trials.

   we try to calculate the id203 of the second event (event b) given
   that the first event (event a) has already happened. if the id203
   of the event changes when we take the first event into consideration,
   we can safely say that the id203 of event b is dependent of the
   occurrence of event a.

   let   s think of cases where this happens:
     * drawing a second ace from a deck given we got the first ace
     * finding the id203 of having a disease given you were tested
       positive
     * finding the id203 of liking harry potter given we know the
       person likes fiction

   and so on   .

   here we can define, 2 events:
     * event a is the id203 of the event we   re trying to calculate.
     * event b is the condition that we know or the event that has
       happened.

   we can write the id155 as , the id203 of the
   occurrence of event a given that b has already happened.

   [cp6.png]

   let   s play a simple game of cards for you to understand this. suppose
   you draw two cards from a deck and you win if you get a jack followed
   by an ace (without replacement). what is the id203 of winning,
   given we know that you got a jack in the first turn?

   let event a be getting a jack in the first turn

   let event b be getting an ace in the second turn.

   we need to find

   p(a) = 4/52

   p(b) = 4/51 {no replacement}

   p(a and b) = 4/52*4/51= 0.006

   here we are determining the probabilities when we know some conditions
   instead of calculating random probabilities. here we knew that he got a
   jack in the first turn.

   let   s take another example.

   suppose you have a jar containing 6 marbles     3 black and 3 white. what
   is the id203 of getting a black given the first one was black
   too.

   p (a) = getting a black marble in the first turn

   p (b) = getting a black marble in the second turn

   p (a) = 3/6

   p (b) = 2/5

   p (a and b) =   *2/5 = 1/5


3.1 reversing the condition

   example: rahul   s favorite breakfast is bagels and his favorite lunch is
   pizza. the id203 of rahul having bagels for breakfast is 0.6. the
   id203 of him having pizza for lunch is 0.5. the id203 of
   him, having a bagel for breakfast given that he eats a pizza for lunch
   is 0.7.

   let   s define event a as rahul having a bagel for breakfast, event b as
   rahul having a pizza for lunch.

   p (a) = 0.6

   p (b) = 0.5

   if we look at the numbers, the id203 of having a bagel is
   different than the id203 of having a bagel given he has a pizza
   for lunch. this means that the id203 of having a bagel is
   dependent on having a pizza for lunch.

   now what if we need to know the id203 of having a pizza given you
   had a bagel for breakfast. i.e. we need to know . id47 now
   comes into the picture.


4. id47

   the id47 describes the id203 of an event based on the
   prior knowledge of the conditions that might be related to the event.
   if we know the id155 , we can use the bayes rule to
   find out the reverse probabilities .

   how can we do that?

   [cp17.png]

   the above statement is the general representation of the bayes rule.

   for the previous example     if we now wish to calculate the id203
   of having a pizza for lunch provided you had a bagel for breakfast
   would be = 0.7 * 0.5/0.6.

   we can generalize the formula further.

   if multiple events a[i ]form an exhaustive set with another event b.

   we can write the equation as

   [cp14.png]


5. example of id47 and id203 trees

   let   s take the example of the breast cancer patients. the patients were
   tested thrice before the oncologist concluded that they had cancer. the
   general belief is that 1.48 out of a 1000 people have breast cancer in
   the us at that particular time when this test was conducted. the
   patients were tested over multiple tests. three sets of test were done
   and the patient was only diagnosed with cancer if she tested positive
   in all three of them.

   let   s examine the test in detail.

   sensitivity of the test (93%)     true positive rate

   specificity of the test (99%)     true negative rate

   let   s first compute the id203 of having cancer given that the
   patient tested positive in the first test.

   p (has cancer | first test +)

   p (cancer) = 0.00148

   sensitivity can be denoted as p (+ | cancer) = 0.93

   specificity can be denoted as p (- | no cancer)

   since we do not have any other information, we believe that the patient
   is a randomly sampled individual. hence our prior belief is that there
   is a 0.148% id203 of the patient having cancer.

   the complement is that there is a 100     0.148% chance that the patient
   does not have cancer. similarly we can draw the below tree to denote
   the probabilities.

   [cp4.png]

   let   s now try to calculate the id203 of having cancer given that
   he tested positive on the first test i.e. p (cancer|+)

   p (cancer and +) = p (cancer) * p (+) = 0.00148*0.93

   p (no cancer and +) = p (no cancer) * p(+) = 0.99852*0.01

   to calculate the id203 of testing positive, the person can have
   cancer and test positive or he may not have cancer and still test
   positive.

   [cp21.png]

   this means that there is a 12% chance that the patient has cancer given
   he tested positive in the first test. this is known as the posterior
   id203.


5.1 bayes updating

   let   s now try to calculate the id203 of having cancer given the
   patient tested positive in the second test as well.

   now remember we will only do the second test if she tested positive in
   the first one. therefore now the person is no longer a randomly sampled
   person but a specific case. we know something about her. hence, the
   prior probabilities should change. we update the prior id203 with
   the posterior from the previous test.

   nothing would change in the sensitivity and specificity of the test
   since we   re doing the same test again. look at the id203 tree
   below.

   [cp5.png]

   let   s calculate again the id203 of having cancer given she tested
   positive in the second test.

   p (cancer and +) = p(cancer) * p(+) = 0.12 * 0.93

   p (no cancer and +) = p (no cancer) * p (+) = 0.88 * 0.01

   to calculate the id203 of testing positive, the person can have
   cancer and test positive or she may not have cancer and still test
   positive.

   [cp22.png]

   now we see, that a patient who tested positive in the test twice, has a
   93% chance of having cancer.


6. frequentist vs bayesian definitions of id203

   a frequentist defines id203 as an expected frequency of
   occurrence over large number of experiments.

   p(event) = n/n, where n is the number of times event a occurs in n
   opportunities.

   the bayesian view of id203 is related to degree of belief.  it is
   a measure of the plausibility of an event given incomplete knowledge.

   the frequentist believes that the population mean is real but
   unknowable and can only be estimated from the data. he knows the
   distribution of the sample mean and constructs a confidence interval
   centered at the sample mean. so the actual population mean is either in
   the confidence interval or not in it.

   this is because he believes that the true mean is a single fixed value
   and does not have a distribution. so the frequentist says that 95% of
   similar intervals would contain the true mean, if each interval were
   constructed from a different random sample.

   the bayesian definition has a totally different view point. they use
   their beliefs to construct probabilities. they believe that certain
   values are more believable than others based on the data and our prior
   knowledge.

   the bayesian constructs a credible interval centered near the sample
   mean and totally affected by the prior beliefs about the mean. the
   bayesian can therefore make statements about the population mean by
   using the probabilities.


7. open challenges

     * in the cancer example taken above, try calculating the id203
       of a patient having cancer provided the patient is tested positive
       in the third test as well.
     * in an exam, there is a problem that 60% of students know the
       correct answer. however, there is 15% chance that a student picked
       the wrong answer even if he/she knows the right answer and there is
       also a 25% chance that a student does not know the right answer but
       guessed it correctly. if a student did get the problem right, what
       is the chance that this student really knows the answer?


end notes

   the debate between bayesian and frequentist approaches has been going
   on for a long while. we have an [101]amazing article which has gone
   deep into both these approaches. it has explained in detail the two
   approaches and bayesian id136.

   the aim of this article was to introduce you to id155
   and id47. id47 forms the backbone of one of very
   frequently used classification algorithms in data science     naive
   bayes.

   once the above concepts are clear you might be interested to open the
   doors [102]the naive bayes algorithm and be stunned by the vast
   applications of id47 in it.

   please post your answers to the open challenges in the comments
   section. and feel free to ask doubts or questions. hope you enjoyed

       nice article! one basic doubt    .prob of can cer and + is calculated
       as prob cancer * prob of positive = 0.00148*0.93   .but we multiply
       probabilities only if they are independent events correct? since
       prob of positive changes with without cancer these are dependent
       right

            the id203 of +ve given you have cancer is the true
            positive rate of the test, which is always fixed for the test.
            here the positive means the id203 of testing positive
            given you have cancer. if you check the value 0.93 it is
            p(+|cancer) and not just p(+).

       on page 8 in the id155 section the first event b
       is the event that has already happened, but later in the page, its
       event a (getting a jack), not b, that is the event that has already
       happened. switching the letters is confusing.
       in addition, in the first part of the game the first draw is a
       jack, but later in the game it states    here we knew that he got an
       ace in the first draw.    please clarify. thank you.

            hey edward, thanks for pointing that out,    here we knew that
            he got an ace in the first draw    has been edited to    got a
            jack in the first draw   .
            small clarification, so the event which we know has happened
            is the condition that we already know for sure. in this case
            we knew that the first draw was a jack, hence that was the
            condition on which the further id203 is based. if the
            letters confuse you, i would encourage solving these examples
            again with taking the known condition as b and always
            calculating p(a/b).
            do post if you need further clarification!

       i think this line is incorrect: p (no cancer and +) = p (no cancer)
       * p(+) = 0.99852*0.99
       the correct statement should be     0.998582 * 0.01
       12 % though is correct & is based on the 2nd formula which i
       mentioned.

       well written and thanks for the article.
       i would need a clarification here. how can we consider
       p(cancer)=0.12 for the second test. here, 12% is a chance that the
       patient has cancer given he tested positive and it   s not the
       id203 of having the cancer.
       could please help me to understand here

       great article and well said.
       quick correction at    let   s not try to calculate the id203 of
       having cancer given that he tested positive on the first test i.e.
       p (cancer|+)   
       there shouldn   t be not in above statement.
