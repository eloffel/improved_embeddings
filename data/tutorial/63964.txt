[126]introduction

   the purpose of this project is to introduce a shortcut to developers
   and researcher for finding useful resources about tensorflow.

[127]motivation

   there are different motivations for this open source project.

[128]why using tensorflow?

   a deep learning is of great interest these days, the crucial necessity
   for rapid and optimized implementation of the algorithms and designing
   architectures is the software environment. tensorflow is designed to
   facilitate this goal. the strong advantage of tensorflow is it
   flexibility is designing highly modular model which also can be a
   disadvantage too for beginners since lots of the pieces must be
   considered together for creating the model. this issue has been
   facilitated as well by developing high-level apis such as [129]keras
   and [130]slim which gather lots of the design puzzle pieces. the
   interesting point about tensorflow is that its trace can be found
   anywhere these days. lots of the researchers and developers are using
   it and its community is growing with the speed of light! so the
   possible issues can be overcame easily since they might be the issues
   of lots of other people considering a large number of people involved
   in tensorflow community.

[131]what's the point of this open source project?

   there other similar repositories similar to this repository and are
   very comprehensive and useful and to be honest they made me ponder if
   there is a necessity for this repository! a great example is
   [132]awesome-tensorflow repository which is a curated list of different
   tensorflow resources.

   the point of this repository is that the resources are being targeted.
   the organization of the resources is such that the user can easily find
   the things he/she is looking for. we divided the resources to a large
   number of categories that in the beginning one may have a headache!!!
   however, if someone knows what is being located, it is very easy to
   find the most related resources. even if someone doesn't know what to
   look for, in the beginning, the general resources have been provided.

[133]how to make the most of this effort

   the written and visual resources have been split. moreover, as one can
   search in the documentation, the number of categories might look to be
   too much. for finding the most relevant resources, please at first look
   through the general resources.

[134]entrance to tensorflow world

   resources will be addressed.
