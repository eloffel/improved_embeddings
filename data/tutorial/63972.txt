nlstm

tensorflow implementation of nested lstm cell

   here is a tensorflow implementation of nested lstm cell.
                [77]nlstm architecture
   nested lstm architecture. courtesy of moniz et al.

   nlstm cell is basically a lstm-like cell that uses the cell memory to
   control the state of the inner lstm, and as such, the architecture can
   be generalized to multiple layers. for a comparison between lstm and
   nlstm,
                           [78]lstm vs nlstm
   lstm and stacked lstm, versus nested lstm. courtesy of moniz et al.

   the implementation here is compatible with the tensorflow id56 api.
from id56_cell import nlstmcell
cell = nlstmcell(num_units=3, depth=2)
init_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)
output, new_state = cell(inputs, state=init_state)
