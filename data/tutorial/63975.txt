   this guide serves as a basic hands-on work to lead you through building
   a neural network from scratch. most of the mathematical concepts and
   scientific decisions are left out.

   you will be able to program and build a vanilla [40]feedforward neural
   network (fnn) starting today via [41]pytorch. here is the python
   jupyter codebase for the
   fnn: [42]https://github.com/yhuag/neural-network-lab

   this guide serves as a basic hands-on work to lead you through building
   a neural network from scratch. most of the mathematical concepts and
   scientific decisions are left out. you are free to research more on
   that part.


getting started


   1. please make sure you have python and pytorch installed in your
   machine:
     * python 3.6 ([43]installation)
     * pytorch ([44]installation)

   2. check the correctness of python installations by the commands at
   console:
python -v

   the output should be python 3.6.3 or later version

   3. open a repository(folder) and create your first neural network file:
mkdir fnn-tuto
cd fnn-tuto
touch fnn.py


start writing codes


   all the following codes should be written in the fnn.py file

   import pytorch

   it will load pytorch into the codes. great! a well beginning is half
   done.

   initialize hyper-parameters

   hyper-parameters are the powerful arguments that are set up upfront and
   will not be updated along with the training of the neural network.

   download mnist dataset

   mnist is a huge database with tons of handwritten digits (i.e. 0 to 9)
   aims for the usage of image processing.

   load the dataset

   after downloading the mnist dataset, we load them into our codes.

   note: we shuffle the loading process of train_dataset to make the
   learning process independent of data order, but the order of
   test_loader remains to examine whether we can handle unspecified bias
   order of inputs.


build the feedforward neural network


   now we have our datasets ready. we will start building the neural
   network. the conceptual illustration can be viewed as below:

                       [1*tobl6xlerkwabswtafay_g.png]
              fnn image retrieved from [45]http://web.utk.edu/

   feedforward neural network model structure

   the fnn includes two fully-connected layers (i.e. fc1 & fc2) and a
   non-linear relu layer in between. normally we call this
   structure 1-hidden layer fnn, without counting the output layer (fc2)
   in.

   by running the forward pass, the input images (x) can go through the
   neural network and generate a output (out) demonstrating how are the
   likabilities it belongs to each of the 10 classes. for example, a cat
   image can have 0.8 likability to a dog class and a 0.3 likability to a
   airplane class.

   instantiate the fnn

   we now create a real fnn based on our structure.
net = net(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)

   enable gpu

   note: you could enable this line to run the codes on gpu
# net.cuda()    # you can comment out this line to disable gpu

   choose the id168 and optimizer

   id168 (criterion) decides how the output can be compared to a
   class, which determines how good or bad the neural network performs.
   and the optimizer chooses a way to update the weight in order to
   converge to find the best weights in this neural network.
criterion = nn.crossid178loss()
optimizer = torch.optim.adam(net.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)


training the fnn model


   this process might takes around 3 to 5 minutes depending on your
   machine. the detailed explanations are listed as comments (#) in the
   following codes.


testing the fnn model


   similar to training the neural network, we also need to load batches of
   test images and collect the outputs. the differences are that:
    1. no loss & weights calculation
    2. no wights update
    3. has correct prediction calculation

   save the trained fnn model for future use

   we save the trained model as a [46]pickle that can be loaded and used
   later.
torch.save(net.state_dict(),    fnn_model.pkl   )

   congrats. you have done building your first feedforward neural network!


what   s next


   save and close the file. start running the file at the console:
python fnn.py

   you will see the training process going like the following:

   thanks for your time and hope you enjoy the tutorial. all the codes can
   be found [47]here!

   credit: the codes are heavily and thankfully based
   on [48]yunjey   s great [49]codebase.
