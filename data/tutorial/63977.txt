   [95]lda2vec_network_publish_text.gif

   the lda2vec model tries to mix the best parts of id97 and lda into
   a single framework. id97 captures powerful relationships between
   words, but the resulting vectors are largely uninterpretable and don't
   represent documents. lda on the other hand is quite interpretable by
   humans, but doesn't model local word relationships like id97. we
   build a model that builds both word and document topics, makes them
   interpreable, makes topics over clients, times, and documents, and
   makes them supervised topics.

   warning: this code is a big series of experiments. it's research
   software, and we've tried to make it simple to modify lda2vec and to
   play around with your own custom topic models. however, it's still
   research software. i wouldn't run this in production, windows, and i'd
   only use it after you've decided both id97 and lda are inadequate
   and you'd like to tinker with your own cool models :) that said, i
   don't want to discourage experimentation: there's some limited
   documentation, a modicum of unit tests, and some interactive examples
   to get you started.

   see the research paper [96]mixing dirichlet topic models and word
   embeddings to make lda2vec

   see this [97]jupyter notebook for an example of an end-to-end
   demonstration.

   see this [98]slide deck or this [99]youtube video for a presentation
   focused on the benefits of id97, lda, and lda2vec.

   see the [100]api reference docs

about

   [101]images/img00_id97.png

   id97 tries to model word-to-word relationships.

   [102]images/img01_lda.png

   lda models document-to-word relationships.

   [103]images/img02_lda_topics.png

   lda yields topics over each document.

   [104]images/img03_lda2vec_topics01.png

   lda2vec yields topics not over just documents, but also regions.

   [105]images/img04_lda2vec_topics02.png

   lda2vec also yields topics over clients.

   [106]images/img05_lda2vec_topics03_supervised.png

   lda2vec the topics can be 'supervised' and forced to predict another
   target.

   lda2vec also includes more contexts and features than lda. lda dictates
   that words are generated by a document vector; but we might have all
   kinds of 'side-information' that should influence our topics. for
   example, a single client comment is about a particular item id, written
   at a particular time and in a particular region. in this case, lda2vec
   gives you topics over all items (separating jeans from shirts, for
   example) times (winter versus summer) regions (desert versus coastal)
   and clients (sporty vs professional attire).

   ultimately, the topics are interpreted using the excellent pyldavis
   library:
