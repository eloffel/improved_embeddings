   we seem primed to understand linear growth, but lots of processes in
   finance, ecology, physics and other fields depend on exponential
   growth.

   here's a simple visualization to help conceptualize this type of
   growth. it starts off {{opts.ratelabel}} with every step. adjust the
   rate to see {{opts.otherratelabels.join(' and ')}}.

  linear growth

   most of us already have an intuition for linear growth. in the example
   below, each step adds a fixed amount to the total.

  exponential growth

   with exponential growth, on the other hand, each step multiplies the
   total by a fixed amount. so, exponentiation is repeated multiplication
   in the same way that linear growth is repeated addition.

  example

   the following is a naive model of the spread of a virus in a
   population. the number of infected individuals grows exponentially up
   until the virus runs out of people to infect.
