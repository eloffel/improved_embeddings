   principal component analysis (pca) is a technique used to emphasize
   variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. it's often used
   to make data easy to explore and visualize.

                                   2d example

   first, consider a dataset in only two dimensions, like (height,
   weight). this dataset can be plotted as points in a plane. but if we
   want to tease out variation, pca finds a new coordinate system in which
   every point has a new (x,y) value. the axes don't actually mean
   anything physical; they're combinations of height and weight called
   "principal components" that are chosen to give one axes lots of
   variation.

   drag the points around in the following visualization to see pc
   coordinate system adjusts.

   pca is useful for eliminating dimensions. below, we've plotted the data
   along a pair of lines: one composed of the x-values and another of the
   y-values.

   if we're going to only see the data along one dimension, though, it
   might be better to make that dimension the principal component with
   most variation. we don't lose much by dropping pc2 since it contributes
   the least to the variation in the data set.

                                   3d example

   with three dimensions, pca is more useful, because it's hard to see
   through a cloud of data. in the example below, the original data are
   plotted in 3d, but you can project the data into 2d through a
   transformation no different than finding a camera angle: rotate the
   axes to find the best angle. to see the "official" pca transformation,
   click the "show pca" button. the pca transformation ensures that the
   horizontal axis pc1 has the most variation, the vertical axis pc2 the
   second-most, and a third axis pc3 the least. obviously, pc3 is the one
   we drop.

                        eating in the uk (a 17d example)

   original example from mark richardson's class notes [6]principal
   component analysis

   what if our data have way more than 3-dimensions? like, 17 dimensions?!
   in the table is the average consumption of 17 types of food in grams
   per person per week for every country in the uk.

   the table shows some interesting variations across different food
   types, but overall differences aren't so notable. let's see if pca can
   eliminate dimensions to emphasize how countries differ.

   here's the plot of the data along the first principal component.
   already we can see something is different about northern ireland.

   now, see the first and second principal components, we see northern
   ireland a major outlier. once we go back and look at the data in the
   table, this makes sense: the northern irish eat way more grams of fresh
   potatoes and way fewer of fresh fruits, cheese, fish and alcoholic
   drinks. it's a good sign that structure we've visualized reflects a big
   fact of real-world geography: northern ireland is the only of the four
   countries not on the island of great britain. (if you're confused about
   the differences among england, the uk and great britain, see: [7]this
   video.)
