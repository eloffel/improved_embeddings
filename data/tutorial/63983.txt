   eigenvalues/vectors are instrumental to understanding electrical
   circuits, mechanical systems, ecology and even google's [6]id95
   algorithm. let's see if visualization can make these ideas more
   intuitive.

   to begin, let $v$ be a vector (shown as a point) and $a$ be a matrix
   with columns $a_1$ and $a_2$ (shown as arrows). if we multiply $v$ by
   $a$, then $a$ sends $v$ to a new vector $av$.

   if you can draw a line through the three points $(0,0)$, $v$ and $av$,
   then $av$ is just $v$ multiplied by a number $\lambda$; that is, $av =
   \lambda v$. in this case, we call $\lambda$ an eigenvalue and $v$ an
   eigenvector. for example, here $(1,2)$ is an eigvector and $5$ an
   eigenvalue.

   below, change the columns of $a$ and drag $v$ to be an eigenvector.
   note three facts: first, every point on the same line as an eigenvector
   is an eigenvector. those lines are eigenspaces, and each has an
   associated eigenvalue. second, if you place $v$ on an eigenspace
   (either $s_1$ or $s_2$) with associated eigenvalue $\lambda<1$, then
   $av$ is closer to $(0,0)$ than $v$; but when $\lambda>1$, it's farther.
   third, both eigenspaces depend on both columns of $a$: it is not as
   though $a_1$ only affects $s_1$.

what are eigenvalues/vectors good for?

   if you keep multiplying $v$ by $a$, you get a sequence ${ v, av,
   a^2v,}$ etc. eigenspaces attract that sequence and eigenvalues tell you
   whether it ends up at $(0,0)$ or far away. therefore,
   eigenvectors/values tell us about systems that evolve step-by-step.

   let's explore some applications and properties of these sequences.

  fibonacci sequence

   suppose you have some amoebas in a petri dish. every minute, all adult
   amoebas produce one child amoeba, and all child amoebas grow into
   adults (note: this is not really how amoebas reproduce.). so if $t$ is
   a minute, the equation of this system is

   which we can rewrite in matrix form like

   below, press "forward" to step ahead a minute. the total population is
   the [7]fibonacci sequence.

   (button) reset (button) forward

   {{opt.pos[opt.curgen][0]}} {{opt.pos[opt.curgen][0] === 1 ? 'child' :
   'children' }} + {{opt.pos[opt.curgen][1]}} {{opt.pos[opt.curgen][1] ===
   1 ? 'adult' : 'adults' }} = {{opt.pos[opt.curgen][0] +
   opt.pos[opt.curgen][1]}}

   as you can see, the system goes toward the grey line, which is an
   eigenspace with $\lambda = (1+\sqrt 5)/2 > 1$.

  steady states

   suppose that, every year, a fraction $p$ of new yorkers move to
   california and a fraction $q$ of californians move to new york. drag
   the circles to decide these fractions and the number starting in each
   state.

   to understand the system better, we can start by writing it in matrix
   terms like:

   it turns out that a matrix like $a$, whose entries are positive and
   whose columns add up to one (try it!), is called a [8]markov matrix,
   and it always has $\lambda = 1$ as its largest eigenvalue. that means
   there's a value of $v_t$ for which $av_t =\lambda v_t = 1 v_t = v_t$.
   at this "steady state," the same number of people move in each
   direction, and the populations stay the same forever. hover over the
   animation to see the system go to the steady state.

   for more on markov matrices, check out our explanation of [9]markov
   chains.

                              complex eigenvalues

   so far we've only looked at systems with real eigenvalues. but looking
   at the equation $ av = \lambda v$, who's to say $\lambda$ and $v$ can't
   have some imaginary part? that it can't be a [10]complex number? for
   example,

   here, $1+i$ is an eigenvalue and $(1, i)$ is an eigenvector.

   if a matrix has complex eigenvalues, its sequence spirals around
   $(0,0)$. to see this, drag $a$'s columns (the arrows) around until you
   get a spiral. the eigenvalues are plotted in the real/imaginary plane
   to the right. you'll see that whenever the eigenvalues have an
   imaginary part, the system spirals, no matter where you start things
   off.

   about. to learn more, check out the legendary gilbert strang's
   [11]id202 course at mit's open courseware site. to get more
   practice with applications of eigenvalues/vectors, also ceck out the
   excellent [12]differential equations course.
