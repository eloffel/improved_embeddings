   a id155 is the id203 of an event, given some
   other event has already occurred. in the below example, there are two
   possible events that can occur. a ball falling could either hit the red
   shelf (we'll call this event a) or hit the blue shelf (we'll call this
   event b) or both.

   if we know the statistics of these events across the entire population
   and then were to be given a single ball and told "this ball hit the red
   shelf (event a), what's the id203 it also hit the blue shelf
   (event b)?" we could answer this question by providing the conditional
   id203 of b given that a occurred or p(b|a).

   [formula.png]

   p(a) = {{pofa | number:3}} or {{pofa * 100 | number:1}}%

   p(b) = {{pofb | number:3}} or {{pofb * 100 | number:1}}%

   p(a n b) = {{pofaandb | number:3}} or {{pofaandb * 100 | number:1}}%

   p(b|a) = {{ pofbgivena | number:3}} or {{ pofbgivena * 100 |
   number:1}}%

   if we have a ball and we know it hit the red shelf, there's a {{
   pofbgivena * 100 | number:1}}% chance it also hit the blue shelf.

   p(a|b) = {{ pofagivenb | number:3}} or {{ pofagivenb * 100 |
   number:1}}%

   if we have a ball and we know it hit the blue shelf, there's a {{
   pofagivenb * 100 | number:1}}% chance it also hit the red shelf.

   count(a n !b): {{counta}} (balls that hit the red shelf but not the
   blue shelf)

   red shelf)

   count(a n b): {{countab}} (balls that hit both the red shelf and the
   blue shelf)

   count(!a n !b): {{countnone}} (balls that did not hit the red nor blue
   shelf)
