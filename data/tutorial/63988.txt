uriel-phonology

   patrick littell, david r. mortensen, and lori levin (eds.)

   this release represents the source phonological feature data and
   calculated averages from the second release of littel, mortensen, and
   levin (v0.1, december 2015).

features

   all files listed here have a simple tabular format, in csv format, with
   iso 639-3 language identifiers in the first column, and features at the
   top. features are [0.0, 1.0] intervals, with 1.0 representing the
   presence of a segment (e.g., the voiceless interdental fricative),
   class (voiced plosives), or phenomenon (complex syllable onsets). 0.5
   represents a null value.

   for example, the file might look something like:
code, p_bilabials, p_clicks
deu, 1.0, 0.0
eng, 1.0, 0.0

   inv_ features represent the phonetic inventory of the language, and p_
   represents phonological features. features that share names otherwise
   (say, p_voiced_plosives and inv_voiced_plosives) should not be assumed
   to have identical semantics and values. (e.g., the language might have
   phonetic voiced plosives but not have a )

   these files are deduced from feature databases (e.g., wals, phoible)
   and text databases (e.g. ethnologue). each source is given as its own
   csv file.
     * wals.csv -- features derived from the world atlas of language
       structures.
     * ethno.csv -- features derived from (shallowly) parsing the prose
       typological descriptions in ethnologue (lewis et al. 2015).
     * phoible_aa.csv -- aa = alphabets of africa. features derived from
       phoible's id172 of syst  mes alphab  tiques des langues
       africaines (hartell 1993, chanard 2006).
     * phoible_gm.csv -- gm = green and moran. features derived from
       phoible's id172 of christopher green and steven moran's
       pan-african inventory database.
     * phoible-ph.csv -- ph = phoible. features derived from phoible
       proper, by moran, mccloy, and wright (2012).
     * phoible-ra.csv -- ra = ramaswami. features derived from phoible's
       id172 of common linguistic features in indian languages:
       phoentics (ramaswami 1999).
     * phoible-saphon.csv - saphon = south american phonological inventory
       database. features derived from phoible's id172 of saphon
       (lev et al. 2012).
     * phoible-spa.csv - spa = stanford phonology archive. features
       derived from phoible's id172 of spa (crothers et al.,
       1979).
     * phoible-upsid.csv - upsid = ucla phonological segment inventory
       database. features derived from phoible's id172 of upsid
       (maddieson 1984, maddieson and precoda 1990).

avg.csv

   the above sources do not always agree on values. the primary source
   used in phoible_aa might, for example, categorize a particular segment
   in a particular language as velar, whereas phoible_gm might categorize
   it as uvular.

   this file contains the mean of (known) values from sources above. that
   is to say, it is equal to the percentage of sources that valuate the
   feature at 1.0, out of sources that valuate the feature at all. (or,
   the id203 of a feature being 1.0 if a source is chosen at
   random.)

   it is in the same format as the feature charts above.
