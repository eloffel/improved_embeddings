wikt2dict

   wiktionary translation parser tool for many language editions.

   wikt2dict parses only the translation sections. it also has a
   triangulation mode which combines the extracted translation pairs to
   generate new ones.

news

   wikt2dict changed completely, hope for the better. if you would like to
   keep using the old one:
   [71]https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict/tree/a08cc896c22dc78db62e1b79
   0c3ec157d00ad08f
     * changed interface. see below for details (april 2014)
     * added support for german wiktionary (aug 2013)
     * had a poster at the building and using comparable corpora workshop
       (bucc) at acl13, updated bibtex accordingly
          + the paper is available here:
            [72]http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/w/w13/w13-2507.pdf
     * all dictionaries are available here:
       [73]http://nessie.nytud.hu/dict

requirements

   wikt2dict should run on any mainstream linux distribution. it needs
   python2.7 and basic command line tools that should be found on most
   linux distributions (wget, bzcat). if you're working with large
   wiktionaries such as the english wiktionary, you need at least 10gb of
   free space, preferrably more. for all wiktionary editions supported,
   you need about 35gb of free space.

installation

git clone https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict.git
cd wikt2dict
sudo pip install -e .

   you can install wikt2dict in virtualenv if you do not have root access.

   a very quick guide to virtualenv:
virtualenv w2d_env
source w2d_env/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict.git
cd wikt2dict
pip install -e .

   note that this way wikt2dict can only be used once the virtualenv was
   activated. you need to run source w2d_env/bin/activate every time you
   login.

very quick start

   wikt2dict's basic functionalities can be accessed using the w2d.py
   script (which should be directly callable after running pip install).
$ w2d.py -h
wikt2dict

usage:
  w2d.py (download|extract|triangulate|all) (--wikicodes=file|<wc>...)

options:
  -h --help              show this screen.
  --version              show version.
  -w, --wikicodes=file   file containing a list of wikicodes.

   w2d.py currently supports 3+1 actions. all actions need a list of
   wiktionary codes to work with. you can either list the codes manually
   or provide them in a file (--wikicodes option).

   the actions are:
    1. download: download the wiktionary dumps. convert them from xml to
       plaintext with a special page separator. the files are saved in the
       directory specified in
       config.py:wiktionary_defaults['dump_path_base']. the default is
       wikt2dict/dat/wiktionary/
    2. extract: extract translations. the translations are saved to the
       file specified in config.py:wiktionary_defaults['output_path']. by
       default this file is wikt2dict/dat/wiktionary//translation_pairs.
    3. triangulate: use triangulation to generate more translations.
       triangles are saved to the directory
       config.py:wiktionary_defaults['triangle_dir'] in separate files
       named as __. this file would contain pairs in wc1-wc3 languages
       triangulated via wc2. for more information on triangulating, see:
       [74]http://aclweb.org/anthology/w/w13/w13-2507.pdf note that
       triangulating only makes sense if you specify at least 3 languages.
    4. all: do all of the above.

   let's try it out on a few small wiktionary editions.

   downloading the slovak, the slovenian and the occitan wiktionaries:
w2d.py download sk sl li

   the downloaded and textified wiktionaries should appear in
   dat/wiktionary//wiktionary.txt

   extracting translations:
w2d.py extract sk sl li

   the extracted translations should appear in
   dat/wiktionary//translation_pairs.

   now let's try triangulating to get a bunch of new translations:
w2d.py triangulate sk sl li

   the results should appear in dat/triangle/ arranged in subdirectories
   with a maximum of 1000 files per directory to avoid filesystem
   problems. using only 3 such small editions for triangulating does not
   make much sense (it yielded 4 pairs on the april 2014 dumps).

   or do all of it at once:
w2d.py all sk sl li

output

   the output is a tab-separated file. if you only want the translation
   pairs you should just cut the first 4 columns:
cut -f1-4 <output_file> > <dictionary>

   or without wiktionary codes:
cut -f2,4 <output_file> > <dictionary>

   where <output_file> should be replaced by the output of either the
   wiktionary extraction or the triangulating, and is the file where the
   filtered columns are saved.

   the columns explained in details are below.

   the one extracted from the wiktionaries has the following columns:
    1. wiktionary code 1 (language 1)
    2. word or expression in language 1
    3. wiktionary code 2 (language 2)
    4. word or expression in language 2
    5. wiktionary code of the wiktionary from which the pair was extracted
    6. article from which the pair was extracted
    7. type of parser used (you probably don't need this)

   an example:
en      dog     fr      chien   en      dog     defaultparser

   the triangulating output has the following columns:
    1. wiktionary code 1 (language 1)
    2. word or expression in language 1
    3. wiktionary code 2 (language 2)
    4. word or expression in language 2
    5. 5-10. the articles and their source wiktionary that were used to
       generate this pair
       hu kutya oc chin hu kutya el              oc chin

   the pairs are listed with all possible ways they were found. i provided
   a little script to sort, unify and count the number of times one pair
   appears. usage (from wikt2dict base directory):
cat <triangle_files_to_merge> | bash bin/merge_triangle.sh > output_file

   to use with all triangle files:
cat <triangle_dir>/*/* | bash bin/merge_triangle.sh > output_file

   where the <triangle_dir> should be replaced with the directory where
   the individual triangle files are stored (triangle_dir option).

   congratulations, you have successfully finished the test tutorial of
   wikt2dict. please send your feedback to [75]judit@sch.bme.hu.

known bugs

     * fixed - lithuanian and a few other wiktionaries have translation
       tables in many articles not only for lithuanian words and these are
       parsed as they were lithuanian words. language detection for all
       articles should be added. this issue is fixed but configuration
       should be updated.
     * logging is not always accurate

upcoming

     * 4lang coverage, finding translations for a list of words
          + check out our basic vocabulary at:
