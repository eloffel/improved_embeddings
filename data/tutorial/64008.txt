contents

   the directory contents of this distribution are as follows:
     * eval a unix script for evaluating a segmenter.
     * segment unix script for segmenting text
     * build.xml an ant script for building the source
     * log.config a configuration file for java logging used by mincutseg.
       must remain in the base directory.
     * readme.md this documentation
     * ./baselines a directory containing alternative segmenters that can
       be evaluated with this code. due to licensing restrictions, this
       contains only utiyama and isahara's textseg-1.211, which they
       kindly provide on their website.
     * ./classes the compiled java class files
     * ./config configuration files for running various experiments
          + dp.config runs the id145 lexical cohesion system
            described in the paper
          + cue.config runs the cue-phrase mcmc implementation of our
            system, initializing from the results of the dynamic
            programming
            implementation
          + mcsopt.ai.config evaluates the mincutseg segmenter (malioutov
            & barzilay 2006)
          + lcseg.config evaluates the lcseg segmenter. this segmenter is
            not included in this distribution, but may be obtained from
            columbia university using this [86]license.
          + ui.config evaluates utiyama & isahara's segmenter
          + perfect.config runs a "perfect" segmenter that reproduces the
            ground truth. for debugging.
          + stopword.list list of stop words used. from malioutov's
            mincutseg package.
          + cuephrases.hl list of possible cue phrases. based on
            (hirschberg and litman 1993)
     * ./data the medical textbook dataset. each file is a chapter from
       the book, and the chapters are divided into segments using the
       "choi" notation, with segment boundaries indicated by a row of
       equal signs. other punctuation is stripped out.
     * ./doc the javadoc api
     * ./lib library dependencies
          + colt.jar
          + lingpipe-3.4.0.jar
          + log4j-1.2.14.jar
          + mincutseg.jar
          + mtj.jar
          + options.jar
     * ./source the java source files
     * ./results the result output

   this is a java-based, platform-independent implementation. the class
   files provided here require java runtime environment (jre) 6.0 or
   higher. if you have a lower version, you may recompile by running "ant
   rebuild." they have been tested to run when compiled to jre 5.0.

usage: reproducing results

   this system contains code and data necessary to reproduce the
   "textbook" results from the paper. to evaluate a system, type

   ./eval config/configfile

   configfile indicates the name of the configuration file. a separate
   configuration file is included for each segmenter, as described above.

   the command will evaluate the segmenter the following files from the
   textbook dataset: files 001.ref, 101.ref, and 201.ref. you can modify
   the "eval" script to evaluate on other sets of files.

   the system will output:

   a. the set of all options b. the location of all data files c.
   information specific to the segmenter.
   d. the pk and windowdiff for each data file e. the average pk and
   windowdiff

   see the javadoc for edu.mit.nlp.segmenter.mcmc.cucoseg.printstatus()
   for details on the status output of the mcmc segmenter.

usage: segmenting your own text

   to segment a text, provide it through stdin:

   cat filename | ./segment config/configfile

   for example, the command

   cat data/books/clinical/050.ref | ./segment config/dp.config

   will run the bayesian cohesion segmenter with id145 on
   the text file 050.ref. it will output the indices of the last sentences
   in each topic segment.

   the number of segments is read from the file itself. the "segment"
   script shows how to change the desired number of segments, and how to
   get debug output. note that the mcmc cue phrase segmenter was not
   really intended to be run on individual documents, and may not work
   well for this purpose.

building instructions

   the build system uses jakarta ant framework
   ([87]http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/).

   to build in unix, set your current working directory to the root
   directory of the distribution, where the file "build.xml" is located,
   and enter the command "ant build", optionally followed by target name
   (build, clean, save or docs)

   this code is copyright 2008 by the massachusetts instute of technology

hierarchical segmentation

   the hierarchical segmenter from the paper j. eisenstein. hierarchical
   text segmentation from multi-scale lexical cohesion. in proceedings of
   the north american chapter of the association for computational
   linguistics (naacl), boulder, co, 2009.
