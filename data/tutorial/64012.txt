segmentation evaluation using segeval[8]  

   a package providing text segmentation id74 and utilities.
   ([9]installation)

   text segmentation is the task of splitting up any amount of text into
   segments by placing boundaries between some atomic unit (e.g.,
   morphemes, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, sections, etc.). it   s a
   common pre-processing step in many [10]natural language processing
   (nlp) tasks.

   e.g., if we were to perform both manual and automatic
   [11]syllabification of words, one may need a way to compare how close
   the automatic solution is to the manual one. for this, we can use
   boundary id153 and boundary similarity. [12]evaluating a
   hypothetical automatic syllabifier, we can obtain the results shown
   below.
   word manual solution automatic solution boundary id153 boundary
   similarity
   automatic au  to  ma  tic au  tom  a  tic 2 matches, 1 near 0.83
   segmentation seg  men  ta  tion seg  ment  ation 1 match, 1 near, 1 miss
   0.50
   is is is no edits 1.00
   fun fun f  un 1 miss 0.00

   this package is a collection of metrics and for comparing text
   segmentations and evaluating automatic text segmenters. both new
   (boundary similarity, segmentation similarity) and traditional
   (windowdiff, pk) are included, as well as inter-coder agreement
   coefficients and confusion matrices based upon a boundary edit
   distance.

   for more examples of how to use segeval, see    [13]an initial study of
   topical poetry segmentation   .
   release: 2.0.11 ([14]changelog)
    date:   may 13, 2017

feature support[15]  

   a variety of segmentation comparison metrics are implemented,
   including:
     * boundary id153 (bed; [16][fournier2013])
     * boundary similarity (b; [17][fournier2013])
     * bed-based confusion matrices (and precision/recall/f1;
       [18][fournier2013])
     * segmentation similarity (s; [19][fournierinkpen2012])
     * windowdiff [20][pevznerhearst2002]
     * pk [21][beefermanberger1999]

   additionally, b-based inter-coder agreement coefficients for
   segmentation that are suitable for 2 or more coders are provided,
   including:
     * fleiss    \pi [22][fleiss1971] (i.e., siegel and castellan   s k
       [23][siegelcastellan1988])
     * fleiss    \kappa [24][daviesfleiss1982]

user guide[25]  

   this part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some
