learn audio beat tracking for music information retrieval (with python codes)

   [97]faizan shaikh, february 14, 2018

introduction

   music is all around us. whenever we hear any music that connects to our
   heart and mind     we lose ourselves to it. subconsciously, we tap along
   with the beats we hear. you must have noticed your foot automatically
   follows along with the beats of that music. there is no logical
   explanation as to why we do this. it   s just that we fall into the
   groove of the music and our mind starts to resonate with the tunes.

   what if we could train an artificial system that could catch the rhythm
   as we do? a cool application could be to build an expressive humanoid
   robot that runs a real-time beat tracking algorithm, enabling it to
   stay in sync with the music as it dances.

   looks interesting right?

   in this article, we will understand the concept of beats, and the
   challenges we face trying to track it. then we will go through the
   approaches of solving the problem, along with the state-of-the-art
   solutions in the industry.

   note : this article assumes that you have basic knowledge of audio data
   analysis in python. if not, you can [99]go through this article and
   then have a go on this.

overview of beat tracking

what is beat tracking?

   audio beat tracking is commonly defined as determining the time
   instances in an audio recording, where a human listener is likely to
   tap his/her foot to the music. audio beat tracking enables the
      beat-synchronous    analysis of music.

   being an important and relevant mir task, research has been rampant in
   this area. the goal of the automatic beat tracking task is to track all
   beat locations in a collection of sound files and output these beat
   onset times for each file.

   to give you an intuition of the task, download and listen to the below
   audio file:

   [100]https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3x8572w6h8?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750


   now check out the audio below which has annotated timings for the
   respective beats.

   &height=750



applications of beat tracking

   there are numerous applications of beat tracking, but the most
   intriguing for me is beat synchronous light effects. check out the
   video below for a real life demonstration.

   [102]https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjxzdmjpmhu?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750

   on a more technical note, beat tracking could be used to for music
   information retrieval tasks such as music transcription. for example,
   you can annotate the beat of drums     so that it can then be shared with
   other music creators and enthusiasts

   [103]https://www.youtube.com/embed/isbbkxv9h3s?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750

   other applications of beat tracking include:
     * music classification/recommendation on the basis of beats
     * audio performance analysis
     * audio editing for a digital dj

challenges in beat tracking

   beat tracking may sound like a straightforward concept, but it   s
   actually an unsolved problem till now. for a simple tune, an algorithm
   may easily figure out the beats from the music. but often in real life,
   audio is much more complex and can be noisy. for example, there may be
   noise from the environment which could befuddle an algorithm and lead
   it to produce false positives while detecting beats.
   technically speaking, there are three major challenges when dealing
   with beat tracking:
    1. unclear pulse level
    2. sudden tempo changes
    3. vague/noisy information

approaches to solve beat tracking

   we now have a gist of what audio beat tracking is. so let us have a
   look at the approaches that are used to solve the challenge.

   there is an annual evaluation campaign for music information retrieval
   algorithms, coupled to the ismir conference, called music information
   retrieval evaluation exchange (mirex). it has a task called audio beat
   tracking. researchers participate in mirex and submit their approaches.
   here i will explain two of those approaches. the first one is simple
   and the most primitive, whereas the second one is state-of-the-art.


approach 1: onset detection and id145

   suppose we have an audio such as this given below:

   what we can do is, find out the locations where there is a sudden burst
   of sound (aka onset) and mark those moments of time:

   this is most likely to be the representations of the beat. but it would
   contain many false positives, such as vocal sound of a person or
   background noise. so to minimize these false positives, we can find the
   longest common subsequence of these onsets to identify the beats. if
   you want to get into the details of how id145 works, you
   can [104]refer this article.

   we will look at an implementation below to have a more clearer
   perspective.
# import modules
import librosa
import ipython.display as ipd

# read audio file
x, sr = librosa.load('media-103515.wav')
ipd.audio(x, rate=sr)

   iframe:
   [105]https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3x8572w6h8?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750

# approach 1 - onset detection and id145
tempo, beat_times = librosa.beat.beat_track(x, sr=sr, start_bpm=60, units='time'
)
clicks = librosa.clicks(beat_times, sr=sr, length=len(x))
ipd.audio(x + clicks, rate=sr)


   iframe:
   [106]https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehzgeb3npkw?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750


approach 2: ensemble of recurrent neural networks coupled with dynamic
id110

   instead of relying on sound cues manually, we can use a machine
   learning/deep learning approach. shown below is an architecture of the
   framework for solving beat tracking. to get into the nitty-gritty of
   it, you can read the official research paper.

   the gist of the approach is this     we preprocess the audio signal, and
   then use recurrent neural network to find out the most probable values
   of these beat times. the researchers additionally use a committee of
   recurrent neural networks (id56), and then ensemble their outputs using
   a id110.

   multimodel

   madmom library contains the implementation of various state of the art
   algorithms in the field of beat tracking and is available on
   [107]github. it incorporates low-level feature extraction and
   high-level feature analysis based on machine learning methods. the code
   for approach 2 is available in this repository as python files which
   output the beat locations from an input audio file.

   let   s look at an implementation in python:
# import modules
import madmom

# approach 2 - dbn tracker
proc = madmom.features.beats.dbnbeattrackingprocessor(fps=100)
act = madmom.features.beats.id56beatprocessor()('train/train1.wav')

beat_times = proc(act)

clicks = librosa.clicks(beat_times, sr=sr, length=len(x))
ipd.audio(x + clicks, rate=sr)

   iframe:
   [108]https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfymumocz58?feature=oembed&width=500
   &height=750


   lets get into the details of the approach we just saw. there are four
   steps you perform to get audio beats from a music signal.

step 1: preprocessing audio signal

   as with all the unstructured data, an artificial system does not grasp
   the concept of audio signal easily. so it has to be converted in a
   format that is explainable to a machine learning model (viz
   preprocessing the data). as mentioned in the image below, there are
   quite a few methods which you can use to preprocess an audio data.


step 2: training and fine tuning the id56 models

   now that you have preprocessed the data, you can apply a machine
   learning/deep learning model to decipher the patterns in the data.

   theoretically, if you train a single deep learning model with enough
   training examples and a proper architecture, it could perform well on
   the problem. but this is not always possible, due to reasons such as
   insufficient training data availability etc. so to boost the
   performance, what we can do is to train multiple id56 models on a single
   genre of music files, so that it can catch the patterns in that genre
   itself. this helps to mitigate some of the data insufficiency problems.

   for this approach, we first train an [109]lstm model (a improved
   version of id56) and set it as our base model. then we fine tune
   multiple lstm models derived from our base model. this fine tuning is
   done on different genres of musical sequences. at test time, we pass
   the audio signal from all the models.

step 3: choosing the best id56 model

   at this step, we simply chose that model which has the least error
   among all the models, by comparing them with the score we get from the
   base model.

step 4: applying dynamic id110

   regardless of you use one lstm or multiple lstms, there is a
   fundamental shortcoming: the final peak-finding stage does not try to
   find a global optimum when selecting the final locations of the beats.
   it rather determines the dominant tempo of the piece (or a segment of
   certain length) and then aligns the beat positions according to this
   tempo by simply choosing the best start position and then progressively
   locating the beats at positions with the highest activation function
   values in a certain region around the pre-determined position.

   to circumvent this problem, we feed the output of the chosen neural
   network model into a dynamic id110 (dbn) which jointly
   infers tempo and phase of a beat sequence. another advantage of using
   dbns is that we are able to model both beat and non-beat states, which
   was shown to perform superior to the case where only beat states are
   modelled. i will not go into the full description of how dbns work, but
   you can refer [110]this video if you are interested.

   this is how we get the beats of a musical sequence from raw audio
   signals.


end notes

   i hope this article gave you an intuition of how to solve a beat
   tracking problem in python. this has potential applications in the
   music information retrieval domain, where we can identify similar kinds
   of music using the beat rhythm we get while tracking it. if you have
   any comments/suggestions do let me know in the comments below!

       thanks for this article. very interesting !
       do you know if there are some clues to figure out all the
       instruments composing a song ?
       the usage i imagine is to be able to auto create tablature and
       partitions for musician by simply playing a song.

            interesting idea. there has actually been some work done in
            this area (technically called audio source separation). check
