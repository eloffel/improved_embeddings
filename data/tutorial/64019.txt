poincar   embeddings for representing hierarchical data

   by [47]soham chatterjee | february 14, 2018

   neural networks are able to understand and work with numerical data.
   however, there is no easy way to convert the data into numbers when it
   comes to text and graphical data.

   one of the ways that we got around this problem was by creating
   embeddings for words and graphs. embeddings of a word or a node in a
   graph are vectors of numbers that contain all the information that is
   necessary for a neural network to understand it. this means is that the
   embeddings of two contextually similar words will be similar and thus
   have a very large product. embeddings were invented very recently and
   they are now the go-to way to create efficient representations of words
   and graphs.

   similarly, nodes that are close together in a graph will have a lesser
   distance in a two-dimensional embedding space.

   all these embeddings are learned and represented in a euclidean space;
   therefore, it is safe to argue that all types of embeddings are limited
   by the mathematics and dimensionality of euclidean spaces.

   the authors of the paper    [48]poincar   embeddings for learning
   hierarchical representations    argue that learning embeddings in a
   hyperbolic plane will improve the quality of the learned
   representations while also reducing the number of dimensions needed to
   create an efficient representation.

   in this article, i   ll talk about problems in the euclidean plane
   representations and explain how hyperbolic poincar   embeddings work.
   i   ll then show you how to train a small text corpus on poincar  
   embeddings and we   ll analyze the results.

   euclidean embeddings and hyperbolic spaces

   all forms of embeddings or representations used currently are in
   euclidean space. euclidean space is something that we deal with the
   most. this means that all lines are straight and can be extended
   indefinitely and distances between two points remain the same no matter
   how far you go from the origin. think cartesian coordinates.

   the definition for euclidean geometry was given by euclid way back in
   ad 125. the definition had 5 postulates. while the first four
   postulates were easy to understand and prove, the fifth postulate
   caused a lot of problems. after nearly 2 thousand years, the fifth
   postulate is still unproven.

   hyperbolic geometry was invented in a rage after geometers could not
   prove the 5th postulate that euclid gave. in a last-ditch effort, they
   invented a new kind of geometry in which the fifth postulate would
   always be true.

   hyperbolic spaces are a bit more complicated and less intuitive to
   understand.

            figure 1
   figure 2


   the image in figure 1 shows a hyperbolic surface that has been
   projected onto a euclidean surface. the reference point is taken as the
   center of the circle and the outer edge is at an infinite distance
   away. distances on the circle increase by a factor of e (euler   s
   constant) as we go further from the center.

   the distance between points a and b on two circles are further apart,
   the further they are from the center. in fact, the shortest line to
   join the two would be a curved line as drawn in figure 2.

   because of this, the distances from a point on different parts of the
   poincar   plane increases as we move away from the center.

   figure 3 illustrates that very well.


   figure 3



   in the first image, we can see that the distance of all points from the
   center increases uniformly. however, as we move away from the center,
   the distances increase dramatically. in the last image, the distances
   from the points even a small distance away are nearly infinite.

   to make things simpler, think of the moon. the moon is a sphere (we
   only see a half-sphere) that our eyes see as a 2d surface. so, the
   distance between two points is actually greater towards the edges of
   the moon than in the center.

   problems with euclidean embeddings

   the biggest problem with embeddings in a euclidean space is that the
   embeddings are limited to the dimensionality of euclidean spaces.
   moreover, when it comes to embedding graph data, we have to model the
   complex connections of nodes. the authors argue that the ability of a
   model to learn and generalize becomes better as we increase the
   representation capacity of the network. put simply, it means that the
   model is better able to capture important features if we increase the
   dimensionality of the embeddings.

   however, increasing the dimensions becomes very expensive
   computationally. we cannot reduce the dimensions as it will lead to a
   loss in important features.

   on the other hand, a hyperbolic plane has a constant negative
   curvature. this makes it perfect to represent graphical and
   hierarchical data. in fact, it has been shown that an infinite tree can
   be represented in a finite hyperbolic space (remember that the edge of
   the circle is at an infinite distance away).

   moreover, since distances in the poincar   ball increase exponentially,
   then it becomes easy to model trees that have an exponentially
   increasing number of children. this can be done in only two dimensions.

   as we will see in the next section, it is these properties of
   hyperbolic space that the author has exploited to come up with better
   representations of graph or hierarchical data.

   hyperbolic embeddings

   to figure out how the embeddings work, we   ll take a look at a
   hierarchical dataset: the mammalian family dataset.

   we want our embeddings to do the following:
    1. data with similar semantic meaning should be close together in the
       embedding space.
    2. nodes that are connected should be placed close together and nodes
       that are not connected should be placed far apart in the embedding
       space.
    3. nodes that are lower in the hierarchy to the reference node should
       be far away from the origin.
    4. all this should be learned in an unsupervised fashion.

   other than this, it would be an added bonus if our embeddings could:
    1. learn better embeddings with decreased runtime and memory
       complexity.
    2. gain more insight as to the structure of the data and the
       relationships between the different entities in the data.

   as mentioned before, the authors have done the training in a
   poincar  -ball model. they have chosen this because it is more suitable
   for gradient-based optimization (differentiation is easy and because
   the results can be easily visualized and understood).

   for a unit d-dimensional space in the hyperbolic space h, the poincar  
   unit ball is given by:

   here, x is the euclidean norm. the distance between two different
   points u and v, in the poincar   plane is given as:

   to perform an update, we have to differentiate the above equation. the
   partial derivative of the above equation is given by:

   the update for each embedding is then made as follows:

   for training, the embeddings are initialized randomly, but all are
   initialized close to the origin. this works better than random
   initialization as the model is supposed to learn by penalizing a high
   value for unconnected nodes.

   the model is also, therefore, trained with a progressively increasing
   learning rate.

   but what about the accuracy?

   to evaluate the model, two metrics are used:
    1. rank, which is the mean of the distances between the points u and
       v, and the ground truth realities; and
    2. mean average precision (map) of the ranking.

   the results are given in the following table:

   the model in the paper was trained on the id138 dataset. the
   highlighted cells show the best results for euclidean embedding and the
   poincar   embedding which achieves an equivalent result. the bold cells
   show the best results.

   it is evident that the poincar   model learns an equivalent result in a
   very small 5 dimensional space, thus reducing computational complexity.
   in case of link prediction, the model learns an optimal representation
   in less than 50 dimensions when it takes close to 50 dimensions in case
   of euclidean space.

   implementation

   we are going to use genism to implement a poincar   embedding on a
   dataset of mammalian animals. the dataset can be found [49]here. it
   consists of a single unique relation among two different entities on
   each line of the dataset.

   to train a poincar   embedding on this dataset, we can use the following
   lines of code:

   from gensim.models.poincare import poincaremodel, poincarerelations
   from gensim.test.utils import datapath
   file_path = datapath('poincare_hypernyms.tsv')
   model = poincaremodel(poincarerelations(file_path), negative=2)
   model.train(epochs=50)

   here, datapath returns the path of the dataset.

   poincar   model defines the model that we are training. it takes as
   parameters the path to the dataset; size, which defines the number of
   dimensions of the trained model and alpha which specifies the learning
   rate. negative specifies the number of negative samples to use.

   epochs specify the number of epochs that we want to train our model
   for.

   after the model is trained, we can test it by running a small script to
   find the most similar nodes to a certain node:

   vectors.most_similar('lion.n.01')

   it should give a result like:

   [('lion_cub.n.01', 0.4484), ('lionet.n.01', 0.6552), ...]
   you can also find the similarity between different nodes as follows:

   model.similarity('mammal.n.01', 'carnivore.n.01')
   it should return a number like 0.73.

   to visualize the results on a 2d plane, we can use this:

   from gensim.viz.poincare import poincare_2d_visualization,
   poincare_distance_heatmap

   show_node_labels = [
   'mammal.n.01', 'placental.n.01', 'ungulate.n.01', 'carnivore.n.01', 'ro
   dent.n.01',
   'canine.n.02', 'even-toed_ungulate.n.01', 'odd-toed_ungulate.n.01', 'el
   ephant.n.01',
   'rhinoceros.n.01', 'german_shepherd.n.01', 'feline.n.01', 'tiger.n.02',
    'homo_sapiens.n.01']
   poincare_2d_visualization(model, tree, figure_title,
   show_node_labels=show_node_labels)


   poincare_2d_visualization() returns a plotly figure that contains the
   plot for the embeddings.

   based on how your model is trained, it should return a similar to the
   graph in figure 4:

                                       figure 4

   conclusion

   poincar   embeddings are still in their nascent phase. the authors of
   the paper have mentioned that they have tested only one method of
   embeddings. however, there can be other methods too, which can give
   similar, or even better, results.
