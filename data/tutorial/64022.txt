visualize the entire deep learning process thanks to visualdl

   [96]pranav dar, february 15, 2018

   a python library, called visualdl, can now visualize the deep learning
   process for us. it   s an incredibly powerful visualization tool that
   helps us design deep learning jobs.


   source: visualdl

   most deep neural networks these days are using python as their primary
   language. keeping this in mind, visualdl was built to support python.
   just by adding a few lines of python code and inserting them into our
   neural network model, we can generate plenty of visualizations to
   understand the framework.

   visualdl has also been written in low level c++.

   currently, visualdl provides four components (more will be added soon):
     * graph
     * scalar
     * image
     * histogram

   let   s look at these in a bit more detail.


graph

   this is compatible with the open neural network exchange. in fact,
   visualdl is compatible with most deep neural network frameworks,
   including pytorch.


scalar

   one of the most useful components, scalar shows us the error trends
   during the training of the model.


image

   the image component can be utilised to visualize any tensor or
   intermediate generated image.


histogram

   histogram is used to visualize the distribution of parameters and
   trends for any tensor.


   just write the below code to install visualdl in python:
pip install --upgrade visualdl

   to give it a quick test run, run the below code:
vdl_create_scratch_log
visualdl --logdir=scratch_log --port=8080

   you can access the source code and other details about this library on
   their official github page [97]here.


our take on this

   this is a pretty fascinating tool that gives the user a deeper insight
   into the deep learning process. visualization has always been a go-to
   technique for data scientists when they   re stuck on an error, or want
   to understand what exactly is going on behind neural network they   re
   training. this wonderfully adaptive tool is a dream for them. and the
   even more exciting part is that new features are being added as we
   write this. definitely one to look out for and we highly recommend you
   follow the page on github.
