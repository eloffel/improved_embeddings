interpretable machine learning through teaching

   we've designed a method that encourages ais to teach each other with
   examples that also make sense to humans. our approach automatically
   selects the most informative examples to teach a concept     for
   instance, the best images to describe the concept of dogs     and
   experimentally we found our approach to be effective at teaching both
   ais and humans.

   [11]paper

   some of the most transformative applications of powerful ai will come
   from computers and humans collaborating, but getting them to speak a
   common language is hard. think about trying to guess the shape of a
   rectangle when you   re only shown a collection of random points inside
   that rectangle: it   s much faster to figure out the correct dimensions
   of the rectangle when you   re given points at the corners of the
   rectangle instead. our machine teaching approach works as a cooperative
   game played between two agents, with one functioning as a student and
   the other as a teacher. the goal of the game is for the student to
   guess a particular concept (i.e.    dog   ,    zebra   ) based on examples of
   that concept (such as images of dogs), and the goal of the teacher is
   to learn to select the most illustrative examples for the student.

   random-vs-teacher-2
   it's far more efficient to teach someone the dimensions of a rectangle
   by defining the opposing points (right), rather than scattering points
   randomly within its borders (left).

   our two-stage technique works like this: a 'student' neural network is
   given randomly selected input examples of concepts and is trained from
   those examples using traditional supervised learning methods to guess
   the correct concept labels. in the second step, we let the 'teacher'
   network     which has an intended concept to teach and access to labels
   linking concepts to examples     to test different examples on the
   student and see which concept labels the student assigns them,
   eventually converging on the smallest set of examples it needs to give
   to let the student guess the intended concept. these examples end up
   looking interpretable because they are still grounded to the concepts
   (via the student trained in step one).

   in contrast, if we train the student and teacher jointly (as is done in
   a lot of current communication games), the student and teacher can
   collude to communicate via arbitrary examples that do not make sense to
   humans. for instance, the concept of a "dog" might end up being encoded
   through some arbitrary vectors that may be showing images of llamas and
   motorcycles, or a rectangle could be composed of two dots that look
   random to a human, but encode a specific rectangle's dimensions.

   to understand why our technique works, consider what happens when we
   use our method to teach the student to recognize concepts from example
   images that vary based on four properties: size (small, medium, large),
   color (red, blue, green), shape (square vs circle), and border (solid
   vs none).

   shape-types

   in this case, a concept is a set of properties that define a subset of
   the examples as belonging to that concept; for example, if the concept
   is red circles, then red circles of any size or border fit the concept.
   our teacher network eventually learns to pick examples whose only
   common properties are the ones required by the concept, so that the
   student can rule out the irrelevant properties. to impart the concept
   of    red   , for instance, our teacher selects a large red square with no
   border and then a small red circle with a border. the only property the
   two shapes have in common is red, so the concept must only consist of
   red.

   shape-examples-2
   our system learns to pick examples that efficiently teach concepts to
   students.

   this approach works across boolean, hierarchical, probabilistic, and
   rule-based concepts, with the teaching techniques invented by the
   teacher network frequently mirroring optimal strategies designed by
   humans. we also evaluated our approach on humans by giving them
   examples generated by the teacher network. we found that human subjects
   on mechanical turk given examples by our machine teacher were able to
   guess the correct concept more often than if they'd just been presented
   with random examples to guide them.

   while we only looked at teaching via examples in this work, the ideas
   can apply to the creation of interpretable communication between agents
   or other ways in which we would wish to make interaction between agents
   to be more understandable by humans. if you   re interested in working on
   such efforts, consider [12]joining openai!
