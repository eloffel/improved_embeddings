   see what's available in the freely-available book "data science at the
   command line" by digging into data exploration in the terminal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [36]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

                                                            c [37]comments

   book image the tools for data science are many and varied, and span a
   variety of ecosystems. python and r tend to be some of the more popular
   programming environments, but there are many other options, including a
   plethora of programming and scripting languages, gui- and web-based
   tools.

   one of the less considered modes of attack is a strictly command line
   approach. sure, you use the command line to execute your python
   scripts, or run your c program, or invoke your r environment... or
   whatever else you might do with it. but what about running the entire
   show from the terminal?

   answering that question is [38]jeroen janssens, the author of the now
   freely-available book "[39]data science at the command line." from the
   book's website:

     this hands-on guide demonstrates how the flexibility of the command
     line can help you become a more efficient and productive data
     scientist. you   ll learn how to combine small, yet powerful,
     command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your
     data.
     ...
     discover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible
     technology. even if you   re already comfortable processing data with,
     say, python or r, you   ll greatly improve your data science workflow
     by also leveraging the power of the command line.

   aside from writing a thorough survey of command line tools for doing
   data science, jeroen has also put together a [40]docker image with over
   80 related tools, those which are covered within the book.

   [41]chapter 7 of "data science at the command line" is titled
   "exploring data," focusing on using command line tools at the third
   step of the [42]osemn model.

         https://www.slideshare.net/snungd/big-data-in-public-safety
                            osemn model (source).

     exploring your data can be done from three perspectives. the first
     perspective is to inspect the data and its properties. here, we want
     to know, for example, what the raw data looks like, how many data
     points the data set has, and what kind of features the data set has.

     the second perspective from which we can explore out data is to
     compute descriptive statistics. this perspective is useful for
     learning more about the individual features. one advantage of this
     perspective is that the output is often brief and textual and can
     therefore be printed on the command line.

     the third perspective is to create visualizations of the data. from
     this perspective we can gain insight into how multiple features
     interact. we   ll discuss a way of creating visualizations that can be
     printed on the command line. however, visualizations are best suited
     to be displayed on a graphical user interfaces. an advantage of
     visualizations over descriptive statistics is that they are more
     flexible and that they can convey much more information.

   here's a quick taste of what you can accomplish exploring data at the
   command line.

   first, you will need to install python3-csvkit:
$ sudo apt install python3-csvkit

   then, download a csv file to play with:
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.c
sv

   we can print the first few lines of iris.csv with head:
$ head iris.csv

sepal_length,sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width,species
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,setosa
4.9,3,1.4,0.2,setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,setosa
5,3.6,1.4,0.2,setosa
5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,setosa
4.6,3.4,1.4,0.3,setosa
5,3.4,1.5,0.2,setosa
4.4,2.9,1.4,0.2,setosa

   handy. but with csvlook (part of python3-csvkit), you get something a
   bit more tabular:
$ head iris.csv | csvlook

|---------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------|
|  sepal_length | sepal_width | petal_length | petal_width | species  |
|---------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------|
|  5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  4.9          | 3           | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  4.7          | 3.2         | 1.3          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  4.6          | 3.1         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  5            | 3.6         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  5.4          | 3.9         | 1.7          | 0.4         | setosa   |
|  4.6          | 3.4         | 1.4          | 0.3         | setosa   |
|  5            | 3.4         | 1.5          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|  4.4          | 2.9         | 1.4          | 0.2         | setosa   |
|---------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+----------|

   much nicer. want to look at the entire file? while i have always piped
   the output of cat into more:
$ cat iris.csv | more

   ... jeroen advocates using less, a more versatile command line tool
   that operates in the style of the vi text editor. it allows for moving
   around within the text file using a series of single key commands. give
   it a try ('q' is for quit when you are finished looking):
$ iris.csv csvlook | less -s

   want to know the dataset's attribute names? easy, with the special
   editor sed:
$ < iris.csv sed -e 's/,/\n/g;q'

sepal_length
sepal_width
petal_length
petal_width
species

   great. what about more attribute metadata?
$ csvstat iris.csv

  1. sepal_length

        nulls: false
        min: 4.3
        max: 7.9
        sum: 876.5000000000002
        mean: 5.843333333333335
        median: 5.8
        standard deviation: 0.8253012917851412
        unique values: 35
        5 most frequent values:
                5.0:    10
                6.3:    9
                5.1:    9
                6.7:    8
                5.7:    8
...

   how about something like unique attribute value counts within the
   dataset?
$ csvstat iris.csv --unique

  1. sepal_length: 35
  2. sepal_width: 23
  3. petal_length: 43
  4. petal_width: 22
  5. species: 3

   depending on how comfortable or reliant you are on the command line (or
   are willing to become), you can delve into more advanced concepts such
   as creating bash scripts with numerous commands working in sequence.
   this, however, moves from "command line" data science into the more
   familiar realm of scripting, but with bash instead of, for example,
   python. you could also do something in between, such as creating a
   library of bash snippets as functions and adding them to your .bashrc
   config file, in order to call them from the command line repetitively
   on different data. the possibilities are limited only by your
   imagination and skill.

   this is just a taste of what you can find in [43]chapter 7 of "data
   science at the command line," which, in turn, only touches on the
   wealth of information that the book holds.

   regardless of how you look at it, having command line skills at your
   disposal are invaluable. in that vein, you should give this book a
   chance.
