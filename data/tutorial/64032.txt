   chatting with a deep learning brain

   this is a demo of chatting with a deep learning chatbot trained through
   [1]neuralconvo, a torch library that implements [2]sequence to sequence
   learning with neural networks (id195), reproducing the results in the
   [3]neural conversational model paper (aka the google chatbot).

   the google    neural conversational model    chatbot was discussed at
   length by [4]wired, [5]motherboard and [6]more. here you can try it out
   for real. you might have fun     

   the medium post about this experiment is here: [7]chatting with a deep
   learning chatbot. this was built as a fun side project by julien
   chaumond and cl  ment delangue, co-founders at hugging face (    ) and part
   of betaworks' [8]botcamp.
