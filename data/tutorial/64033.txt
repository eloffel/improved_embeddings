aaas ama: hi, we   re researchers from google, microsoft, and facebook who
study artificial intelligence. ask us anything!

   [rendertimingpixel.png]
   [31]the future (and present) of artificial intelligence ama

   are you on a first-name basis with siri, cortana, or your google
   assistant? if so, you   re both using ai and helping researchers like us
   make it better.

   until recently, few people believed the field of artificial
   intelligence (ai) existed outside of science fiction. today, ai-based
   technology pervades our work and personal lives, and companies large
   and small are pouring money into new ai research labs. the present
   success of ai did not, however, come out of nowhere. the applications
   we are seeing now are the direct outcome of 50 years of steady
   academic, government, and industry research.

   we are private industry leaders in ai research and development, and we
   want to discuss how ai has moved from the lab to the everyday world,
   whether the field has finally escaped its past boom and bust cycles,
   and what we can expect from ai in the coming years.

   ask us anything!

   eh: thanks everyone. i'd love to answer more of these great questions.
   i really appreciate people taking the time to engage.

   cortana is telling me with an alert on my laptop (complete with an
   explanatory map--per that question on ai and explanation that i wish i
   had time to get to :-)) that i have to leave now for the airport to
   make it back to seattle tonight. i know that cortana is calling our
   predictive models (build via the clearflow project), so i trust the
   id136s! would love to catch up with folks in other forums, or
   perhaps in person.

   best, eric

   a lot of research in ml now seems to have shifted towards deep
   learning.
    1. do you think that this has any negative effects on the diversity of
       research in ml?
    2. should research in other paradigms such as probabilistic graphical
       models, id166s, etc be abandoned completely in favor of deep
       learning? perhaps models such as these which do not perform so well
       right now may perform well in future, just like deep learning in
       the 90's.

   ylc: as we make progress towards better ai, my feeling is that deep
   learning is part of the solution. the idea that you can assemble
   parameterized modules in complex (possibly dynamic) graphs and
   optimizes the parameters from data is not going away. in that sense,
   deep learning won't go away for as long as we don't find an efficient
   way to optimize parameters that doesn't use gradients. that said, deep
   learning, as we know it today, is insufficient for "full" ai. i've been
   fond to say that with the ability to define dynamic deep architectures
   (i.e. computation graphs that are defined procedurally and whose
   structure changes for every new input) is a generalization of deep
   learning that some have called differentiable programming.

   but really, we are missing at least two things: (1) learning machines
   that can reason, not just perceive and classify, (2) learning machines
   that can learn by observing the world, without requiring human-curated
   training data, and without having to interact with the world too many
   times. some call this unsupervised learning, but the phrase is too
   vague.

   the kind of learning we need our machines to do is that kind of
   learning human babies and animals do: they build models of the world
   largely by observation, and with a remarkably small amount of
   interaction. how do we do that with machines? that's the challenge of
   the next decade.

   regarding question 2: there is no opposition between deep learning and
   id114. you can very well have id114, say factor
   graphs, in which the factors are entire neural nets. those are
   orthogonal concepts. people have built probabilistic programming
   frameworks on top of deep learning framework. look at uber's pyro,
   which is built on top of pytorch (probabilistic programming can be seen
   as a generalization of id114 theway differentiable
   programming is a generalization of deep learning). turns it's very
   useful to be able to back-propagate gradients to do id136 in
   id114. as for id166/kernel methods, trees, etc have a use when
   the data is scarce and can be manually featurized.

   imho saying that the baby is learning from a small set of data is a bit
   misleading. the mammalian brain has evolved over an extremely long
   time. there is so many examples of instinctual behavior in nature that
   it seems like a lot has already been learned before birth. so if you
   include evolutionary development, then the baby's brain has been
   trained on a significant amount of training data. the analogy is more
   like taking an already highly optimized model then training it on a
   little bit more live data.

   how do you mean babies learn with small amounts of interaction? isn   t
   all the emotional urges that get triggered kind of comparable to
   training data? it tells the infant which information is important and
   which isn   t. or am i missing the point?

   eh: there   s a lot of excitement about the power delivered by deep
   neural networks for doing classification and prediction. it   s certainly
   been wonderful to see the boosts in accuracy with applications with
   object recognition, id103, translation, and with even
   learning about best actions to take, when the methods have been coupled
   with ideas from planning and id23. however, ai is a
   broad area with fabulous and promising subdisciplines -- and the ml
   subdiscipline of ai is also broad in itself.

   we need to continue to invest deeply in the span of promising ai
   technologies (and links among advances in each) including the wealth of
   great work in probabilistic id114 and decision-theoretic
   analyses, logical id136 and reasoning, planning, algorithmic game
   theory, metareasoning and control of id136, etc., etc., and also
   broader pursuits, e.g., models of bounded rationality   how limited
   agents can do well in the open world (a particular passion of mine).

   we   ve made a point at microsoft research, while pushing hard on dnns
   (exciting work there), to invest in talent and projects in ai more
   broadly--as we have done since our inception in 1991. we   re of course
   also interested in how we might understand how to combine logical
   id136 and dnns and other forms of machine learning, e.g., check out
   our work on program synthesis for an example of dnns + logic to
   automated the generation of programming (from examples). we see great
   opportunity at some of these syntheses!

   which careers do you see being replaced by ai and which seem safe for
   the next generation?

   i ask this as a high school teacher who often advises students on their
   career choices.

   so many people talk about the disruption of jobs that are primarily
   based on driving a vehicle to the exclusion of other fields. i have a
   student right now who plans to become a pilot. i told him to look into
   the pilotless planes and he figured that it isn't a threat.

   i have told students that going into the trades is a safe bet,
   especially trades that require a lot of mobility. what other fields
   seem safe for now?

   thanks

   pn: i think it makes more sense to think about tasks, not careers. if
   an aspiring commercial pilot asked for advise in 1975, good advice
   would be: do you enjoy taking off and landing? you can do that for many
   years to come. do you enjoy long hours of steady flight? sorry, that
   task is going to be almost completely automated away. so i think most
   fields are safe, but the mix of tasks you do in any job will change,
   the relative pay of different careers will change, and the number of
   people needed for each job will change. it will be hard to predict
   these changes. for example, a lot of people today drive trucks. at some
   point, much of the long-distance driving will be automated. i think
   there will still be a person in the cab, but their job will be more
   focused on loading/unloading and customer relations/salesmanship than
   on driving. if they can (eventually) sleep in the cab while the cab is
   moving and/or if we can platoon larger truck fleets, then you might
   think we need fewer total drivers, but if the cost of trucking goes
   down relative to rail or sea, then there might be more demand. so it is
   hard to predict where things will end up decades from now, and the best
   advice is to stay flexible and be ready to learn new things, whether
   that is shifting tasks within a job, or changing jobs.

   eh: ai advances are going to have multiple influences on labor on the
   economy. i believe some changes may be disruptive and could come in a
   relatively fast-paced way   and such disruptions could come to jobs like
   driving cars and trucks. other influences will be via shifts in how
   jobs are performed and in how people perform tasks in different
   domains. overall, i   m positive about how advances in ai will affect the
   distribution of jobs and nature of work. i see many tasks as being
   supported rather than replaced by more sophisticated automation. these
   include work in the realms of artistry, scientific exploration, jobs
   where fine physical manipulation is important, and in the myriad jobs
   where we will always rely on people to work with and to care for other
   people--including teaching, mentoring, medicine, social work, and
   nurturing kids into adulthood. on the latter, i hope to see rise and
   support of an even more celebrated    caring economy    in a world of
   increasing automation.

   folks may be interested in taking a look at several recent pieces of
   work on reflecting about the future. here   s a very interesting recent
   reflection on how machine learning advances may influences jobs in
   terms of specific capabilities:
   [67]http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6370/1530.full i
   recommend the article to folks as an example of working to put together
   some structure to making predictions about the future of work and ai.

   btw: we had a session at aaas here in austin yesterday on advances in
   ai for augmenting human abilities and for transforming tasks. it was a
   great session for hearing about advances and research directions on
   possibilities:

   ylc: it will be a very long time before we have robotic plumbers,
   carpenters, handypersons, hairdressers, etc. in general, ai will not
   replace jobs, but it will transform them. ultimately, every job is
   going to be made more efficient by ai. but jobs that require human
   creativity, interaction, emotional intelligence, are not going to go
   away for a long time. science, engineering, art, craft making and other
   creative jobs are here to stay.

     ai will not replace jobs, but it will transform them. ultimately,
     every job is going to be made more efficient by ai.

   automation has made steel production workers vastly more efficient. the
   result is that we have fewer steel workers producing more steel per
   worker than ever before.

   how does ai-based automation not have the same effect? or, if it does,
   how can we leverage that to let humans work fewer hours without also
   having lower buying power?
