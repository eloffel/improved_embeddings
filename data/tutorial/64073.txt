seqnmf

   unsupervised discovery of temporal sequences in high-dimensional
   datasets, with applications to neuroscience

   emily mackevicius and andrew bahle - feelab           2018

description

   seqnmf is an algorithm which uses regularized convolutional
   non-negative id105 to extract repeated sequential
   patterns from high-dimensional data. it has been validated using neural
   calcium imaging, spike data, and spectrograms, and allows the discovery
   of patterns directly from timeseries data without reference to external
   markers.

   for more information see our [77]preprint; [78]cosyne talk; tutorial
   [79]video and [80]materials; and simons foundation [81]article.

usage

   the main function is seqnmf.m and it can be called
[w,h,cost,loadings,power] = seqnmf(x,'k',k,'l',l,'lambda',0.01)

   where x is the data matrix, k and l are the factorization parameters
   and lambda is a parameter controling the strength of id173.

   specifically seqnmf factorizes the nxt data matrix x into k factors.
   factor exemplars are returned in the nxkxl tensor w. factor timecourses
   are returned in the kxt matrix h

demo

   see the [82]demo script, for a demonstration of the seqnmf algorithm on
   synthetic data and songbird imaging data. this demo also gives examples
   of how to cross validate, test for significance and select parameters.
