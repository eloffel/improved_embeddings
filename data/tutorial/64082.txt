   deeppavlov is an open-source conversational ai library built on
   [127]tensorflow and [128]keras. it is designed for
     * development of production ready chat-bots and complex
       conversational systems,
     * nlp and id71 research.

breaking changes in version 0.2.0!

     * utils module was moved from repository root in to deeppavlov module
     * ms_bot_framework_utils,server_utils, telegram utils modules was
       renamed to ms_bot_framework, server and telegram correspondingly
     * rename metric functions exact_match to squad_v2_em and squad_f1 to
       squad_v2_f1
     * replace dashes in configs name with underscores

breaking changes in version 0.1.0!

     * as of version 0.1.0 all models, embeddings and other downloaded
       data for provided configurations are by default downloaded to the
       .deeppavlov directory in current user's home directory. this can be
       changed on per-model basis by modifying a root_path [129]variable
       or related fields one by one in model's configuration file.
     * in configuration files, for all components, dataset readers and
       iterators "name" and "class" fields are combined into the
       "class_name" field.
     * deeppavlov.core.commands.infer.build_model_from_config() was
       renamed to build_model and can be imported from the deeppavlov
       module directly.
     * the way arguments are passed to metrics functions during training
       and evaluation was changed and [130]documented.

hello bot in deeppavlov

   import key components to build hellobot.
from deeppavlov.skills.pattern_matching_skill import patternmatchingskill
from deeppavlov.agents.default_agent.default_agent import defaultagent
from deeppavlov.agents.processors.highest_confidence_selector import highestconf
idenceselector

   create skills as pre-defined responses for a user's input containing
   specific keywords or matching regexps. every skill returns response and
   confidence.
hello = patternmatchingskill(responses=['hello world!'], patterns=["hi", "hello"
, "good day"])
bye = patternmatchingskill(['goodbye world!', 'see you around'], patterns=["bye"
, "chao", "see you"])
fallback = patternmatchingskill(["i don't understand, sorry", 'i can say "hello
world!"'])

   agent executes skills and then takes response from the skill with the
   highest confidence.
hellobot = defaultagent([hello, bye, fallback], skills_selector=highestconfidenc
eselector())

   give the floor to the hellobot!
print(hellobot(['hello!', 'boo...', 'bye.']))

installation

    0. currently we support linux and windows platforms and python 3.6
          + python 3.5 is not supported!
          + windows platform requires git for windows (for example,
            [150]git), visual studio 2015/2017 with c++ build tools
            installed!
    1. create a virtual environment with python 3.6:
virtualenv env

    2. activate the environment:
          + linux
source ./env/bin/activate

          + windows
.\env\scripts\activate.bat

    3. install the package inside this virtual environment:
pip install deeppavlov

demo

   demo of selected features is available at [151]demo.ipavlov.ai

quick start

   to use our pre-trained models, you should first install their
   requirements:
python -m deeppavlov install <path_to_config>

   then download the models and data for them:
python -m deeppavlov download <path_to_config>

   or you can use additional key -d to automatically download all required
   models and data with any command like interact, riseapi, etc.

   then you can interact with the models or train them with the following
   command:
python -m deeppavlov <mode> <path_to_config> [-d]

     * <mode> can be train, predict, interact, interactbot, interactmsbot
       or riseapi
     * <path_to_config> should be a path to an nlp pipeline json config
       (e.g. deeppavlov/configs/ner/slotfill_dstc2.json) or a name without
       the .json extension of one of the config files [152]provided in
       this repository (e.g. slotfill_dstc2)

   for the interactbot mode you should specify telegram bot token in -t
   parameter or in telegram_token environment variable. also you should
   use --no-default-skill optional flag if your component implements an
   interface of deeppavlov [153]skill to skip its wrapping with deeppavlov
   [154]defaultstatelessskill. if you want to get custom /start and /help
   telegram messages for the running model you should:
     * add section to [155]deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json with
       your custom telegram messages
     * in model config file specify metadata.labels.telegram_utils
       parameter with name which refers to the added section of
       [156]deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json

   you can also serve deeppavlov models for:
     * microsoft bot framework ([157]see developer guide for the detailed
       instructions)
     * amazon alexa ([158]see developer guide for the detailed
       instructions)

   for riseapi mode you should specify api settings (host, port, etc.) in
   [159]deeppavlov/utils/settings/server_config.json configuration file.
   if provided, values from model_defaults section override values for the
   same parameters from common_defaults section. model names in
   model_defaults section should be similar to the class names of the
   models main component. here is [160]detailed info on the deeppavlov
   rest api

   all deeppavlov settings files are stored in deeppavlov/utils/settings
   by default. you can get full path to it with python -m
   deeppavlov.settings settings. also you can move it with with python -m
   deeppavlov.settings settings -p <new/configs/dir/path> (all your
   configuration settings will be preserved) or move it to default
   location with python -m deeppavlov.settings settings -d (all your
   configuration settings will be reset to default ones).

   for predict you can specify path to input file with -f or --input-file
   parameter, otherwise, data will be taken from stdin.
   every line of input text will be used as a pipeline input parameter, so
   one example will consist of as many lines, as many input parameters
   your pipeline expects.
   you can also specify batch size with -b or --batch-size parameter.

docker images

   we have built several deeppavlov based docker images, which include:
     * deeppavlov based jupyter notebook docker image;
     * docker images which serve some of our models and allow to access
       them via rest api (riseapi mode).

   here is our [162]dockerhub repository with images and deployment
   instructions.

tutorials

   jupyter notebooks and videos explaining how to use deeppalov for
   different tasks can be found in [163]/examples/tutorials/
