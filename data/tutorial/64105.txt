   on a regular basis people tell me about their impressive achievements
   using ai. 99% of these things are completely stupid. this post may come
   off as a rant, but that   s not so much its intent, as it is to point out
   why we went from having very few ai experts, to having so many in so
   little time. also to convey that most of these experts only seem
   experty because so few people know how to call them on their bull shit.

so you built a neural network from scratch    and it runs on a phone   

   great. so you converted 11 lines of python that would fit on a t-shirt
   to java or c or c++. you have mastered what a cross compiler can do in
   3 seconds.

   most people don   t know that a neural network is so simple. they think
   it is super complex. like fractals a neural network can do things that
   seem complex, but that complexity comes from repetition and a random
   number generator.

so you built a neural network that is 20 layers deep   

   congrats! you took the above code, and looped the loop again. that must
   have been so hard, deciding where to put another for and a colon.

      deep learning    and n-layers of depth is just a neural network that
   runs its output through itself. this is called recursive neural
   networks (id56), because you loop the loop.

   this is similar to learning to drive, and only being able to make right
   turns. you can get to almost anywhere doing this. it may not be the
   most efficient, but it is easier than making left turns.

so you trained a neural network using nvidia gpus and moved it to the phone   

   in that above 11 lines of code something that is wrong (or not
   implemented) is that the seed is not set. without setting the seed i
   can   t guarantee that i will get the same random numbers in a second
   pass as in the first pass. as a result i could have dramatically
   different results. since your phone and your desktop won   t give the
   same random numbers, and different phone chips could all have different
   random numbers, your training from a gpu based system to a mobile
   system has a high id203 of not working.

   since training can take millions to billions of times longer than
   classifying in a locked system, building a neural network for a phone
   is pretty much impossible. there will always be differences between
   devices. plus or minus 5% is not a big deal for voice recognition. it
   is a big deal for things like cancer detection/diagnosis.

so you trained a neural network to do something no human has been able to
do   like detect if people are gay just from a photo.

   no. no you didn   t. neural networks are dumb black box systems. if you
   torture them enough you can get great fit of test data, but you won   t
   get great results from randomly sourced tests. ai is really good at
   spurious correlations. the marriage rate in kentucky is not driving the
   drowning rate.

   [:0]

   nor is the fact that a picture is taken close up a proof that the
   animal in the photo is a cat instead of a lion. so the shape of the
   horizon didn   t cause something to be a lion or a cat.

   people want to ascribe magic powers to ai, but for the most part ai
   can   t do anything a human can   t. there are some exceptions, but only
   for transparent ai. neural networks aren   t transparent, and even in the
   transparent systems a human would be able to replicate the final
   result.

so you use tensorflow to   

   remember those 11 lines from above? tensorflow is just a wrapper for
   those 11 lines. what it does well is help you visualize what is
   happening in those 11 lines. in many ways it is like google analytics.
   all of the data to do what google analytics does is probably in your
   server log, but looking at those logs is hard, and looking at google
   analytics is easy. at the same time while google analytics will tell
   you that your server is slow it won   t tell you why.

   [:0]

   those of us who understand neural networks don   t want or need tensor
   flow because we visualize the data without their fancy charts and
   animations, and because we look at the data and code raw, we can figure
   out the equivalent of why the server is slow.

so you use neural networks to do nlp/nlu   

   common sense, people. neural networks are not simulating much more than
   a slug   s level of intelligence. what are the odds you taught a slug to
   understand english?

   building a neural network with 1 trait for every word in the english
   language would require a network that used as much computing power as
   all of google. upping that to 1 trait for each word sense in the
   english language would be all of the computing in all of the cloud
   services on the planet.

   ai can be built to do great things. neural networks have limitations.

so you have a self-defining neural networks   

   congrats, you know how to wrap the 11 lines of neural network code in
   the 9 lines of code for a genetic algorithm. or the 44 lines for a
   distributed evolutionary algorithm. write a press release because your
   55 lines of code are going to... oh, wait...

so you trained a neural network to   anything.

   congrats, you are a data wrangler. while that sounds impressive you are
   a dog trainer. only your dog has the brains of a slug, and the only
   thing it has going for it, is that you can make lots of them. there is
   no magic in owning a training set. it might have been hard to track
   down, but don't fool yourself (or others) into thinking you are
   anything more than a glorified slug trainer.

so you combined neural networks and blockchain   

   congrats, you know how to make hype stack. unfortunately, hash mining
   and neural networks don   t have anything in common, and trying to run
   all of a data sets through all of the nodes of a blockchain farm
   wouldn   t work. neural network start to have problems when you    slice   
   the load more than about 16 ways with data sets of normal size. you can
   go larger of if you have billions of records, or if you are doing back
   propagation and want to test multiple orders of data presentation, but
   these techniques don   t scale to 1000s or millions of nodes.

i don't do much with neural networks.

   there is neural network code in my tool box. but that is what it should
   be. a tool in the selection, not the basis for an entire product. most
   of my work is in epistemology an self-defining heuristics. the
   combination of technologies is called mind simulation, because rather
   than neural networks that are supposed to be modeled after the hardware
   of the brain, in software (which they aren't), mind simulation is about
   modeling the software of the brain, in software. a brain emulator as it
   were. mind simulation has only been a thing for about 10 years, where
   as neural networks have been around for 50+. mind simulation also
   differs in that it is transparent, and takes millions of lines of code
   not dozens.
