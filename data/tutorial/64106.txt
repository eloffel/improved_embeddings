capsule network

   [75]license

pytorch implementation of the following paper:

     * [76]dynamic routing between capsules by sara sabour, nicholas
       frosst and geoffrey hinton

official implemenation

     * [77]official implementation (tensorflow) by sara sabour

visual represenation

     image source: mike ross, [79]a visual representation of capsule
     network computations

run the experiment

     * for details, run python main.py --help

example of reconstructed vs. original images

   [80]reconstructed
     __________________________________________________________________

requirements:

     * pytorch ([81]http://www.pytorch.org)
     * numpy ([82]http://www.numpy.org/)
     * gpu

default hyper-parameters (similar to the paper):

     * per-gpu batch_size = 128
     * initial learning_rate = 0.001
     * exponential lr_decay = 0.96
     * number of routing iteration (num_routing) = 3

id168 hyper-parameters (see [83]loss.py):

     * lambda for margin loss = 0.5
     * scaling factor for reconstruction loss = 0.0005

gpu speed benchmarks:

   (with above mentioned hyper-parameters)
     * single geforce gtx 1080ti - 35.6s per epoch
     * two geforce gtx 1080ti - 35.8s per epoch (twice the batch size ->
       half the iteration)
