sequence modeling benchmarks and temporal convolutional networks (tcn)

   this repository contains the experiments done in the work [73]an
   empirical evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent networks
   for sequence modeling by shaojie bai, j. zico kolter and vladlen
   koltun.

   we specifically target a comprehensive set of tasks that have been
   repeatedly used to compare the effectiveness of different recurrent
   networks, and evaluate a simple, generic but powerful (purely)
   convolutional network on the recurrent nets' home turf.

   experiments are done in pytorch. if you find this repository helpful,
   please cite our work:
@article{baitcn2018,
        author    = {shaojie bai and j. zico kolter and vladlen koltun},
        title     = {an empirical evaluation of generic convolutional and recurr
ent networks for sequence modeling},
        journal   = {arxiv:1803.01271},
        year      = {2018},
}

domains and datasets

   update: the code should be directly runnable with pytorch 0.4.0 or
   above (pytorch 1.0 strongly recommended). the older versions of pytorch
   are no longer supported.

   this repository contains the benchmarks to the following tasks, with
   details explained in each sub-directory:
     * the adding problem with various t (we evaluated on t=200, 400, 600)
     * copying memory task with various t (we evaluated on t=500, 1000,
       2000)
     * sequential mnist digit classification
     * permuted sequential mnist (based on seq. mnist, but more
       challenging)
     * jsb chorales polyphonic music
     * nottingham polyphonic music
     * penntreebank [small] word-level id38 (lm)
     * wikitext-103 [large] word-level lm
     * lambada [large] word-level lm and textual understanding
     * penntreebank [medium] char-level lm
     * text8 [large] char-level lm

   while some of the large datasets are not included in this repo, we use
   the [74]observations package to download them, which can be easily
   installed using pip.

usage

   each task is contained in its own directory, with the following
   structure:
[task_name] /
    data/
    [task_name]_test.py
    models.py
    utils.py

   to run tcn model on the task, one only need to run [task_name]_test.py
   (e.g. add_test.py). to tune the hyperparameters, one can specify via
   argument options, which can been seen via the -h flag.
