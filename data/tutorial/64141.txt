[7]muse: multilingual unsupervised and supervised embeddings

   dec. 24, 2017, 5:34 a.m. [8]by: kirti bakshi [9]edit

   muse

   muse is a python library that is meant for id73
   embeddings, and whose goal is to provide the community with:
     * state-of-the-art multilingual id27s that are based on
       fasttext
     * large-scale high-quality bilingual dictionaries for the purpose of
       training and evaluation

   going in-depth, muse is a library in python that is used to align
   embedding spaces in a supervised or an unsupervised way. while the
   supervised method makes the use of a bilingual dictionary or identical
   character strings. the unsupervised approach does not make the use of
   any parallel data. instead, it builds a bilingual dictionary between
   two different languages by the aligning of monolingual id27
   spaces in an unsupervised way.

   the python library has now been open-sourced by facebook and muse has
   state-of-the-art multilingual id27s for over 30 languages
   that are based on fasttext as mentioned before.

   fasttext is a library that is used for efficient learning of word
   representations as well as sentence classification. fasttext can also
   be used for making id27s with the use of id97, cbow
   (continuous bag of words) or even skipgram and then further use it for
   text classification.

   the muse library provides you with the following:

   1. get evaluation datasets:

   get cross-lingual as well as monolingual id27s evaluation
   datasets:
     * the 110 bilingual dictionaries
     * 28 monolingual word similarity tasks for 6 different languages, and
       in addition to it, the english word analogy task
     * cross-lingual word similarity tasks from semeval2017
     * sentence translation retrieval with [10]europarl corpora

   2. get monolingual id27s:

   for pre-trained monolingual id27s, it is highly recommend to
   make the use of fasttext wikipedia embeddings, or fasttext in order to
   train your very own id27s from your corpus.

   3. alignment of monolingual id27s:

   this project comprises of two different ways that help achieve
   cross-lingual id27s:
     * supervised: making the use of a train bilingual dictionary or
       identical character strings as anchor points, learn a mapping from
       the source to the target space with the use of (iterative)
       procrustes alignment.
     * unsupervised: without the use of any parallel data or anchor point,
       learn a mapping from the source to the target space using
       adversarial training and (iterative) procrustes refinement.

   4. evaluate monolingual or cross-lingual embeddings (cpu|gpu):

   the library also includes within itself a simple script to evaluate the
   quality of monolingual or cross-lingual id27s on several
   tasks that take place.

   5. ground-truth bilingual dictionaries:

   there is a creation of 110 large-scale ground-truth bilingual
   dictionaries with the use of an internal translation tool. the
   dictionaries very well handle the polysemy of words. it also provides a
   train and test split of 5000 and 1500 unique source words, as well as a
   larger set that goes up to 100k pairs.

   the main goal is to ease the development as well as the evaluation of
   cross-lingual id27s and multilingual [11]nlp(natural language
   processing).

   dependencies:
     * python 2/3 with [12]numpy/[13]scipy
     * [14]pytorch
     * faiss (recommended) for fast nearest neighbour search (cpu or gpu).

   while the library is available on cpu or gpu, in python 2 or 3, faiss
   is considered to be optional for gpu users as with faiss-gpu will
   greatly speed up the nearest neighbour search - and is therefore highly
   recommended for cpu users. for more information, one can go through the
   link mentioned below.
