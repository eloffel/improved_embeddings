what is artificial intelligence? part 1

   although the term artificial intelligence (ai) has been around for many
   years, in recent years it seems to have become a buzzword. like many
   buzzwords picked up from science, ai seems to have fallen victim to a
   rather annoying phenomenon: most of the people using the term don   t
   really know what it means.

   ok, perhaps that is a bit too harsh. of course, people using the term
   ai have some idea of its meaning, but i have noticed in many cases that
   the usage by non-experts (and even some supposed experts) strays quite
   far from how the term was originally intended in academic circles.

   nobody really knows who coined the term    artificial intelligence   . many
   people attribute it to the belated computer scientist [18]john
   mccarthy, but according to interviews conducted by daniel crevier,
   mccarthy denies having come up with the term [19][1, p. 50].

   nonetheless, the term ai became prevalent in use in the mid-1950s,
   albeit within a small circle of primarily american scientists. a
   synonymous term, machine intelligence, seems to have originated in the
   uk, and it is still in use today, thought not as widely as ai. in this
   article, i mainly use the term ai to refer to the concept of    thinking
   machines,    except where i   m discussing authors who consistently used
      machine intelligence    instead.

   overall, this article aims to shed light on the concept of ai from a
   historical perspective and briefly trace its development up to the
   modern era. as a disclaimer, i need to point out that i   m not a
   professional historian. there are likely many missing episodes in this
   brief history, but i will try to make up for this by citing numerous
   more authoritative references.

   i intend to publish the article in several parts. in part 1, i focus on
   ideas leading up to the concept of machines that can think. part 2 will
   focus on developments in the uk between 1936 and roughly 1954. part 3
   will continue the story from around 1954 when focus started to shift to
   the us.

a brief history of early artificial intelligence

   in order to understand what artificial intelligence is, we look to the
   past to see what great thinkers have thought was possible for machines
   to do. i have divided this early history of ai is divided into three
   periods:    from automata to the analytical engine,       from turing
   machines to checkers,    and    from the logic theorist to self-writing
   programs   . this takes us up to roughly the end of the 1950s, a point at
   which we can say artificial intelligence is a firmly-rooted scientific
   discipline.

from automata to the analytical engine

   some authors trace the idea of thinking machines back to ancient egypt
   or ancient greece (e.g. [2]), but personally i don   t find these
   examples, such as the conversation between socrates and euthypro about
   a standard of piety, as having much to do with thinking machines or
   artificial intelligence (see [3]). another example is talos, the figure
   made of bronze from greek mythology [4]. as he was supposedly made by
   the greek god hephaestus, he hardly qualifies as an artificial
   creature.
   [1*wsp4nb6q7igwlfdclkcrlw.jpeg]
   in 1637, descartes presumed that it would be impossible to create
   machines that reasoned like humans. image from a first edition copy of
   discourse on the method (source: biblioth  que nationale de france,
   d  partement r  serve des livres rares, resm-r-76, available from:
   [20]http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594)

   based on my limited research, i think the idea of thinking machines can
   be traced back to the 17th century [5]. in particular, ren   descartes
   published discourse on the method in 1637 (where the famous phrase,    i
   think, therefore i am    comes from), in which he conjectured that it
   would be impossible to create a machine that could reason like humans
   [6]:

           it must be morally impossible that there should exist in any
     machine a diversity of organs sufficient to enable it to act in all
     the occurrences of life, in the way in which our reason enables us
     to act.   

   in fact, in this same passage he outlined what amounts to the turing
   test, a topic we will turn to later:

     nor will this appear at all strange to those who are acquainted with
     the variety of movements performed by the different automata, or
     moving machines fabricated by human industry, and that with help of
     but few pieces compared with the great multitude of bones, muscles,
     nerves, arteries, veins, and other parts that are found in the body
     of each animal   

        but if there were machines bearing the image of our bodies, and
     capable of imitating our actions as far as it is morally possible,
     there would still remain two most certain tests whereby to know that
     they were not therefore really men. of these the first is that they
     could never use words or other signs arranged in such a manner as is
     competent to us in order to declare our thoughts to others: for we
     may easily conceive a machine to be so constructed that it emits
     vocables, and even that it emits some correspondent to the action
     upon it of external objects which cause a change in its organs; for
     example, if touched in a particular place it may demand what we wish
     to say to it; if in another it may cry out that it is hurt, and such
     like; but not that it should arrange them variously so as appositely
     to reply to what is said in its presence, as men of the lowest grade
     of intellect can do.

     the second test is, that although such machines might execute many
     things with equal or perhaps greater perfection than any of us, they
     would, without doubt, fail in certain others from which it could be
     discovered that they did not act from knowledge, but solely from the
     disposition of their organs   

   the automata that he refers to are essentially mechanized imitations of
   various living things. such automata are reported to have been built
   throughout antiquity, but they hardly qualify as machines mimicking
   human thought.

   image of the great chess automaton from    briefe   ber den schachspieler
   des hrn. von kempelen    by karl gottlieb von windisch and published in
   1783 (source: [21]kre  imir josi  , university of houston)

   one exception is wolfgang von kempelen   s great chess automaton, which
   was built in 1769. it was designed to play chess, and play it well. it
   even beat benjamin franklin! excelling at chess is certainly a
   capability most would agree requires intelligence. the only problem is
   that von kempelen   s chess automaton turned out to be a fake. there was
   actually a person inside the contraption! this wasn   t revealed until
   1837, nearly seventy years after its creation [7].

   this example demonstrates, however, that the idea of thinking machines
   was certainly alive and well by the 18th century, and some were willing
   to try to prove descartes wrong (if they were even aware of his
   assertion). in reality, nobody seemed to have any idea how to make
   thinking machines, but at least the dream was there.

   a giant leap forward was taken in the first half of the 19th century,
   when inventor charles babbage proposed the analytical engine. it is
   widely regarded as the first design of a general-purpose computer.
   although the analytical engine has never been fully built, many
   consider it to be influential in pushing forward the dream of
   mechanized general-purpose computation.

   1878   3. science museum group collection online. accessed march 10,
   2018. [22]https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co62245.)

   in 1843, ada lovelace translated and annotated a paper by luigi
   menabrea, which was a description of babbage   s analytical engine, based
   on lectures babbage gave in turin in 1840 [8]. nobody seems to have
   thought that the analytical engine was indeed a thinking machine:

     for the machine is not a thinking being, but simply an automaton
     which acts according to the laws imposed upon it.

   lovelace adds in her notes:

     the analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate
     anything. it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. it
     can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any
     analytical relations or truths. its province is to assist us in
     making available what we are already acquainted with.

   despite the analytical engine not being regarded as a thinking machine,
   it was a major step forward in the design of a computer that could
   carry out complex mathematical computations. this would prove to be
   inspirational for other computing pioneers, such as alan turing, who we
   will turn to next.
