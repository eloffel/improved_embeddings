   [82]neural relational id136 (nri)

   abstract: interacting systems are prevalent in nature, from dynamical
   systems in physics to complex societal dynamics. the interplay of
   components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be
   explained using a simple model of the system's constituent parts. in
   this work, we introduce the neural relational id136 (nri) model: an
   unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while
   simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data.
   our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the
   latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the
   reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. in experiments on
   simulated physical systems, we show that our nri model can accurately
   recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. we further
   demonstrate that we can find an interpretable structure and predict
   complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.

requirements

     * pytorch 0.2 (0.3 breaks simulation decoder)
     * python 2.7 or 3.6

data generation

   to replicate the experiments on simulated physical data, first generate
   training, validation and test data by running:
cd data
python generate_dataset.py

   this generates the springs dataset, use --simulation charged for
   charged particles.

   note: make sure to use the same preprocessing and evaluation scripts
   (check the id168 as well) as in our code release to get
   comparable results.

run experiments

   from the project's root folder, simply run
python train.py

   to train a neural relational id136 (nri) model on the springs
   dataset. you can specify a different dataset by modifying the suffix
   argument: --suffix charged5 will run the model on the charged particle
   simulation with 5 particles (if it has been generated).

   to train the encoder or decoder separately, run
python train_enc.py

   or
python train_dec.py

   respectively. we provide a number of training options which are
   documented in the respective training files.

   additionally, we provide code for an lstm baseline (denoted lstm
   (joint) in the paper), which you can run as follows:
python lstm_baseline.py
