how does alphago work? power of id23

   in october 2015, alphago, an ai-powered system, beat mr. fan hui, the
   reigning 3-times european champion of the complex boardgame go, by 5
   points to 0. it was the first time an ai conquered a human in such a
   sophisticated game.

the game of go

   go is an abstract strategy board game for two players invented in
   ancient china more than 2,500 years ago. its aim is to use    stones   
   (black or white) to surround more territory than the opponent.

   the rules of the game are very simple. however, the variations of the
   placements of the stones outnumber the total number of atoms in the
   visible universe (10^80 atoms vs 10^761 possible games of go).
   instinct, intuition and feel play an important role in the game, and
   because of its intellectual beauty, it has captured the attention of
   civilizations since centuries.

   the fact that so many combinations are possible makes the fact that
   alphago managed to beat the reigning champion of go truly remarkable,
   and sheds light on the potential opportunities of artificial
   intelligence in the future.
   alphago and id23

was it just an one-time event?

   this win was not a fluke or one-time thing. after the victory with mr.
   fan hui, alphago played with mr. lee sedol, who is the winner of 18
   world titles and recognized as the greatest go player of the decade, in
   seoul, south korea. the result? 4 to 1 for the machine.

   these landslide victories shocked professional associations worldwide,
   and alphago was granted an honorary 9-dan ranking (the highest possible
   certification)     a title previously reserved only for the world   s top
   go champions.
   alphago game

what about chess?

   chess has many similarities to go. both stem from ancient times and are
   played by two people taking turns. also, in both games, there is no
   random element involved.

   but     unlike go     chess has been easy for ai machines to master.
   champion (garry kasparov) was defeated by a software program called
   deep blue more than two decades ago in 1977. the program was carefully
   designed with collaboration between software engineers and chess
   grandmasters, and they created an extremely efficient machine.on the
   other hand, it took programmers around 20 years to create intelligence
   that could defeat the go world champion.

   this is because of a profound difference in complexity between these
   games. in go, during every turn, a player has a far larger quantity of
   moves to chose from (about 250 in go vs. 35 in chess). you can imagine
   the intelligence that a machine needs to have in order to master a game
   like go. let   s discuss how they did it.

deep id23 to the rescue

   have you ever trained a dog to teach him a new trick? what does that
   process could look like? most likely, you give him a reward if the
   trick is performed correctly, and punish him or ignore him if it   s not.

   for example, if every time a dog messes up a living room, you take away
   some of his favorite food, or every time he returns with a stick that
   you   ve thrown out, you give him a sugar cube, what will the dog
   eventually learn?

   the dog, or the agent, will behave in a way to maximize the amount of
   his favorite food you give him as a feedback. his biological    neural
   network    will invent the correct patterns itself so that he can achieve
   the maximum positive result. this type of learning is a very powerful
   tool, and it   s ingrained in nearly every biological unit.

   the above example is a high-level real-world example of reinforcement
   learning. it constantly relies on feedback from the environment. the
   machine can be rewarded or punished based on the current state of the
   actions it performed, or based on how fast it   s able to reach the
   desired state from a current position. the longer the distance (be it a
   physical distance, a fraction of time or just an abstract distance),
   the reward can be discounted by a certain factor.

   one of the recent, spectacular achievements related to rl was when
   openai built a rl system in 2 weeks that beats world-class players in
   dota 2. the system was not taught the rules of dota, nor does it
   contain any hardcoded game-based rules. it started by randomly
   traversing a map or standing still and slowly improved itself,
   baby-stepping its way. in other words: it played more games than any
   human was ever capable of playing, and it learned this way.

where else is id23 used?

   there are many areas where id23 is applied. just to
   name a few:
     * in robotics     to efficiently find a combination of electrical
       signals to steer robotic arms (to perform an action) or legs (to
       walk)
     * logic games     apart from go: poker, back-gammon, othello/reversi,
       checkers, solitaire
     * in manufacturing     robots for package transportation or for
       assembling specific parts of cars
     * in [20]military     among others for logistics and to provide
       automatic assistance for humans in analyzing the environment before
       actions
     * in inventory management     to reduce transit time and space
       utilization, or to optimize [21]dispatching rules
     * power systems     to predict and minimize transmission losses
     * in the financial sector     for instance in the trading systems to
       generate alpha or to serve as an assistant to allow traders and
       analysts to save time
     * steering [22]an autonomous helicopter

     id23 has found multiple uses in business.
     practical machine learning is another type of ai learning that has
     become useful in business. for more information, check out our
     [23]article? read our article!

     * for complex simulations     e.g. [24]robo soccer
     * in [25]marketing     for cross-channel campaign optimisation and to
       [26]maximize long-term profit of a campaign
     * adtech     optimizing a strategy of pricing ads in order to maximize
       returns within a given budget
     * energy management optimization     [27]reducing data center energy
       cost by 40%!
     * in [28]healthcare     e.g. to stabilize the level of hemoglobin for
       patients undergoing chronic renal failure

   finally     it was successfully used to [29]play atari games (e.g.
   pacman, tetris). it quickly gained the skills and outperformed human
   experts on three of the games described in the experiment.

what other materials can i read to learn the basis of id23?

   assuming you are already familiar with machine learning and at least
   the basics of deep learning, we strongly recommend:
     * id23: an introduction     a book by richard s.
       sutton and andrew g. barto
     * [30]neuro-id145 by dimitri p. bertsekas and john
       tsitsiklis

     what   s hot in deep learning right now? beat the learning curve and
     read the [31]2017 review of gan architectures.
