essentials of deep learning     sequence to sequence modelling with attention
(using python)

   [97]faizan shaikh, march 15, 2018

introduction

   deep learning at scale is disrupting many industries by creating
   chatbots and bots never seen before. on the other hand, a person just
   starting out on deep learning would read about basics of neural
   networks and its various architectures like id98 and id56.

   but there seems like a big jump from the simple concepts to industrial
   applications of deep learning. concepts such as batch id172,
   dropout and attention are almost a requirement to know in building deep
   learning applications.

   in this article, we will cover two important concepts used in the
   current state of the art applications in id103 and natural
   language processing     viz sequence to sequence modelling and attention
   models.

   just to give you a sneak peek of the potential application of these two
   techniques     baidu   s ai system uses them to [98]clone your voice it
   replicates a persons voice by understanding his voice in just three
   seconds of training.you can check out some [99]audio samples provided
   by baidu   s research team which consist of original and synthesized
   voices.

   note: this article assumes that you already are comfortable with basics
   of deep learning and have built id56 models. if you want a refresher,
   you can go through these articles first:
     * [100]fundamentals of deep learning     starting with artificial
       neural network
     * [101]fundamentals of deep learning     introduction to recurrent
       neural networks

problem formulation for sequence to sequence modelling

   we know that to solve sequence modelling problems, recurrent neural
   networks is our go-to architecture. let   s take an example of a question
   answering system to understand what a sequence modelling problem looks
   like.

   suppose you have a series of statements:

   joe went to the kitchen. fred went to the kitchen. joe picked up the
   milk.
   joe travelled to the office. joe left the milk. joe went to the
   bathroom.

   and you have been asked the below question:

   where was joe before the office?

   the appropriate answer would be    kitchen   . a quick glance makes this
   seem like a simple problem. but to understand the complexity     there
   are two dimensions which the system has to understand:
    1. the underlying working of the english language and the sequence of
       characters/words which make up the sentence
    2. the sequence of events which revolve around the people mentioned in
       the statements

   this can be considered as a sequence modelling problem, as
   understanding the sequence is important to make any prediction around
   it.

   there are many such scenarios of sequence modelling problems, which are
   summarised in the image below. the example given above is a many input
       one output problem (if you consider a word as a single output).

   a special class of these problems is called a sequence to sequence
   modelling problem, where the input as well as the output are a
   sequence. examples of sequence to sequence problems can be:

   1. machine translation     an artificial system which translates a
   sentence from one language to the other.

   2. video captioning     automatically creating the subtitles of a video
   for each frame, including a description of the sound cues (such as
   machinery starting up, people laughing in the background, etc.).


a glance of sequence to sequence modelling technique

   a typical sequence to sequence model has two parts     an encoder and a
   decoder. both the parts are practically two different neural network
   models combined into one giant network.

   broadly, the task of an encoder network is to understand the input
   sequence, and create a smaller dimensional representation of it. this
   representation is then forwarded to a decoder network which generates a
   sequence of its own that represents the output. let   s take an example
   of a conversational agent to understand the concept.

                                                 source:
   https://github.com/farizrahman4u/id195

   in the image given above, the input sequence is    how are you   . so when
   such an input sequence is passed though the encoder-decoder network
   consisting of lstm blocks (a type of id56 architecture), the decoder
   generates words one by one in each time step of the decoder   s
   iteration. after one whole iteration, the output sequence generated is
      i am fine   .


improving the performance of models     id125 and attention mechanism

   a sequence to sequence modelling network should not be used out of the
   box. it still needs a bit of tuning to squeeze out the best performance
   out there to meet expectations. below are two techniques which have
   proven to be useful in the past in sequence to sequence modelling
   applications.
    1. id125
    2. attention mechanism


id125

   as we saw before, the decoder network generates the id203 of
   occurrence of a word in the sequence. at each time step, the decoder
   has to make a decision as to what the next word would be in the
   sequence.

   one way to make a decision would be to greedily find out the most
   probable word at each time step.

   for example, if the input sequence was    who does john like?   , there
   could be many sentences that can be generated by a single decoder
   network in multiple iterations, making a tree like structure of
   sentences as shown above. the greedy way would be to pick a word with
   the greatest id203 at each time step.

   what if it comes out to be,    likes mary john   ? this does not
   necessarily give us the sentence with the highest combined
   id203. for this, you would have to intelligently sort out the
   appropriate sequence for the sentence.

   id125 takes into account the id203 of the next k words in
   the sequence, and then chooses the proposal with the max combined
   id203, as seen in the image below:

attention mechanism

   when a human tries to understand a picture, he/she focuses on specific
   portions of the image to get the whole essence of the picture. in the
   same way, we can train an artificial system to focus on particular
   elements of the image to get the whole    picture   . this is essentially
   how attention mechanism works.

   let   s take an example of an image captioning problem, where the system
   has to generate a suitable caption for an image. in this scenario, to
   generate the caption, attention mechanism helps the model to grasp
   individual parts of the image which are most important at that
   particular instance.

   to implement attention mechanism, we take input from each time step of
   the encoder     but give weightage to the timesteps. the weightage
   depends on the importance of that time step for the decoder to
   optimally generate the next word in the sequence, as shown in the image
   below:

   source     https://github.com/google/id195

   keeping these two techniques in mind, you can then build an end-to-end
   sequence to sequence model that works wonderfully well. in the next
   section, we will go through a hands on example of the topics we have
   learnt and apply it on a real life problem using python.


hands-on view of sequence to sequence modelling

   let   s look at a simple implementation of sequence to sequence modelling
   in keras. the task is to translate short english sentences into french
   sentences, character-by-character using a sequence-to-sequence model.

   the code for this example [102]can be found on github. the original
   author of this code is [103]francois chollet.

   for implementation, we will use a dataset consisting of pairs of
   english sentences and their french translation, which you can download
   from [104]here (download the file named fra-eng.zip). you also should
   have [105]keras installed in your system. here   s a summary of our
   implementation:

   1) turn the sentences into 3 numpy
   arrays, encoder_input_data, decoder_input_data, decoder_target_data:
     * encoder_input_data is a 3d array of shape (num_pairs,
       max_english_sentence_length, num_english_characters) containing a
       one-hot vectorization of the english sentences
     * decoder_input_data is a 3d array of shape (num_pairs,
       max_french_sentence_length, num_french_characters) containing a
       one-hot vectorization of the french sentences
     * decoder_target_data is the same as decoder_input_data but offset by
       one timestep. decoder_target_data[:, t, :] will be the same
       as decoder_input_data[:, t + 1, :]

   2) train a basic lstm-based id195 model to
   predict decoder_target_data given encoder_input_data and decoder_input_
   data.

   3) decode some sentences to check that the model is working (i.e. turn
   samples from encoder_input_data into corresponding samples
   from decoder_target_data).

   now let   s have a look at the python code.
# import modules
from keras.models import model
from keras.layers import input, lstm, dense

# define an input sequence and process it.
encoder_inputs = input(shape=(none, num_encoder_tokens))
encoder = lstm(latent_dim, return_state=true)
encoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = encoder(encoder_inputs)
# we discard `encoder_outputs` and only keep the states.
encoder_states = [state_h, state_c]

# set up the decoder, using `encoder_states` as initial state.
decoder_inputs = input(shape=(none, num_decoder_tokens))
# we set up our decoder to return full output sequences,
# and to return internal states as well. we don't use the
# return states in the training model, but we will use them in id136.
decoder_lstm = lstm(latent_dim, return_sequences=true, return_state=true)
decoder_outputs, _, _ = decoder_lstm(decoder_inputs,
                                     initial_state=encoder_states)
decoder_dense = dense(num_decoder_tokens, activation='softmax')
decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)

# define the model that will turn
# `encoder_input_data` & `decoder_input_data` into `decoder_target_data`
model = model([encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs], decoder_outputs)


# run training
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossid178')
model.fit([encoder_input_data, decoder_input_data], decoder_target_data,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=epochs,
          validation_split=0.2)


encoder_model = model(encoder_inputs, encoder_states)

decoder_state_input_h = input(shape=(latent_dim,))
decoder_state_input_c = input(shape=(latent_dim,))
decoder_states_inputs = [decoder_state_input_h, decoder_state_input_c]
decoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = decoder_lstm(
    decoder_inputs, initial_state=decoder_states_inputs)
decoder_states = [state_h, state_c]
decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)
decoder_model = model(
    [decoder_inputs] + decoder_states_inputs,
    [decoder_outputs] + decoder_states)


def decode_sequence(input_seq):
    # encode the input as state vectors.
    states_value = encoder_model.predict(input_seq)

    # generate empty target sequence of length 1.
    target_seq = np.zeros((1, 1, num_decoder_tokens))
    # populate the first character of target sequence with the start character.
    target_seq[0, 0, target_token_index['\t']] = 1.

    # sampling loop for a batch of sequences
    # (to simplify, here we assume a batch of size 1).
    stop_condition = false
    decoded_sentence = ''
    while not stop_condition:
        output_tokens, h, c = decoder_model.predict(
            [target_seq] + states_value)

        # sample a token
        sampled_token_index = np.argmax(output_tokens[0, -1, :])
        sampled_char = reverse_target_char_index[sampled_token_index]
        decoded_sentence += sampled_char

        # exit condition: either hit max length
        # or find stop character.
        if (sampled_char == '\n' or
           len(decoded_sentence) > max_decoder_seq_length):
            stop_condition = true

        # update the target sequence (of length 1).
        target_seq = np.zeros((1, 1, num_decoder_tokens))
        target_seq[0, 0, sampled_token_index] = 1.

        # update states
        states_value = [h, c]

    return decoded_sentence

   here is a preview of the output which is generated:
input sentence: be nice.
decoded sentence: soyez gentil !
-
input sentence: drop it!
decoded sentence: laissez tomber !
-
input sentence: get out!
decoded sentence: sortez   !


end notes

   in this article, we went through a brief overview of sequence to
   sequence modelling and id12, two of the most important
   techniques which are used in state-of-the-art deep learning products
   focused on natural language and speech processing.

   there is a lot of scope of applying these models in practical
   day-to-day life scenarios. if you do try them out, let us know in the
