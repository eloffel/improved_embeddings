   'story cloze test' is a new commonsense reasoning framework for
   evaluating story understanding, story generation, and script learning.
   this test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a
   four-sentence story. we propose the story cloze test to replace the
   state-of-the-art for evaluating narrative structure learning, the
   'narrative cloze test' (chambers & jurafsky, 2008).
   to enable the story cloze test, we created a new corpus of
   five-sentence commonsense stories, 'rocstories'. this corpus is unique
   in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal
   commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high
   quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for
   story generation.
