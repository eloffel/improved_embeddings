spark-nlp

   [114]build status

   john snow labs spark-nlp is a natural language processing library built
   on top of apache spark ml. it provides simple, performant & accurate
   nlp annotations for machine learning pipelines, that scale easily in a
   distributed environment.

usage

apache spark support

   spark-nlp 2.0.1 has been built on top of apache spark 2.4.0

   note that spark is not retrocompatible with spark 2.3.x, so models and
   environments might not work.

   if you are still stuck on spark 2.3.x feel free to use [141]this
   assembly jar instead. support is limited. for ocr module, [142]this is
   for spark 2.3.x.
   spark nlp spark 2.0.1 / spark 2.3.x spark 2.4
   2.x.x     no                        yes
   1.8.x     partially                 yes
   1.7.3     yes                       n/a
   1.6.3     yes                       n/a
   1.5.0     yes                       n/a

   find out more about spark-nlp versions from our [143]release notes.

spark packages

command line (requires internet connection)

   this library has been uploaded to the [144]spark-packages repository.

   benefit of spark-packages is that makes it available for both
   scala-java and python

   to use the most recent version just add the --packages
   johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1 to you spark command
spark-shell --packages johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1

pyspark --packages johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1

spark-submit --packages johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1

   this can also be used to create a sparksession manually by using the
   spark.jars.packages option in both python and scala

compiled jars

build from source

spark nlp

     * fat-jar for cpu

sbt assembly

     * fat-jar for gpu

sbt -dis_gpu=true assembly

     * packaging the project

sbt package

spark-nlp-ocr

   requires native tesseract 4.x+ for image based ocr. does not require
   spark-nlp to work but highly suggested
     * fat-jar

sbt ocr/assembly

     * packaging the project

sbt ocr/package

using the jar manually

   if for some reason you need to use the jar, you can either download the
   fat jars provided here or download it from [145]maven central.

   to add jars to spark programs use the --jars option:
spark-shell --jars spark-nlp.jar

   the preferred way to use the library when running spark programs is
   using the --packages option as specified in the spark-packages section.

scala

   our package is deployed to maven central. in order to add this package
   as a dependency in your application:

maven

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp -->
<dependency>
    <groupid>com.johnsnowlabs.nlp</groupid>
    <artifactid>spark-nlp_2.11</artifactid>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>

   and
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp-ocr -->
<dependency>
    <groupid>com.johnsnowlabs.nlp</groupid>
    <artifactid>spark-nlp-ocr_2.11</artifactid>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>

sbt

// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp
librarydependencies += "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp" %% "spark-nlp" % "2.0.1"

   and
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp/spark-nlp-ocr
librarydependencies += "com.johnsnowlabs.nlp" %% "spark-nlp-ocr" % "2.0.1"

   maven central:
   [146]https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.johnsnowlabs.nlp

python

python without explicit pyspark installation

pip

   if you installed pyspark through pip, you can install spark-nlp through
   pip as well.
pip install spark-nlp==2.0.1

   pypi [147]spark-nlp package

conda

   if you are using anaconda/conda for managing python packages, you can
   install spark-nlp as follow:
conda install -c johnsnowlabs spark-nlp

   anaconda [148]spark-nlp package

   then you'll have to create a sparksession manually, for example:
spark = sparksession.builder \
    .appname("ner")\
    .master("local[4]")\
    .config("spark.driver.memory","4g")\
    .config("spark.driver.maxresultsize", "2g") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1")\
    .config("spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max", "500m")\
    .getorcreate()

   if using local jars, you can use spark.jars instead for a comma
   delimited jar files. for cluster setups, of course you'll have to put
   the jars in a reachable location for all driver and executor nodes

apache zeppelin

   use either one of the following options
     * add the following maven coordinates to the interpreter's library
       list

com.johnsnowlabs.nlp:spark-nlp_2.11:2.0.1

     * add path to pre-built jar from [149]here in the interpreter's
       library list making sure the jar is available to driver path

python in zeppelin

   apart from previous step, install python module through pip
pip install spark-nlp==2.0.1

   or you can install spark-nlp from inside zeppelin by using conda:
%python.conda install -c johnsnowlabs spark-nlp

   configure zeppelin properly, use cells with %spark.pyspark or any
   interpreter name you chose.

   finally, in zeppelin interpreter settings, make sure you set properly
   zeppelin.python to the python you want to use and installed the pip
   library with (e.g. python3).

   an alternative option would be to set spark_submit_options
   (zeppelin-env.sh) and make sure --packages is there as shown earlier,
   since it includes both scala and python side installation.

jupyter notebook (python)

   easiest way to get this done is by making jupyter notebook run using
   pyspark as follows:
export spark_home=/path/to/your/spark/folder
export pyspark_python=python3
export pyspark_driver_python=jupyter
export pyspark_driver_python_opts=notebook

pyspark --packages johnsnowlabs:spark-nlp:2.0.1

   alternatively, you can mix in using --jars option for pyspark + pip
   install spark-nlp

   if not using pyspark at all, you'll have to run the instructions
   pointed [150]here

s3 cluster

with no hadoop configuration

   if your distributed storage is s3 and you don't have a standard hadoop
   configuration (i.e. fs.defaultfs) you need to specify where in the
   cluster distributed storage you want to store spark-nlp's tmp files.
   first, decide where you want to put your application.conf file
import com.johnsnowlabs.uti.configloader
configloader.setconfigpath("/somewhere/to/put/application.conf")

   and then we need to put in such application.conf the following content
sparknlp {
  settings {
    cluster_tmp_dir = "somewhere in s3n:// path to some folder"
  }
}

how to use models and pipelines

   to use spark nlp online pretrained pipelines, you can call
   pretrainedpipeline with pipeline's name and its language:
pipeline = pretrainedpipeline('explain_document_dl', lang='en')

   to use spark nlp online pretrained models:
ner = nerdlmodel.pretrained()

   if you have any trouble using online pipelines or models in your
   environment (maybe it's air-gapped), you can directly download them for
   offline use.

   after downloading offline models/pipelines and extracting them, here is
   how you can use them iside your code (the path could be a shared
   storage like hdfs in a cluster):
     * loading id88model annotator model inside spark nlp pipeline

val pos = id88model.load("/tmp/pos_ud-gsd_fr_2.0.0_2.4_1553029753307/")
      .setinputcols("document", "token")
      .setoutputcol("pos")

     * loading offline pipeline

val advancedpipeline = pipelinemodel.load("/tmp/explain_document_dl_en_2.0.0_2.4
_1553227894237/")
// to use the loaded pipeline for prediction
advancedpipeline.transform(predictiondf)

troubleshooting

ocr

     * q: i am getting a java core dump when running ocr transformation
          + a: add lc_all=c environment variable
     * q: getting org.apache.pdfbox.filter.missingimagereaderexception:
       cannot read jpeg2000 image: java advanced imaging (jai) image i/o
       tools are not installed when running an ocr transformation
          + a: --packages
            com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio-jpeg2000:1.3.0. this
            library is non-free thus we can't include it as a spark-nlp
            dependency by default
