id164 deep learning

   since 2012 when [20]alexnet appeared and broke almost all the records
   in image classification contests, the landscape of a id161
   (cv) community has completely changed. there has been an exponential
   growth in the number of id161 solutions based on
   convolutional neural networks (id98s) in the past five years, and this
   trend seems to be continuing.

   because it   s so easy to reuse professionally pretrained networks like
   [21]microsoft resnet or [22]google inception, implementing and
   understanding id98s for tasks like image classification and regression
   has gotten exponentially easier, even for a beginner deep learning
   researcher. but deep learning can do a lot more than this.

   in this post, we will concentrate on some specific, sophisticated
   visual tasks that deep learning can help accomplish. these are tasks
   where we are not only interested in image recognition, but also would
   like to automatically infer the actual position of detected objects
   from a provided image: id164, image segmentation and object
   instance segmentation (with masking).

   detection using faster r-id98

id164

   the main aim of id164 task is to detect the object (or a set
   of objects) from a predefined set of classes as well as detect the
   minimal sufficient bounding box around each object instance.

   this problem is usually tackled by:
    1. producing the set of candidate region proposals
    2. classifying each of them using a neural network designed and
       trained specifically for this purpose.

   the most difficult part of this process is to effectively find
   reasonable proposals.

   in the beginning, classic and relatively sophisticated cv techniques
   were used in order to find appropriate candidates. this process slowly
   evolved into an end-to-end deep learning solution called [23]faster
   r-id98     where id98s are used for both finding proposals (so-called
   region proposal networks     rpns), and classification. it   s worth
   mentioning that these two networks (rpns and networks used for
   classification) share a huge part of their parameters, which speeds up
   the training process and increases the accuracy of both candidate
   region selection as well as its final prediction and evaluation.

   architectures for image segmentation.

image segmentation

   in the most basic image segmentation definition, the algorithm is
   tasked with performing a pixel-wise classification, which assigns one
   class to a pixel. it does this by using the predefined set of classes
   (or a id203 distribution, which measures how a given pixel is
   probable to belong to the given class). usually, when any other class
   is not assigned to the given pixel, an extra background class is added.

   the main difficulty of this task is that most of existing id98
   topologies tend to favor the increase of the semantic complexity over
   the actual spatial precision of deeper filters in a network. to deal
   with this challenge, we use pooling/downsampling layers which decrease
   the resolution of feature maps. although in case of regression and
   classification such approach is reasonable     mainly because the general
   features of an image should be properly detected     if the network is to
   produce the full-resolution feature map, these downsampling techniques
   may result in a poor performance.

deconvolution

   in order to prevent a negative performance using downsampling
   techniques, we use an intelligent upsampling technique called
   deconvolution. using this method, which works exactly like upsampling
   convolution, we make it possible to increase the resolution of a
   feature map in id98 data flow. most of the time, these upsampled feature
   maps are combined with precedent feature maps in the network- or even
   the original input image- in order to obtain more accurate predictions.
   the most popular architectures which work in this manner are:
   [25]u-nets and [26]fully convolutional neural networks (fcns).

   instance segmentation with masking using mask r-id98 .

object instance segmentation with masking

   this task can be considered as a combination of the previous two tasks.
   the main purpose of object instance segmentation with masking is to
   find a binary mask for every instance of objects from a predefined set
   of classes.

   the current state-of-the-art solution for this problem, called [27]mask
   r-id98, is a brilliant combination of the techniques used for both
   id164 and image segmentation. whereas in faster r-id98 the
   convolutional shared layers model part is a base for both region
   proposal and classification outputs, in mask r-id98 an additional
   segmentation branch is added.

   thanks to this branch, each instance is provided with the bounding
   boxes and a full object mask. because of the fact that training of the
   additional image segmentation part also influences the shared
   convolutional base, it positively affects other output branches of the
   model. thanks to this phenomenon, the model, which has been designed
   for an object instance segmentation,is able to achieve a new record on
   a highly recognized [28]ms coco 2016 dataset for an id164.

summary

   image recognition and regression are only a tip of the iceberg when it
   comes to successful deep learning applications. thanks to increasing
   algorithmic and computational progress, more and more real-life
   applications of image recognition and regression may experience a huge
   boost in the coming years. at the same time, as more and more solutions
   are designed in an end-to-end manner, the need for deep learning
   expertise is rapidly decreasing. needless to say, the industry has some
   interesting changes that await it as our technology continues to
   improve.
