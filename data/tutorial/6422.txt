machine learning pipeline     you   ve got it wrong

   design specs. write software. test it, fix bugs, post to production.

   agile development is omnipresent in the software development world.
   however, the machine learning development is more like a creative
   research process. there are certain similarities though, which i   d like
   to shortly outline here.

   for those of you that never worked on building an end-to-end machine
   learning solution, i   d like to shed a light on this process.

1. specify your expectations to determine roi

   in machine learning our system has a precisely-defined task, like
   recognizing text on an image. to determine business plausibility, we
   need to understand: how good our algorithm needs to be to bring us a
   return on investment?

   let   s imagine we have a regular, rule-based algorithm (without machine
   learning), that is 70% effective in automating a human task, like
   insurance underwriting         i.e. it can automate away the task in 7 in 10
   cases. will an increase to 80% yield an improvement good enough to
   justify the investment?

   action item: determine the threshold when the investment returns.

2. determine the    state of the art    solution

   before tackling any software development project, we do a research on
   existing solutions, libraries, algorithms etc.

   when working on a machine learning project, we do the same         but along
   with libraries, it   s important to review the scientific literature.

     state of the art     the best solution to a definite problem known in
     the academic world. for example, currently [20]state of the art
     solution to the mnist digits classification problem is 0.21% error.

   action item: research the current state of the art for a problem
   similar to yours. you will probably not do better         is the solution
   satisfying?
   sample neural network classification result on the cifar-10 a sample
   neural network classification result on the cifar-10. with 67% accuracy
   it   s not exactly state-of-the-art     

3. collect high-quality training data (but not too much)

   the biggest threat to any machine learning solution is not having
   enough clear, meaningful data.

          did you know that docker can run your gpu app? learn how to
     [21]dockerize a gpu-powered keras deep neural network to run in
     production and scale up!

   too noisy data will lead to building an algorithm giving unsatisfying
   results i.e. learning from the noise.
   too little data will make it not general enough (a phenomenon known as
   underfitting).
   underfitting and overfitting underfitting and overfitting are the
   challenges for quality of a machine learning model. source:
   [22]http://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning.

   yet getting more data is often expensive (time or money) process and is
   not usually justified at the very beginning of the process. a decision
   to collect more data must be informed.

   action item: determine how much data you can gather without getting
   high with spendings. determine how much would it take (time and money)
   in order to get more data.

4. pre-process and augment data

   let   s consider the problem of customer segmentation, where we try to
   split a customer base into segments. we may want to do this to target
   them with different types of marketing message or branding.
   customer segmentation customer segmentation is a hot topic         businesses
   want to understand their market better. source: expressanalytics

   what information about a customer do we need to determine his fit for a
   particular profile? surely demographics or purchase history would be
   useful.

   if the data isn   t relevant (like the first or last name), though, it
   can confuse the algorithm.

   but can (and should) we collect more features? we might want to augment
   our customer profile with social media information or infer e.g. their
   income group based on other features. if we   re good enough in this, we
   can even use that to win a us election.

   action items: determine, what features used to be relevant when you
   were working on this problem. what expert knowledge do you already
   have? how can you augment your dataset?

5. design some number of experiments

   grid search method grid search is a method to find optimal parameters
   of a machine learning model. it   s an important step in machine learning
   development.

   now that we have our dataset ready, we need to design experiments and
   evaluate them.

   action items:
    1. define 10   20 experiments you   d like to go with and try to train
       them for a limited time.
    2. determine a couple of them that are significantly better than the
       others. run a grid search (or a variation) to determine a winner
       combination of algorithm and hyperparameters.

6. refine your final algorithm(s)

   now that you have your winner algorithm and parameter set, try to make
   it even better.

   action items:
    1. is your model overfitting to the training set? if so, you can get
       more data to enhance the model quality.
    2. are there any more parameters you can fine-tune?
    3. are you satisfied with the result? try deploying your model in a
       production environment. how does it handle a real-world challenge?
