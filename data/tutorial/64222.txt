inspect_id97

   google [71]released a large id97 model that they trained on roughly
   100 billion words from a google news dataset. it contains exactly 3
   million words, and the word vectors have 300 features each.

   i was curious to explore some aspects of that 3 million word list, and
   that's what this project is about.

   if you're interested in actually applying id97 to a problem, i
   recommend the python package gensim--it's what i've used here to
   interact with the pre-trained google model.

   if you'd like to browse the 3m word list in google's pre-trained model,
   you can just look at the text files in the "vocabulary" folder. i split
   the word list across 50 files, and each text file contains 100,000
   entries from the model. i split it up like this so your editor wouldn't
   completely choke (hopefully) when you try to open them. the words are
   stored in their original order--i haven't sorted the list
   alphabetically. i don't know what determined the original order.

   for example:
     * does it include stop words?
          + answer: some stop words like "a", "and", "of" are excluded,
            but others like "the", "also", "should" are included.
     * does it include misspellings of words?
          + answer: yes. for instance, it includes both "mispelled" and
            "misspelled"--the latter is the correct one.
     * does it include commonly paired words?
          + answer: yes. for instance, it includes "soviet_union" and
            "new_york".
     * does it include numbers?
          + answer: not directly; e.g., you won't find "100". but it does
            include entries like "###mhz_ddr2_sdram" where i'm assuming
            the '#' are intended to match any digit.

the code

   3 million words is a lot, so the full list of words is unwieldy. the
   code writes out the word list to 30 files with 100k words each.

   once you've loaded the model, you can also query it directly to check
   if a particular entry is present or not.

   in order to run this, you're going to need to download the [72]binary
   file of google's model. it's 1.5gb, so i can't include it in the github
   project.
