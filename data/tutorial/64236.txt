undreamt: unsupervised id4

   this is an open source implementation of our unsupervised neural
   machine translation system, described in the following paper:

   mikel artetxe, gorka labaka, eneko agirre, and kyunghyun cho. 2018.
   [72]unsupervised id4. in proceedings of the
   sixth international conference on learning representations (iclr 2018).

   if you use this software for academic research, please cite the paper
   in question:
@inproceedings{artetxe2018iclr,
  author    = {artetxe, mikel  and  labaka, gorka  and  agirre, eneko  and  cho,
 kyunghyun},
  title     = {unsupervised id4},
  booktitle = {proceedings of the sixth international conference on learning rep
resentations},
  month     = {april},
  year      = {2018}
}

   note: this software has been superseded by [73]monoses, our
   unsupervised id151 system. [74]monoses
   obtains substantially better results (e.g. 26.2 vs 15.1 id7 in
   english-french wmt14), so we strongly recommend that you switch to it.

requirements

     * python 3
     * pytorch (tested with v0.3)

usage

   the following command trains an unsupervised id4 system from
   monolingual corpora using the exact same settings described in the
   paper:
python3 train.py --src src.mono.txt --trg trg.mono.txt --src_embeddings src.emb.
txt --trg_embeddings trg.emb.txt --save model_prefix --cuda

   the data in the above command should be provided as follows:
     * src.mono.txt and trg.mono.txt are the source and target language
       monolingual corpora. they should both be pre-processed so atomic
       symbols (either tokens or bpe units) are separated by whitespaces.
       for that purpose, we recommend using [75]moses to tokenize and
       truecase the corpora and, optionally, [76]subword-id4 if you want
       to use bpe.
     * src.emb.txt and trg.emb.txt are the source and target language
       cross-lingual embeddings. in order to obtain them, we recommend
       training monolingual embeddings in the corpora above using either
       [77]id97 or [78]fasttext, and then map them to a shared space
       using [79]vecmap. please make sure to cutoff the vocabulary as
       desired before mapping the embeddings.
     * model_prefix is the prefix of the output model.

   using the above settings, training takes about 3 days in a single titan
   xp. once training is done, you can use the resulting model for
   translation as follows:
python3 translate.py model_prefix.final.src2trg.pth < input.txt > output.txt

   for more details and additional options, run the above scripts with the
   --help flag.

faq

i have seen that you have a separate unsupervised smt system called
[80]monoses. which one should i use?

   you should definitely use [81]monoses. it is newer and obtains
   substantially better results (e.g. 26.2 vs 15.1 id7 in english-french
   wmt14), so we strongly recommend that you switch to it.

you claim that your unsupervised id4 system is trained on monolingual corpora
alone, but it also requires bilingual embeddings... isn't that cheating?

   not really, because we also learn the bilingual embeddings from
   monolingual corpora alone. we use our companion tool [82]vecmap for
   that.

can i use this software to train a regular id4 system on parallel corpora?

   yes! you can use the following arguments to make undreamt behave like a
   regular id4 system:
python3 train.py --src2trg src.parallel.txt trg.parallel.txt --src_vocabulary sr
c.vocab.txt --trg_vocabulary trg.vocab.txt --embedding_size 300 --learn_encoder_
embeddings --disable_denoising --save model_prefix --cuda
