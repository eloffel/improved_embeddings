building a faq chatbot in python     the future of information searching

   [97]yogesh kulkarni, january 21, 2018

introduction

   what do we do when we need any information? simple:    we ask, and google
   tells   .

   but if the answer depends on multiple variables, then the existing
   ask-tell model tends to sputter. state of the art search engines
   usually cannot handle such requests. we would have to search for
   information available in bits and pieces and then try to filter and
   assemble relevant parts together. sounds time consuming, doesn   t it?

   source: inbenta

   this ask-tell model is evolving rapidly with the advent of chatbots
   (also referred to as just    bots   ).

   this article talks about the development of a bot for extracting
   information related to the recently introduced goods and services tax
   (gst) in india. being a relatively new concept, a lot of people are
   still trying to understand how it works. chatbots can provide such
   information in a natural and conversational way. this article
   demonstrates building a chatbot for answering queries related to gst.
   let   s call this a gst-faq bot!

    8. our chatbot in action


chatbots and nlp

   to know more about gst, like how to apply for registrations, tax slabs,
   etc., companies have posted frequently asked questions (faqs) on their
   websites. going through that amount of information can be a painstaking
   process. in these situations, chatbots come in handy, effective and
   thus, have become enormously popular.

   these days, natural language processing (nlp), especially its component
   natural language understanding (nlu), has allowed bots to have a
   greater understanding of language and context. they are becoming more
   intelligent in understanding the meaning of the search and can return
   very specific, context-based information.

   applications like whatsapp, facebook messenger, slack, etc. are
   increasingly being used by businesses. bots are starting to replace
   websites-interface as well. from the considerable number of choices
   available for building a chatbot, this particular implementation uses
   the rasa-nlu library in python.


why rasa-nlu?

   many chatbot platforms are currently available, from rudimentary
   rule-based aiml (artificial intelligence markup language), to highly
   sophisticated ai bots. some popular chatbot platforms are api.ai,
   wit.ai, facebook apis, microsoft luis, ibm watson, etc.

   rasa-nlu builds a local nlu (natural language understanding) model for
   extracting intent and entities from a conversation. it   s open source,
   fully local and above all, free! it is also compatible with wit.ai,
   luis, or api.ai, so you can migrate your chat application data into the
   rasa-nlu model.

   below is a demonstration on how to install rasa-nlu and build a simple
   faq bot in python.


building gst faq bot architecture

   a chatbot is a client-server application. in the case of rasa-nlu, even
   the server can be local. the client is nothing but the chabot ui. the
   interaction and architecture can be understood by the following
   diagram:


installations

   rasa can be installed and configured on a standalone machine. steps to
   follow:
    1. ready installation can be done by: pip install rasa_nlu
    2. you can view the latest documentation [98]here

   rasa-nlu is made up of a few components, each doing some specific work
   (intent detection, entity extraction, etc.). each component may have
   some specific dependencies and installations. options like mitie (nlp +
   ml), spacy and sklearn are available to choose from. we will be using
   spacy-sklearn here.

   client ui can be a web page (using frameworks like flask in python) or
   a mobile app. flask is simple to code and runs locally. use pip install
   flask and follow [99]this tutorial to get a basic understanding of the
   framework.


server

   a rasa-nlu platform needs to be trained before we start using it. we
   need to supply it with a few sentences and mention which are the
   intents and entities in it. intents are the actions/categories of the
   sentences and entities are the necessary variables needed to fulfil the
   actions.

   for example,    i wish to book a flight from mumbai to pune on 27 march   
   has    flight-booking    as the intent and    mumbai   ,    pune    and    27 march   
   as the entities. similarly, many training examples can be used so that
   the rasa-nlu model is trained on different ways of extracting
   intents/entities from our domain conversations. this training data is
   stored in a json, a sample of which can be seen [100]here.

   it contains many entries. one of the sample entries is shown below:
      {
        "text": "show me a mexican place in the centre",
        "intent": "restaurant_search",
        "entities": [
          {
            "start": 31,
            "end": 37,
            "value": "centre",
            "entity": "location"
          },
          {
            "start": 10,
            "end": 17,
            "value": "mexican",
            "entity": "cuisine"
          }
        ]
}


   following is the explanation of some of the fields mentioned in the
   above code:
     * text: the input sentence.
     * intent: action or category, in this instance    restaurant_search   .
       this is typically the call-back function name.
     * entities: array of entities. here, there are two. one is of type
          location    with value as    centre   , whereas the other is of type
          cuisine    with value    mexican   .    start    and    end    specify beginning
       and ending indices of the word in the sentence.

   you can use the below online tool as well, to generate this json file:

   [101]https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-nlu-trainer/


steps to build server side of the gst chat bot application:

    1. create a new directory and navigate to it.
    2. create the following things in it:
         1. data directory
         2. data/demo_gst.json: this has gst faq training examples as
            shown above
         3. json: this has settings for rasa-nlu as shown below:
{
  "pipeline": "spacy_sklearn",
  "path" : "./",
  "data" : "./data/gstfaq-data.json"
}

    3. train the model in python
          +
-m rasa_nlu.train -c config.json
    4. this will create a model_yyyymmdd-hid48ss folder
    5. run:
          +
-m rasa_nlu.server -c config.json --server_model_dirs=./model_yyyymmdd-hid48ss
          + this starts the rasa-nlu server and let   s us know the port,
            for instance
    6. once the server starts running you can get/post via curl to post or
       use it as the http server
    7. for http server, add    -e luis    while running the server
    8. then, in the browser,
       type: http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello%20there
    9. the output is shown below:

   we can now look at the remaining components of our gst faq bot.


client

   our chatbot client ui has been built using flask framework. it uses two
   html templates to render the ui (i.e. the chat window). the outer ui is
   built with base.html as shown below:
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   
</head>
    <body>
         <h1 align="center">gst faq chat</h1>
        <div class="container">
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
</body>
    <footer>
        {% block other_footers %}{% endblock %}
    </footer>
</html>

   the content and other_footers blocks are defined in home.html as shown
   below:
{% block content %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="chat_window">
                <ul class="messages"></ul>
                <div class="bottom_wrapper clearfix">
                    <div class="message_input_wrapper">
                        <input id="msg_input" class="message_input" placeholder=
"say hi to begin chat..." />
                    </div>
                    <div class="send_message">
                         <div class="text">send</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="message_template">
                <li class="message">
                    <div class="avatar"></div>
                    <div class="text_wrapper">
                        <div class="text"></div>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}


{% block other_footers %}
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename="js/bind.js") }}"></script>
{% endblock %}


engine

   this is the heart of the chatbot. based on the intent received from
   rasa-nlu, it dispatches the entities to the mapped call-back functions.
   the function in turn, depending on the entities, calls knowledgebase to
   get the response. once the response is received, it is sent back to the
   ui.

   knowledgebase can be as simple as a dictionary of questions and
   answers, or as sophisticated as one can imagine/require (like
   databases, internet sources, etc.). this article, being minimalistic
   for demonstration purposes, fetches pre-coded responses from the
   dictionary.

   let   s take a look at the sample dictionary:
intent_response_dict = {
    "intro": ["this is a gst faq bot. one stop-shop to all your gst related quer
ies"],
    "greet":["hey","hello","hi"],
    "goodbye":["bye","it was nice talking to you","see you","ttyl"],
    "affirm":["cool","i know you would like it"],
    "faq_link":['you can check all the events here <a href="https://www.cbec.gov
.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/deptt_offcr/faq-on-gst.pdf</a>']
}


   the engine   s use of rasa-nlu for intent-entities extraction and
   dispatching call-backs can be seen below:
@app.route('/chat',methods=["post"])
def chat():
    try:
        user_message = request.form["text"]
        response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/parse",params={"q":user_m
essage})
        response = response.json()
        response = response["topscoringintent"]
        intent = response.get("intent")
        entities = response.get("entities")
        if intent == "gst-info":
            response_text = gst_info(entities
        elif intent == "gst-query":
            response_text = gst_query(entities)
        else:
            response_text = get_random_response(intent)
        return jsonify({"status":"success","response":response_text})
    except exception as e:
        print(e)
        return jsonify({"status":"success","response":"sorry i am not trained to
 do that yet..."})



   user text is sent to the rasa-nlu server using
   [102]http://localhost:5000/parse. its response contains the intent and
   the entities. depending on the intent, functions like gst-info and
   gst-query are called. their responses are then sent back to the ui.

   the source code for this app is available on [103]github.


our chatbot in action

   steps to operate:

   1.       start the rasa-nlu server by executing    run_server.bat   
   script. it loads the custom trained model and starts listening to port
   5000

   2.       execute the flash app, by running the localhost at the given
   port, say 8000.

   3.       start typing commands in the bottom chat window and click
      send   .

   4.       typed messages and their responses appear in the window above,
   as seen in the adjoining picture.


   you can view the video demonstration [104]here.


end notes

   this tutorial presents just a small example, demonstrating the
   potential to develop something full-fledged and practically useful. our
   gst q&a bot can be enhanced on various fronts, such as expansion of
   knowledgebase (i.e. number of questions and answers), better training
   to find more intents and entities, id86 of the
   responses to have a human language feel, etc.

   gst faq bot is just one example of building an intuitive frontend using
   government information. with the availability of more apis and open
   public data, we can build similar (if not better) bots for those
   databases. imagine interacting with government departments using a
   chatty bot!

       great intro on chatbot for a novice like me!
       it would be great if you could give more insights on knowledge
       base. as here simple knowledge base has been used but if a smart
       chatbot need to be developed a good knowledge base would be
       required. help me to explore and integrate better knowledge base.
       do knowledge base need to be created manually or we can also come
       over it using some hack ( considering a domain specific chatbot)?
       let say fro an e-comerce chatbot, what could be the probable
       knowledge base we can use?
       kindly share your email, it would be really nice to connect with
       you.

            knowledge base can get as complex as one wants or needs. nlu
            layer just interprets what user types into    intent    and
               entities   , rest is all upto queries into the knowledge-base.

       hi,
       i do have a small question. i want to build a chatbot for not only
       faq but also for other conversations. it is a company specific
       chatbot. currently i am planning on using tensorflow to achieve the
       goal using id195 algorithm for deep learning. my question is can
       we build a general chatbot which not only works with faqs but also
       with normal conversations using rasa-nlu?

            nlu layer just interprets what user types into    intent    and
               entities   , rest is all up to you. if you have a id195 model
            (id56/lstm) that can predict the response (decoder ), given
            intent and entities (encoder), then that should work as well.
            btw, would like to suggest you to look at rasa   s latest core
            module. it models the next action   may be useful in what you
            are trying to do.

            please re-sync with the latest github code.
            delete the existing model.
            re-train by running the training script, it will create a new
            model.
            run the latest/updated run_server script.
            please let me know if you are still getting the error, after
            following the above steps.

                 the error still exists. i have taken the latest code from
                 git today.
                 i checked in the code for server.py and there isnt an
                 argument called    server_model_dirs   . it just has the

                      first delete the existing model.
                      create a new one by training using run_training.bat:
                         python -m rasa_nlu.train -c config.json   
                      config.json should be:
                      {
                         pipeline   :    spacy_sklearn   ,

                      }
                      then run run_server.bat , it should be    python -m

                           linking with spacy   s en dictionary too (i had
                           to download using python -m spacy download en

                           issues when using spacy so we need to initiate
                           these 2 variables to initiate utf-8 locale :

                           for me the flask app isnt opening at all. the

            rasa nlu is trained to identify intent and entities. better
            the training, better the identification. context gets captured
            better.
            as far as slot-filling is concerned, that one has to do by our
            own logic.
            rasa core is now providing dialog manager to let you navigate
            the dialog states via stories.
            i would suggest going to tutorials at rasa site.

       for the data to train the model. therefore, what is the argument
       for starting the rasa-nlu server and let   s us know the port, for
