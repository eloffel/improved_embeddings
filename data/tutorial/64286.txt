[29]id111: how to cluster texts (e.g. news articles) with artificial
intelligence?

   $\begingroup$

   i have built some neural networks (mlp (fully-connected), elman
   (recurrent)) for different tasks, like playing pong, classifying
   handwritten digits and stuff...

   additionally i tried to build some first convolutional neural networks,
   e.g. for classifying multi-digit handwritten notes, but i am completely
   new to analyze and cluster texts, e.g. in image recognition/id91
   tasks one can rely on standardized input, like 25x25 sized images, rgb
   or greyscale and so on...there are plenty of pre-assumption features.

   for id111, for instance news articles, you have an ever changing
   size of input (different words, different sentences, different text
   length, ...).

   how can one implement a modern id111 tool utilizing artificial
   intelligence, preferably neural networks / soms?

   unfortunately i were unable to find simple tutorials to start-off.
   complex scientific papers are hard to read and not the best option for
   learning a topic (as to my opinion). i already read quite some papers
   about mlps, dropout techniques, convolutional neural networks and so
   on, but i were unable to find a basic one about id111 - all i
   found was far too high level for my very limited id111 skills.

   id44 (lda) is great, but if you want something
   better that uses neural networks i would strongly suggest doc2vec
   ([44]https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html).

   what it does? it works similarly to google's id97 but instead of a
   single word feature vector you get a feature vector for a paragraph.
   the method is based on a skip-gram model and neural networks and is
   considered one of the best methods to extract a feature vector for
   documents.

   now given that you have this vector you can run id116 id91 (or
   any other preferable algorithm) and cluster the results.

   finally, to extract the feature vectors you can do it as easy as that:
from gensim.models import doc2vec
from gensim.models.doc2vec import labeledsentence

class labeledlinesentence(object):
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
    def __iter__(self):
        for uid, line in enumerate(open(self.filename)):
            yield labeledsentence(words=line.split(), labels=['txt_%s' % uid])


sentences = labeledlinesentence('your_text.txt')

model = doc2vec(alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.025, size=50, window=5, min_count=5,
                dm=1, workers=8, sample=1e-5)

model.build_vocab(sentences)

for epoch in range(500):
    try:
        print 'epoch %d' % (epoch)
        model.train(sentences)
        model.alpha *= 0.99
        model.min_alpha = model.alpha
    except (keyboardinterrupt, systemexit):
        break

   apart from lda you can use [51]latent semantic analysis with
   [52]id116. it's not neural networks, but rather "classical"
   id91, but it works quite well.

   example in sklearn (taken from [53]here):
dataset = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', shuffle=true, random_state=42)
labels = dataset.target
true_k = np.unique(labels).shape[0]

vectorizer = tfidftransformer()
x = vectorizer.fit_transform(dataset.data)

svd = truncatedsvd(true_k)
lsa = make_pipeline(svd, normalizer(copy=false))

x = lsa.fit_transform(x)

km = kmeans(n_clusters=true_k, init='id116++', max_iter=100)
km.fit(x)

   now cluster assignment labels are available in km.labels_

   for example, these are the topics extracted from 20 newsgroups with
   lsa:
cluster 0:  space  shuttle  alaska  edu  nasa  moon  launch  orbit  henry  sci
cluster 1:  edu  game  team  games  year  ca  university  players  hockey  baseb
all
cluster 2:  sale  00  edu  10  offer  new  distribution  subject  lines  shippin
g
cluster 3:  israel  israeli  jews  arab  jewish  arabs  edu  jake  peace  israel
is
cluster 4:  cmu  andrew  org  com  stratus  edu  mellon  carnegie  pittsburgh  p
a
cluster 5:  god  jesus  christian  bible  church  christ  christians  people  ed
u  believe
cluster 6:  drive  scsi  card  edu  mac  disk  ide  bus  pc  apple
cluster 7:  com  ca  hp  subject  edu  lines  organization  writes  article  lik
e
cluster 8:  car  cars  com  edu  engine  ford  new  dealer  just  oil
cluster 9:  sun  monitor  com  video  edu  vga  east  card  monitors  microsyste
ms
cluster 10:  nasa  gov  jpl  larc  gsfc  jsc  center  fnal  article  writes
cluster 11:  windows  dos  file  edu  ms  files  program  os  com  use
cluster 12:  netcom  com  edu  cramer  fbi  sandvik  408  writes  article  peopl
e
cluster 13:  armenian  turkish  armenians  armenia  serdar  argic  turks  turkey
  genocide  soviet
cluster 14:  uiuc  cso  edu  illinois  urbana  uxa  university  writes  news  co
bb
cluster 15:  edu  cs  university  posting  host  nntp  state  subject  organizat
ion  lines
cluster 16:  uk  ac  window  mit  server  lines  subject  university  com  edu
cluster 17:  caltech  edu  keith  gatech  technology  institute  prism  morality
  sgi  livesey
cluster 18:  key  clipper  chip  encryption  com  keys  escrow  government  algo
rithm  des
cluster 19:  people  edu  gun  com  government  don  like  think  just  access

   you also can apply [54]non-negative id105, which can be
   interpreted as id91. all you need to do is to take largest
   component of each document in the transformed space - and use it as
   cluster assignment.

   in sklearn:
nmf = nmf(n_components=k, random_state=1).fit_transform(x)
labels = nmf.argmax(axis=1)

   lsa+kmeans works well but you have to input the amount of clusters you
   are expecting. moreover the silhouette coefficient of the clusters
   found is usually low.

   another method with which i get better results is to use dbscan
   [61]example here. it search for centers of high density and expands to
   make clusters. in this method it automatically finds the optimal amount
   of clusters.

   i've also found it very important to use a stemmer, such as snowball
   for ex, which reduces the errors due to typos. a good stop words list
   is also very important if you want to be sure to get rid of some
   clusters which would have no meaning because of the high occurrence of
   common words with no significant meaning. when you build your count
   matrix, normalisation is also important, it allows to add weigh to a
   word with a low occurrence on the dataset, but with high occurrence in
   particular samples. these words are meaningful and you don't want to
   miss them. it also lowers weights of words with high occurrences in all
   particular samples (close to stop word but for words which can have a
   little meaning). one last thing i noticed was important is not to print
   the top 10 words of your clusters, but a more extended selection.
   usually the quality and relevance of the keywords toward the label you
   would give to the cluster tend to reduce dramatically after these top
   10-20 words. so an extended view of top keywords will help you to
   analyze if your cluster is really relevant or very polluted by noise.

   my favorite method is [66]lda; you can look [67]here for a tutorial
   using python packages.

   you can also look at much simpler methods like [68]this.
