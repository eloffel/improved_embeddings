   have you ever wondered how life formed from the primordial soup and
   evolved to the different life forms which can be seen at present? how
   did different species evolved from their ancestors and what
   relationships do they have with each other? these questions can be
   answered through the study of phylogenetics.

   this article will walk you through the following topics.
    1. what is phylogenetics?
    2. phylogenetic trees
    3. algorithms used for phylogenetic id136
    4. sample practice task with code

what is phylogenetics?

   according to wikipedia,

     phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history and
     relationships among individuals or groups of organisms.

   the relationships among organisms are discovered through phylogenetic
   id136 methods where heritable traits, such as dna sequences or
   morphologies can be observed under a certain model of evolution. the
   result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic
   tree). it is a diagram depicting a hypothesis about the history of the
   evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms or a family of
   genes.

   molecular phylogenetics is a branch of phylogenetics that analyses how
   certain molecules, mainly dna sequences and proteins have changed over
   time, to determine evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms
   or a family of genes.

phylogenetic trees

   phylogenetic trees represent evolutionary relationships between
   organisms or genes. the pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree
   reflects how species or other groups have evolved from a series of
   common ancestors. an example of a phylogenetic tree is the [18]tree of
   life which denotes how various species of organisms have evolved since
   the birth of earth.

   in a phylogenetic tree, the species or groups of interest are found at
   the tips of lines known as branches. the points where branches are
   divided are called branch points.

   two species are more related if they have a more recent common ancestor
   and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.

   given here is a phylogenetic tree for primates based on their genetic
   data. gorillas and orangutans have diverged earlier than other primate
   groups. the homo lineage (humans) has moved along one path where as the
   pan lineage has moved along another path. later on, the pan lineage has
   divided, yielding chimpanzees and bonobos.

algorithms used for phylogenetic id136

   there are three main categories of algorithms that are used for
   phylogenetic id136 from any type of biological data. they are,
    1. distance-based methods
    2. maximum parsimony (mp) methods
    3. probabilistic methods

1. distance-based methods

   distance-based methods compute an evolutionary distance, which is the
   number of changes that have occurred for two species considered to
   diverge from a common ancestor. however, these methods face problems
   with accuracy when it comes to dealing with large volumes of data which
   have very distant relationships.

2. maximum parsimony (mp) methods

   mp methods infer a tree that minimizes the total number of changes,
   known as mutations, required to explain the data. under the maximum
   parsimony criterion, the shortest possible tree that explains the data
   is considered as the best tree. this best tree is known as the
   most-parsimonious tree. heuristic search is performed to quickly
   generate the most-parsimonious tree. since this methods considers the
   shortest possible tree as the best tree, actual evolutionary changes
   that have occurred may be underestimated.

3. probabilistic methods

   probabilistic methods, such as maximum likelihood (ml) and bayesian
   id136, attempt to find a tree that maximizes the conditional or
   posterior id203 of observing the data. phylogenetic studies at
   present, widely utilize bayesian frameworks due to the possibility of
   account for the phylogenetic uncertainty, availability of efficient
   algorithms and their implementation as various computer programs.

bio.phylo         time to practice

   since we have a basic idea about phylogenetic trees, it is time to try
   out some coding. i have introduced a set of python tools named
   biopython in one of my [21]previous articles, which can be used to
   analyze biological data. if you haven   t gone through it make sure to
   check it out as well.

   i will be using the bio.phylo module which provides classes, functions
   and i/o support for working with phylogenetic trees. you can go through
   the [22]official documentation to get more details about this module.

task         construct the phylogenetic tree for the given dna sequences

   consider you are provided five dna sequences with their labels in the
   beginning of each line. you can find these sequences in a file named as
   [23]msa.phy in the [24]official biopython test material for tree
   construction. the sequences considered are given below.
    1. alpha aacgtggccacat
    2. beta aaggtcgccacac
    3. gamma cagttcgccacaa
    4. delta gagatttid35cct
    5. epsilon gagatctid35ccc

   we are given the task of constructing the phylogenetic tree to
   represent these sequences based on distance-based phylogenetic
   id136 methods.

   currently, bio.phylo module has two types of tree constructors:
   distancetreeconstructor and parsimonytreeconstructor. we will be using
   distancetreeconstructor for this task.

   furthermore, the distancetreeconstructor supports two heuristic
   algorithms: upgma (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean)
   and nj (neighbor joining). we will be using the upgma algorithm. you
   can read more about the upgma algorithm from this [25]link.

solution

   firstly, make sure you have downloaded the msa.phy file which contains
   the input sequences and include it in your current working directory.

   given below is the python code to create the phylogenetic tree for the
   given dna sequences. note how we have used bio.phylo module and its
   functionality.

   by running the code, we can get the phylogenetic tree as a graphical
   visualization as well as get it printed in the terminal as shown below.

   if you use nj algorithm instead of upgma algorithm, the resulting tree
   will be changed as shown below.

   hope you enjoyed reading this article and learned useful and
   interesting things about molecular genetics and how to use biopython to
   construct phylogenetic trees from a given set of sequences. i would
   love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

   thanks for reading
