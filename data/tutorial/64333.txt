       as a current student on this bumpy collegiate pathway, i stumbled
       upon course hero, where i can find study resources for nearly all
       my courses, get online help from tutors 24/7, and even share my old
       projects, papers, and lecture notes with other students.

       i cannot even describe how much course hero helped me this summer.
       it   s truly become something i can always rely on and help me. in
       the end, i was not only able to survive summer classes, but i was
       able to thrive thanks to course hero.

       the ability to access any university   s resources through course
       hero proved invaluable in my case. i was behind on tulane
       coursework and actually used ucla   s materials to help me move
       forward and get everything together on time.
