description

   prototype implementation in pytorch of the nips'16 paper:
   convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral
   filtering
   m defferrard, x bresson, p vandergheynst
   advances in neural information processing systems, 3844-3852, 2016
   arxiv preprint: [86]arxiv:1606.09375

code objective

   the code provides a simple example of graph convnets for the mnist
   classification task.
   the graph is a 8-nearest neighbor graph of a 2d grid.
   the signals on graph are the mnist images vectorized as $28^2 \times 1$
   vectors.

installation

git clone https://github.com/xbresson/graph_convnets_pytorch.git
cd graph_convnets_pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt # installation for python 3.6.2
python check_install.py
jupyter notebook # run the 2 notebooks

note

   pytorch has not yet implemented function torch.mm(sparse, dense) for
   variables: [87]https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/2389. it will
   be certainly implemented but in the meantime, i defined a new autograd
   function for sparse variables, called "my_sparse_mm", by subclassing
   torch.autograd.function and implementing the forward and backward
   passes.
class my_sparse_mm(torch.autograd.function):
    """
    implementation of a new autograd function for sparse variables,
    called "my_sparse_mm", by subclassing torch.autograd.function
    and implementing the forward and backward passes.
    """

    def forward(self, w, x):  # w is sparse
        self.save_for_backward(w, x)
        y = torch.mm(w, x)
        return y

    def backward(self, grad_output):
        w, x = self.saved_tensors
        grad_input = grad_output.clone()
        grad_input_dl_dw = torch.mm(grad_input, x.t())
        grad_input_dl_dx = torch.mm(w.t(), grad_input )
        return grad_input_dl_dw, grad_input_dl_dx

when to use this algorithm?

   any problem that can be cast as analyzing a set of signals on a fixed
   graph, and you want to use convnets for this analysis.
