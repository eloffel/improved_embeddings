why curing cancer is hard?

cancer stems from normal biology

cancer is not a single disease

cancer naturally resists treatment

10

cancer stems from normal biology

cancer is caused by genetic mutations

cells divide billions of times everyday

each division generates a few mutations

inevitable: enough of right mutations

11

cancer is    thousands of diseases   

traditionally classified by originating organ

   similar    tumors might have few common mutations

   20-80 rule   : treatments often fail for most patients

12

cancer has evolution on its side

over a billion cells upon detection

many    clones    w/ different characteristics

killing primary clone liberates resistant subclones

adapting clinical paradigms to the challenges of cancer 
clonal evolution. mrurgaesu et al., am. j. pathology 2013.

39

entity linking (a.k.a. id172)

in eubacteria and eukaryotic organelles the product of this gene, peptide 
deformylase (pdf), removes the formyl group from the initiating methionine of 
nascent peptides.        the discovery that a natural inhibitor of pdf, actinonin, acts as 
an antimicrobial agent in some bacteria has spurred intensive research into the 
design of bacterial-specific pdf inhibitors.        in humans, pdf function may 
therefore be restricted to rapidly growing cells.

relation: classification

the p56lck inhibitor dasatinib was shown to enhance apoptosis
induction by dexamethasone in otherwise gc-resistant cll cells.

this finding concurs with the observation by sade showing that
notch-mediated resistance of a mouse lymphoma cell line could be
overcome by inhibiting p56lck.

dasatinib could be used to treat notch-mutated tumors.

we can derive even more power from 
compositional representations!

[toutanova, lin, yih,  poon,  quirk, 16]

the bilinear compositional model of paths permits exact id136 with all relation paths 
of bounded length, using id145. 

polynomial in graph size and maximum path length

this model also allows finer-grained modeling of relation paths by distinguishing paths 
according to their specific intermediate nodes.
