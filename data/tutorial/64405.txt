set theory

this chapter describes set theory, a mathematical theory that underlies all of
modern mathematics.

a.1 basic de   nitions

de   nition a.1.1. a set is an unordered collection of elements.

sets may be described by listing their elements between curly braces, for
example {1, 2, 3} is the set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3. alternatively,
we an describe a set by specifying a certain condition whose elements satisfy, for
example {x : x2 = 1} is the set containing the elements 1 and    1 (assuming x is
a real number).

we make the following observations.

    there is no importance to the order in which the elements of a set appear.

thus {1, 2, 3}, is the same set as {3, 2, 1}.

    an element may either appear in a set or not, but it may not appear more

than one time.

    sets are typically denoted by an uppercase letter, for example a or b.

    it is possible that the elements of a set are sets themselves, for example
{1, 2,{3, 4}} is a set containing three elements (two scalars and one set).
we typically denote such sets with calligraphic notation, for example u.

de   nition a.1.2. if a is an element in a set a, we write a 2 a. if a is not
an element of a, we write a 62 a. the empty set, denoted by ; or {}, does not
contain any element.

appendix a. set theory

de   nition a.1.3. a set a with a    nite number of elements is called a    nite
set and its size (number of elements) is denoted by |a|. a set with an in   nite
number of elements is called an in   nite set.

de   nition a.1.4. we denote a     b if all elements in a are also in b. we
denote a = b if a     b and b     a, implying that the two sets are identical.
the di   erence between two sets a \ b is the set of elements in a but not in b.
the complement of a set a with respect to a set     is ac =     \ a (we may omit
the set     if it is obvious from context). the symmetric di   erence between two
sets a, b is

a4b = {x : x 2 a \ b or x 2 b \ a}.

example a.1.1. we have {1, 2, 3} \ {3, 4} = {1, 2} and {1, 2, 3}4{3, 4} =
{1, 2, 4}. assuming     = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, we have {1, 2, 3}c = {4, 5}.

in many cases we consider multiple sets indexed by a    nite or in   nite set. for

example u   ,     2 a represents multiple sets, one set for each element of a.
example a.1.2. below are three examples of multiple sets, u   ,     2 a. the
   rst example shows two sets: {1} and {2}. the second example shows multiple
sets: {1,   1}, {2,   2}, {3,   3}, and so on. the third example shows multiple
sets, each containing all real numbers between two consecutive natural numbers.

ui = {i},
ui = {i,   i},
u    = {    + r : 0     r     1},

i 2 a = {1, 2},
i 2 a = n = {1, 2, 3, . . .},
    2 a = n = {1, 2, 3, . . .}.

de   nition a.1.5. for multiple sets u   ,     2 a we de   ne the union and inter-
section operations as follows:

[   2a
\   2a

u    = {u : u 2 u    for one or more     2 a}

u    = {u : u 2 u    for all     2 a}.

figure a.1 illustrates these concepts in the case of two sets a, b with a non-

empty intersection.
de   nition a.1.6. the sets u   ,     2 a are disjoint or mutually disjoint if
\   2au    = ; and are pairwise disjoint if     6=    implies u    \ u   = ;. a union of
pairwise disjoint sets u   ,     2 a is denoted by ]   2au   .
example a.1.3.

{a, b, c} \ {c, d, e} = {c}
{a, b, c} [ {c, d, e} = {a, b, c, d, e}
{a, b, c} \ {c, d, e} = {a, b}.

zontal and vertical lines), and their union a[ b (gray area with either horizontal
or vertical lines or both). the set    \(a[b) = (a[b)c = ac\bc is represented
by white color.

example a.1.4. if a1 = {1}, a2 = {1, 2}, a3 = {1, 2, 3} we have

{ai : i 2 {1, 2, 3}} = {{1},{1, 2},{1, 2, 3}}

the properties below are direct consequences of the de   nitions above.

proposition a.1.1. for all sets a, b, c        ,

1. union and intersection are commutative and distributive:

a [ b = b [ a,
a \ b = b \ a,

(a [ b) [ c = a [ (b [ c)
(a \ b) \ c = a \ (b \ c)

7. a [ a = a = a \ a
8. a [     =    ,
9. a [ ; = a,

a \     = a
a \ ; = ;.

de   nition a.1.7. the power set of a set a is the set of all subsets of a, including
the empty set ; and a. it is denoted by 2a.
proposition a.1.2. if a is a    nite set then

|2a| = 2|a|.

proof. we can describe each element of 2a by a list of |a| 0 or 1 digits (1 if the
corresponding element is selected and 0 otherwise). the proposition follows since
there are 2|a| such lists (see proposition 1.6.1).

example a.1.5.

2{a,b} = {;,{a, b},{a},{b}}
|2{a,b}| = 4
xa22{a,b}

|a| = 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

the r package sets is convenient for illustrating basic concepts.

a   1a\ c = [   2q   a   \ c   
a   1a[ c = \   2q   a   [ c    .

proof. we prove the    rst statement for the case of |q| = 2. the proof of the
second statement is similar, and the general case is a straightforward extension.
we prove the set equality u = v by showing u     v and v     u . let x
belong to the set (a [ b) \ c. this means that x is in c and also in either a
or b, which implies x 2 (a \ c) [ (b \ c). on the other hand, if x belongs to
(a \ c) [ (b \ c), x is in a \ c or in b \ c. therefore x 2 c and also x is in
either a or b, implying that x 2 (a [ b) \ c.

sets, which implies x 2 s \ a    for all    , and therefore x 2 \   2q(s \ a   ). on the
other hand, if x 2 \   2q(s \ a   ), then x is in each of the s \ a    sets. therefore
x is in s but not in any of the a    sets, hence x 2 s \ [   2qa   .

de   nition a.1.8. we de   ne the sets of all natural numbers, integers, and ra-
tional numbers as follows:

n = {1, 2, 3, . . .}
z = {. . . ,   1, 0, 1, . . .}
q = {p/q : p 2 z, q 2 z \ {0}}.

228

appendix a. set theory

the set of real numbers1 is denoted by r.

de   nition a.1.9. we denote the closed interval, the open interval and the two
types of half-open intervals between a, b 2 r as

example a.1.6.

[a, b] = {x 2 r : a     x     b}
(a, b) = {x 2 r : a < x < b}
[a, b) = {x 2 r : a     x < b}
(a, b] = {x 2 r : a < x     b}.
[n2n
\n2n

[0, n/(n + 1)) = [0, 1/2).

[0, n/(n + 1)) = [0, 1),

de   nition a.1.10. the cartesian product of two sets a and b is

a     b = {(a, b) : a 2 a, b 2 b}.

in a similar way we de   ne the cartesian product of n 2 n sets. the repeated
cartesian product of the same set, denoted as

ad = a                a,

d 2 n,

is the set of d-tuples or d-dimensional vectors whose components are elements in
a.

example a.1.7. rd is the set of all d dimensional vectors whose components
are real numbers.

de   nition a.1.11. a relation r on a set a is a subset of a     a, or in other
if (a, b) 2 r we denote a     b and if
words a set of pairs of elements in a.
(a, b) 62 r we denote a 6    b. a relation is re   exive if a     a for all a 2 a. it is
symmetric if a     b implies b     a for all a, b 2 a. it is transitive if a     b and
b     c implies a     c for all a, b, c 2 a. an equivalence relation is a relation that
is re   exive, symmetric, and transitive.
example a.1.8. consider relation 1 where a     b if a     b over r and relation
2 where a     b if a = b over z. relation 1 is re   exive and transitive but not
symmetric. relation 2 is re   exive, symmetric, and transitive and is therefore an
equivalence relation.

1one way to rigorously de   ne the set of real numbers is as the completion of the rational
numbers. the details may be found in standard real analysis textbooks, for example [37]. we
do not pursue this formal de   nition here.

a.2. functions

229

de   nition a.1.12. the sets u   ,     2 a form a partition of u if

u    = u.

]   2a

(see de   nition a.1.6.) in other words, the union of the pairwise disjoint sets
u   ,     2 a is u . the sets u    are called equivalence classes.

an equivalence relation     on a induces a partition of a as follows: a     b if

and only if a and b are in the same equivalence class.
example a.1.9. consider the set a of all cities and the relation a     b if the
cities a, b are in the same country. this relation is re   exive, symmetric, and
transitive, and therefore is an equivalence relation. this equivalence relation
induces a partition of all cities into equivalence classes consisting of all cities in
the same country. the number of equivalence classes is the number of countries.

a.2 functions

de   nition a.2.1. let a, b be two sets. a function f : a ! b assigns one
element b 2 b for every element a 2 a, denoted by b = f (a).
de   nition a.2.2. for a function f : a ! b, we de   ne

range f = {f (a) : a 2 a}
f   1(b) = {a 2 a : f (a) = b}
f   1(h) = {a 2 a : f (a) 2 h}.

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)
if range f = b, we say that f is onto. if for all b 2 b, |f   1(b)|     1 we say that
f is 1-1 or one-to-one. a function that is both onto and 1-1 is called a bijection.
if f : a ! b is one-to-one, f   1 is also a function f   1 : b0 ! a where
if f : a ! b is a bijection then f   1 : b ! a is also a

b0 = range f     b.
bijection.
de   nition a.2.3. let f : a ! b and f : b ! c be two functions. their
function composition is a function f     g : a ! c de   ned as (f     g)(x) = f (g(x)).
proposition a.2.1. for any function f and any indexed collection of sets
u   ,     2 a,

f   1 \   2a
f   1 [   2a
f [   2a

u   ! = \   2a
u   ! = [   2a
u   ! = [   2a

230

appendix a. set theory

proof. we prove the result above for a union and intersection of two sets. the
proof of the general case of a collection of sets is similar.

if x 2 f   1(u \ v ) then f (x) is in both u and v and therefore x 2 f   1(u ) \
f   1(v ). if x 2 f   1(u ) \ f   1(v ) then f (x) 2 u and f (x) 2 v and therefore
f (x) 2 u \ v , implying that x 2 f   1(u \ v ).
if x 2 f   1(u [ v ) then f (x) 2 u [ v , which implies f (x) 2 u or f (x) 2 v
and therefore x 2 f   1(u )[ f   1(v ). on the other hand, if x 2 f   1(u )[ f   1(v )
then f (x) 2 u or f (x) 2 v implying f (x) 2 u [ v and x 2 f   1(u [ v ).
if y 2 f (u [ v ) then y = f (x) for some x in either u or v and y = f (x) 2
f (u ) [ f (v ). on the other hand, if y 2 f (u ) [ f (v ) then y = f (x) for some x
that belongs to either u or v , implying y = f (x) 2 f (u [ v ).

interestingly, the statement f (u \ v ) = f (u ) \ f (v ) is not true in general.
example a.2.1. for f : r ! r, f (x) =x 2, we have f   1(x) ={ px,   px}
implying that f is not one-to-one. we also have f   1([1, 2]) = [   p2, 1] [ [1,p2].
de   nition a.2.4. given two functions f, g : a ! r we denote f     g if f (x)    
g(x) for all x 2 a, f < g if f (x) < g(x) for all x 2 a, and f     g if f (x) =g (x)
for all x 2 a.
de   nition a.2.5. we denote a sequence of functions fn : a ! r, n 2 n
satisfying f1     f2     f3            as fn %.
de   nition a.2.6. given a set a         we de   ne the indicator function ia :     !
r as

ia(!) =(1 ! 2 a

0

otherwise

,

! 2    .

example a.2.2. for any set a, we have ia = 1     iac .
example a.2.3. if a     b, we have ia     ib.

a.3 cardinality

the most obvious generalization of the size of a set a to in   nite sets (see de   ni-
tion a.1.3) implies the obvious statement that in   nite sets have in   nite size. a
more useful generalization can be made by noticing that two    nite sets a, b have
the same size if and only if there exists a bijection between them, and generalizing
this notion to in   nite sets.

de   nition a.3.1. two sets a and b (   nite or in   nite) are said to have the
same cardinality, denoted by a     b if there exists a bijection between them.

note that the cardinality concept above de   nes a relation that is re   exive
(a     a) symmetric (a     b ) b     a), and transitive (a     b and b     c
implies a     c) and is thus an equivalence relation. the cardinality relation

a.3. cardinality

231

thus partitions the set of all sets to equivalence classes containing sets with the
same cardinality. for each natural number k 2 n, we have an equivalence class
containing all    nite sets of that size. but there are also other equivalence classes
containing in   nite sets, the most important one being the equivalence class that
contains the natural numbers n.
de   nition a.3.2. let a be an in   nite set. if a     n then a is a countably
in   nite set. if a 6    n then a is a uncountably in   nite set.
proposition a.3.1. every in   nite subset e of a countably in   nite set a is
countably in   nite.

proof. a is countably in   nite, so we can construct an in   nite sequence x1, x2, . . .
containing the elements of a. we can construct another sequence, y1, y2, . . .,
that is obtained by omitting from the    rst sequence the elements in a \ e. the
sequence y1, y2, . . . corresponds to a bijection between the natural numbers and
e.

proposition a.3.2. a countable union of countably in   nite sets is countably
in   nite.
proof. let an, n 2 n be a collection of countably in   nite sets. we can arrange
the elements of each an as a sequence that forms the n-row of a table with in   nite
rows and columns. we refer to the element at the i-row and j-column in that
table as aij. traversing the table in the following order: a11, a21, a12, a31,
a22, a13, and so on (traversing south-west to north-east diagonals of the table
starting at the north-west corner), we express the elements of a = [n2nan as
an in   nite sequence. that sequence forms a bijection from n to a.
corollary a.3.1. if a is countably in   nite then so is ad, for d 2 n.
proof. if a is countably in   nite, then a     a corresponds to one copy of a for
each element of a, and thus we have a bijection between a2 and a countably
in   nite union of countably in   nite sets. the previous proposition implies that
a2 is countably in   nite. the general case follows by induction.

it can be shown that countably in   nite sets are the    smallest    sets (in terms
of the above de   nition of cardinality) among all in   nite sets. in other words, if
a is uncountably in   nite, then there exists an onto function f : a ! n but no
onto function f : n ! a.
proposition a.3.3. assuming a < b and d 2 n,

n     z     q
n 6    [a, b]
n 6    (a, b)
n 6    r
n 6    rd.

232

appendix a. set theory

we    rst de   ne the concept of a binary expansion of a number, which will be

used in the proof of the proposition below.
de   nition a.3.3. the binary expansion of a number r 2 [0, 1] is de   ned as
0.b1b2, b3 . . . where bn 2 {0, 1}, n 2 n and
r =xn2n

bn2   n.

example a.3.1. the binary expansions of 1/4 is 0.01 and the binary expansion
of 3/4 is 0.11 = 1/2 + 1/4.

proof. obviously there exists a bijection between the natural numbers and the
natural numbers. the mapping f : n ! z de   ned as
f (n) =((n     1)/2 n is odd

n is even

   n/2

maps 1 to 0, 2 to -1, 3 to 1, 4 to -2, 5 to 2, etc., and forms a bijection between
n and z.

a rational number is a ratio of a numerator and a denominator integers (note
however that two pairs of numerators and denominators may yield the same
rational number). we thus have that q is a subset of z2, which is countably in   -
nite by proposition a.3.2. using proposition a.3.1, we have that q is countably
in   nite.

we next show that there does not exist a bijection between the natural num-
bers and the interval [0, 1].
if there was such a mapping f , we could arrange
the numbers in [0, 1] as a sequence f (n), n 2 n and form a table a with in   nite
rows and columns where column n is the binary expansion of the real number
f (n) 2 [0, 1].
we could then create a new real number whose binary expansion is bn, n 2 n
with bn 6= ann for all n 2 n by traversing the diagonal of the table and choosing
the alternative digits. this new real number is in [0, 1] since it has a binary
expansion, and yet it is di   erent from any of the columns of a. we have thus
found a real number that is di   erent from any other number2 in the range of f ,
contradicting the fact that f is onto.

since there is no onto function from the naturals to [0, 1] there can be no onto

function from the natural numbers to r or its cartesian products rd.

we extend below the de   nition of a cartesian product (de   nition a.1.10) to

an in   nite number of sets.

de   nition a.3.4. let a, t be sets. the notation at denotes a cartesian
product of multiple copies of a, one copy for each element of the set t . in other
words, at is the set of all functions from t to a. the notation a1 denotes an,
a product of a countably in   nite copies of a.

2the setup described above is slightly simpli   ed. a rigorous proof needs to resolve the fact
that some numbers in [0, 1] have two di   erent binary expansions, for example, 0.0111111 . . . =
0.1. see for example [37].

a.4. limits of sets

233

example a.3.2. the set r1 is the set of all in   nite sequences over the real
line r

r1 = {(a1, a2, a2, . . . , ) : an 2 r for all n 2 n}

and the set {0, 1}1 is the set of all in   nite binary sequences. the set r[0,1] is
a cartesian product of multiple copies of the real numbers     one copy for each
element of the interval [0, 1], or in other words the set of all functions from [0, 1]
to r.

example a.3.3. the set {0, 1}a is the set of all functions from a to {0, 1},
each such function implying a selection of an arbitrary subset of a (the selected
elements are mapped to 1 and the remaining elements are mapped to 0). a similar
interpretation may given to sets of size 2 that are di   erent than {0, 1}. recalling
de   nition a.1.7, we thus have if |b| = 2, then ba corresponds to the power set
2a, justifying its notation.

(abbreviated i.o.) in the sequence an, and lim inf n!1 an is the set of ! 2     that
always appear in the sequence an except for a    nite number of times.
proof. we prove the    rst part. the proof of the second part is similar. if ! 2
lim supn!1 an then by de   nition for all n there exists a kn such that ! 2 akn .
for that ! we havepn2n ian (!) =1. conversely, if pn2n ian (!) =1, there
exists a sequence k1, k2, . . . such that ! 2 akn , implying that for all n 2 n,
! 2 [i   nai.

de   nition a.4.3. a sequence of sets an, n 2 n is monotonic non-decreasing if
a1     a2     a3            and monotonic non-increasing if            a3     a2     a1. we
denote this as an % and an &, respectively. if lim an = a, we denote this as
an % a and an & a, respectively.
proposition a.4.2. if an % then limn!1 an = [n2nan and if an & then
limn!1 an = \n2nan.
proof. we prove the    rst statement. the proof of the second statement is similar.
we need to show that if an is monotonic non-decreasing, then lim sup an =
lim inf an = [nan. since ai     ai+1, we have \k   nak = an, and

lim inf
n!1

lim sup

an = [n2n \k   n
an = \n2n [k   n

a.5 notes

most of the material in this section is standard material in set theory. more
information may be found in any set theory textbook. a classic textbook is
[20]. limits of sets are usually described at the beginning of measure theory or
id203 theory textbooks, for example [5, 1, 33].

a.6 exercises

1. prove the assertions in example a.1.1.

2. prove the assertion in example a.1.6.

3. prove that f (u \ v ) = f (u ) \ f (v ) is not true in general.
4. let a0 = {a} and de   ne ak = 2ak1 for k 2 n. write down the elements

of the sets ak for all k = 1, 2, 3.

5. let a, b, c be three    nite sets. describe intuitively the sets a(bc ) and

(ab)c. what are the sizes of these two sets?

6. let a be a    nite set and b be a countably in   nite set. are the sets a1

and b1 countably in   nite or uncountably in   nite?

7. find a sequence of sets an, n 2 n for which lim inf an 6= lim sup an.
8. describe an equivalence relation with an uncountably in   nite set of equiv-

alence classes, each of which is a set of size 2.
