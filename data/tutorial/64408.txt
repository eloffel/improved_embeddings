id116 id91 in 
spectral embedded space

simplex spectral embedding theorem provides 

theoretical basis for id116 id91 in the 
embedded eigenspace 
    cluster centroids are well separated (corners of the 

simplex)

    id116 id91 is invariant under (i) coordinate  

rotation x     tx, and (ii) shift x     x + a

    thus orthogonal transform t in simplex embedding un-

necessary

(cid:127) many variants of id116 (ng et al, bach & 

jordan, zha et al, shi & xu, etc)

tutorial on spectral id91, icml 2004, chris ding    university of california

we have proved

spectral embedding + id116 id91
is the appropriate method

we now show :

id116 itself is solved by pca

equivalence of id116 id91 
and principal component analysis

(cid:127) cluster indicators specify the solution of id116 

id91

(cid:127) principal components are eigenvectors of the 

gram (kernel) matrix = data projections in the 
principal directions of the covariance matrix

(cid:127) optimal solution of id116 id91: 

continuous solution of the discrete cluster 
indicators of id116 are given by 
principal components

principal component analysis (pca)

(cid:127) widely used in large number of different fields
    best low-rank approximation (svd theorem, eckart-

young, 1930) : noise reduction

    unsupervised dimension reduction
    many generalizations

(cid:127) conventional perspective is inadequate to explain 

the effectiveness of pca

(cid:127) new results: principal components are cluster 

indicators for well-motivated id91 objective

distance-sensitive ordering

ordering is determined by  permutation indexes
4-variable. for a given ordering, there are 3
