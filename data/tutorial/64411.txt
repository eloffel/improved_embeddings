chapter 1

basic de   nitions

this chapter covers the most basic de   nitions of id203 theory and explores
some fundamental properties of the id203 function.

1.1 sample space and events

our starting point is the concept of an abstract random experiment. this is an
experiment whose outcome is not necessarily determined before it is conducted.
examples include    ipping a coin, the outcome of a soccer match, and the weather.
the set of all possible outcomes associated with the random experiment is called
the sample space. events are subsets of the sample space, or in other words sets
of possible outcomes. the id203 function assigns real values to events in
a way that is consistent with our intuitive understanding of id203. formal
de   nitions appear below.

de   nition 1.1.1. a sample space     associated with a random experiment is
the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.

a sample space can be    nite, for example

    = {1, . . . , 10}

in the experiment of observing a number from 1 to 10. or     can be countably
in   nite, for example

in the experiment of counting the number of phone calls made on a speci   c day.
a sample space may also be uncountably in   nite, for example

    = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}

in the experiment of measuring the height of a passer-by.

    = {x : x 2 r, x     0}

chapter 1. basic definitions

the notation n corresponds to the natural numbers {1, 2, 3, . . .}, and the
notation n [ {0} corresponds to the set {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. the notation r corre-
sponds to the real numbers and the notation {x : x 2 r, x     0} corresponds to
the non-negative real numbers. see chapter a in the appendix for an overview
of set theory, including the notions of a power set and countably in   nite and
unconuntably in   nite sets.

in the examples above, the sample space contained unachievable values (num-
ber of people and height are bounded numbers). a more careful de   nition could
have been used, taking into account bounds on the number of potential phone
calls or height. for the sake of simplicity, we often use simpler sample spaces
containing some unachievable outcomes.

de   nition 1.1.2. an event e is a subset of the sample space    , or in other
words a set of possible outcomes.

in particular, the empty set ; and the sample space     are events. figure 1.1
shows an example of a sample space     and two events a, b         that are neither
; nor    . the r code below shows all possible events of an experiment with
    = {a, b, c}. there are 2|   | such sets, assuming     is    nite (see chapter a for
more information on the power set).

# bring the sets package into scope (install
# it first using install.packages('sets') if
# needed)
library(sets)
omega = set("a", "b", "c")
# display a set containing all possible
# events of an experiment with a sample
# space omega
2  omega

## {{}, {"a"}, {"b"}, {"c"}, {"a", "b"},
##
##

{"a", "c"}, {"b", "c"}, {"a", "b",
"c"}}

example 1.1.1. in the random experiment of tossing a coin three times and
observing the results (heads or tails), with ordering, the sample space is the set

    = {hhh,hht,hth,htt,thh,tht,tth,ttt}.

the event

e = {hhh,hht,htt,hth}        

describes    a head was obtained in the    rst coin toss.    in this case both the sample
space     and the event e are    nite sets.

1.2. the id203 function

21

example 1.1.2. consider a random experiment of throwing a dart at a round
board without missing the board. assuming the radius of the board is 1, the sample
space is the set of all two dimensional vectors inside the unit circle

an event describing a bullseye hit may be

    =n(x, y) : x, y 2 r,px2 + y2 < 1o .
e =n(x, y) : x, y 2 r,px2 + y2 < 0.1o        .

in this case both the sample space     and the event e are uncountably in   nite.

for an event e, the outcome of the random experiment ! 2     is either in e
(! 2 e) or not in e (! 62 e). in the    rst case, we say that the event e occurred,
and in the second case we say that the event e did not occur. a[ b is the event
of either a or b occurring and a\ b is the event of both a and b occurring. ac
(in the complement, the universal set is taken to be    : ac =     \ a) is the event
that a did not occur. if the events a, b are disjoint (a \ b = ;), the two events
cannot happen at the same time, since no outcome of the random experiment
belongs to both a and b. if a     b, then b occurring implies that a occurs as
well.

1.2 the id203 function

de   nition 1.2.1. let     be a sample space associated with a random experiment.
a id203 function p is a function that assigns real numbers to events e        
satisfying the following three axioms.

1.

2.

p(e)     0

for all e.

p(   ) = 1

3. if en, n 2 n, is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events (ei\ej = ; whenever

i 6= j), then

p  1[i=1

ei! =

1xi=1

p(ei).

some basic properties of the id203 function appear below.

proposition 1.2.1.

p(;) = 0.

22

chapter 1. basic definitions

proof. using the second and third axioms of id203,

1 =p (   ) =p (    [ ; [ ; [        ) = p(   ) +p (;) +p (;) +      
= 1 + p(;) +p (;) +      

,

implying that p(;) = 0 (since p (e)     0 for all e).

proposition 1.2.2 (finite additivity of id203). for every    nite sequence
e1, . . . , en of pairwise disjoint events (ei \ ej = ; whenever i 6= j),

p(e1 [        [ en ) = p(e1) +       + p(en ).

proof. setting ek = ; for k > n in the third axiom of id203, we have

p(e1 [        [ en ) = p  1[i=1

ei! =

1xi=1

p(ei) = p(e1) +       + p(en ) + 0.

the last equality above follows from the previous proposition.

proposition 1.2.3.

proof. by    nite additivity,

p(ac) = 1     p(a).

1 =p (   ) =p (a [ ac) = p(a) +p (ac).

proposition 1.2.4.

p(a)     1.

proof. the previous proposition implies that p(ac) = 1     p(a). since all prob-
abilities are non-negative p(ac) = 1     p(a)     0, proving that p(a)     1.
proposition 1.2.5. if a     b then

p(b) = p(a) +p (b \ a)
p(b)     p(a).

proof. the    rst statement follows from    nite additivity:

p(b) = p(a [ (b \ a)) = p(a) +p (b \ a).

the second statement follows from the    rst statement and the non-negativity of
the id203 function.

proposition 1.2.6 (principle of inclusion-exclusion).

p(a [ b) = p(a) +p (b)     p(a \ b).

1.2. the id203 function

figure 1.1: two circular sets a, b, their intersection a\ b (gray area with hori-
zontal and vertical lines), and their union a[ b (gray area with either horizontal
or vertical lines or both). the set    \(a[b) = (a[b)c = ac\bc is represented
by white color.

proof. using the previous proposition, we have

p(a [ b) = p((a \ (a \ b)) [ (b \ (a \ b)) [ (a \ b))

= p((a \ (a \ b)) + p(b \ (a \ b))) + p(a \ b)
= p(a)     p(a \ b) +p (b)     p(a \ b) +p (a \ b)
= p(a) +p (b)     p(a \ b).

figure 1.1 illustrates the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

intuitively, the
id203 function p(a) measures the size of the set a (assuming a suitable
de   nition of size). the size of the set a plus the size of the set b equals the
size of the union a [ b plus the size of the intersection a \ b: p(a) +p (b) =
p(a[b)+p(a\b) (since the intersection a\b is counted twice in p(a)+p(b)).
de   nition 1.2.2. for a    nite sample space    , an event containing a single
element e = {!}, ! 2     is called an elementary event.

if the sample space is    nite     = {!1, . . . , !n}, it is relatively straightforward
to de   ne id203 functions by de   ning the n probabilities of the elementary
events. more speci   cally, for a sample space with n elements, suppose that we are
given a set of n non-negative numbers {p! : ! 2    } that sum to one. there exists

24

chapter 1. basic definitions

then a unique id203 function p over events such that p({!}) =p !. this
id203 is de   ned for arbitrary events through the    nite additivity property

p(e) = x!2e

p({!}) = x!2e

p!.

a similar argument holds for sample spaces that are countably in   nite.

the r code below demonstrates such a id203 function, de   ned on     =

{1, 2, 3, 4} using p1 = 1/2, p2 = 1/4, p3 = p4 = 1/8.
# sample space
omega = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
# probabilities of 4 elementary events
p = c(1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8)
# make sure they sum to 1
sum(p)

## [1] 1

# define an event 1,4 using a binary
# representation
a = c(1, 0, 0, 1)
# compute id203 of a using
# probabilities of elementary events
sum(p[a == 1])

## [1] 0.625

1.3 the classical id203 model on finite

spaces

in the classical interpretation of id203 on    nite sample spaces, the prob-
abilities of all elementary events {!}, ! 2    , are equal. since the id203
function must satisfy p(   ) = 1 we have

p({!}) = |   |   1,

for all ! 2    .

this implies that under the classical model on a    nite    , we have

p(e) = |e|
|   |

.

example 1.3.1. consider the experiment of throwing two distinct dice and ob-
serving the two faces with order. the sample space is

    = {1, . . . , 6}     {1, . . . , 6} = {(x, y) : x, y 2 {1, 2, . . . , 6}}

1.3. the classical id203 model on finite spaces

25

(see chapter a in the appendix for the notation of a cartesian product of two
sets). since     has 36 elements, the id203 of the elementary event e =
{(4, 4)} is p(e) = 1/|   | = 1/36. the id203 of getting a sum of 9 in both
dice is

p(sum = 9) = p({(6, 3), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)}) = |{(6, 3), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)}|

36

=

4
36

.

the classical model in this case is reasonable, assuming the dice are thrown in-
dependently and are fair.

the r code below demonstrates the classical model and the resulting proba-

bilities on a small    .

omega = set(1, 2, 3)
# all possible events
2  omega

## {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2,
##

3}, {1, 2, 3}}

# size of all possible events
sapply(2  omega, length)

## [1] 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3

# probabilities of all possible events under
# the classical model
sapply(2  omega, length)/length(omega)

## [1] 0.0000 0.3333 0.3333 0.3333 0.6667 0.6667
## [7] 0.6667 1.0000

note that the sequence of probabilities above does not sum to one since it
contains probabilities of non-disjoint events. the r code below demonstrates this
below for a larger set using by graphing the histogram of sizes and probabilities.

library(ggplot2)
omega = set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# histogram of sizes of all possible events
qplot(sapply(2  omega, length), xlab = "event sizes")

the left-most and right-most bars represent two sets with probabilities 0 and

1.4. the classical model on continuous spaces

27

1.4 the classical id203 model on contin-

uous spaces

for a continuous sample space of dimension n (for example     = rn), we de   ne
the classical id203 function as

p(a) =

voln(a)
voln(   )

,

where voln(s) is the n-dimensional volume1 of the set s.

example 1.4.1. in an experiment measuring the weight of residents in a partic-
ular geographical region, the sample space could be     = (0, 1000)     r1 (assuming
our measurement units are pounds and people weigh less than 1000 pounds). the
id203 of getting a measurement between 150 and 250 (in the classical model)
is the ratio of the 1-dimensional volumes or lengths:

p((150, 250)) = |250     150|
|1000     0|

= 0.1.

the classical model in this case is highly inaccurate and not likely to be useful.

example 1.4.2. assuming the classical model on the sample space of exam-
ple 1.1.2, the id203 of hitting the bullseye is

p   n(x, y) : px2 + y2 < 0.1o    =

    0.12
    12 = 0.01

(since the area of a circle of radius r is        r2). the classical model in this case
assumes that the person throwing the darts does not make any attempt to hit the
center. for most dart throwers this model is inaccurate.

1. for the classical model to apply, the sample space     must by    nite or be

continuous with a    nite non-zero volume.

2. the classical model (on both    nite and continuous spaces) satis   es the

three axioms de   ning a id203 function.

3. a consequence of the classical model on continuous spaces is that the prob-
ability of an elementary event is zero (the volume of a single element is
0).

4. in the next two chapters we will explore a number of alternative id203

models that may be more accurate than the classical model.

1the 1-dimensional volume of a set s     r is its length. the 2-dimensional volume of a set
s     r2 is its area. the 3-dimensional volume of a set s     r3 is its volume. in general, the
n-dimensional volume of a is the n-dimensional integral of the constant function 1 over the set
a.

chapter 1. basic definitions

1.5 id155 and independence

de   nition 1.5.1. the id155 of an event a given an event b
with p(b) > 0 is

p(a| b) =
if p(a) > 0 and p(b) > 0 we have

p(a \ b)

p(b)

.

p(a \ b) = p(a| b) p(b) = p(b | a) p(a).

intuitively, p(a| b) is the id203 of a occurring assuming that the event
b occurred. in accordance with that intuition, the id155 has
the following properties.

1. if b     a, then p(a| b) = p(b)/ p(b) = 1.
2. if a \ b = ;, then p(a| b) = 0/ p(b) = 0.
3. if a     b then p(a| b) = p(a)/ p(b).
4. the id155 may be viewed as a id203 functions

pa(e) def= p(e | a)

satisfying de   nition 1.2.1 (exercise 1.7). in addition, all the properties and
intuitions that apply to id203 functions apply to pa as well.

5. assuming the event a occurred, pa generally has better forecasting abilities

than p.

as mentioned above, conditional probabilities are usually intuitive. the fol-
lowing example from [16], however, shows a counter-intuitive situation involving
conditional probabilities. this demonstrates that intuition should not be a sub-
stitute for rigorous computation.

example 1.5.1. consider families with two children where the gender id203
of each child is symmetric (1/2). we select a family at random and consider the
sample space describing the gender of the children     = {m m, m f, f m, f f}.
we assume a classical model, implying that the probabilities of all 4 elementary
events are 1/4.

we de   ne the event that both children in the family are boys as a = {m m},
the event that a family has a boy as b = {m f, f m, m m}, and the event that
the    rst child is a boy as c = {m f, m m}.
given that the    rst child is a boy, the id203 that both children are boys
is

p(a| c) = p(a \ c)/ p(c) = p(a)/ p(c) = (1/4)/(1/2) = 1/2.

this matches our intuition. given that the family has a boy, the id203 that
both children are boys is the counterintuitive

p(a| b) =

p(a \ b)

p(b)

=

p(a)
p(b)

= (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.

1.5. id155 and independence

29

de   nition 1.5.2. two events a, b are independent if p(a \ b) = p(a) p(b).
a    nite number of events a1, . . . , an are independent if

p(a1 \        an) = p(a1)       p(an)

and are pairwise independent if every pair ai, aj, i 6= j are independent.

the following de   nition generalizes independence to an arbitrary collection

of events, indexed by a (potentially in   nite) set    .

de   nition 1.5.3. multiple events a   ,     2     are pairwise independent if every
pair of events is independent. multiple events a   ,     2     are independent if for
every k > 0 and for every size k-subset of distinct events a   1 , . . . , a   k , we have

p(a   1 \ . . . \ a   k ) = p(a   1 )       p(a   k ).

note that pairwise independence is a strictly weaker condition than indepen-

dence.

in agreement with our intuition, conditioning on an event that is independent

of a does not modify the id203 of a:

p(a| b) = p(a) p(b)/ p(b) = p(a).

on the other hand, two disjoint events cannot occur simultaneously and should
therefore be dependent. indeed, in this case p(a| b) = 0 6= p(a) (assuming that
p(a) and p(b) are non-zero).

example 1.5.2. we consider a random experiment of throwing two dice inde-
pendently and denote by a the event that the    rst throw resulted in 1, by b the
event that the sum in both throws is 3, and by c the event that the second throw
was even. assuming the classical model, the events a, b are dependent

p(a \ b) = p(b | a) p(a) = (1/6)(1/6) 6= (1/6)(2/36) = p(a) p(b),

while a and c are independent

p(a \ c) = p(c | a) p(a) = (1/2)(1/6) = p(a) p(c).

proposition 1.5.1. if a, b are independent, then so are the events ac, b, the
events a, bc, and the events ac, bc.

proof. for example,

p(ac \ b) = p(b \ a) = p(b)     p(a \ b) = p(b)     p(a) p(b)

= (1     p(a)) p(b) = p(ac) p(b).

the other parts of the proof are similar.

30

chapter 1. basic definitions

proposition 1.5.2 (id47). if p(b) 6= 0 and p(a) 6= 0, then

p(a| b) =

p(b | a) p(a)

p(b)

.

proof.

p(a| b) p(b) = p(a \ b) = p(b \ a) = p(b | a) p(a).

example 1.5.3. we consider the following imaginary voting pattern of a group
of 100 americans, classi   ed according to their party and whether they live in
a city or a small town. the last row and last column capture the sum of the
columns and the sum of the rows, respectively.

democrats
republicans
total

100

we consider the experiment of drawing a person at random and observing the
vote. the sample space contains 100 elementary events and we assume a classical
model, implying that each person may be selected with equal 1/100 id203.

de   ning a as the event that a person selected at random lives in the city, and

b as the event that a person selected at random is a democrat, we have

p(a \ b) = 30/100
p(ac \ b) = 15/100
p(a \ bc) = 20/100
p(ac \ bc) = 35/100
p(a) = 50/100
p(b) = 45/100
p(a| b) = 0.3/0.45
p(a| bc) = 0.2/0.55
p(b | a) = 0.3/0.5
p(b | ac) = 0.15/0.5.

since a, b are dependent, conditioning on city dwelling raises the id203 that
a randomly drawn person is democrat from p(b) = 0.45 to p(b | a) = 0.6.

proposition 1.5.3 (general multiplication rule).

p(a1 \        \ an) = p(a1) p(a2 | a1) p(a3 | a2 \ a1)       p(an | a1 \        \ an   1).

figure 1.2: the partition a1, . . . , a4 of     induces a partition b \ ai, i = 1, . . . , 4
of b (see proposition 1.5.4).

proof. using induction and p(a \ b) = p(a| b) p(b), we get
p(a1 \        \ an) = p(an | a1 \        \ an   1) p(a1 \        \ an   1)

=       
= p(a1) p(a2 | a1) p(a3 | a2 \ a1)       p(an | a1 \        \ an   1).

proposition 1.5.4 (the law of total id203). if ai, i 2 s, form a    nite
or countably in   nite partition of     (see de   nition a.1.12)

p(b) =xi2s

p(ai) p(b | ai).

proof. the partition ai, i 2 s, of     induces a partition b \ ai, i 2 s, of b.
the result follows from countable additivity (third id203 axiom) or    nite
additivity applied to that partition

p(b) = p [i2s

(b \ ai)! =xi2s

p(ai \ b) =xi2s

p(ai) p(b | ai).

figure 1.2 illustrates the above proposition and its proof.
the de   nition below extends the notion of independence to multiple experi-

ments.

de   nition 1.5.4. consider n random experiments with sample spaces    1, . . . ,    n.
the set     =    1               n (see chapter a for a de   nition of the cartesian product

32

chapter 1. basic definitions

   ) is the sample space expressing all possible results of the experiments. the
experiments are independent if for all sets a1                an with ai        i,

p(a1                an) = p(a1)       p(an).

in the equation above, the id203 function on the left hand side is de   ned
on    1                 n and the id203 functions on the right hand side are de   ned
on    i, i = 1, . . . , n.

chapter 4 contains an extended discussion of probabilities associated with

multiple experiments.

1.6 basic combinatorics for id203

some knowledge of combinatorics is essential for id203. for example, com-
puting the id203 p(e) in the classical model on    nite sample spaces p(e) =
|e|/|   | is equivalent to the combinatorial problem of enumerating the elements
in e and    .
in the case of a two-stage experiment where stage 1 has k outcomes and stage
2 has l outcomes and every combination of results in the two stages is possible,
the total number of combinations of results of stage 1 and 2 is k    l. a formal
generalization appears below.

de   nition 1.6.1. a k-tuple over the sets s1, . . . , sk is a    nite ordered sequence
(s1, . . . , sk) such that si 2 si.

proposition 1.6.1. there are qk

j=1 |sj| ways to form k-tuples over the    nite
in particular if s1 =        = sk = s there are |s|k possible

sets s1, . . . , sk.
k-tuples.

proof. a k-tuple is characterized by picking one element from each group. there
are n1 elements in group 1, n2 in group 2, and so on. since choices in one group
do not constrain the choices in other groups, the number of possible choices is

example 1.6.1. the r code below generates all possible 3-tuples over s1 =
{1, 2}, s2 = {1, 2, 3}, and s3 = {1, 2}. there are 2    3    2 = 12 such possibilities.

positive integer, we use the following notation:

we refer to the function f (n) = n! as the factorial function and to    n

r    as

n-choose-r.

the factorial function grows very rapidly as n ! 1. the r code below shows

the considerable magnitude of n! even for small n.

proposition 1.6.4. the number of r-tuples over a    nite set s in which no
element appears twice is (|s|)r and the number of di   erent orderings of n elements
is n!.

proof. the    rst statement is a direct corollary of proposition 1.6.1, where each
value in the r tuple is selected from the population of remaining or unselected
items. the second statement follows from the    rst (n = r = |s|).

example 1.6.2 (the birthday paradox). there are 365r possible assignments of
birthdays to r people. using the previous proposition, the number of assignments
of birthdays to r people, assuming that all birthdays are di   erent, is (365)r. under
the classical id203 model, the id203 p(ar) that a group of r people will
have all di   erent birthdays is

p(ar) = |ar|
|   |

=

(365)r
365r .

for example, p(a30)     0.294, implying that it is likely to    nd recurring birth-
days in a group of 30 people. the graph below shows how the id203 of having
di   erent birthdays decays to zero as r increases. the median (the value at which
the id203 is approximately 1/2) is r = 23. the name    the birthday para-
dox    is sometimes associated with this example, since it is intuitively likely that
23 people will all have di   erent birthdays with high id203.

the following r code graphs the id203 of r people having all di   erent

birthdays as a function of r.

proposition 1.6.5. a population of n elements has    n
size r. equivalently there are    n

r    di   erent subsets of
r    ways to select r elements out of n distinct

elements with no element appearing twice (selection without replacement) if order
is neglected.

proof. there are (n)r ways to select r elements out of n elements if ordering
matters (number of r-tuples over n elements). since there are r! possible order-
ings of the selected values, the number we are interested in times r! equals (n)r.
dividing (n)r by r! completes the proof.

out of 52 distinct cards. the cards have face values (1-13) and suits (clubs,

this is the number of subsets of size 5 from the 52 distinct cards. the id203

chapter 1. basic definitions

the description above corresponds to choosing r elements out of n distinct
elements, or alternatively placing n distinct elements into two bins     one with r
elements and one with n   r elements. a useful generalization is placing n distinct
elements in k bins with ri elements being placed at bin i, for i = 1, . . . , k.

proposition 1.6.7. the number of ways to deposit n distinct objects into k bins
with ri objects in bin i, i = 1, . . . , k, is the multinomial coe   cient n!/(r1!       rk!).
proof. repeated use of proposition 1.6.5 shows that the number is

r1      n     r1
    n

r2       n     r1     r2

r3

            n     r1                rk   2

    .

canceling common factors in the numerators and denominators completes the
proof.

example 1.6.7. a throw of twelve dice can result in 612 di   erent outcomes.
the event a that each face appears twice can occur in as many ways as twelve
dice can be arranged in six groups of two each. assuming the classical id203
model, the above proposition implies that

p(a) = |a|
|   |

=

12!/(26)

612     0.0034.

the following inequality is useful in bounding the id203 of complex

events in terms of the id203 of multiple simpler events.

proposition 1.6.8 (boole   s inequality). for a    nite or countably in   nite set of
events ai, i 2 c

proof. for two events the proposition holds since p(a [ b) = p(a) +p (b)    
p(a \ b) (principle of inclusion-exclusion). the case of a    nite number of sets
holds by induction. the case of a countably in   nite number of sets follows from
proposition e.2.1 in the appendix.

1.7 id203 and measure theory*

de   nition 1.2.1 appears to be formal, and yet is not completely rigorous.
it
states that a id203 function p assigns real values to events e         in a
manner consistent with the three axioms. the problem is that the domain of the
id203 function p is not clearly speci   ed. in other words, if p is a function
p : f ! r from a set f of subsets of     to r, the set f is not speci   ed. the
importance of this issue stems from the fact that the three axioms need to hold
for all sets in f.

1.8. notes

39

at    rst glance this appears to be a minor issue that can be solved by choosing
f to be the power set of    : 2   . this works nicely whenever     is    nite or
countably in   nite. but selecting f = 2    does not work well for uncountably
in   nite     such as continuous spaces. it is hard to come up with useful functions
p : 2    ! r that satisfy the three axioms for all subsets of    .
a satisfactory solution that works for uncountably in   nite     is to de   ne f
to be a   -algebra of subsets of     (see section e.1) that is smaller than 2   . in
particular, when         rd, the borel   -algebra (de   nition e.5.1) is su   ciently
large to include the    interesting    subsets of     and yet is small enough to not
restrict p too much.

we also note that a id203 function p is nothing but a measure    on a
measurable space (   ,f) (de   nition e.2.1) satisfying   (   ) = 1. in other words,
the triplet (   ,f, p) is a measure space (see de   nition e.2.1) where f is the
  -algebra of measurable sets and p is a measure satisfying p(   ) = 1. thus,
the wide array of mathematical results from measure theory (chapter e) and
lebesgue integration (chapter f.3) are directly applicable to id203 theory.

1.8 notes

our exposition follows the axiomatic view of id203, promoted by a. kol-
mogorov. alternative viewpoints are available, including the frequency viewpoint
(p(a) is the frequency of a occurring in a long sequence of repetitive experiments)
and the subjective viewpoint (p(a) measures the belief that a will occur).

more information on the basic concepts of id203 is available in nearly
any id203 textbook. one example is feller   s    rst volume [16], which in-
spired a generation of probabilists as well as several of the examples in this
chapter. examples of books with rigorous coverage of id203 theory are
[17, 10, 5, 1, 33, 25]. elementary exposition that avoids measure theory is avail-
able in most undergraduate id203 textbooks, such as [48, 36, 14]. more
information on combinatorics is available in combinatorics textbooks, for exam-
ple [35] (undergraduate level) and [42] (graduate level).

1.9 exercises

1. extend the argument at the end of section 1.2 and characterize id203
functions on a countably in   nite     using a sequence of non-negative num-
bers that sum to one. what is the problem with extending this argument
further to uncountably in   nite    ?

2. can there be a classical id203 model on sample spaces that are count-

ably in   nite? provide an example or prove that it is impossible.

3. complete the proof of proposition 1.5.1.

4. describe a sample space consistent with the experiment of drawing a hand
in poker. write the events e corresponding to drawing three aces and
drawing a full house (and their sizes |e|). what is the event correspond-
ing to the intersection of the two events above, and what is its size and
id203 under the classical model?

5. formulate a theory of id203 that mirrors the standard theory, with
the only di   erence that the second axiom would be p(   ) = 2. how would
the propositions throughout the chapter change (if at all)?

6. show a situation where we have three events that are independent but not

mutually independent. hint: look for a id203 function satisfying

p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = 1/3

p(a \ b) = p(a \ c) = p(b \ c) = 1/9 =p (a \ b \ c).
7. prove that pe(a) = p(a| e) is a id203 function if p(e) 6= 0.
8. consider the experiment of throwing three fair six-sided dice independently
and observing the results without order. identify the sample space, and the
most and least probable elements of it.

9. repeat the previous exercise, if the results are observed with order.

10. generalize proposition 1.2.6 (principle of inclusion-exclusion) to a union of
three sets. can you further generalize it to a union of an arbitrary number
of sets?
