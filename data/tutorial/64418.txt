   deep learning architectures includes many type of neural networks.
   convolutional neural networks is one of specialized image recognition
   algorithms.

   to talk about convolutional neural network, first we need to understand
   what a typical neural network does. fundamentally, a neural network
   takes certain inputs and makes classifications. it can be a binary
   classification or multiclass classification. an example of a binary
   classification is, someone else uses your phone and tries to unlock it
   with facial recognition. the phone likely will tell him/her that it   s
   not your face. an example of a multiclass classification is, your phone
   camera predicts if you are making a happy, sad, angry, face.
     __________________________________________________________________

   so why is neural network very robust at making complex classification?
   let   s look at some very simple examples. let   s predict if you are going
   to pass this course or not.

   linear graph

   are you going to pass this course?

   x1 = how hard you study.

   x2 = how hard you play.

   we will have 2 input factors, x1 and x2, representing how hard you
   study and play, respectively. the data may end up with some graph like
   above graph. + and o are the labeled results from everyone in the
   class, based on how hard they studied and played, and if they pass or
   not. + means passed, o means failed. to predict if a new student is
   going to pass or not, based on this graph, a straight line can be drawn
   between the +   s and o   s. in other words, this binary classification can
   be predicted by using an equation of a straight line with a constant
   slope.
     __________________________________________________________________

   now how about this?

   non-linear graph

   this nonlinear classification can certainly be done with complicated
   mathematical equations. however, a simple neural network can do this
   without a sweat.

   if the inputs are simplified to binary inputs, 1 or 0, the graph is
   also simplified as shown on the right hand side.
   [1*qgmkfbwellg17un8cpovew.png]
   simplified binary graph

   to make the nonlinear classification in neural network. we will need
   the simplified neural network looks like below graph:
   [1*yxalftc0a5wfcwhp1ijxsg.png]

   it consists of an input layer as a column, and one or more hidden
   layers in the middle, and an output layer on the right hand side. x1
   and x2 are the binary inputs, 0 or 1, and each layer has a bias which
   is typically 1. each circle represents a neuron. to calculate a1, you
   simply multiply the value of the neuron with the corresponding weights,
   sum them all up, and undergo an activation function g(x).

   a1 = g(-30 + 20x1 + 20x2)

   a2 = g(10   20x1   20x2)

   a3 = g(-10 +20a1 +20a2)

   the activation function simply transforms the value of x into 1 or 0.
   if x is >0, g(x) is 1, if x is <0, g(x) is 0. if you do all the
   calculations you will end up with the chart below. this is equivalent
   to the classification we wanted to do earlier.
   [1*go-r26zygfmr6hqv5eeo-g.png]

   this is also called the xor gate, where the output is 1 only when x1 or
   x2 is 1. this shows neural networks are very robust at solving
   non-linear classifications.

   traditional neural networks are robust, but they still have
   limitations. for one, they are not very good at id161,
   because there are no geometric relations among the inputs when they are
   fed into a traditional neural network. this is where convolutional
   neural network comes in and takes the main stage.

   the main difference between a traditional neural network and a
   convolutional neural network (or id98) is that a id98 can detect edges of
   an object in earlier layers, and then detect features based on the
   edges in the later layers. in other words, a id98 somehow maintains the
   geometric relations among the inputs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   how does id98 work?

   so how does a id98 detect edges in an image? let   s take a look at this
   simple example.
   [1*ywyng8grsbfrl9dpwbqnlq.png]

   this is a 6 pixels by 6 pixels greyscale image. the value in each pixel
   represents how bright it is. the higher the number, the brighter it is.
   the matrix after translation looks something like the image below.
   [1*0veecl350baetysldagdqw.png]
   edge

   now we apply the image with 3 by 3 matrix, or we call it a filter with
   a matrix convolution operation. this specific filter is also called a
   vertical edge filter. you will see in a moment why it is called
   vertical edge filter. the asterisk between the two matrices represent
   the matrix convolution operation.

   this specific convolution operation will end up with a 4 by 4 matrix.
   to do this, first we take the red highlight portion, 3 by 3, of the
   matrix and multiply by the filter. the multiply here means element wise
   multiplication.
   [1*6bdkgj_gzd1murdhdu0zog.png]

   the left column: 10 x 1 + 10 x 1 + 10 x 1 = 30

   the middle column is just zero: 10 x 0 + 10 x 0 + 10 x 0

   the right column: 10 x -1 + 10 x -1 + 10 x -1 = -30

   now the sum from all 3 columns is 0, and we put it on the upper left
   hand corner in the result.
     __________________________________________________________________

   next step, we move the 3 by 3 portion to the right by one element and
   highlight it as green.
   [1*_dhjieq552dux-tnecifgq.png]

   conduct the same multiplication and we will end up with 30. when the
   entire convolution operation is done, you will end up with this 4 by 4
   matrix as the result.
   [1*ct-w9jf3qrlfalrzzanaaa.png]

   if there are series of cells in the resultant matrix have values
   greater or less than 0, it means the filter detects vertical edge(s) in
   the input image.
     __________________________________________________________________

   the concept of these filters are not something new. these filters are
   commonly used in image processing, such as sharpening an image,
   blurring an image. the values inside the filters are traditionally
   analyzed and optimized by researchers to do specific functions. the
   beauty of a id98 is that the values inside the filters are learned by
   dumping large amount of images in the id98 and going through forward and
   backward propagation.

   how about the colour images?

   most images come in rgb colors instead of greyscale, so to convolve a
   3d matrix, we also need a 3d filter. in a id98, we can have many
   filters. through supervised learning process, each filter will take
   different form to accurately predict the input images.
   [1*bn_vj4f0eni-lmc60jpabg.png]

   you can also notice that in this rgb convolution layer, there are only
   27 (9 x 3) weights (or variables) to learn, doesn   t matter how big the
   image is. unlike a traditional neural network, if you have 1000 by 1000
   pixel image, that is 1 million inputs, and the first hidden layer
   usually has to be close to number of inputs or it suffers accuracy
   issue. fewer variables to learn means faster computation time. that is
   why id98 is fast and accurate to apply analysing the visual imagery.
     __________________________________________________________________

   time, and the right learning algorithms made all the difference

   deep learning has enabled many practical applications of machine
   learning. in some scenarios the result from deep learning is better
   than humans. the technique of image recognition can identify the
   indicators for cancer in blood and tumors in mri scans.

   so thanks to deep learning, ai has a bright future. like driverless
   cars, the better preventive healthcare, or the even better movie
   recommendations.

   in the near future, it is not impossible that people can walk with
   c-3po or even the terminator.
