natural language processing for beginners: using textblob

   [97]shubham jain, february 11, 2018

introduction

   natural language processing (nlp) is an area of growing attention due
   to increasing number of applications like chatbots, machine translation
   etc. in some ways, the entire revolution of intelligent machines in
   based on the ability to understand and interact with humans.

   i have been exploring nlp for some time now.  my journey started with
   nltk library in python, which was the recommended library to get
   started at that time. nltk is a perfect library for education and
   research, it becomes very heavy and tedious for completing even the
   simple tasks.

   later, i got introduced to textblob, which is built on the shoulders of
   nltk and pattern. a big advantage of this is, it is easy to learn and
   offers a lot of features like id31, pos-tagging, noun
   phrase extraction, etc. it has now become my go-to library for
   performing nlp tasks.

   on a side note, there is [98]spacy, which is widely recognized as one
   of the powerful and advanced library used to implement nlp tasks. but
   having encountered both spacy and textblob, i would still suggest
   textblob to a beginner due to its simple interface.

   if it is your first step in nlp, textblob is the perfect library for
   you to get hands-on with. the best way to go through this article is to
   follow along with the code and perform the tasks yourself. so let   s get
   started!

   note : this article does not narrate nlp tasks in depth. if you want to
   revise the basics and come back here, you can always go through
   [99]this article.

1. about textblob?

   textblob is a python library and offers a simple api to access its
   methods and perform basic nlp tasks.

   a good thing about textblob is that they are just like python strings.
   so, you can transform and play with it same like we did in python.
   below, i have shown you below some basic tasks. don   t worry about the
   syntax, it is just to give you an intuition about how much-related
   textblob is to python strings.

   code so, to perform these things on your own let   s quickly install and
   start coding.


2. setting up the system

   installation of textblob in your system in a simple task, all you need
   to do is open anaconda prompt ( or terminal if using mac os or ubuntu)
   and enter the following commands:
pip install -u textblob

   this will install textblob. for the uninitiated     practical work in
   natural language processing typically uses large bodies of linguistic
   data, or corpora. to download the necessary corpora, you can run the
   following command
python -m textblob.download_corpora


3. nlp tasks using textblob

3.1 id121

   id121 refers to dividing text or a sentence into a sequence of
   tokens, which roughly correspond to    words   . this is one of the basic
   tasks of nlp. to do this using textblob, follow the two steps:
    1. create a textblob object and pass a string with it.
    2. call functions of textblob in order to do a specific task.

   so, let   s quickly create a textblob object to play with.
from textblob import textblob

blob = textblob("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science. \n
it helps community through blogs, hackathons, discussions,etc.")

   now, this textblob can be tokenized into a sentence and further into
   words. let   s look at the code shown below.
blob.sentences
>> [sentence("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science."),
sentence("it helps community through blogs, hackathons, discussions,etc.")]

blob.sentences[0]  ## extracting only first sentence
>> sentence("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science.")
for words in blob.sentences[0].words:  ## printing words of first sentence
 print (words)

>> analytics
vidhya
is
a
great
platform
to
learn
data
science


3.2 noun phrase extraction

   since we extracted the words in the previous section, instead of that
   we can just extract out the noun phrases from the textblob. noun phrase
   extraction is particularly important when you want to analyze the    who   
   in a sentence. lets see an example below.
blob = textblob("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science.")
for np in blob.noun_phrases:
 print (np)
>> analytics vidhya
great platform
data science

   as we can see that the results aren   t perfectly correct, but we should
   be aware that we are working with machines.


3.3 part-of-speech tagging

   part-of-speech tagging or grammatical tagging is a method to mark words
   present in a text on the basis of its definition and context. in simple
   words, it tells whether a word is a noun, or an adjective, or a verb,
   etc. this is just a complete version of noun phrase extraction, where
   we want to find all the the parts of speech in a sentence.

   let   s check the tags of our textblob.
for words, tag in blob.tags:
 print (words, tag)
>> analytics nns
vidhya nnp
is vbz
a dt
great jj
platform nn
to to
learn vb
data nns
science nn

   here, nn represents a noun, dt represents as a determiner, etc. you can
   check the full list of tags from [100]here to know more.


3.4 words inflection and lemmatization

   inflection is a process of word formation in which characters are added
   to the base form of a word to express grammatical meanings. word
   inflection in textblob is very simple, i.e., the words we tokenized
   from a textblob can be easily changed into singular or plural.
blob = textblob("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science. \n
it helps community through blogs, hackathons, discussions,etc.")
print (blob.sentences[1].words[1])
print (blob.sentences[1].words[1].singularize())

>> helps
help

   textblob library also offers an in-build object known as word. we just
   need to create a word object and then apply a function directly to it
   as shown below.
from textblob import word
w = word('platform')
w.pluralize()
>>'platforms'

   we can also use the tags to inflect a particular type of words as shown
   below.
## using tags
for word,pos in blob.tags:
 if pos == 'nn':
 print (word.pluralize())
>> platforms
sciences

   words can be lemmatized using the lemmatize function.
## lemmatization
w = word('running')
w.lemmatize("v") ## v here represents verb
>> 'run'


3.5 id165s

   a combination of multiple words together are called id165s. n grams (n
   > 1) are generally more informative as compared to words, and can be
   used as features for language modelling.  id165s can be easily
   accessed in textblob using the ngrams function, which returns a tuple
   of n successive words.
for ngram in blob.ngrams(2):
print (ngram)
>> ['analytics', 'vidhya']
['vidhya', 'is']
['is', 'a']
['a', 'great']
['great', 'platform']
['platform', 'to']
['to', 'learn']
['learn', 'data']
['data', 'science']


3.6 id31

   id31 is basically the process of determining the attitude
   or the emotion of the writer, i.e., whether it is positive or negative
   or neutral.

   the sentiment function of textblob returns two properties, polarity,
   and subjectivity.

   polarity is float which lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means
   positive statement and -1 means a negative statement. subjective
   sentences generally refer to personal opinion, emotion or judgment
   whereas objective refers to factual information. subjectivity is also a
   float which lies in the range of [0,1].

   let   s check the sentiment of our blob.
print (blob)
blob.sentiment
>> analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science.
sentiment(polarity=0.8, subjectivity=0.75)

   we can see that polarity is 0.8, which means that the statement is
   positive and 0.75 subjectivity refers that mostly it is a public
   opinion and not a factual information.


4. other cool things to do

4.1 id147

   id147 is a cool feature which textblob offers, we can be
   accessed using the correct function as shown below.
blob = textblob('analytics vidhya is a gret platfrm to learn data scence')
blob.correct()
>> textblob("analytics vidhya is a great platform to learn data science")

   we can also check the list of suggested word and its confidence using
   the spellcheck function.
blob.words[4].spellcheck()
>> [('great', 0.5351351351351351),
 ('get', 0.3162162162162162),
 ('grew', 0.11216216216216217),
 ('grey', 0.026351351351351353),
 ('greet', 0.006081081081081081),
 ('fret', 0.002702702702702703),
 ('grit', 0.0006756756756756757),
 ('cret', 0.0006756756756756757)]



4.2 creating a short summary of a text

   this is a simple trick which we will be using the things we learned
   above. first, take a look at the code shown below and to understand
   yourself.
import random

blob = textblob('analytics vidhya is a thriving community for data driven indust
ry. this platform allows \
people to know more about analytics from its articles, q&a forum, and learning p
aths. also, we help \
professionals & amateurs to sharpen their skillsets by providing a platform to p
articipate in hackathons.')
nouns = list()
for word, tag in blob.tags:
if tag == 'nn':
nouns.append(word.lemmatize())

print ("this text is about...")
for item in random.sample(nouns, 5):
word = word(item)
print (word.pluralize())

>> this text is about...
communities
platforms
forums
platforms
industries

   simple, ain   t it? what we did above that we extracted out a list of
   nouns from the text to give a general idea to the reader about the
   things the text is related to.


4.3 translation and language detection

   can you guess what is written in the next line?

   haha! can you guess which language is this? don   t worry, let   s detect
   it using textblob   
blob.detect_language()
>> 'ar'

   so, it is arabic. now, let   s find translate it into english so that we
   can know what is written using textblob.
blob.translate(from_lang='ar', to ='en')
>> textblob("that's cool")

   even if you don   t explicitly define the source language, textblob will
   automatically detect the language and translate into the desired
   language.
blob.translate(to= 'en') ## or you can directly do like this
>> textblob("that's cool")

   this is seriously so cool!!!     


5. text classification using textblob

   let   s build a simple text classification model using textblob. for
   this, first, we need to prepare a training and testing data.
training = [
('tom holland is a terrible spiderman.','pos'),
('a terrible javert (russell crowe) ruined les miserables for me...','pos'),
('the dark knight rises is the greatest superhero movie ever!','neg'),
('fantastic four should have never been made.','pos'),
('wes anderson is my favorite director!','neg'),
('captain america 2 is pretty awesome.','neg'),
('let\s pretend "batman and robin" never happened..','pos'),
]
testing = [
('superman was never an interesting character.','pos'),
('fantastic mr fox is an awesome film!','neg'),
('dragonball evolution is simply terrible!!','pos')
]

   textblob provides in-build classifiers module to create a custom
   classifier. so, let   s quickly import it and create a basic classifier.
from textblob import classifiers
classifier = classifiers.naivebayesclassifier(training)


   as you can see above, we have passed the training data into the
   classifier.

   note that here we have used naive bayes classifier, but textblob also
   offers decision tree classifier which is as shown below.
## decision tree classifier
dt_classifier = classifiers.decisiontreeclassifier(training)

   now, let   s check the accuracy of this classifier on the testing dataset
   and also textblob provides us to check the most informative features.
print (classifier.accuracy(testing))
classifier.show_informative_features(3)
>> 1.0
most informative features
            contains(is) = true              neg : pos    =      2.9 : 1.0
      contains(terrible) = false             neg : pos    =      1.8 : 1.0
         contains(never) = false             neg : pos    =      1.8 : 1.0

   as, we can see that if the text contains    is   , then there is a high
   id203 that the statement will be negative.

   in order to give a little more idea, let   s check our classifier on a
   random text.
blob = textblob('the weather is terrible!', classifier=classifier)
print (blob.classify())
>> neg

   so, based on the training on the above dataset, our classifier has
   provided us the right result.

   note that here we could have done some preprocessing and data cleaning
   but here my aim was to give you an intuition that how we can do text
   classification using textblob.


6. pros and cons

pros:

    1. since, it is built on the shoulders of nltk and pattern, therefore
       making it simple for beginners by providing an intuitive interface
       to nltk.
    2. it provides language translation and detection which is powered by
       google translate ( not provided with spacy).

cons:

    1. it is little slower in the comparison to spacy but faster than
       nltk. (spacy > textblob > nltk)
    2. it does not provide features like id33, word vectors
       etc. which is provided by spacy.


7. end notes

   i hope that you that a fun time learning about this library. textblob,
   actually provided a very easy interface for beginners to learn basic
   nlp tasks.

   i would recommend every beginner to start with this library and then in
   order to do advance work you can learn spacy as well. we will still be
   using textblob for initial prototyping in the almost every nlp project.
