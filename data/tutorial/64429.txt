some nlp: probabilistic id18 (pid18) and cky parsing in python

     * posted by [35]sandipan dey on june 5, 2017 at 11:00pm
     * [36]view blog

   this problem appeared as an assignment in the coursera course natural
   language processing (by stanford) in 2012. the following description of
   the problem is taken directly from the assignment description.

   in this article, a probabilistic parser will be built by implementing
   the cky parser. the manually annotated sub-corpus (masc) from the
   american national corpus (anc): [37]this will be used for this purpose.

instructions

   first, we need to learn a pid18 from the training trees. since
   the training set is handparsed this learning is very easy. we need to
   simply set:

   im00.png

   where c(n_j     )  is the count observed for that production in the data
   set. while we could consider smoothing rule rewrite probabilities, it
   is sufficient to just work with un-smoothed id113
   probabilities for rules. (doing anything else makes things rather more
   complex and slow, since every rewrite will have a nonzero id203,
   so let   s get things working with an un-smoothed grammar before
   considering adding smoothing!).

   at the very beginning, all the train and the test trees are read in.
   the training trees are going to be used to construct a pid18 parser, by
   learning the pid18 grammar. the parser is then used to predict trees for
   the sentences in the test set. for each test sentence, the parse given
   by the parser is evaluated by comparing the constituents it generates
   with the constituents in the hand-parsed version. from
   this, precision, recall and the f1 score are calculated.

   there are the following basic data structures:

       ling.tree: id18 tree structures (ling.trees.penntreerenderer)

       lexicon: pre-terminal productions and probabilities

       grammar, unaryrule, binaryrule: id18 rules and accessors

   most parsers require grammars in which the rules are at most
   binary branching. hence, first we need to binarize the trees and then
   construct a grammar out of them using id113.

the task

   the first job is to build a cky parser using this pid18 grammar learnt.
   scan through a few of the training trees in the masc dataset to get a
   sense of the range of inputs. something worth noticing is that the
   grammar has relatively few non-terminal symbols but thousands of rules,
   many ternary-branching or longer. currently there are 38 masc
   train files and 11 test files.

   once we have a parser working on the treebank, the next task is improve
   upon the supplied grammar by adding 1st / 2nd-order vertical
   markovization. this means using parent annotation symbols like np^s to
   indicate a subject noun phrase instead of just np.

the id145 algorithm (cky) for parsing

   the following figure shows the cky algorithm to compute the best
   possible (most probable) parse tree for a sentence using the pid18
   grammar learnt from the training dataset.

   im0.png

   the following animation (prepared from the lecture slides of the same
   course) shows how the chart for cky is constructed using dynamic
   programming for  a small set of pid18 grammar.

evaulation

   for this assignment we will use your average f1 score to evaluate the
   correctness of the cky parser, although in essence we ought to know
   from the output on the development set (devtest) whether the parser is
   implemented correctly. the following figure shows an
   example evaluation:

   im3.png

results

   (1) first let   s use a toy minimal training dataset containing just 3
   pos-tagged trees, and a dev/test dataset with a single test
   sentence (with ground-truth), to start with. the following figure shows
   all the training trees.  there are just enough productions in the
   training set for the test sentence to have an ambiguity due
   to pp-attachment.

   train1

   the following figure shows the pid18 learnt from these training trees.
   now let   s try to parse a single test sentence   cats scratch walls with
   claws    with the cky parser and using the pid18 grammar learnt. the
   following figure shows the manual (gold) parse tree and the best (most
   probable) parse tree using the cky id145 algorithm.

   (2) now, let   s use a much larger training dataeset masc  (with a total
   of 3595 annotated training trees), a few of them are shown in the
   next figure.

   train.png

   let   s use all these 3595  pos-tagged training trees to
   learn the pid18 grammar.
     * there are ~10k of  lexicon rules producing terminals (with non-zero
       probabilities) are learnt, some of them are shown below:
       lex

     * there are ~4.5k binary rules (with non-zero
       probabilities) producing terminals are learnt, some of them are
       shown below:
       bin.png
     * there are ~3.5k unary rules (with non-zero probabilities) producing
       terminals are learnt, some of them are shown below:
       uni.png

   then let   s evaluate/compare the best parse trees obtained (guessed)
   with cky for a few testsentences from the dev/test dataset using
   the pid18 learnt, with the manually (gold) parsed test trees (there
   are 355 of them) using precision, recall and f1 score. a few of the
   test sentence parses are shown in the following figures.

   pid18_gold_shehadthelookofevery.png
   pid18_guessed_shehadthelookofevery.png

vertical markovization

   the independence assumptions of a pid18 are ofen too strong. in order to
   indicate the dependency on the parent non-terminal in a tree the
   grammar rules can be re-written depending on past k ancestor nodes,
   denoting the order-k vertical markovization, as explained in the
   following figure, which often increases the accuracy of the parse
   trees.

   im2.png

   there are ~14k of  lexicon rules producing terminals (with non-zero
   probabilities) are learnt, ~6k binary rules and ~5k  unary rules are
   learnt, some of them are shown below:

   rmkv.png

   the following figure shows the best parse trees obtained with cky for a
   sentence using pid18 learnt with and without vertical markovization from
   the minimal dataset.
   vmarkov.png

   similarly, using the masc dataset, as can be seen for the following
   particular test sentence, the cky parser performs much better with
   the pid18 learnt from the vertically markovized of the training trees:
   vm1.png

   a few more parse trees guessed by the cky using the pid18  learnt from
   the vertically markovized training trees are shown below:
