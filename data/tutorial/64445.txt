   last story we talked about [12]neural networks and its math , this
   story we will build the neural network from scratch in python.

     let   s get started!!!!!!

   [1*ncsqigfp-8650e2zhapq9w.jpeg]

   first let   s take the simplest dataset which is xor table.

   2 . pick the network architecture and initialize the weights
   [1*wo35zk_acq1n06bq9n4ixw.jpeg]

   here we have two inputs x1,x2 , 1 hidden layer of 3 neurons and 2
   output neurons, if we initalize the network so the neural net will look
   like this.

   3. we apply the forward propagation algorithm,

   if we use numpy arrays , it   s just a dot product of inputs and
   weights,then we apply the sigmoid function , we do this for every
   neuron in every layer.

   4. apply back propagation as we talked in last story.

   for updating weights

   5. repeat the process for certain no of epochs.

   once the training is completed , the neural network has learned weights
   by minimizing the error.

   well, that   s it.

   next step is prediction

   you can simply call the forward propagation method to predict.

   see that works!!

   that   s it for this story. hope you enjoyed and learned something let me
   know if it helps .

   you can find the full code on my [13]github.

   in the next story i will talk about one of the important algorithms in
   deep learning which is convolution neural networks.

   until then

   see ya!!!!!
