   last story we talked about the id90 and the code is my
   [12]github, this story i wanna talk about the simplest algorithm in
   machine learning which is k-nearest neighbors. let   s get started!!

   k-nearest neighbor is used for both regression and classification
   problems and there is no training process for this algorithm, the
   entire data set is used for predicting/classifying new data.

     core idea

   when a new data point is given, it calculates the distance from the new
   data point to all other points in our data-set.

   then depending on the k value, it identifies the nearest neighbor(   s)
   in our data set,

   if k=1 then then it takes the minimum distance of all points and
   classifies as the same class of the minimum distance data point.

   if k>1 then it takes a list of k minimum distances of all data points

   for classification, it classifies the new data point based on the
   majority of votes in the list.

   for regression, it takes the average of all values in the list.

   let   s understand how it works with data
   [1*4dxrispkp5jzpct0stywqg.jpeg]

   we have a dataset(labeled) of two features like this , now we need to
   have new data points which are not labeled to identify the class for
   each data point.

   then it calculates the distance from these new data points to all other
   points in our data-set

     how it calculates the distance from one point to another??

   well, there are several distance metrics available, it uses one of the
   distance metrics

   lets say k=1 and we use euclidean distance as a metric,
   [1*cv5mad1kcrlnh_ezganxaq.jpeg]

   now we calculate the distance from the new data point(   s) to all other
   points and then take the minimum value of all.

   if k>1 let   s say 5 then we take a list of 5 minimum distances then
   classify the new data point based on the majority of votes in the list

   for ex: observe below right picture.
   [1*yixio3mhnnga0tr0u1xm4q.jpeg]

   if k= 5 then we take 5 close points (4 purple, 1 yellow) we classify
   that point as purple(as the majority of purple is high).

     okay that   s cool but how do we define the k value???

   well, the only parameter tuned in this algorithm is k, it can be adjust
   based on the data and accuracy of predicting.

   one of the simple ways of adjusting k value is trying many k values ,
   based on the accuracy you can decide the value of k.
   [1*up0y9-ngi4musol33qh03w.jpeg]

   best value for k is either 1 or 2

   note : it would be better if we choose odd numbers for k values to
   avoid a tie at the time of prediction.

   you can find the full code on my [13]github.

   that   s it for this story. hope you enjoyed and learned something let me
   know if it helps .

   i think i covered most of machine learning,from the next story onwards
   i will talk about deep leaning algorithms.

   until then

   see ya!
