   last story we talked about the theory of [12]id166 with math,this story i
   wanna talk about the coding id166 from scratch in python. lets get our
   hands dirty!
   [1*qf4mqvrctoxzp2evtshg0g.png]

   full code is available on my [13]github.

   first things first, we take a toy data-set , we can generate random
   data x and y using sklearn make_blobs and plot it.
   [1*rn-yd8dmp9ic41ug2m9epg.jpeg]

   we have two features(independent variables) and 1 dependent variable
   which is either 0 or 1, for id166 convenience we treat them either -1 or
   1 separate our data-set like that and define required variables.
   [1*xljkqg_djjjjmj9dvs_44g.jpeg]

   we have everything we need so lets talk about the training process

   we are very sure from our last story, if the training points satisfy
   the below condition, then we have a separable hyperplane between those
   points.

     yi*(w.x+b)   1

   if it satisfies, we calculate the magnitude and save the weights

   else we update the weights.

   the below code does the same thing.

   note : i only talk about required code, full code is on my [14]github.

   the main code has been taken from the awesome guy [15]sentdex so the
   credit goes to him.

   optimization code.

   here we are storing the magnitude of weights(w) in a dictionary, once
   its optimized so we get a dictionary(keys=|w|,values=[w,b]) ,

   from them we choose the minimum |w|
   [1*ogkptfo3r4jf7smqlii0eq.jpeg]

   an example picture for above is this
   [1*ndzjcki-l7bywc35okpaog.png]

   if we get these two pictures we pick the minimum magnitude one |w|
   [1*wbd77tmv4dowfa3q05smha.png]

   that   s cool right???

   okay we have optimized the weights, but wait , there might be a problem
   for optimizing the weights which is    what if we overshot the minimum
   value??   
   [1*rwdicbv1dcwmbsslklj39w.jpeg]

   after overshooting we take a step back to minimum, but that step
   size(learning rate) is not same as earlier size, we need to decrease
   it,

   we should give a list of step sizes as per our convince, which is why i
   gave a list variable in the beginning of code.
learning_rate = [max_feature_value * 0.1, max_feature_value * 0.01, max_feature_
value * 0.001,]

   for every step size we run the whole optimization code(above block),
   then we finally reach the global minimum value.
for lrate in learning_rate:
     optimization code(lrate)

   now we have the whole optimization done, and we got final weights.

   if we visualize the data-set we get this.

   so what   s next???

   predicting new values.

   as we talked in the last story ,
   [1*ectoli m1l7d0neqbgdw.jpeg]

     bam!

   that   s it for this story. hope you enjoyed and learned something let me
   know if it helps .

   in the next story i will cover another interesting machine leaning
   concept until then see ya!

   full code is available on my [16]github.
