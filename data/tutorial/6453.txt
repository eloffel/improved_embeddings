neural networks demo in javascript

   find code (soon) on [3]github
   find me on twitter [4]@karpathy

   mouse click: add red data point
   shift + mouse click: add green data point
   'r': re-initialize weights to random
   's': shock the weights (change randomly a bit)
   'q': change architecture (number of neurons, layers of neurons)
   browser not supported for canvas. get a real browser.

   the network above is by default a 2-10-10-1 neural network.
   it has 2 inputs (x and y coordinates), 2 layers of 10 hidden neurons
   each, and one output neuron that activates for green class.

   note, this demo is depractated in favor of much better and recent demos
   over at [5]convnetjs.com.
