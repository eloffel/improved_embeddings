support vector machine in javascript

   uses smo algorithm. find code on [3]github
   find me on twitter [4]@karpathy

   mouse click: add red data point
   shift + mouse click: add green data point
   'k': toggle between linear and rbf kernel
   'r': reset
   browser not supported for canvas. get a real browser.

   c = 1.0
   rbf kernel sigma = 1.0

   note, these demos are somewhat depractated in favor of much better and
   recent ones over at [5]convnetjs.com. also, convnetjs supports (linear)
   id166s as a special case, where the neural network has no hidden layers
   and the id168 is the hinge loss. however, the solution is
   obtained in primal with subid119.
