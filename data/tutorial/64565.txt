normal distribution 

 
 
the normal distribution is the most widely known and used of all distributions.  because the 
normal distribution approximates many natural phenomena so well, it has developed into a 
standard of reference for many id203 problems.

     the notation n(  ,   2) means normally distributed with mean    and variance   2.  if we say 

x     n(  ,   2) we mean that x is distributed n(  ,   2). 

     about 2/3 of all cases fall within one standard deviation of the mean, that is 
 

     about 95% of cases lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean, that is 

p(   - 2       x        + 2  ) = .9544 

p(   -        x        +   ) = .6826.

ii.  why is the normal distribution useful? 
 

     many things actually are normally distributed, or very close to it.  for example, height 
and intelligence are approximately normally distributed; measurement errors also often 
have a normal distribution 

     the normal distribution is easy to work with mathematically.  in many practical cases, 

the methods developed using normal theory work quite well even when the distribution is 
not normal. 

     there is a very strong connection between the size of a sample n and the extent to which 
a sampling distribution approaches the normal form.  many sampling distributions based 
on large n can be approximated by the normal distribution even though the population 
distribution itself is definitely not normal. 

the standardized normal distribution. 

a. 

general procedure.  as you might suspect from the formula for the normal 

density function, it would be difficult and tedious to do the calculus every time we had a new set 
of parameters for    and   .  so instead, we usually work with the standardized normal 
distribution, where    = 0 and    = 1, i.e. n(0,1).  that is, rather than directly solve a problem 
involving a normally distributed variable x with mean    and standard deviation   , an indirect 
approach is used. 

1. 

we first convert the problem into an equivalent one dealing with a normal 
variable measured in standardized deviation units, called a standardized normal variable.  to do 
this, if x     n(  ,   5), then

used to obtain an answer in terms of the converted problem. 

a table of standardized normal values (appendix e, table i) can then be 

if necessary, we can then convert back to the original units of 

measurement.  to do this, simply note that, if we take the formula for z, multiply both sides by 
  , and then add    to both sides, we get

4. 

the interpetation of z values is straightforward.  since    = 1, if z = 2, the 

corresponding x value is exactly 2 standard deviations above the mean.  if z = -1, the 
corresponding x value is one standard deviation below the mean.  if z = 0, x = the mean, i.e.   . 

 
rules for using the standardized normal distribution.  it is very important to 

b. 

understand how the standardized normal distribution works, so we will spend some time here 
going over it.  recall that, for a random variable x, 
 

f(x) = p(x     x) 

 
 

normal distribution - page 2 

 
appendix e, table i (or see hays, p. 924) reports the cumulative normal probabilities for 
normally distributed variables in standardized form (i.e. z-scores).  that is, this table reports p(z 
    z) = f(z).  for a given value of z, the table reports what proportion of the distribution lies 
below that value.  for example, f(0) = .5; half the area of the standardized normal curve lies to 
the left of z = 0.  note that only positive values of z are reported; as we will see, this is not a 
problem, since the normal distribution is symmetric.  we will now show how to work with this 
table. 
 

note:  while memorization may be useful, you will be much better off if you gain an 
intuitive understanding as to why the rules that follow are correct.  try drawing pictures of the 
normal distribution to convince yourself that each rule is valid. 
 
rules: 
 
1. 

p(z     a) 
= f(a)  
= 1 - f(-a) 

(use when a is positive) 
 

(use when a is negative) 

 

 

 
ex: 
 

 

 

find p(z     a) for a = 1.65, -1.65, 1.0, -1.0 

to solve: for positive values of a, look up and report the value for f(a) given in appendix 

e, table i.  for negative values of a, look up the value for f(-a) (i.e. f(absolute value of a)) and 
report 1 - f(-a). 

 
p(z     1.65) = f(1.65) = .95 
p(z     -1.65) = f(-1.65) = 1 - f(1.65) = .05 

 
 

normal distribution - page 3 

p(z     1.0) = f(1.0) = .84 
p(z     -1.0) = f(-1.0) = 1 - f(1.0) = .16 

 
you can also easily work in the other direction, and determine what a is given p(z     a) 
 
ex: 
 

find a for p(z     a) = .6026, .9750, .3446 

to solve: for p     .5, find the id203 value in table i, and report the corresponding 

value for z.  for p < .5, compute 1 - p, find the corresponding z value, and report the negative of 
that value, i.e. -z. 

p(z     .26) = .6026 
p(z     1.96) = .9750 
p(z     -.40) = .3446 (since 1 - .3446 = .6554 = f(.40)) 

 
note:  it may be useful to keep in mind that f(a) + f(-a) = 1. 
 
2. 

p(z     a) 
= 1 - f(a) 
= f(-a) 

 
 

(use when a is positive) 
(use when a is negative) 

find p(z      a) for a = 1.5, -1.5 

 

to solve: for a positive, look up f(a), as before, and subtract f(a) from 1.  for a negative, 

just report f(-a). 

p(z     1.5) = 1 - f(1.5) = 1 - .9332 = .0668 
p(z     -1.5) = f(1.5) = .9332 

 

 
ex: 
 

 
 

 
 

normal distribution - page 4 

p(a     z     b) = f(b) - f(a) 

find p(a     z     b) for a = -1 and b = 1.5 

 

to solve: determine f(b) and f(a), and subtract. 
p(-1     z     1.5) = f(1.5) - f(-1) = f(1.5) - (1 - f(1)) = .9332 - 1 + .8413 = .7745 

3. 
 

 
ex: 
 

 
4. 
 
proof: 

for a positive, p(-a     z     a) = 2f(a) - 1 

p(-a     z     a)  
= f(a) - f(-a)   
= f(a) - (1 - f(a)) 
= f(a) - 1 + f(a) 
= 2f(a) - 1 

 
 

(by rule 3) 
(by rule 1) 

 
ex: find p(-a     z     a) for a = 1.96, a = 2.58 
 

p(-1.96     z     1.96) = 2f(1.96) - 1 = (2 * .975) - 1 = .95 
p(-2.58     z     2.58) = 2f(2.58) - 1 = (2 * .995) - 1 = .99 

 
4b.  for a positive, f(a) = [1 + p(-a     z     a)] / 2 
 
ex: find a for p(-a     z     a) = .90, .975 
 
f(a) = (1 + .90)/2 = .95, implying a = 1.65. 
 
for p(-a     z     a) = .975, 
 
f(a) = (1 + .975)/2 = .9875, implying a = 2.24 
 
note:  suppose we were asked to find a and b for p(a     z     b) = .90.  there are an infinite 
number of values that we could use; for example, we could have a = negative infinity and b = 
1.28, or a = -1.28 and b = positive infinity, or a = -1.34 and b = 2.32, etc.  the smallest interval 
between a and b will always be found by choosing values for a and b such that a = -b.  for 
example, for p(a     z     b) = .90, a = -1.65 and b = 1.65 are the    best    values to choose, since they 
yield the smallest possible value for b - a.

we can give some examples of how to use standardized scores to address various questions. 
 
examples. 
 
1.  the top 5% of applicants (as measured by gre scores) will receive scholarships.  if gre ~ 
n(500, 1002), how high does your gre score have to be to qualify for a scholarship? 
 
solution. let x = gre.  we want to find x such that 
 

p(x     x) = .05 

 
this is too hard to solve as it stands - so instead, compute 
 

z = (x - 500)/100 

 

(note: z ~ n(0,1) ) 

 
and find z for the problem, 
 

p(z     z) = .05 

 
note that p(z     z) = 1 - f(z) (rule 2).  if 1 - f(z) = .05, then f(z) = .95.  looking at table i in 
appx e, f(z) = .95 for z = 1.65 (approximately). 
 
hence, z = 1.65.  to find the equivalent x, compute 
 
x = (z * 100) + 500 = (1.65 * 100) + 500 = 665.  thus, your gre score needs to be 665 or higher 
to qualify for a scholarship. 
 
 
 
2. 
of the population lives in poverty? 
 
solution.  let x = family income.  we want to find p(x     $10,000).  this is too hard to 
compute directly, so let 

family income ~ n($25000, $100002).  if the poverty level is $10,000, what percentage 

z = (x - $25,000)/$10,000. 

 
if x = $10,000, then z = ($10,000 - $25,000)/$10,000 = -1.5.  so, 
 

p(x     $10,000) = p(z     -1.5) = f(-1.5) = 1 - f(1.5) = 1 - .9332 = .0668.  hence, a little 

under 7% of the population lives in poverty.

between $20,000 and $30,000.  if family income ~ n($25000, $100002), what percentage of the 
population will benefit from the law? 
 
solution.  let x = family income.  we want to find p($20,000 x     $30,000).  to solve, let 
 

z = (x - $25,000)/$10,000. 

 
note that when x = $20,000, z = ($20,000 - $25,000)/$10,000 = -0.5, and when x = $30,000, z = 
+0.5.  hence, 
 

p($20,000     x     $30,000) = p(-.5     z    .5) = 2f(.5) - 1 = 1.383 - 1 = .383.  thus, about 

the normal approximation to the binomial.   

38% of the taxpayers will benefit from the new law. 
 
v. 
 
as we saw before, many interesting problems can be addressed via the binomial distribution.  
however, for large ns, the binomial distribution can get to be quite awkward to work with.  
fortunately, as n becomes large, the binomial distribution becomes more and more symmetric, 
and begins to converge to a normal distribution.  that is, for a large enough n, a binomial 
variable x is approximately     n(np, npq).  hence, the normal distribution can be used to 
approximate the binomial distribution.  just how large n needs to be depends on how close p is 
to 1/2, and on the precision desired, but fairly good results are usually obtained when npq     3.   

of course, a binomial variable x is not distributed exactly normal because x is not 

continuous, e.g. you cannot get 3.7 heads when tossing 4 coins.  in the binomial, p(x     a) + p(x 
     a + 1) = 1 whenever a is an integer.  but if we sum the area under the normal curve 
corresponding to p(x     a) + p(x     a + 1), this area does not sum to 1.0 because the area from a 
to (a + 1) is missing.   

the usual way to solve this problem is to associate 1/2 of the interval from a to a + 1 with 

each adjacent integer.  the continuous approximation to the id203 p(x     a) would thus be 
p(x     a + 1/2), while the continuous approximation to p(x     a + 1) would be p(x     a + 1/2).  
this adjustment is called a correction for continuity.  more specifically,

note:  for the binomial distribution, the values to the right of each = sign are primarily 
included for illustrative purposes.  the equalities which hold in the binomial distribution do not 
hold in the normal distribution, because there is a gap between consecutive values of a.  the 
normal approximation deals with this by    splitting    the difference. 

for example, in the binomial, p(x     6 ) = p(x < 7), since 6 is the next possible value of 

x that is less than 7.  in the normal, we approximate this by finding p(x     6.5).  and, in the 
binomial, p(x     6) = p(x > 5), because 6 is the next value of x that is greater than 5.  in the 
normal, we approximate this by finding p(x     5.5)

what is the id203 that exactly 11 will support the governor? 
what is the id203 that 11 or fewer will support the governor? 

 
solution:  note that n = 20, p = .5, so    = np = 10 and   5 = npq = 5,    = 2.236.  since npq 
    3, it is probably safe to assume that x has approximately a n(10,5) distribution. 
 

a. 

for the binomial, find p(x = 7).  appx. e, table ii shows p(7) = .0739. 

for the normal, find p(6.5     x     7.5).  we convert 6.5 and 7.5 to their corresponding z-scores 
(-1.57 and -1.12), and the problem becomes finding p(-1.57     z     -1.12) = f(1.57) - f(1.12) = 
.9418 - .8686 = .0732. 
 

b. 

to use the binomial distribution, find p (x     7).  using appx. e, we get 

p(7) + p(6) + p(5) + p(4) + p(3) + p(2) + p(1) + p(0) =  
.0739 + .0370 + .0148 + .0046 + .0011 + .0002 + 0 + 0 = .1316. 

to use the normal approximation to the binomial, find p(x     7.5).  as noted above, the z-

score that corresponds to 7.5 is -1.12.  f(-1.12) = 1 - f(1.12) = 1 - .8686 = .1314. 
 

c. 

for the binomial, find p(x = 11).  appx. e shows p(11) = .1602. 

for the normal, find p(10.5     x     11.5).  if we convert 10.5 and 11.5 to their corresponding z-
scores, the problem becomes a matter of finding p(.22     z    .67) = f(.67) - f(.22) = .7486 - .5871 
= .1615. 
 

d. 

for the binomial, find p(x     11).  from appx e table 2, you can determine that 
this is .7483.  for the normal, find p(x     11.5).  the z-score that corresponds to 11.5 is .67, and 
f(.67) = .7486. 

in all of the above, note that the results obtained using the binomial distribution and the 

normal approximation to the binomial are almost identical.

2. 
in each of 25 races, the democrats have a 60% chance of winning.  what are the odds 
that the democrats will win 19 or more races?  use the normal approximation to the binomial. 
 
solution.  np = 15, npq = 6, so x ~ n(15, 6).  using the normal approximation to the binomial, 
we want to find p(x     18.5). 
 
let z = (x - 15)/   6.  when x = 18.5, z = 3.5/   6 = 1.43.  hence, 
 
p(x     18.5) = p(z     1.43) = 1 - f(1.43) = 1 - .9236 = .0764. 
 
hence, democrats have a little less than an 8% chance of winning 19 or more races. 
 
incidentally, note that, since n = 25 is not included in appendix e, table ii, it would be very 
tedious to calculate this using the binomial distribution. 
 
 
 
3. 
 use the normal approximation to the binomial. 
 
solution.     = np = 5.5,   5 = npq = 2.75, so x     n(5.5, 2.75).  if we were using the binomial 
distribution, we would find p(x     6); since we are using the normal approximation to the 
binomial, we find p(x     5.5).  hence, 
 

in a family of 11 children, what is the id203 that there will be more boys than girls? 

p(x     5.5) = p(z     0) = .5.  (i hope you are convinced about this question by now!) 
 

warning (added september 2004): i   ve suggested using the correction for continuity ever 
since i first taught this course in the 1980s.  several other sources also recommend this.  
however, it turns out that this is fairly controversial; while the correction often produces more 
accurate results (as it does in all the examples i have presented here) sometimes the results are 
less accurate (indeed, at least one old exam has a wrong answer!).  if your life really depends on 
getting the results exactly correct, it is better to work with a computer program that can do the 
calculations directly using the binomial distribution rather than the normal approximation.  stata 
and excel are among the programs that can do this.  for example, in stata you could work 
problem #2 exactly using the bitesti command:
