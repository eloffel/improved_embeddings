   this is a demo of our state-of-the-art neural coreference resolution
   system. the open source code for [2]neural coref, our coreference
   system based on neural nets and spacy, is [3]on github, and we explain
   in our medium publication [4]how the model works and [5]how to train
   it.

   in short, coreference is the fact that two or more expressions in a
   text     like pronouns or nouns     link to the same person or thing. it is
   a classical natural language processing task, that has seen a revival
   of interest in the past two years as several research groups applied
   cutting-edge deep-learning and reinforcement-learning techniques to it.
   it is also one of the key building blocks to building conversational
   artificial intelligences. if you like this demo please [6]tweet about
   it     .
