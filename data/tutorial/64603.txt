   before we jump into the full convolutional neural network, lets first
   understand the basic underlying concept and then build up on that.

   this post will explain the following:
     * convolution concept
     * convolutional neural network
     * strided convolutions

convolution concept

   for those of you who have taken a class/course on digital signal/image
   processing, would be comfortable with the concept of covolution. for
   the rest of us, let quickly run through the concept, so that we can
   dive into the actual id98 implementation.

   if you have an image of a city with alot of buildings as below, and you
   would like to extract all the edges from the image, how would you do
   it?

   fig 1. edge detection on an image using convolution. note how all the
   edges separating different colours and brightness levels have been
   identified

   whenever one signal (s) needs to be modified to extract only a set of
   desired features from it, the process is known as filtering. now to
   carryout filtering, another set of signals are required which we
   somehow imposed/applied over the original signal, s, called filters
   (f). these filters can also be called masks, as they help us    mask    all
   image features except the ones we want!

   now all the masks can show the required effect on the image if they are
   convolved with the images pixels in a manner demonstrated by the below
   animation.

   image. [18]source

   for a better understanding of convolution please refer to this
   [19]post.

convolutional neural network

   [0*drotsjppgk51uqe-.png]

   digits recognition. each plane is a feature map ie a set of units whose
   weights are constrained to be identical. [20]source

   the above illustration from the original paper by [21]prof yann lecun
   shows all the basic components and data flow in a convolutional
   network.

   to put it in a quantifiable form, every id98 has the following
   components/layers:
     * input image
     * convolution layer
     * pooling layer (max pooling or avg pooling)
     * flattening
     * fully connected layer (default neural network)

   we will dive deeper into the details of each of the above layers in
   subsequent posts.

strided convolutions

   when we are dealing with convolution on images of very large size, its
   not always required to convolve over each and every pixel of an image.
   so we can set the subsequent convolutions to be shifted by more than
   one pixel in either the vertical or horizontal axis.
   [0*du3pvh2emskoeabx.png]
   fig 4. effect of strided convolutions on an image dimensions

   this shift in subsequent convolutions is called the stride, and hence
   the name strided convolutions.

   if we have an image of dimension n x n with a padding p, which is
   convolved with filter of dimension f x f witha stride of s, then the
   output dimensions can be determined using the below general equation:
   [0*ymkz_ickyf_mdw03.png]
   fig 5. equation governing the resultant image/signal dimension after
   applying a filter (f x f) with padding (p) and stride (s)

   ps: in the mathematical convolution operation we flip one of the
   signals being convolved i.e. like viewed in a mirror. the operation we
   are using above is actually cross-correlation, but generally in deep
   learning convolution is the term used for it!

conclusion

   in this post we have understood the basic concepts which help us in
   building the entire convolution neural network. we covered how
   convolution works with image data, using different filters or masks.
   further we touched upon the various building blocks of a id98, and how
   strided convolutions affect the image/data dimensions.

     in the next post i will be covering convolution in more detail and
     how it is applied across volumes with many filters.
