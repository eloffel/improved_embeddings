your job as a linguist in the space federation is to translate between languages for the international team 
aboard the u.s.s. enterprise. one day, you see some words flashing on your switchboard: 

   houston, we have a problem. houston, we have a problem.     
   the klingons?    you ask.  
   roger that. klag is frantic. he won   t go back to the pagh until we answer him,    came the reply. 
   copy. we are working on it. we will report back asap,    you respond.

you know that the klingons are grammarians, so you must make sure that you accurately translate your mes-
sage into the klingon language to avoid upsetting them further.  
 
you think back to the last time you had to translate something. in that case, you needed to translate the 
turkish sentence bir k  z bir kitap okudu into english. first you looked up all of the turkish words: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by replacing each turkish word with its english equivalent, you got the translation a girl a book read...which 
didn   t seem quite right. luckily, at that point your boss came over. (your boss is very wise, as are all linguists, 
especially those who organize linguistics olympiads). she told you that you can   t just translate turkish to eng-
lish word-for-word because turkish and english use different word orders. she then handed you a file of syn-
chronous id18s (sid18s). an sid18 provides you with two systems of rules for constructing 
sentences in the correct word order, one system for each language. this way, you can translate not only 
words, but also word order, from one language to another. here is the english-turkish sid18 from the file she 
gave you: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

s     <np vp, np vp> 
vp     <v np, np v> 
np     <a book, bir kitap> 
np     <a cat, bir kedi> 
np     <a girl, bir k  z> 
np     <a turtle, bir kaplumba  a> 
v     <ate, yedi > 
v     <bit,   s  rd  > 
v     <chased, kovalad   > 
v     <read, okudu > 
v     <saw, g  rd   > 

<english, turkish> sid18

using this sid18, you correctly translated bir k  z bir kitap okudu into a girl read a book. you were also able to 
translate in the other direction, for example to translate a turtle saw a cat as bir kaplumba  a bir kedi g  rd  . 
 
d1. using only words in the <english, turkish> sid18 presented above,  

a. write an english sentence that is exactly 20 letters long (excluding spaces and punctuation). 

 

b. translate your sentence into turkish. 

 

 

d2. before you can answer the klingons, you have to clarify something between the members on board the 
u.s.s. enterprise. you have already translated something that elif, who speaks turkish, told tovo, who speaks 
malagasy, using the turkish-malagasy sid18 below on the left. the malagasy sentences you generated are 
shown in the table on the right. now, you need to translate the sentences for elisabeth, who speaks english. 
write the english translations of the following malagasy sentences. 

<turkish, malagasy> sid18 

s     <np vp, vp np > 
vp     <np v, v np > 
np     <bir kaplumba  a, sokatra> 
np     <bir kedi , saka> 
v     < g  rd     nahita> 
v     <   s  rd  , nanaikitra > 
v     < kovalad  , nanenjika > 
v     < yedi, nihinana > 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

malagasy 

english translation: 

a.  nahita sokatra saka 

 

 

b.  nanenjika saka sokatra 

c.  nanaikitra saka sokatra 

d.  nihinana saka sokatra 

 

 

 

 

d3. you should probably get around to answering klag, who is by now even more irate than before because 
you   ve spent so much time reminiscing about turkish and malagasy. use the sid18 for english to klingon (on 
the next page) to translate the following sentences into klingon. write your answers next to the associated 
letters in the answer spaces. 

a. the pet bites.   
b. the u.s.s. enterprise will battle the klingons. 
c. the leaders know that the klingons know that the commander learned that a spy saw that the klingons 
have a pet.

id18s provide a set of rules to describe a natural (ie, human) language. because of the abil-
ity of these rules to construct longer phrases and sentences from a finite list of smaller units, context free 
grammars have been used in computer science as components of parsing and translation algorithms. syn-
chronous id18s provide the id18s of two languages simultaneously and matched up with 
each other. this is especially useful for translation purposes.
