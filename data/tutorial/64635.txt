 

(l) peeled potato act with annie (1/3) [5 points] 

consider the following sentence: 

1) the girl ate rice with shrimp. 

there are multiple different things that this sentence could mean. it could mean that the girl ate rice which 
contained shrimp; with this meaning, the phrase with shrimp modifies the noun rice. on the other hand, it 
could instead mean that the girl used shrimp as tools that allowed her to eat the rice; with this meaning, with 
shrimp modifies the verb ate. for this sentence, it is obvious to a human reader that the intended meaning is 
the one where with shrimp modifies the noun rather than the verb, because it is common for shrimp to ap-
pear in rice while it is uncommon for people to use shrimp as eating implements. however, this changes if we 
change the word shrimp to chopsticks: 

2) the girl ate rice with chopsticks. 

now it is much more likely that with chopsticks modifies the verb ate rather than the noun rice because chop-
sticks are usually eating implements rather than ingredients. 
 
with chopsticks and with shrimp are examples of prepositional phrases, which modify other phrases to pro-
vide more information about those phrases. prepositional phrases always start with a preposition, such as to, 
for, of, or with. in ambiguous sentences (such as 1 or 2), it is usually easy for humans to tell whether the 
prepositional phrase is intended to modify the noun or the verb, but for computers this task can be much 
harder because the computers might not have all of the background knowledge that humans use to make 
this judgment. in the following article about annie, a circus performer, each italicized component contains a 
prepositional phrase that could potentially be describing a noun or a verb:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
l1. the table on the next page lists each instance of an ambiguously positioned prepositional phrase in the 
article about annie. some instances are already correctly labeled as either modifying the noun (n) or the verb 
(v). fill in the remaining labels in the    correct label    column with the most likely label given the context of 
the instance. note that adjectives within the sentences are not listed in the table. 
 
 
 

annie [1] joined the circus as tightrope walker, but she [2] is now head of the acrobats. she [3] 
performs her main act in a purple leotard. annie best [4] likes the routine with the trapeze, be-
cause she [5] had liked that act as a child. she usually [6] performs this act with gusto, but yes-
terday she [7] performed this act with sadness. she [8] had just lost her lucky penny in the street. 
but, at least she [9] likes her new good luck charm with the inscription. because he was sick, an-
nie [10] practiced her routine with charley alone yesterday. while charley is an acrobat, he usu-
ally [11] performs his main act with the clowns. charley [12] likes the act with the bananas, but 
charley best [13] likes the one with the peach pie. tonight, charley gets to [14] perform his main 
act with annie. unfortunately, the peach pie act is not very popular with the audience, so they 
have to [15] do the act with the peeled potatoes.

l2. a computer would struggle to predict the correct labels for these instances, but you can help it by giving it 
some rules to guide its decisions. these rules will be interpreted in a specified order such that, once an in-
stance has been labeled by one rule, its label cannot be changed by any later rules, even if those rules would 
apply if it had not yet been labeled.  
 
you are considering using the following rules:

a. if the verb is a form of    to like    (e.g., likes, like, liked), label the instance as n. 
b. if the preposition is    with    and noun2 contains a food item, label the instance as n. 
c. if noun1 is    act   , label the instance as v. 
 

for algorithm1, you order the rules as follows: 

1. __a__ 
2. __b__ 
3. __c__ 

 
fill in the label that algorithm1 would assign to each instance in the    algorithm1    column of the table above. 
if the algorithm does not produce a label for an instance, leave that cell blank.

l3. a baseline is a starting point (the default predictions) that can be used to determine whether an algorithm 
improves labelling prediction. because it is a default, the baseline consists of only one rule and applies to all 
instances (ie, there will be no blank labels). if you were a computer scientist developing algorithm1, before 
testing algorithm1, you should have already made a baseline algorithm for the article about annie, and you 
found that algorithm1 gets 10 labels right, gets 1 label wrong, and leaves 4 blank. the baseline gets 8 right 
and 7 wrong, leaving 0 blank. state a single rule that could have been the rule you used as your baseline. 

 

then, in the    baseline    column of the table on the previous page, fill in the label for that instance given by 
your baseline. 
 
l4. what order should the rules a, b, and c be placed in an algorithm in order to obtain the highest accuracy 
possible? write the letter of the rule next to the number of the order that it is placed in.
