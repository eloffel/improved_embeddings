   the content of this course changes as technology evolves, to keep up to
   date with changes [114]follow me on github.

course description

   deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural
   networks. through a combination of advanced training techniques and
   neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create
   neural networks of much greater complexity. deep learning allows a
   neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is
   like the function of the human brain. this course will introduce the
   student to id161 with convolution neural networks (id98), time
   series analysis with long short-term memory (lstm), classic neural
   network structures and application to computer security. high
   performance computing (hpc) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning
   can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (gpus), as well as
   grids. focus is primarily upon the application of deep learning to
   problems, with some introduction mathematical foundations. students
   will use the python programming language to implement deep learning
   using google tensorflow and keras. it is not necessary to know python
   prior to this course; however, familiarity of at least one programming
   language is assumed. this course will be delivered in a hybrid format
   that includes both classroom and online instruction.

objectives

    1. explain how neural networks (deep and otherwise) compare to other
       machine learning models.
    2. determine when a deep neural network would be a good choice for a
       particular problem.
    3. demonstrate your understanding of the material through a final
       project uploaded to github.
