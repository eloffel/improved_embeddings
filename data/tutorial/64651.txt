   i want to discuss some very fundamental terms/concepts related to
   id203 and statistics that often come across any literature
   related to machine learning and ai.

   random experiment
   a random experiment is a physical situation whose outcome cannot be
   predicted until it is observed.

   sample space
   a sample space, is a set of all possible outcomes of a random
   experiment.

   random variables
   a random variable, is a variable whose possible values are numerical
   outcomes of a random experiment. there are two types of random
   variables.
   1. discrete random variable is one which may take on only a countable
   number of distinct values such as 0,1,2,3,4,      .. discrete random
   variables are usually (but not necessarily) counts.
   2. continuous random variable is one which takes an infinite number of
   possible values. continuous random variables are usually measurements.

   id203
   id203 is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur
   in a random experiment. id203 is quantified as a number between 0
   and 1, where, loosely speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1
   indicates certainty. the higher the id203 of an event, the more
   likely it is that the event will occur.
   example
   a simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. since the
   coin is fair, the two outcomes (   heads    and    tails   ) are both equally
   probable; the id203 of    heads    equals the id203 of    tails   ;
   and since no other outcomes are possible, the id203 of either
      heads    or    tails    is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

   id155
   id155 is a measure of the id203 of an event
   given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another
   event has already occurred. if the event of interest is a and the event
   b is known or assumed to have occurred,    the id155 of
   a given b   , is usually written as p(a|b).

   [1*885ek0w8dsktktz11jpx9a.png]

   independence
   two events are said to be independent of each other, if the id203
   that one event occurs in no way affects the id203 of the other
   event occurring, or in other words if we have observation about one
   event it doesn   t affect the id203 of the other. for independent
   events a and b below is true
   [1*zjxkfj1malvrhvnaoksxig.png]

   example
   let   s say you rolled a die and flipped a coin. the id203 of
   getting any number face on the die is no way influences the id203
   of getting a head or a tail on the coin.

   conditional independence
   two events a and b are conditionally independent given a third event c
   precisely if the occurrence of a and the occurrence of b are
   independent events in their id155 distribution given
   c. in other words, a and b are conditionally independent given c if and
   only if, given knowledge that c already occurred, knowledge of whether
   a occurs provides no additional information on the likelihood of b
   occurring, and knowledge of whether b occurs provides no additional
   information on the likelihood of a occurring.
   [1*j60qn0-m5wtnwdkqo-sb_g.png]

   example
   a box contains two coins, a regular coin and one fake two-headed coin
   (p(h)=1p(h)=1). i choose a coin at random and toss it twice.
    let
    a = first coin toss results in an hh.
    b = second coin toss results in an hh.
    c = coin 1 (regular) has been selected.
   if c is already observed i.e. we already know whether a regular coin is
   selected or not, the event a and b becomes independent as the outcome
   of 1 doesn   t affect the outcome of other event.

   expectation
   the expectation of a random variable x is written as e(x). if we
   observe n random values of x, then the mean of the n values will be
   approximately equal to e(x) for large n. in more concrete terms, the
   expectation is what you would expect the outcome of an experiment to be
   on an average if you repeat the experiment a large number of time.
   [1*b23d4c974qaa5iswez5rwg.png]
   so the expectation is 3.5 . if you think about it, 3.5 is halfway
   between the possible values the die can take and so this is what you
   should have expected.

   variance
   the variance of a random variable x is a measure of how concentrated
   the distribution of a random variable x is around its mean. it   s
   defined as
   [1*kz6k1d35k5ncgyiwcl89uq.png]

   id203 distribution
   is a mathematical function that maps the all possible outcomes of an
   random experiment with it   s associated id203. it depends on the
   random variable x , whether it   s discrete or continues.
   1. discrete id203 distribution: the mathematical definition of a
   discrete id203 function, p(x), is a function that satisfies the
   following properties. this is referred as id203 mass function.
   [1*ef0mbx8z41qxkd1zlpoqaw.png]

   2. continuous id203 distribution: the mathematical definition of
   a continuous id203 function, f(x), is a function that satisfies
   the following properties. this is referred as id203 density
   function.
   [1*mkhtcwduzcvlfvdxcuuedg.png]

   joint id203 distribution
   if x and y are two random variables, the id203 distribution that
   defines their simultaneous behaviour during outcomes of a random
   experiment is called a joint id203 distribution. joint
   distribution function of x and y ,defined as
   [1*qoebiglcaahscmemfodg1a.png]
   in general if there are n random variables and each can take values v1,
   v2     vn different values then there will be total (v1)^n*(v2)^n*   (vn)^n
   rows in the table.

   id155 distribution (cpd)
   if z is random variable who is dependent on other variables x and y,
   then the distribution of p(z|x,y) is called cpd of z w.r.t x and y. it
   means for every possible combination of random variables x, y we
   represent a id203 distribution over z.
   example
   there is a student who has a property called    intelligence    which can
   be either low(i_0)/high(i_1). he/she enrolls to a course, the course
   has property called    difficulty    which can take binary values
   easy(d_0)/difficult(d_1). and the student gets a    grade    in the course
   based on his performance, and grade can take 3 values
   g_1(best)/(g_2)/(g_3)(worst). then the cpd p(g|i,d) is as follow
   [1*iucu2fn3nlkhlkngsqgz3a.png]

   there are a number of operations that one can perform over any
   id203 distribution to get interesting results. some of the
   important operations are as below.
    1. conditioning/reduction
       if we have a id203 distribution of n random variables x1,
       x2     xn and we make an observation about k variables that they
       acquired certain values a1, a2,    , ak. it means we already know
       their assignment. then the rows in the jd which are not consistent
       with the observation is simply can removed and that leave us with
       lesser number of rows. this operation is known as reduction.

   [1*0eyxq_djnumpp_zlwpq__a.png]

   2. marginalisation
    this operation takes a id203 distribution over a large set
   random variables and produces a id203 distribution over a smaller
   subset of the variables. this operation is known as marginalising a
   subset of random variables. this operation is very useful when we have
   large set of random variables as features and we are interested in a
   smaller set of variables, and how it affects output. for ex.

   factor
   a factor is a function or a table which takes a number of random
   variables {x_1, x_2,   ,x_n} as an argument and produces a real number as
   a output. the set of input random variables are called scope of the
   factor. for example joint id203 distribution is a factor which
   takes all possible combinations of random variables as input and
   produces a id203 value for that set of variables which is a real
   number. factors are the fundamental block to represent distributions in
   high dimensions and it support all basic operations that join
   distributions can be operated up on like product, reduction and
   marginalisation.

   factor product
   we can do factor products and the result will also be a factor. for ex
