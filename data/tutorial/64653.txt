contractions

   this package is capable of resolving contractions (and slang),
   examples:
you're -> you are
i'm    -> i am
# uses \b boundaries for "unsafe"
ima    -> i am going to
yall  -> you all
gotta  -> got to

   note that in ambigious cases it will revert to the most common case:
he's -> he is (instead of he has)

usage

import contractions
contractions.fix("you're happy now")
# "you are happy now"
contractions.fix("yall're happy now", slang=false) # default: true
# "yall are happy"
contractions.fix("yall're happy now")
# "you all are happy now"
