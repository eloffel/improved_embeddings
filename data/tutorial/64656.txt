   this post will serve as a practical walkthrough of a text data
   preprocessing task using some common python tools.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by [39]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

                                                            c [40]comments

   in a pair of previous posts, we first discussed a [41]framework for
   approaching textual data science tasks, and followed that up with a
   discussion on a [42]general approach to preprocessing text data. this
   post will serve as a practical walkthrough of a text id174
   task using some common python tools.

                             id174
    preprocessing, in the context of the textual data science framework.

   our goal is to go from what we will describe as a chunk of text (not to
   be confused with text chunking), a lengthy, unprocessed single string,
   and end up with a list (or several lists) of cleaned tokens that would
   be useful for further id111 and/or natural language processing
   tasks.

   first we start with our imports.

   beyond the standard python libraries, we are also using the following:
     * [43]nltk - the natural language toolkit is one of the best-known
       and most-used nlp libraries in the python ecosystem, useful for all
       sorts of tasks from id121, to id30, to part of speech
       tagging, and beyond
     * [44]beautifulsoup - beautifulsoup is a useful library for
       extracting data from html and xml documents
     * [45]inflect - this is a simple library for accomplishing the
       natural language related tasks of generating plurals, singular
       nouns, ordinals, and indefinite articles, and (of most interest to
       us) converting numbers to words
     * [46]contractions - another simple library, solely for expanding
       contractions

   if you have nltk installed, yet require the download of its any
   additional data, [47]see here.

   we need some sample text. we'll start with something very small and
   artificial in order to easily see the results of what we are doing step
   by step.

   a toy dataset indeed, but make no mistake; the steps we are taking here
   to preprocessing this data are fully transferable.

                           preprocessing framework
                   the text id174 framework.


noise removal


   let's loosely define noise removal as text-specific id172 tasks
   which often take place prior to id121. i would argue that, while
   the other 2 major steps of the preprocessing framework (id121
   and id172) are basically task-independent, noise removal is
   much more task-specific.

   sample noise removal tasks could include:
     * removing text file headers, footers
     * removing html, xml, etc. markup and metadata
     * extracting valuable data from other formats, such as json

   as you can imagine, the boundary between noise removal and data
   collection and assembly, on the one hand, is a fuzzy one, while the
   line between noise removal and id172 is blurred on the other.
   given its close relationship with specific texts and their collection
   and assembly, many denoising tasks, such as parsing a json structure,
   would obviously need to be implemented prior to id121.

   in our id174 pipeline, we will strip away html markup with
   the help of the beautifulsoup library, and use id157 to
   remove open and close double brackets and anything in between them (we
   assume this is necessary based on our sample text).

   while not mandatory to do at this stage prior to id121 (you'll
   find that this statement is the norm for the relatively flexible
   ordering of text id174 tasks), replacing contractions with
   their expansions can be beneficial at this point, since our word
   tokenizer will split words like "didn't" into "did" and "n't." it's not
   impossible to remedy this id121 at a later stage, but doing so
   prior makes it easier and more straightforward.

   and here is the result of de-noising on our sample text.
title goes here
bolded text
italicized text

but this will still be here!

i run. he ran. she is running. will they stop running?

i talked. she was talking. they talked to them about running. who ran to the tal
king runner?



  sebasti  n, nicol  s, alejandro and j  ronimo are going to the store tomorrow morn
ing!

something... is! wrong() with.,; this :: sentence.

i cannot do this anymore. i did not know them. why could not you have dinner at
the restaurant?

my favorite movie franchises, in order: indiana jones; marvel cinematic universe
; star wars; back to the future; harry potter.

do not do it.... just do not. billy! i know what you are doing. this is a great
little house you have got here.



john: "well, well, well."
james: "there, there. there, there."



there are a lot of reasons not to do this. there are 101 reasons not to do it. 1
000000 reasons, actually.
i have to go get 2 tutus from 2 different stores, too.

{{here is some stuff inside of double curly braces.}}
{here is more stuff in single curly braces.}


id121


   id121 is a step which splits longer strings of text into smaller
   pieces, or tokens. larger chunks of text can be tokenized into
   sentences, sentences can be tokenized into words, etc. further
   processing is generally performed after a piece of text has been
   appropriately tokenized. id121 is also referred to as text
   segmentation or lexical analysis. sometimes segmentation is used to
   refer to the breakdown of a large chunk of text into pieces larger than
   words (e.g. paragraphs or sentences), while id121 is reserved
   for the breakdown process which results exclusively in words.

   for our task, we will tokenize our sample text into a list of words.
   this is done using ntlk's word_tokenize() function.

   and here are our word tokens:
['title', 'goes', 'here', 'bolded', 'text', 'italicized', 'text', 'but', 'this',
 'will', 'still',
'be', 'here', '!', 'i', 'run', '.', 'he', 'ran', '.', 'she', 'is', 'running', '.
', 'will', 'they',
'stop', 'running', '?', 'i', 'talked', '.', 'she', 'was', 'talking', '.', 'they'
, 'talked', 'to', 'them',
'about', 'running', '.', 'who', 'ran', 'to', 'the', 'talking', 'runner', '?', '
  sebasti  n', ',',
'nicol  s', ',', 'alejandro', 'and', 'j  ronimo', 'are', 'going', 'tot', 'he', 'st
ore', 'tomorrow',
'morning', '!', 'something', '...', 'is', '!', 'wrong', '(', ')', 'with.', ',',
';', 'this', ':', ':',
'sentence', '.', 'i', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'this', 'anymore', '.', 'i', 'did', 'n
ot', 'know', 'them', '.',
'why', 'could', 'not', 'you', 'have', 'dinner', 'at', 'the', 'restaurant', '?',
'my', 'favorite',
'movie', 'franchises', ',', 'in', 'order', ':', 'indiana', 'jones', ';', 'star',
 'wars', ';', 'marvel',
'cinematic', 'universe', ';', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'future', ';', 'harry', 'pott
er', '.', 'do', 'not',
'do', 'it', '...', '.', 'just', 'do', 'not', '.', 'billy', '!', 'i', 'know', 'wh
at', 'you', 'are',
'doing', '.', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'great', 'little', 'house', 'you', 'have', 'got
', 'here', '.', 'john',
':', '``', 'well', ',', 'well', ',', 'well', '.', "''", 'james', ':', '``', 'the
re', ',', 'there', '.',
'there', ',', 'there', '.', "''", 'there', 'are', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'reasons', '
not', 'to', 'do', 'this',
'.', 'there', 'are', '101', 'reasons', 'not', 'to', 'do', 'it', '.', '1000000',
'reasons', ',',
'actually', '.', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'go', 'get', '2', 'tutus', 'from', '2', 'dif
ferent', 'stores', ',',
'too', '.', '22', '45', '1067', '445', '{', '{', 'here', 'is', 'some', 'stuff',
'inside', 'of', 'double',
'curly', 'braces', '.', '}', '}', '{', 'here', 'is', 'more', 'stuff', 'in', 'sin
gle', 'curly', 'braces',
'.', '}']


id172


   id172 generally refers to a series of related tasks meant to
   put all text on a level playing field: converting all text to the same
   case (upper or lower), removing punctuation, converting numbers to
   their word equivalents, and so on. id172 puts all words on
   equal footing, and allows processing to proceed uniformly.

   normalizing text can mean performing a number of tasks, but for our
   framework we will approach id172 in 3 distinct steps: (1)
   id30, (2) lemmatization, and (3) everything else. for specifics on
   what these distinct steps may be, [48]see this post.

   remember, after id121, we are no longer working at a text level,
   but now at a word level. our id172 functions, shown below,
   reflect this. function names and comments should provide the necessary
   insight into what each does.

   after calling the id172 function:
['title', 'goes', 'bolded', 'text', 'italicized', 'text', 'still', 'run', 'ran',
 'running', 'stop',
'running', 'talked', 'talking', 'talked', 'running', 'ran', 'talking', 'runner',
 'sebastian', 'nicolas',
'alejandro', 'jeronimo', 'going', 'store', 'tomorrow', 'morning', 'something', '
wrong', 'sentence',
'anymore', 'know', 'could', 'dinner', 'restaurant', 'favorite', 'movie', 'franch
ises', 'order',
'indiana', 'jones', 'marvel', 'cinematic', 'universe', 'star', 'wars', 'back', '
future', 'harry',
'potter', 'billy', 'know', 'great', 'little', 'house', 'got', 'john', 'well', 'w
ell', 'well', 'james',
'lot', 'reasons', 'one hundred and one', 'reasons', 'one million', 'reasons', 'a
ctually', 'go', 'get',
'two', 'tutus', 'two', 'different', 'stores', 'twenty-two', 'forty-five', 'one t
housand and sixty-seven',
'four hundred and forty-five', 'stuff', 'inside', 'double', 'curly', 'braces', '
stuff', 'single',
'curly', 'braces']

   calling the id30 and lemming functions are done as below:

   this results in a return of 2 new lists: one of stemmed tokens, and
   another of lemmatized tokens with respect to verbs. depending on your
   upcoming nlp task or preference, one of these may be more appropriate
   than the other. see here for a [49]discussion on lemmatization vs.
   id30.
stemmed:
 ['titl', 'goe', 'bold', 'text', 'it', 'text', 'stil', 'run', 'ran', 'run', 'sto
p', 'run', 'talk',
'talk', 'talk', 'run', 'ran', 'talk', 'run', 'sebast', 'nicola', 'alejandro', 'j
eronimo', 'going',
'stor', 'tomorrow', 'morn', 'someth', 'wrong', 'sent', 'anym', 'know', 'could',
'din', 'resta',
'favorit', 'movy', 'franch', 'ord', 'indian', 'jon', 'marvel', 'cinem', 'univers
', 'star', 'war', 'back',
'fut', 'harry', 'pot', 'bil', 'know', 'gre', 'littl', 'hous', 'got', 'john', 'we
l', 'wel', 'wel', 'jam',
'lot', 'reason', 'one hundred and on', 'reason', 'one million', 'reason', 'act',
 'go', 'get', 'two',
'tut', 'two', 'diff', 'stor', 'twenty-two', 'forty-five', 'one thousand and sixt
y-seven', 'four hundred
and forty-five', 'stuff', 'insid', 'doubl', 'cur', 'brac', 'stuff', 'singl', 'cu
r', 'brac']

lemmatized:
 ['title', 'go', 'bolded', 'text', 'italicize', 'text', 'still', 'run', 'run', '
run', 'stop', 'run',
'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'run', 'run', 'talk', 'runner', 'sebastian', 'nicolas',
'alejandro', 'jeronimo',
'go', 'store', 'tomorrow', 'morning', 'something', 'wrong', 'sentence', 'anymore
', 'know', 'could',
'dinner', 'restaurant', 'favorite', 'movie', 'franchise', 'order', 'indiana', 'j
ones', 'marvel',
'cinematic', 'universe', 'star', 'war', 'back', 'future', 'harry', 'potter', 'bi
lly', 'know', 'great',
'little', 'house', 'get', 'john', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'jam', 'lot', 'reason'
, 'one hundred and one',
'reason', 'one million', 'reason', 'actually', 'go', 'get', 'two', 'tutus', 'two
', 'different', 'store',
'twenty-two', 'forty-five', 'one thousand and sixty-seven', 'four hundred and fo
rty-five', 'stuff',
'inside', 'double', 'curly', 'brace', 'stuff', 'single', 'curly', 'brace']

   and there you have a walkthrough of a simple text id174
   process using python on a sample piece of text. i would encourage you
   to perform these tasks on some additional texts to verify the results.
   we will use this same process to clean the text data for our next task,
   in which we will undertake some actual nlp task, as opposed to spending
   time preparing our data for such an actual task.
