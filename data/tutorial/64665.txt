gans: id3

   multiple id3 (gans) implemented in pytorch
   and tensorflow.

   [83]check out this blog post for an introduction to generative
   networks.

   [84][dcgan_mnist.gif] [85][dcgan_cifar.gif]

vanilla gans

   vanilla gans found in this project were developed based on the original
   paper [86]id3 by goodfellow et al.

   these are trained on the [87]mnist dataset, and learn to create
   hand-written digit images using a 1-dimensional vector representation
   for 2d input images.

     * [89]tensorflow notebook

   [90][vanilla_mnist_pt_raw.png] [91][vanilla_mnist_pt.png]

   mnist-like generated images before & after training.

dcgans

   deep convolutional id3 (dcgans) in this
   repository were developed based on the original paper [92]unsupervised
   representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial
   networks by radford et al.

   these are trained on the [93]cifar10 and the [94]mnist datasets. they
   use 3 dimensional representations for images (length x height x colors)
   directly for training.
