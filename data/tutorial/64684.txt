[7]ann visualizer: a python library for visualizing artificial neural
networks (ann)

   april 7, 2018, 8:09 a.m. [8]by: kirti bakshi [9]edit

   ann visualizer

   the process of being able to visualize data lies at the core of the
   skill set of any data scientist who is good at what he does. as doing
   so results in the provision of a holistic view of what all could be
   hidden in the data. and, today, with the help of advancement in the
   field of deep learning, an individual can now visualize the entire deep
   learning process or just even the [10]convolutional neural network (id98
   or convnet) that has been built.

   also, adding on to it and taking it a step further, you can as well
   visualize an [11]id158(ann) by just making the use
   of only a single line of code!

   in order to help us do so, we have ann visualizer, a visualization
   library that is used in order to work with keras. the visualization
   library makes the use of the    graphviz    library of python in order to
   create a graph that is neat and presentable of the neural network that
   is being built.

   how is it useful?

   this library can be useful in a lot of ways. for, let's say, the
   library can be made use for the purpose of teaching when an individual,
   without having to run a lot of code, want to explain how the nn looks
   like. there have been a number of previous efforts that have taken
   place in this area but with the ease of effort that it presents itself
   with and the beautifully optimized output, this is a library that is
   definitely worth.

   the library, as of now, currently only visualizes dense layers but the
   developers have indicated that very soon there might be the addition of
   convolution as well as lstm layers.

   for all those who wish to go ahead and explore this library, do keep in
   mind that this is still an unstable release and there can be chances of
   bugs, so don't let them bother you. presently, it has been tested with
   python3.5, but it should run just fine on any python3 as well!

   so, go ahead and start visualizing your ann with just a line of code,
   making the use of the    ann visualizer    python library!
