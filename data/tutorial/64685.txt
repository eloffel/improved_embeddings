   deep id23 (drl) is an exciting area of ai research,
   with potential applicability to a [96]variety of problem areas. some
   see drl as a path to artificial general intelligence, or agi, because
   of how it mirrors human learning by exploring and receiving feedback
   from environments. recent successes of drl agents besting human video
   game players, the well-publicized defeat of a go grandmaster at the
   hands of deepmind   s alphago, and demonstrations of bipedal agents
   learning to walk in simulation have all contributed to the general
   sense of enthusiasm about the field.

   unlike supervised machine learning, which trains models based on
   known-correct answers, in id23, researchers train the
   model by having an agent interact with an environment. when the agent   s
   actions produce desired results, it gets positive feedback. for
   example, the agent gets a reward for scoring a point or winning a game.
   put simply, researchers reinforce the agent   s good behaviors.


   one of the key challenges in applying drl to non-trivial problems is in
   constructing a reward function that encourages desired behaviors
   without undesirable side effects. when you get this wrong, all kinds of
   bad things can happen, including cheating behaviors. (think of
   rewarding a robot maid on some visual measure of room cleanliness, just
   to teach the bot to sweep dirt under the furniture.)

   it might be worth noting here that while deep id23    
      deep    referring to the fact that the underlying model is a deep neural
   network     is still a relatively new field, id23 has
   been around since the 1970s or earlier, depending on how you count. as
   andrej karpathy points out in his [97]2016 blog post, pivotal drl
   research such as the alphago paper and the atari deep id24 paper
   are based on algorithms that have been around for a while, but with
   deep learning swapped in instead of other ways to approximate
   functions. their use of deep learning is of course enabled by the
   explosion in inexpensive compute power we   ve seen over the past 20+
   years.

   the promise of drl, along with google   s 2014 acquisition of deepmind
   for $500 million, has led to a number of startups hoping to capitalize
   on this technology. i   ve [98]interviewed bonsai founder mark hammond
   for the this week in machine learning & ai podcast (disclosure: bonsai
   is a client of mine). that company offers a development platform for
   applying deep id23 to a variety of industrial use
   cases. i [99]spoke with university of california at berkeley   s pieter
   abbeel on the topic as well. he   s since founded embodied intelligence,
   a still-stealthy startup looking to apply vr and drl to robotics.

   osaro, backed by jerry yang, peter thiel, sean parker, and other
   boldface-named investors, is also looking to apply drl in the
   industrial space. meanwhile, pit.ai is seeking to best traditional
   hedge funds by applying it to algorithmic trading, and deepvu is
   addressing the challenge of managing complex enterprise supply chains.

   as a result of increased interest in drl, we   ve also seen the creation
   of new open source toolkits and environments for training drl agents.
   most of these frameworks are essentially special-purpose simulation
   tools or interfaces thereto. here are some of the ones i   m tracking.

openai gym

   [100]openai gym is a popular toolkit for developing and comparing
   id23 models. its simulator interface supports a
   variety of environments, including classic atari games as well as
   robotics and physics simulators like mujoco and the darpa-funded
   gazebo. like other drl toolkits, it offers apis to feed observations
   and rewards back to agents.

deepmind lab

   [101]deepmind lab is a 3d learning environment based on the quake iii
   first-person shooter video game, offering up navigation and
   puzzle-solving tasks for learning agents. deepmind recently added
   dmlab-30, a collection of new levels, and introduced its new
   [102]impala distributed agent training architecture.

psychlab

   another deepmind toolkit, open-sourced earlier this year, [103]psychlab
   extends deepmind lab to support cognitive psychology experiments like
   searching an array of items for a specific target or detecting changes
   in an array of items. researchers can then compare the performance of
   human and ai agents on these tasks.

house3d

   a collaboration between uc berkeley and facebook ai researchers,
   [104]house3d offers over 45,000 simulated indoor scenes with realistic
   room and furniture layouts. the primary task covered in the paper that
   introduced house3d was    concept-driven navigation,    such as training an
   agent to navigate to a room in a house given only a high-level
   descriptor like    dining room.   

unity machine learning agents

   under the stewardship of vice president of ai and ml [105]danny lange,
   game engine developer unity is making an effort to incorporate
   cutting-edge ai technology into its platform. [106]unity machine
   learning agents, released in september 2017, is an open source unity
   plugin that enables games and simulations running on the platform to
   serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

ray

   while the other tools listed here focus on drl training environments,
   ray is more about the infrastructure of drl at scale. developed by
   [107]ion stoica and his team at the berkeley riselab, ray is a
   framework for efficiently running python code on clusters and large
   multi-core machines, specifically targeted at providing a low-latency
   distributed execution framework for id23.

   the advent of all these tools and platforms will make drl more
   accessible to developers and researchers. they   ll need all the help
   they can get, though, because deep id23 can be
   challenging to put into practice. a recent critique by google engineer
   alex irpan, in his provocatively titled article    [108]deep
   id23 doesn   t work yet,    explains why. irpan cited the
   large amount of data required by drl, the fact that most approaches to
   drl don   t take advantage of prior knowledge about the systems and
   environments involved, and the aforementioned difficulty in coming up
   with an effective reward function, among other issues.

   i expect deep id23 to continue to be a hot topic in
   the ai field, from both the research and applied perspectives, for some
   time. it has shown great promise at handling complex, multifaceted, and
   sequential decision-making problems, which makes it useful not just for
   industrial systems and gaming, but in fields as varied as marketing,
   advertising, finance, education, and even data science itself.
