 supporting rapid prototyping with a deep learning nlp toolkit   [110]tweet

   pytorch-nlp, or torchnlp for short, is a library of neural network
   layers, text processing modules and datasets designed to accelerate
   natural language processing (nlp) research.

   join our community, add datasets and neural network layers! chat with
   us on [111]gitter and join the [112]google group, we're eager to
   collaborate with you.

installation

   make sure you have python 3.6+ and pytorch 1.0+. you can then install
   pytorch-nlp using pip:
pip install pytorch-nlp

   or to install the latest code via:
pip install git+https://github.com/petrochukm/pytorch-nlp.git

docs     

   the complete documentation for pytorch-nlp is available via [119]our
   readthedocs website.

basics

   add pytorch-nlp to your project by following one of the common use
   cases:

load a [120]dataset

   load the imdb dataset, for example:
from torchnlp.datasets import imdb_dataset

# load the imdb training dataset
train = imdb_dataset(train=true)
train[0]  # returns: {'text': 'for a movie that gets..', 'sentiment': 'pos'}

apply [121]neural networks layers

   for example, from the neural network package, apply state-of-the-art
   lockeddropout:
import torch
from torchnlp.nn import lockeddropout

input_ = torch.randn(6, 3, 10)
dropout = lockeddropout(0.5)

# apply a lockeddropout to `input_`
dropout(input_) # returns: torch.floattensor (6x3x10)

[122]encode text

   tokenize and encode text as a tensor. for example, a whitespaceencoder
   breaks text into terms whenever it encounters a whitespace character.
from torchnlp.encoders.text import whitespaceencoder

# create a `whitespaceencoder` with a corpus of text
encoder = whitespaceencoder(["now this ain't funny", "so don't you dare laugh"])

# encode and decode phrases
encoder.encode("this ain't funny.") # returns: torch.tensor([6, 7, 1])
encoder.decode(encoder.encode("this ain't funny.")) # returns: "this ain't funny
."

load [123]word vectors

   for example, load fasttext, state-of-the-art english word vectors:
from torchnlp.word_to_vector import fasttext

vectors = fasttext()
# load vectors for any word as a `torch.floattensor`
vectors['hello']  # returns: [torch.floattensor of size 100]

compute [124]metrics

   finally, compute common metrics such as the id7 score.
from torchnlp.metrics import get_moses_multi_id7

hypotheses = ["the brown fox jumps over the dog    "]
references = ["the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog    "]

# compute id7 score with the official id7 perl script
get_moses_multi_id7(hypotheses, references, lowercase=true)  # returns: 47.9

help    

   maybe looking at longer examples may help you at [125]examples/.

   chat

contributing

   we've released pytorch-nlp because we found a lack of basic toolkits
   for nlp in pytorch. we hope that other organizations can benefit from
   the project. we are thankful for any contributions from the community.

contributing guide

   read our [127]contributing guide to learn about our development
   process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and
   test your changes to pytorch-nlp.

related work

[128]torchtext

   torchtext and pytorch-nlp differ in the architecture and feature set;
   otherwise, they are similar. torchtext and pytorch-nlp provide
   pre-trained word vectors, datasets, iterators and text encoders.
   pytorch-nlp also provides neural network modules and metrics. from an
   architecture standpoint, torchtext is object orientated with external
   coupling while pytorch-nlp is object orientated with low coupling.

[129]allennlp

   allennlp is designed to be a platform for research. pytorch-nlp is
   designed to be a lightweight toolkit.
