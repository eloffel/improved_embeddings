   background
   id17 (mrc) enables computers to read, process,
   and understand natural language text, considered to be one of the core
   abilities of artificial intelligence. it is of great value for
   next-generation search engines and intelligent agent products, and has
   received wide attention across academia and industry in recent years.
   with the intention of advancing reading comprehension technology, 2018
   nlp challenge on id17 is organized jointly by
    [3]chinese information processing society of china(cips), [4]china
   computer federation(ccf), and [5]baidu inc.. the challenge provides a
   large-scale, open-domain, application-oriented chinese mrc dataset and
   a platform for research and academic exchanges on mrc, nlu and other ai
   technologies and applications. the workshop and award ceremony of the
   challenge will be held at the third  [6]language & intelligence summit.
   all researchers and developers are welcomed.
   about the challenge
   1. task description
   given a question "q", and a set of documentsd = d1, d2, ..., dn   the
   participating mrc system is expected to output an answer "a" that best
   answers "q" based to the evidences in d.
   2. dataset
   the dataset contains 300k questions sampled from real anonymized user
   queries from baidu search. each question has 5 corresponding evidence
   documents and human generated answers. the dataset is divided into a
   training set (270k questions), a development set (10k questions) and a
   test set (20k questions). a subset of 200k questions have already been
   released in [7]dureader dataset, available for free [8]download and
   using for pre-training/validation. competition participants will get
   the new data of 100k questions after the registration deadline.
   3. id74
   [9]rough-l and [10]id74 are adopted as the basic id74 to
   measure the performance of participating systems, with the former as
   the main measurement. some minor modifications are made over the
   original id8-l and id74 metrics to better measure the performance of
   yes-no and entity type questions.
   *please refer to the specification enclosed in the dataset package for
   details.
