scanner semantic parser

introduction

   the input is a sentence, while the output is a tree-structured logical
   form, for which we use s-expression to represent. for example:
     * input: which college did obama go to?
     * output: (and (type university) (education barackobama))

training data

   the training data consites of either sentences paired with logical
   forms (code in the main folder, e.g. for geoquery), or sentences paired
   with answers (code in the kb folder or table folder, e.g., for webqa,
   graphqa and spades)

domains

   knowledge base (kb_simple) or table domain (table). instructions for
   generating domain-specific input data will be uploaded.
