bnf grammars for sql-92, sql-99 and sql-2003

   this repository contains the bnf (backus-naur form) grammars for three
   versions of standard sql     sql-92, sql-99 and sql-2003.

   you should be able to find a version of this site with 'active html'
   at:
     * [100]https://ronsavage.github.io/sql/

   it may not be the most recent release, but the technical content is
   mostly valid. the download link is not functional     you can obtain the
   material for the latest release from
   [101]https://github.com/ronsavage/sql/releases/latest.

   this project is still in transition to github. the links in this
   readme.md file lead to the pages in the github source tree. most of
   them will display the html source     not a rendered html image. there
   probably are ways around that; we're learning github as we go.

   for a long time, this material was hosted by ron savage at
   [102]http://savage.net.au/sql     many thanks, ron!     but that site now
   points to here.

   at the moment, the suggested method of operation is:
     * clone this repository to your machine     e.g. into the
       /home/somebody/sql directory
     * point your browser to file:///home/somebody/sql/index.html.

   this should give you full html access to the material. alternatively,
   you can download the latest release of this material (instead of
   cloning the repo), and then extract that into a directory and point
   your browser to the index.html file in that directory.

   yes: it is sub-optimal. yes: we'll fix it when we know how to fix it.

sql-92

   the file [103]sql-92.bnf.html is a heavily hyperlinked html version of
   the bnf grammar for sql-92 (iso/iec 9075:1992 - database language -
   sql).

   the plain text file [104]sql-92.bnf, from which it was automatically
   converted, is more useful (read legible) for reading without a browser.

sql-99

   the file [105]sql-99.bnf.html is a heavily hyperlinked html version of
   the bnf grammar for sql-99 (iso/iec 9075-2:1999 - database languages -
   sql - part 2: foundation (sql/foundation)).

   the plain text file [106]sql-99.bnf, from which it was automatically
   converted, is more useful (read legible) for reading without a browser.

sql-2003

   the file [107]sql-2003-2.bnf.html is a heavily hyperlinked html version
   of the bnf grammar for sql-2003 (iso/iec 9075-2:2003 - database
   languages - sql - part 2: foundation (sql/foundation)).

   the plain text file [108]sql-2003-2.bnf, from which it was
   automatically converted, is more useful (read legible) for reading
   without a browser.

   there is a separate file [109]sql-2003-1.bnf.html for the information
   from iso/iec 9075-1:2003 - database languages - sql - part 1: framework
   (sql/framework).

   it was automatically converted from the plain text file
   [110]sql-2003-1.bnf, which is more useful (read legible) for reading
   without a browser.

   also available:

     [111]sql 2003 core features

     [112]sql 2003 non-core features

informix outer join syntax

   the file [113]outer-joins.html is an explanation of the non-standar
   informix outer join syntax and semantics.

conversion tools

   the plain text was converted to html by the perl script [114]bnf2html
   which you may use if you wish. the bnf2html script also uses the c
   program webcode version 1.09 which you can download as a [115]gzipped
   tar file.

   see also [116]bnf2yacc, an experimental script to convert bnf into an
   outline yacc grammar. the generated grammar typically includes some
   unacceptable tokens, such as %token 0, that should be handled by the
   lexical analyzer rather than the grammar. the sql standard includes
   such rules as grammar rules; consequently, you won't get a clean yacc
   grammar from the sql bnf files.

   (the perl scripts should normally be renamed after downloading.)
