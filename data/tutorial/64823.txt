   i know this must be your first reaction after reading the title.

   iframe: [18]/media/e4b0c02478bc8136b169935698b1dc2d?postid=be1312df9b4a

   but as you go along this article my fellow ai community of developers,
   practitioners and enthusiast you   ll experience a new way of designing,
   deploying and training deep learning models without programming,
   through a software platform which is free, free, free !!!! (yes you
   read it right)

   ever since i started my journey in the field of deep learning, i used
   to see lots of questions on [19]quora such as    what if i   m not a good
   programmer, can i still get started in deep learning or find solutions
   to complex problems   , or    can i learn ai (artificial intelligence),
   deep learning without programming    and most of the time the answer used
   to ended up into a big bold    no   . well know if someone ask me the same
   question i have an answer which is    yes    it is possible through the
   easiest deep learning platform the    [20]deep learning studio    created
   by a company named [21]deep cognition .
   [1*bd6h0mzd3s87cgshym2saa.png]

   deep learning studio is the first robust deep learning platform
   available in two version (cloud and desktop) with a visual interface in
   production since january 2017. the platform provides a comprehensive
   solution to data ingestion, model development, training, deployment and
   management. by using deep learning studio any one starting from a
   developer to an engineer or a researcher will acquire the ability to
   quickly develop and deploy deep learning solutions through robust
   integration with tensorflow, mxnet and keras.
     __________________________________________________________________

   alright, now after introducing you all to the deep learning studio,
   it   s time to demonstrate how this software platform actually work. as
   being said    you should practice what you preach    so with the same
   intent [22]mandeep kumar, the ceo and co-founder at deep cognition,
   inc. gave a practical exhibition of using deep learning studio to apply
   3[23]d convolutional neural network over a ct scan dataset through a
   [24]kaggle post, the step by step implementation of which is presented
   below.

step-1: get access

   sign up and get access to deep learning studio at
   [25]deepcognition - become an ai-powered organization today
   design, train, and deploy deep learning models without coding. deep
   learning studio simplifies and accelerates the   deepcognition.ai

   [super important point: once you   ll register for a free account on deep
   cognition website you   ll receive 2 hours of free nvidia gpu training
   time too, now this is what i call extremely fascinating.]

step-2: enable cached dataset

   then he enable cached dataset in his account by uploading two small
   files that he downloaded from his kaggle account, uploading of these
   files insured that he had access to kaggle dataset (follow markers 1 to
   4)
   [0*jql3mvsy9gpu3n5z.jpg]
   figure 1

step-3: create and open a new project

   then, he built a new project by going to project menu on left and
   clicking on + button.
   [0*94ht_wgxwidguf3d.jpg]
   figure 2

   he gave a name and description to his project, and then opened the
   project by clicking on box+arrow icon on project bar.
   [0*_zdnkwx4whgmjvuq.jpg]
   figure 3

step-4: select dataset and do training/validation set division

   he did training with 1200 samples and he used 197 samples for
   validation for this example.
   [0*s4ifmfs-6fasuvn7.jpg]
   figure 4

step-5: build model

   after selecting dataset he clicked on    model    tab and started building
   model as shown below by dragging layers from left menu bar to the
   canvas and connecting these layer blocks.
   [0*dzprp9atyqw3ujny.jpg]
   figure 5

   the code block shown below, reflects the actual generated source code
   for the entire model which was built by [26]mandeep kumar using deep
   learning studio and can be seen in the figure 5.
def get_model():
    input_1 = input(shape=(256, 512, 512, 1))
    maxpooling3d_27 = maxpooling3d(pool_size= (1,3,3))(input_1)
    convolution3d_1 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 4,nb_filter= 10,activation= 're
lu' ,kernel_dim3= 4,kernel_dim2= 4)(maxpooling3d_27)
    convolution3d_7 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 4,nb_filter= 10,activation= 're
lu' ,kernel_dim3= 4,kernel_dim2= 4)(convolution3d_1)
    batchid172_28 = batchid172()(convolution3d_7)
    maxpooling3d_12 = maxpooling3d(pool_size= (2,2,2))(batchid172_28)
    spatialdropout3d_1 = spatialdropout3d(p= 0.5)(maxpooling3d_12)
    convolution3d_9 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 2,nb_filter= 20,activation= 're
lu' ,kernel_dim3= 2,kernel_dim2= 2)(spatialdropout3d_1)
    convolution3d_11 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 2,nb_filter= 20,activation= 'r
elu' ,kernel_dim3= 2,kernel_dim2= 2)(convolution3d_9)
    batchid172_9 = batchid172()(convolution3d_11)
    maxpooling3d_14 = maxpooling3d(pool_size= (2,2,2))(batchid172_9)
    spatialdropout3d_4 = spatialdropout3d(p= 0.5)(maxpooling3d_14)
    convolution3d_12 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 2,nb_filter= 40,activation= 'r
elu' ,kernel_dim3= 2,kernel_dim2= 2)(spatialdropout3d_4)
    convolution3d_13 = convolution3d(kernel_dim1= 2,nb_filter= 40,activation= 'r
elu' ,kernel_dim3= 2,kernel_dim2= 2)(convolution3d_12)
    maxpooling3d_23 = maxpooling3d(pool_size= (2,2,2))(convolution3d_13)
    batchid172_23 = batchid172()(maxpooling3d_23)
    spatialdropout3d_5 = spatialdropout3d(p= 0.5)(batchid172_23)
    globalmaxpooling3d_1 = globalmaxpooling3d()(spatialdropout3d_5)
    dense_1 = dense(activation= 'relu' ,output_dim= 10)(globalmaxpooling3d_1)
    dropout_14 = dropout(p= 0.3)(dense_1)
    dense_6 = dense(activation= 'relu' ,output_dim= 10)(dropout_14)
    dense_2 = dense(activation= 'softmax' ,output_dim= 2)(dense_6)
    return model([input_1],[dense_2])

     therefore my fellow readers now you understood how using a simple
     drag and drop gui in deep learning studio software platform you can
     too construct a model without programming, well that   s not all
     training and tuning of    hyperparameters    can be accomplished too
     without programming, just see the next steps below and get amazed
     with your own eyes .

step-6: training and results

   then he clicked on    hyperparameters    tab and made sure batch size is
   set to 1. this is important because anything bigger will not fit gpus
   memory and training will fail.
   [0*jttllslg5c6tnhrn.jpg]
   figure 6

   finally he moved to    training    tab. selected gpu-k80 as instance and
   click on    start instance   . once instance started, he clicked on    start
   training   . note that training is going to be very slow because of sheer
   size of dataset and computations needed.

   after trying out 2 epochs he was able to get loss of about 0.58 on
   validation set.
   [0*tznsyhfzi_3r22gn.jpg]
   figure 7

   before making a model, he also did some pre-processing on the ct scan
   dataset, so the intuition about the model he built and full information
   about the pre-processing steps he took can be found [27]here.

   so, this mark the end of my journey in making you aware of this new
   software platform in the market which simplifies and accelerates the
   process of deep learning through a drag and drop gui and allow you all
   to design, train and deploy deep learning model with no coding
   involved. but don   t forget to have a look over the reference section
   which is filled with other exciting resources for you to cherish.
