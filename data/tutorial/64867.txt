scitail

   this released code is for our acl2018 paper "end-task oriented textual
   entailment via deep explorations of inter-sentence interactions". it
   gets stoa performance in a id123 benchmark -- 82.1%
   accuracy on scitail dataset. we release the code and the pretrained
   model

   to reproduce the result, just run the "train_scitail_deiste_model.py"
   file. it needs id97 embeddings. we provide the pretrained model so
   that reloading it can reproduce the paper numbers.
