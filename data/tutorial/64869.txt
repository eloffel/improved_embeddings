   for people who are new or still didn   t use it      [18]   google colab is
   jupyter service with dedicated server(with gpu) that you get free for
   about 12 hours(after it you need to reinitialize it). so it   s good
   place where you can test your python scripts, or use it while you are
   learning machine learning & data science.

   in my work i often use [19]colab, for two reason. first it gives free
   computation power and even free nvidia tesla k80. second it   s very
   convenient way of sharing some ml & ds examples to people (which i use
   in every article on medium).

   here i gathered useful snippets that i use every day, that makes my
   life easier :)

connecting google drive to your instance

# create drive folder
!mkdir -p drive
!apt-get install -y -qq software-properties-common python-software-properties mo
dule-init-tools
!add-apt-repository -y ppa:alessandro-strada/ppa 2>&1 > /dev/null
!apt-get update -qq 2>&1 > /dev/null
!apt-get -y install -qq google-drive-ocamlfuse fuse
# authorize instance to use google drive
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
from oauth2client.client import googlecredentials
creds = googlecredentials.get_application_default()
import getpass
!google-drive-ocamlfuse -headless -id={creds.client_id} -secret={creds.client_se
cret} < /dev/null 2>&1 | grep url
vcode = getpass.getpass()
!echo {vcode} | google-drive-ocamlfuse -headless -id={creds.client_id} -secret={
creds.client_secret}
# connect drive to folder
!google-drive-ocamlfuse drive

   from new release all above can be replaced with
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('./drive')

   don   t forget to copy all intensive reading data from drive to instance
   to make access faster.

upload/download files from instance

from google.colab import files
def upload(path):
    uploaded = files.upload()
    with open(path,   wb   ) as fp:
        fp.write(uploaded[uploaded.keys()[0]])

def download(path):
    files.download(path)

use facets

   [1*oa7kgbqwvy31cmv7mcalhg.png]

   source: [20]https://github.com/pair-code/facets

   iframe: [21]/media/c97518469622bd3c1e801909a9cbc695?postid=d976d6b3e6de

   then just write (example):
facetsoverview(df_train, df_test)
facetsdive(df_train.head(500))

running tensorboard on instance

   iframe: [22]/media/e62e69513ee5e7af8e7431e08d4d34c7?postid=d976d6b3e6de

   then just open url that will be printed and that   s all.

connecting to instance over ssh

   iframe: [23]/media/fcf3951edfb69e1a55a5afa5ac7c4e5b?postid=d976d6b3e6de

   all your data is in /content/ directory.

   right now free ngrok account doesn   t support 2 simultaneous tunnels, so
   if you are using one for tensorboard, you will have to kill it.
   you can do it with command:
!kill $(ps aux | grep './ngrok' | awk '{print $2}')

downloading/uploading data to kaggle

   for this purpose you just need to use kaggle-api library
   [24]https://github.com/kaggle/kaggle-api
