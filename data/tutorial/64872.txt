25 open datasets for deep learning every data scientist must work with

   [96]pranav dar, march 29, 2018

introduction

   the key to getting better at deep learning (or most fields in life) is
   practice. practice on a variety of problems     from image processing to
   id103. each of these problem has it   s own unique nuance
   and approach.

   but where can you get this data? a lot of research papers you see these
   days use proprietary datasets that are usually not released to the
   general public. this becomes a problem, if you want to learn and apply
   your newly acquired skills.

   if you have faced this problem, we have a solution for you. we have
   curated a list of openly available datasets for your perusal.

   in this article, we have listed a collection of high quality datasets
   that every deep learning enthusiast should work on to apply and improve
   their skillset. working on these datasets will make you a better data
   scientist and the amount of learning you will have will be invaluable
   in your career. we have also included papers with state-of-the-art
   (sota) results for you to go through and improve your models.


how to use these datasets?

   first things first     these datasets are huge in size! so make sure you
   have a fast internet connection with no / very high limit on the amount
   of data you can download.

   there are numerous ways how you can use these datasets. you can use
   them to apply various deep learning techniques. you can use them to
   hone your skills, understand how to identify and structure each
   problem, think of unique use cases and publish your findings for
   everyone to see!

   the datasets are divided into three categories     image processing,
   natural language processing, and audio/speech processing.

   let   s dive into it!

       a machine translation researcher here,
       regarding the machine translation data set you present: you clearly
       have not researched this well. you link randomly to the wmt machine
       translation shared task of 2011, although there are 7 newer
       editions, including 2018 ([198]http://statmt.org/wmt18/index.html).
       also, the    attention is all you need    paper from google is _not_
       state of the art on the 2011 data you are describing, the paper
       only has results from the 2014 shared task), and only from english
       to german, and english to french.
       by the way, the data sets are of course not called    machine
       translation of european languages   . wmt data is comprised of
       several individual data sets, such as europarl, jrc aquis, news
       commentary or opensubtitles.
       please do your homework.

            hi mathias,
            thanks for taking the time to read through the article and
            giving us your suggestions! we have updated the link for the
            machine translation set accordingly. since the latest version
            has incorporated a few other languages as well, we have
            updated the name to reflect that.

                 hi pranav
                 thanks for your reply. in retrospect, i do not like the
                 condescending tone of my comment, my apologies. i am
                 mainly taking issue because of the strong title (   data
                 every data scientist must work with   ).
                 let me try to explain things a bit more. the theme of
                 your post is to present individual data sets, say, the
                 mnist digits. but for machine translation, people usually
                 aggregate and blend different individual data sets. your
                 section about machine translation is misleading in that
                 it suggests there is a self-contained data set called
                    machine translation of various languages   .
                 an actual data set for machine translation you could
                 mention is opensubtitles:
                 [203]http://opus.nlpl.eu/opensubtitles.php. or europarl:
                 [204]http://www.statmt.org/europarl/. or the english
                 gigaword corpus (a monolingual resource):
                 [205]https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2011t07. or a very
                 recent resource, paracrawl:
