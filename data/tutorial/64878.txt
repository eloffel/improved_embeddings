   neuralcoref: coreference resolution in spacy with neural networks.

   neuralcoref is a pipeline extension for spacy 2.0 that annotates and
   resolves coreference clusters using a neural network. neuralcoref is
   production-ready, integrated in spacy's nlp pipeline and easily
   extensible to new training datasets.

   for a brief introduction to coreference resolution and neuralcoref,
   please refer to our [100]blog post. neuralcoref is written in
   python/cython and comes with pre-trained statistical models for
   english. it can be trained in other languages. neuralcoref is
   accompanied by a visualization client [101]neuralcoref-viz, a web
   interface powered by a rest server that can be [102]tried online.
   neuralcoref is released under the mit license.

       version 3.0 out now! 100x faster and tightly integrated in spacy
   pipeline.
   [103]current release version [104]spacy [105]travis-ci [106]neuralcoref
   online demo

install neuralcoref

as a pre-trained spacy model

   this is the easiest way to install neuralcoref if you don't need to
   train the model on a new language or dataset.
   operating system macos / os x, linux, windows (cygwin, mingw, visual
   studio)
   python version cpython 2.7, 3.4+. only 64 bit.

   neuralcoref is currently available in english with three models of
   increasing accuracy that mirror [107]spacy english models. the larger
   the model, the higher the accuracy:
   model name model_url size description
   en_coref_sm [108]en_coref_sm 78 mo a small english model based on spacy
   [109]en_core_web_sm-2.0.0
   en_coref_md [110]en_coref_md 161 mo [recommended] a medium english
   model based on spacy [111]en_core_web_md-2.0.0
   en_coref_lg [112]en_coref_lg 893 mo a large english model based on
   spacy [113]en_core_web_lg-2.0.0

   to install a model, copy the model_url of the model you are interested
   in from the above table and type:
pip install model_url

   when using pip it is generally recommended to install packages in a
   virtual environment to avoid modifying system state:
venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install model_url

install neuralcoref from source

   clone the repo and install using pip.
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref.git
cd neuralcoref
pip install -e .

usage

loading neuralcoref

   neuralcoref is integrated as a spacy pipeline extension .

   to load neuralcoref, simply load the model you dowloaded above using
   spacy.load() with the model's name (e.g. en_coref_md) and process your
   text [114]as usual with spacy.

   neuralcoref will resolve the coreferences and annotate them as
   [115]extension attributes in the spacy doc, span and token objects
   under the ._. dictionary.

   here is a simple example before we dive in greater details.
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_coref_md')
doc = nlp(u'my sister has a dog. she loves him.')

doc._.has_coref
doc._.coref_clusters

   you can also import neuralcoref model directly and call its load()
   method:
import en_coref_md

nlp = en_coref_md.load()
doc = nlp(u'my sister has a dog. she loves him.')

doc._.has_coref
doc._.coref_clusters

doc, span and token extension attributes

   attribute type description
   doc._.has_coref boolean has any coreference has been resolved in the
   doc
   doc._.coref_clusters list of cluster all the clusters of corefering
   mentions in the doc
   doc._.coref_resolved unicode unicode representation of the doc where
   each corefering mention is replaced by the main mention in the
   associated cluster.
   span._.is_coref boolean whether the span has at least one corefering
   mention
   span._.coref_cluster cluster cluster of mentions that corefer with the
   span
   token._.in_coref boolean whether the token is inside at least one
   corefering mention
   token._.coref_clusters list of cluster all the clusters of corefering
   mentions that contains the token

the cluster class

   the cluster class is a small container for a cluster of mentions.

   a cluster contains 3 attributes:
   attribute type description
   cluster.i int index of the cluster in the doc
   cluster.main span span of the most representative mention in the
   cluster
   cluster.mentions list of span all the mentions in the cluster

   the cluster class also implements a few python class methods to
   simplify the navigation inside a cluster:
   method              output      description
   cluster.__getitem__ return span access a mention in the cluster
   cluster.__iter__    yields span iterate over mentions in the cluster
   cluster.__len__     return int  number of mentions in the cluster

examples

   here are a few examples on how you can navigate the coreference cluster
   chains and display clusters and mentions.
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_coref_sm')
doc = nlp(u'my sister has a dog. she loves him')

doc._.coref_clusters
doc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions
doc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1]
doc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1]._.coref_cluster.main

token = doc[-1]
token._.in_coref
token._.coref_clusters

span = doc[-1:]
span._.is_coref
span._.coref_cluster.main
span._.coref_cluster.main._.coref_cluster

   important: neuralcoref mentions are spacy [116]span objects which means
   you can access all the usual [117]span attributes like span.start
   (index of the first token of the span in the document), span.end (index
   of the first token after the span in the document), etc...

   ex: doc._.coref_clusters[1].mentions[-1].start will give you the index
   of the first token of the last mention of the second coreference
   cluster in the document.

using neuralcoref as a server

   a simple example of server script for integrating neuralcoref in a rest
   api is provided as an example in [118]examples/server.py.

   there are many other ways you can manage and deploy neuralcoref. some
   examples can be found in [119]spacy universe.

re-train the model / extend to another language

   if you want to retrain the model or train it on another language, see
   our detailed [120]training instructions as well as our [121]detailed
   blog post

   the training code will soon benefit from the same cython refactoring
   than the id136 code.
