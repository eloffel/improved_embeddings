peerread

   data and code for [76]"a dataset of peer reviews (peerread):
   collection, insights and nlp applications" by dongyeop kang, waleed
   ammar, bhavana dalvi, madeleine van zuylen, sebastian kohlmeier, eduard
   hovy and roy schwartz, naacl 2018

the peerread dataset

   pearread is a dataset of scientific peer reviews available to help
   researchers study this important artifact. the dataset consists of over
   14k paper drafts and the corresponding accept/reject decisions in
   top-tier venues including acl, nips and iclr, as well as over 10k
   textual peer reviews written by experts for a subset of the papers.

   we structured the dataset into sections each corresponding to a venue
   or an arxiv category, e.g., [77]./data/acl_2017 and
   [78]./data/arxiv.cs.cl_2007-2017. each section is further split into
   the train/dev/test splits (same splits used in the paper). due to
   licensing constraints, we provide instructions for downloading the data
   for some sections instead of including it in this repository, e.g.,
   [79]./data/nips_2013-2017/readme.md.

models

   in order to experiment with (and hopefully improve) our models for
   aspect prediction and for predicting whether a paper will be accepted,
   see [80]./code/readme.md.

setup configuration

   run ./setup.sh at the root of this repository to install dependencies
   and download some of the larger data files not included in this repo.

acknowledgement

     * we use some of the code in [81]canaanshen for web crawling.
     * we use some of the code in [82]jiegzhan for our aspect prediction
       experiments.
     * this work would not have been possible without the efforts of rich
       gerber and paolo gai (developers of the [83]softconf.com conference
       management system), stefan riezler, yoav goldberg (chairs of conll
       2016), min-yen kan, regina barzilay (chairs of acl 2017) for
       allowing authors and reviewers to opt-in for this dataset during
       the official review process.
     * we thank the [84]openreview.net, [85]arxiv.org and
       [86]semanticscholar.org teams for their commitment to promoting
       transparency and openness in scientific communication.
