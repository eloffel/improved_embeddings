an introduction to id91 and different methods of id91

   [97]saurav kaushik, november 3, 2016

introduction

   have you come across a situation when a chief marketing officer of a
   company tells you        help me understand our customers better so that we
   can market our products to them in a better manner!   

   i did and the analyst in me was completely clueless what to do! i was
   used to getting specific problems, where there is an outcome to be
   predicted for various set of conditions. but i had no clue what to do
   in this case. if the person would have asked me to calculate life time
   value (ltv) or propensity of cross-sell, i wouldn   t have blinked. but
   this question looked very broad to me.

   this is usually the first reaction when you come across an
   [98]unsupervised learning problem for the first time! you are not
   looking for specific insights for a phenomena, but what you are looking
   for are structures with in data with out them being tied down to a
   specific outcome.

   the method of identifying similar groups of data in a dataset is called
   id91. it is one of the most popular techniques in [99]data
   science. entities in each group are comparatively more similar to
   entities of that group than those of the other groups. in this article,
   i will be taking you through the types of id91, different
   id91 algorithms and a comparison between two of the most commonly
   used id91 methods.

   let   s get started.

    6. difference between id116 and hierarchical id91

    8. improving supervised learning algorithms with id91


1. overview

   id91 is the task of dividing the population or data points into a
   number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more
   similar to other data points in the same group than those in other
   groups. in simple words, the aim is to segregate groups with similar
   traits and assign them into clusters.

   let   s understand this with an example. suppose, you are the head of a
   rental store and wish to understand preferences of your costumers to
   scale up your business. is it possible for you to look at details of
   each costumer and devise a unique business strategy for each one of
   them? definitely not. but, what you can do is to cluster all of your
   costumers into say 10 groups based on their purchasing habits and use a
   separate strategy for costumers in each of these 10 groups. and this is
   what we call id91.

   now, that we understand what is id91. let   s take a look at the
   types of id91.


2. types of id91

   broadly speaking, id91 can be divided into two subgroups :
     * hard id91: in hard id91, each data point either belongs
       to a cluster completely or not. for example, in the above example
       each customer is put into one group out of the 10 groups.
     * soft id91: in soft id91, instead of putting each data
       point into a separate cluster, a id203 or likelihood of that
       data point to be in those clusters is assigned. for example, from
       the above scenario each costumer is assigned a id203 to be in
       either of 10 clusters of the retail store.


3. types of id91 algorithms

   since the task of id91 is subjective, the means that can be used
   for achieving this goal are plenty. every methodology follows a
   different set of rules for defining the    similarity    among data points.
   in fact, there are more than 100 id91 algorithms known. but few
   of the algorithms are used popularly, let   s look at them in detail:
     * connectivity models: as the name suggests, these models are based
       on the notion that the data points closer in data space exhibit
       more similarity to each other than the data points lying farther
       away. these models can follow two approaches. in the first
       approach, they start with classifying all data points into separate
       clusters & then aggregating them as the distance decreases. in the
       second approach, all data points are classified as a single cluster
       and then partitioned as the distance increases. also, the choice of
       distance function is subjective. these models are very easy to
       interpret but lacks scalability for handling big datasets. examples
       of these models are hierarchical id91 algorithm and its
       variants.

     * centroid models: these are iterative id91 algorithms in which
       the notion of similarity is derived by the closeness of a data
       point to the centroid of the clusters. id116 id91 algorithm
       is a popular algorithm that falls into this category. in these
       models, the no. of clusters required at the end have to be
       mentioned beforehand, which makes it important to have prior
       knowledge of the dataset. these models run iteratively to find the
       local optima.

     * distribution models: these id91 models are based on the
       notion of how probable is it that all data points in the cluster
       belong to the same distribution (for example: normal, gaussian).
       these models often suffer from overfitting. a popular example of
       these models is expectation-maximization algorithm which uses
       multivariate normal distributions.

     * density models: these models search the data space for areas of
       varied density of data points in the data space. it isolates
       various different density regions and assign the data points within
       these regions in the same cluster. popular examples of density
       models are dbscan and optics.

   now i will be taking you through two of the most popular id91
   algorithms in detail     id116 id91 and hierarchical
   id91. let   s begin.


4. id116 id91

   id116 is an iterative id91 algorithm that aims to find local
   maxima in each iteration. this algorithm works in these 5 steps :
    1. specify the desired number of clusters k : let us choose k=2 for
       these 5 data points in 2-d space.

   [100]id91-2
    2. randomly assign each data point to a cluster : let   s assign three
       points in cluster 1 shown using red color and two points in cluster
       2 shown using grey color.

   [101]id91-2
    3. compute cluster centroids : the centroid of data points in the red
       cluster is shown using red cross and those in grey cluster using
       grey cross.

   [102]id91-3
    4. re-assign each point to the closest cluster centroid : note that
       only the data point at the bottom is assigned to the red cluster
       even though its closer to the centroid of grey cluster. thus, we
       assign that data point into grey cluster

   [103]id91-4
    5. re-compute cluster centroids : now, re-computing the centroids for
       both the clusters.

   [104]id91-5
    6. repeat steps 4 and 5 until no improvements are possible :
       similarly, we   ll repeat the 4^th and 5^th steps until we   ll reach
       global optima. when there will be no further switching of data
       points between two clusters for two successive repeats. it will
       mark the termination of the algorithm if not explicitly mentioned.


5. hierarchical id91

   hierarchical id91, as the name suggests is an algorithm that
   builds hierarchy of clusters. this algorithm starts with all the data
   points assigned to a cluster of their own. then two nearest clusters
   are merged into the same cluster. in the end, this algorithm terminates
   when there is only a single cluster left.

   the results of hierarchical id91 can be shown using dendrogram.
   the dendrogram can be interpreted as:

   [105]id91-6

   at the bottom, we start with 25 data points, each assigned to separate
   clusters. two closest clusters are then merged till we have just one
   cluster at the top. the height in the dendrogram at which two clusters
   are merged represents the distance between two clusters in the data
   space.

   the decision of the no. of clusters that can best depict different
   groups can be chosen by observing the dendrogram. the best choice of
   the no. of clusters is the no. of vertical lines in the dendrogram cut
   by a horizontal line that can transverse the maximum distance
   vertically without intersecting a cluster.

   in the above example, the best choice of no. of clusters will be 4 as
   the red horizontal line in the dendrogram below covers maximum vertical
   distance ab.

   [106]id91-7

   two important things that you should know about hierarchical id91
   are:
     * this algorithm has been implemented above using bottom up approach.
       it is also possible to follow top-down approach starting with all
       data points assigned in the same cluster and recursively performing
       splits till each data point is assigned a separate cluster.
     * the decision of merging two clusters is taken on the basis of
       closeness of these clusters. there are multiple metrics for
       deciding the closeness of two clusters :
          + euclidean distance: ||a-b||[2] =    (  (a[i]-b[i]))
          + squared euclidean distance: ||a-b||[2]^2 =   ((a[i]-b[i])^2)
          + manhattan distance: ||a-b||[1] =   |a[i]-b[i]|
          + maximum distance:||a-b||[infinity] = max[i]|a[i]-b[i]|
          + mahalanobis distance:    ((a-b)^t s^-1 (-b))   {where, s :
            covariance matrix}


6. difference between id116 and hierarchical id91

     * hierarchical id91 can   t handle big data well but id116
       id91 can. this is because the time complexity of id116 is
       linear i.e. o(n) while that of hierarchical id91 is quadratic
       i.e. o(n^2).
     * in id116 id91, since we start with random choice of
       clusters, the results produced by running the algorithm multiple
       times might differ. while results are reproducible in hierarchical
       id91.
     * id116 is found to work well when the shape of the clusters is
       hyper spherical (like circle in 2d, sphere in 3d).
     * id116 id91 requires prior knowledge of k i.e. no. of
       clusters you want to divide your data into. but, you can stop at
       whatever number of clusters you find appropriate in hierarchical
       id91 by interpreting the dendrogram


7. applications of id91

   id91 has a large no. of applications spread across various
   domains. some of the most popular applications of id91 are:
     * recommendation engines
     * market segmentation
     * social network analysis
     * search result grouping
     * medical imaging
     * image segmentation
     * anomaly detection


8. improving supervised learning algorithms with id91

   id91 is an unsupervised machine learning approach, but can it be
   used to improve the accuracy of supervised machine learning algorithms
   as well by id91 the data points into similar groups and using
   these cluster labels as independent variables in the supervised machine
   learning algorithm? let   s find out.

   let   s check out the impact of id91 on the accuracy of our model
   for the classification problem using 3000 observations with 100
   predictors of stock data to predicting whether the stock will go up or
   down using r. this dataset contains 100 independent variables from x1
   to x100 representing profile of a stock and one outcome variable y with
   two levels : 1 for rise in stock price and -1 for drop in stock price.

   the dataset is available here : [107]download

   let   s first try applying randomforest without id91.
#loading required libraries
library('randomforest')

library('metrics')

#set random seed
set.seed(101)

#loading dataset

data<-read.csv("train.csv",stringsasfactors= t)

#checking dimensions of data
dim(data)

## [1] 3000  101

#specifying outcome variable as factor


 data$y<-as.factor(data$y)

#dividing the dataset into train and test
train<-data[1:2000,]
test<-data[2001:3000,]

#applying randomforest
model_rf<-randomforest(y~.,data=train)

preds<-predict(object=model_rf,test[,-101])

table(preds)

## preds
##  -1   1
## 453 547

#checking accuracy

auc(preds,test$y)

## [1] 0.4522703

   so, the accuracy we get is 0.45. now let   s create five clusters based
   on values of independent variables using id116 id91 and reapply
   randomforest.
#combing test and train

all<-rbind(train,test)

#creating 5 clusters using k- means id91

cluster <- kmeans(all[,-101], 5)

#adding clusters as independent variable to the dataset.
all$cluster<-as.factor(cluster$cluster)

#dividing the dataset into train and test
train<-all[1:2000,]
test<-all[2001:3000,]

#applying randomforest
model_rf<-randomforest(y~.,data=train)

preds2<-predict(object=model_rf,test[,-101])

table(preds2)

## preds2

## -1   1

##548 452

auc(preds2,test$y)

## [1] 0.5345908

   whoo! in the above example, even though the final accuracy is poor but
   id91 has given our model a significant boost from accuracy of
   0.45 to slightly above 0.53.

   this shows that id91 can indeed be helpful for supervised machine
   learning tasks.

end notes

   in this article, we have discussed what are the various ways of
   performing id91. it find applications for unsupervised learning
   in a large no. of domains. you also saw how you can improve the
   accuracy of your supervised machine learning algorithm using
   id91.

   although id91 is easy to implement, you need to take care of some
   important aspects like treating outliers in your data and making sure
   each cluster has sufficient population. these aspects of id91 are
   dealt in great detail in this [108]article.

       i accept that id91 may help in improving the supervised
       models. but here in the above:
       id91 is performed on sample points (4361 rows). is that
       right.?
       but i think correct way is to cluster features (x1-x100) and to
       represent data using cluster representatives and then perform
       supervised learning.
       can you please elaborate further? why samples are being clustered
       in the code (not independent variables)?

            hey, sai.
            so, yes. i have clustered the observations ( or rows, 3000 in
            total).
            consider all these data points ( observations) in data space
            with all the features (x1-x100) as dimensions.
            what i   m doing is to cluster these data points into 5 groups
            and store the cluster label as a new feature itself.
            id91 the 100 independent variables will give you 5
            groups of independent variables. going this way, how exactly
            do you plan to use these cluster labels for supervised
            learning?

                 1. i am not able to understand (intuitively) why
                 id91 sample points will yield better results?
                 please explain and if you have any book/paper explaining
                 this , please provide it too.
                 2. regarding what i said , i read about this pam
                 id91 method (somewhat similar to id116) , where
                 one can select representative objects ( represent cluster
                 using this feature, for example if x1-x10 are in one
                 cluster , may be one can pick x6 to represent the cluster
                 , this x6 is provided by pam method). then classification
                 is performed simply on those objects. i am not sure
                 whether that would yield better results. just wanted to
                 share this.
                 i guess this dataset is from a hackathlon , even i worked
                 on that problem. if you did too, what method you chose
                 for id91 ?

                 once you have separated the data into 5 clusters, can we
                 create five different models for the 5 clusters. what are
                 your thoughts?
                 nice introductory article by the way. in the next
                 article, may be you can discuss about identifying
                 clusterability of the data, finding the ideal number of
                 clusters for the id116. also how can we evaluate our
                 id91 model?

       nice article!
       how would you handle a id91 problem when there are some
       variables with many missing values (let   s say   around 90% of each
       column). these missing values are not random at all, but even they
       have a meaning, the id91 output yields some isolated (and
       very small) groups due to these missing values.
       thanks in advance!

            hi luis. thanks.
            1. since the missing values are as high as 90%, you can
            consider dropping these variables.
            2. as you said, these missing values are not completely
            meaningless, try imputing them (might not yield good results
            with this high percentage of missing values.)
            3. if the pattern in missing values is something like say   
            values are missing because students didn   t took a certain test
            otherwise that column contains the scores of that test. you
            can try replacing the variable with another variable having 0
            for missing values and 1 for some valid value.

                 hi again,
                 thanks for the response. let   s say i cannot drop these
                 variables, so i have to impute them somehow. what would
                 affect less to a distance function (such as euclidan),
                 median or mean?
                 as in your example, there are students that did not take
                 the test, so i do not want them to affect the output.
                 however, students who took the test should be meaningful
                 and it is important whether they got a bad score or a
                 good one.

                      choice of central tendency depends on your data.
                      mean is generally a good central tendency to impute
                      your missing values with. but consider a situation
                      in which you have to impute salaries of employees in
                      an organization. the ceo, directors, etch will have
                      very high salaries but majority will have
                      comparatively very lower salary. so in that case,
                      median should be the way to go.
                      ok, so to handle example similar to that, create
                      another column in your data with 0 for rows that
                      have missing values for your column under
                      consideration and 1 for some valid value. and in the
                      main column, replace all na with some unique value.
                      hope this resolves your query.

       hello saurav,
       your article and related explanation on id91 and the two most
       used methods was very insightful. however, please do enlighten us
       by telling how does one interpret cluster output for both these
       methods     id116 and hierarchical. also, it would be nice if you
       could let the reader know when could one use id116 versus say
       something like k-median. in what scenario does the former work and
       in which one does the latter???
       it would also be a great idea to:
       1. discuss the ways to implement a density based algorithm and a
       distribution based one
       2. maybe show an actual example of market segmentation
       you have done a good job of showing how id91 could in sense
       preclude a following classification method but if the problem is
       such that it is only limited to id91, then how would you
       explain the output to an uninitiated audience?
       maybe some thoughts for your second article in the id91
       article. but great job. i enjoyed reading your piece.

            hi kunal,
            i   m happy that you liked the article. actually, id91 is
            a very wide topic to be completely covered in a single
            article. for some of the things that you mentioned like when
            to use which method out of two , you can refer to differences
            between two.
            for interpretation of clusters formed using say hierarchical
            id91 is depicted using dendrograms.
            apart from these, things like using density based and
            distribution based id91 methods, market segmentation
            could definitely be a part of future articles on id91.
            thank you for your thoughts.

       also saurav,
       it might be a good idea to suggest which id91 algorithm would
       be appropriate to use when:
       1. all variables are continuous
       2. all variables are categorical     many times this could be the
       case
       3. all variables are count     maybe sometimes
       4. a mix of continuous and categorical     this could be possibly the
       most common
       5. similarly a mix of continuous, categorical and count
       to be more precise, if i had one or more scenarios above, and was
       using a distance based method to calculate distances between
       points, what distance calculation method works where.
       any insights would be great!!

            so, to understand this, its important to understand how
            categorical variables behave in id91.
            if the levels of your categorical variables are in sequence
            like : very bad, bad, average, good, very good. you can try
            encoding labels say with 0,1,2,3 and 4 respectively.
            if there is no sequence in levels like : red, green and orange
            , you can try one hot encoding.
            also, there is no one definite best distance metric to cluster
            your data. it depends on various factors like the ones you
            mentioned : type of variables. also, things like the scales of
            variables , no. of clusters you want are important while
            deciding the best distance metric.

       since we are classifying assets in this tutorial, don   t you think
       corelation based distance should give us better results than
       eucledian distances (which id116 normally uses)?

       hi
       it    s a good post on covering a broad topic like id91.
       however, i   m not so convinced about using id91 for aiding
       supervised ml.
       for me, id91 based approaches tend to be more    exploratory   
       in nature to understand the inherent data structure, segments et
       al.
       id84 techniques like pca are more intuitive
       approaches (for me) in this case, quite simple because you don   t
       get any id84 by doing id91 and
       vice-versa, yo don   t get any groupings out of pca like techniques.
       my distinction of the two,
       pca
       is used for id84 / feature selection /
       representation learning e.g. when the feature space contains too
       many irrelevant or redundant features. the aim is to find the
       intrinsic dimensionality of the data.
       id116
       is a id91 algorithm that returns the natural grouping of data
       points, based on their similarity.
       i   d like to point to the excellent explanation and distinction of
       the two on quora :
       [163]https://www.quora.com/what-is-the-difference-between-factor-an
       d-cluster-analyses
       my question to you
       how would you fit / cluster the same groupings (you obtained out of
       id91 the training set) onto a unseen test set? or would you
       apply id91 to it again?
       typically, you perform pca on a training set and apply the same
       loadings on to a new unseen test set and not fit a new pca to it..

       hi saurav kaushik,
       i am new to this area, but i am in search of help to understand it
       deeper.
       one of my personal projects involves analysing data for creating a
          predictive model    based on some information collected about
       previous historical data which i have in a spreadsheet (or in .txt
       file if it is bette).
       could you recommend a simple package (in python or in delphi) that
       can help me do something like this?
       my spreadsheet has (for example), 1500 lines which represent
       historical moments (test 1, test2   test1500).
       on the columns, i have the labels and values for each of 1000
       characteristics i analyse separately at each test.
       what i would like to do with this? to be able to    predict    some 10
       ou 20 values for 10 or 20 characteristics for the next test1501.
       do you think it is possible?
       if you are involved in this kind of project, what would it cost me
       to have your help in building a tool for doing that? i can send you
       an example file, if you would be interested in helping me.

       1
       then

            1. make sure your outcome variable in categorical and so are
            your predictions.
            2. make sure you have loaded the metrics package as auc() is
            the function defined in that package.
