what is the difference between lda and pca for id84?

   both lda and pca are linear transformation techniques: lda is a
   supervised whereas pca is unsupervised     pca ignores class labels.

   we can picture pca as a technique that finds the directions of maximal
   variance:

   in contrast to pca, lda attempts to find a feature subspace that
   maximizes class separability (note that ld 2 would be a very bad linear
   discriminant in the figure above).

   remember that lda makes assumptions about normally distributed classes
   and equal class covariances. if you are interested in an empirical
   comparison: a. m. martinez and a. c. kak. pca versus lda. pattern
   analysis and machine intelligence, ieee transactions on, 23(2):228   233,
   2001). (pca tends to result in better classification results in an
   image recognition task if the number of samples for a given class was
   relatively small.)
