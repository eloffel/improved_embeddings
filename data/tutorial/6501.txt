   randomly chosen examples from the development set of bowman   s corpus

   although natural language processing (nlp) has made major strides in
   the last few years, to what extent can an nlp algorithm understand
   human sentences beyond a superficial read? although they can
   computationally identify, count, or regurgitate individual words,
   phrases, and sentences, can they capture the meaning behind the words
   that they are handling? these questions are at the heart of a fledgling
   sub-field within nlp called natural language id136 (nli), where
   center for data science professor sam bowman   s work is currently
   focused.

   a typical nli test runs something like this: the algorithm is given a
   sentence like    a man is playing with a dog,    and then a hypothesis
   about that sentence like    two dogs are playing together.    the algorithm
   would then be asked to compare the sentence with the hypothesis, and
   infer whether the hypothesis is contradictory (e.g. false), neutral, or
   an entailment (e.g. true). in this case, the hypothesis is a
   contradiction, and whether or not the algorithm is able to infer it as
   such reveals the extent to which the algorithm has understood the
   sentence.

   for researchers to perform these tests, however, they need a corpus of
   sentence and hypothesis pairs. such is the purpose of bowman   s
   [15]multi-genre nli corpus, an exciting project that received [16]a
   google faculty research award earlier this year. working with adina
   williams and nikita nangia from nyu, and angeliki lazaridou from google
   deepmind, bowman and his team are creating a multi-genre nli corpus
   that builds on his earlier work, the snli corpus. the snli corpus is a
   collection of 570,000 human written sentence pairs that were manually
   labelled. since its creation, the snli corpus has become a vital
   benchmark for researchers in the field.

   but a drawback to the snli corpus is that all of the sentences were
   extracted from a single genre         image captions. the multi-genre nli
   corpus that bowman and his researchers are now working on, however,
   addresses this problem by extracting written sentences from several
   different areas. in addition to the snli image captions, the
   multi-genre corpus collects sentences from fiction, government
   documents, news articles, telephone transcriptions, travel guides, the
   9/11 report, face-to-face speech, letters, nonfiction books, and
   magazines.

   by collecting both written and spoken text, this massive multi-genre
   corpus will help researchers test and identify problems with their
   current algorithms. it also takes us one step closer to learning how to
   foster transferable language skills in machine brains. presently, the
   project is harnessing the power of crowd-sourcing to manually label the
   sentence extracts. the multi-genre nli corpus will also be the basis
   for the repeval 2017 shared task later this year         you can find out
   more about it [17]here.
