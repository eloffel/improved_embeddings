   opinosis: a graph based approach to abstractive summarization of highly
   redundant opinions

opinosis: a graph based approach to abstractive summarization of highly
redundant opinions

abstract

   we present a novel graph-based summarization framework (opinosis) that
   generates concise abstractive summaries of highly redundant opinions.
   evaluation results on summarizing user reviews show that opinosis
   summaries have better agreement with human summaries compared to the
   baseline extractive method. the summaries are readable, reasonably
   well-formed and are informative enough to convey the major opinions.

the big idea

   the opinosis summarization framework focuses on generating very short
   abstractive summaries from large amounts of text. these summaries can
   resemble micropinions or    micro-reviews    that you see on sites like
   twitter and four squares. the idea of the algorithm is to use a word
   graph data structure referred to as the opinosis-graph to represent the
   text to be summarized. then, the resulting graph is repeatedly explored
   to find meaningful paths which in turn becomes candidate summary
   phrases. the opinosis summarizer is considered a    shallow    abstractive
   summarizer as it uses the original text itself to generate summaries
   (this makes it shallow) but it can generate phrases that were
   previously not seen in the original text because of the way paths are
   explored (and this makes it abstractive rather than purely extractive).
   the summarization framework was evaluated on an opinion ([40]user
   review) dataset. the approach itself is actually very general in that,
   it can be applied to any corpus containing high amounts of
   redundancies, for example, twitter comments or user comments on
   blog/news articles.

   here is another example of an opinosis summary for a car (acura 2007)
   generated using the [41]opinrank edmunds data set. :

additional thoughts

   while most research projects in data mining and nlp focus on technical
   complexity, the focus of opinosis was its practicality, in that it uses
   very shallow representation of text, relying mostly on redundancy to
   help generate summaries. this is not too much to ask given that we live
   in an era of big data, and we have ample user reviews on the web to
   work with. even though the opinosis paper uses part-of-speech tags in
   its graph representation, you don   t have to use this at all and the
   algorithm will still work fine as long as you have sufficient volume of
   reviews and you make a few tweaks in finding sentence breaks.

other works using a similar graph data structure

     * [44]discovering related clinical concepts     this paper focuses on
       using a concept graph similar to the opinosis-graph to mine
       clinical concepts that are highly related. for example, the drug
       advair is highly related to concepts like inhaler, puff, diskus,
       singulair, tiotropium, albuterol, combivent, spiriva. such concepts
       are easily discovered using the concept-graph in this paper.

       katja   s work was used to summarize news (google news) for both
       english and spanish while opinosis was evaluated on user reviews
       from various sources (english only). she studies the
       informativeness and grammaticality of sentences and in a similar
       way we evaluate these aspects by studying how close the opinosis
       summaries are compared to the human composed summaries in terms of
       information overlap and readability (using a human assessor
     * peilin yang and hui fang     contextual suggestion     another related
       work uses the opinosis algorithm to extract terms from reviews for
       the purpose of contextual suggestion. this was done as  part of the
       contextual suggestion trec task. it turns out that yang and fang
       had the highest rank and mrr scores in this track. their paper can
       be found here: [46]an opinion-aware approach to contextual
       suggestion. the details of the trec run can be found here:
