summarize opinions with a graph     part 1

   how does the saying go? opinions are like bellybuttons, everybody   s got
   one? so let   s say you have an opinion that nosql is not for you. maybe
   you read my blog and think this graph database stuff is great for
   recommendation engines and path finding and maybe some other stuff, but
   you got really hard problems and it can   t help you.

   i am going to try to show you that a graph database can help you solve
   your really hard problems if you can frame your problem in terms of a
   graph. did i say    you   ? i meant anybody, specially ph.d. students. one
   trick is to search for    graph based approach to    and your problem.
   i   ll give you an example. the other day i ran in to    [21]opinosis: a
   graph based approach to abstractive summarization of highly redundant
   opinions    by [22]kavita ganesan, chengxiang zhai and jiawei han at the
   university of illinois at urbana-champaign. here is the abstract:

     we present a novel graph-based summarization framework (opinosis)
     that generates concise abstractive summaries of highly redundant
     opinions. evaluation results on summarizing user reviews show that
     opinosis summaries have better agreement with human summaries
     compared to the baseline extractive method. the summaries are
     readable, reasonably well-formed and are informative enough to
     convey the major opinions.

   what does that mean? it means opiniosis takes the free form text people
   write in reviews, aggregates it, and makes something useful out of it,
   so i can look at one sentence and not 1000 when looking for details
   about a review.

   how is this useful? most companies want to know what their customers
   are saying about them, but nobody has time to read 1000 responses to
   that customer survey, so generate a summary instead. ebay feedback?
   twitter posts about a specific hashtag? text of support e-mails? you
   get the picture.

   let   s dive into what this means by an example that everyone is familiar
   with, e-commerce.

   you can see the 1 to 5 star ratings and you already know how to build a
   [23]recommendation algorithm out of this. we also know how to predict
   what the star rating of the user will be using [24]personalization, but
   we want to ask a different question. can we summarize what people are
   saying about this product? we want to do this because all our
   competitors are also giving items 1-5 star ratings, and they are also
   telling you what rating they think you   ll give this item. but it   s not
   enough. we turned to graph databases to get that little bit extra. that
   feature that none of our competitors are doing, that secret sauce, that
   edge.

   we are going to take the things people are saying about the products we
   sell and generate a graph out of them, find the paths most traveled,
   and combine them to build our summary. an illustration might help:

   today we are just going to look at step 1. our input is going to be
   these two sentences:

     my phone calls drop frequently with the iphone.

     great device, but the calls drop too frequently.

   with these, we can generate the following graph:

   one interesting property about this graph is that it naturally captures
   redundancies. the paths shared by 2 sentences are captured by the nodes
   which is what allows us to have high confidence in the summaries we
   build.

   another property the graph has is that it can handle gaps between
   words, which helps us see the redundancy and allows us to discover new
   sentences.

   a third interesting property about this graph is that it allows us to
   join similar sentences together:

   think about how these properties are going to help us build a summary
   that represents what our users are saying, and we   ll tackle building
   the graph in part 2.

   if you want to take a sneak peek, take a look at the [25]opinosis
   presentation which goes over each step in depth. you can find more
   about it on [26]kavita   s website.

       interesting, but how can this representation handle
       context/sentiment?
       for example if an opinion in the form of    my phone calls do not
       drop frequently    is added, will it be aggregated with the negative
       ones or positive/neutral ones?

            sentiment is not included in this context. part of speech is
            taken into account, but for your specific question, the number
            of redundant entries will determine the winning summary. for
            your example, the number of people who wrote    calls drop
            frequently    vs    calls do not drop frequently    determines the
               winning    opinion.

                 are there any research papers that you can reference to
                 that describe/support this approach?
