contextualized word vectors (cove)

   this repo provides the best, pretrained mt-lstm from the paper
   [77]learned in translation: contextualized word vectors (mccann et. al.
   2017). for a high-level overview of why cove are great, check out the
   [78]post.

   this repository uses a [79]pytorch implementation of the mtlstm class
   in mtlstm.py to load a pretrained encoder, which takes in sequences of
   vectors pretrained with glove and outputs cove.

need cove in tensorflow?

   a keras/tensorflow implementation of the mt-lstm/cove can be found at
   [80]https://github.com/rgsachin/cove.

unknown words

   out of vocabulary words for cove are also out of vocabulary for glove,
   which should be rare for most use cases. during training the cove
   encoder would have received a zero vector for any words that were not
   in glove, and it used zero vectors for unknown words in our
   classification and id53 experiments, so that is
   recommended.

   you could also try initializing unknown inputs to something close to
   glove vectors instead, but we have no experiments suggesting that this
   would work better than zero vectors. if you wanted to try this, glove
   vectors follow (very roughly) a gaussian with mean 0 and standard
   deviation 0.4. you could initialize by randomly drawing from that
   distrubtion, but you would probably want to train those embeddings
   while keeping the cove encoder (mtlstm) and glove fixed.

example usage

   the following example can be found in test/example.py. it demonstrates
   a few different variations of how to use the pretrained mtlstm class
   that generates contextualized word vectors (cove) programmatically.

running with docker

   install [81]docker. install [82]nvidia-docker if you would like to use
   with with a gpu.
docker pull bmccann/cove   # pull the docker image
# on cpu
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`/.embeddings:/.embeddings/ -v `pwd`/.data/:/.data/ b
mccann/cove bash -c "python /test/example.py --device -1"
# on gpu
nvidia-docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`/.embeddings:/.embeddings/ -v `pwd`/.data/:/.
data/ bmccann/cove bash -c "python /test/example.py"

running without docker

   install [83]pytorch.
git clone https://github.com/salesforce/cove.git # use ssh: git@github.com:sales
force/cove.git
cd cove
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
# on cpu
python test/example.py --device -1
# on gpu
python test/example.py

re-training cove

   there is also the third option if you are operating in an entirely
   different context -- retrain the bidirectional lstm using trained
   embeddings. if you are mostly encoding a non-english language, that
   might be the best option. check out the paper for details; code for
   this is included in the directory openid4-py, which was forked from
   [84]openid4-py a long while back and includes changes we made to the
   repo internally.
