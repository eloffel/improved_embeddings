motivation     

   graph nlu uses graph databases as a means to represent natural language
   relationships flexibly and dynamically.

   the primary motivation for this project is to develop a way to
   understand natural language dialog in an interactive setting by
   remembering previous dialog states. [77]virtual assistants like siri,
   google assistant, and alexa have the common problem that they behave
   like amnesiacs, i.e., they do not remember much about previous
   interactions.

   one proposal to get around the memory problem is by representing the
   previous dialog states using a persistent graph. because graphs offer a
   powerful and interpretable way of encoding high-level representations
   of entities and their associated relationships, an attractive
   proposition is to leverage them in processing natural language. graph
   databases (e.g., [78]neo4j) offer a rich suite of tools to quickly
   construct such graphs and persist them over the long term.

   this project is in its research phase, hence all code in this
   repository is exploratory. the supplied jupyter (ipython) notebooks do
   the following:
    1. examine several dialog domains
    2. explain some of the design considerations for using graphs to
       process natural language
    3. define models for solving a dialog domain
    4. evaluate these models for accuracy and usefulness

   explanations behind each code snippet are given where possible.
   [79]read the research paper (pdf) discussing a more detailed approach
   to the personal assistant memory problem.

getting started     

     * [80]video talk overview (youtube)
     * [81]video talk slides (pdf)

   get an introduction to this project by viewing the supplied jupyter
   notebooks in github under the notebooks directory:
     * [82]dynamic_memory_1 - evaluates the babi qa tasks using neo4j
       queries

running the code     

   the python code uses the neo4j graph database to store and query
   natural language relationships. in addition, several processing steps
   will require popular python data processing tools like pandas, numpy,
   sklearn, and nltk.

prerequisites

    1. make sure these are on your system:

     * [83]python (3.5+)
     * [84]neo4j (3.1+)

    2. install the python packages in requirements.txt if you don't have
       them already.

pip install -r ./requirements.txt

running jupyter notebooks

    3. clone the repository.

git clone https://github.com/hyperparticle/graph-nlu.git
cd ./graph-nlu/notebooks

    4. run the ipython notebooks with jupyter.
