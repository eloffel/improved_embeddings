namebot

   a company/product/whatever name generating tool written in python.

   this project is ongoing, but feel free to contribute! it's a
   full-fledged suite of tools that can help you get started generating
   real business names for your project or company!

getting started

   install the package:

   pip install namebot or clone this repo and then run python setup.py
   install

   wite your code!
# example usage - this one is slower because it does all techniques.
from pprint import pprint as ppr

from namebot import nlp
from namebot import techniques

base_words = ['cat', 'dog']
more_words = nlp.get_synsets(base_words)
all_examples = techniques.generate_all_techniques(base_words)

ppr(all_examples)

modules:

   [99]see the docs

metrics

   a class of utilities for generating all kinds of linguistic metrics for
   a set of words.

nlp

   natural language processing tools for finding word relationships - uses
   nltk for all of the heavy-lifting.

id172

   some tools for normalizing and formatting content for use with the rest
   of the library.

scoring

   some scoring algorithms, primarily for classifying pronunciation, such
   as soundex or double metaphone.

techniques

   the major chunk of work represented in this library. the many
   techniques i've created after researching hundreds of corporate names
   and naming agency techniques

language techniques

   techniques that involve the use of language translation for stylistic
   name use, such as latin.

strainer

   similar to id172, but for filtering based on rules, like
   length, count, etc... good for mapping 1:1 with ui inputs or just
   calling from the functions directly.

   [100]see the docs for more

how to setup server and test:

sudo make install

   check out [101]https://github.com/automotron/namebot-flask to see an
   example app and configuration setup to use namebot and generate results
   with test data.

library dependencies

   see [102]requirements.txt and [103]makefile for details.

tests

make install
make tests

   tests are available in the tests/ folder. test runner is provided by
   nose and can be run via make.

versioning

   versioning style follows the semantic versioning convention. for more
   info, see [104]http://semver.org/
