word_sense_disambigation_corpora

   ##semcor and masc documents annotated with noad word senses.

   this package includes semcor and masc documents annotated with noad
   (new oxford american dictionary) word senses.

   the files are in xml format with dtd simple-wsd-doc.dtd.

   we use the part-of-speech tags specified as follows:
     * . punctuation
     * adj adjectives
     * adp adpositions (prepositions and postpositions)
     * adv adverbs
     * conj conjunctions
     * det determiners
     * noun nouns (common and proper)
     * num cardinal numbers
     * pron pronouns
     * prt particles or other function words
     * verb verbs (all tenses and modes)
     * x other: foreign words, typos, abbreviations

   the break level of a word indicates how it was separated from the
   previous token in the text:
     * no_break no separation between tokens.
     * space_break separated by space.
     * line_break separated by line break.
     * sentence_break separated by sentence break.

   ##paper

   these annotated documents are used to evaluate our word sense
   disambiguation systems in [74]"semi-supervised word sense
   disambiguation with neural models", dayu yuan, julian richardson, ryan
   doherty, colin evans and eric altendorf, proceedings coling 2016

   ##word sense mappings

   this package also includes maps from noad word senses to id138
   senses.
    1. manual_map.txt is a manually created map for a few word senses.
    2. algorithmic_map.txt is built algorithmically.

   both files have the same format: noad_word_sense\tid138_word_senses
   separated by comma

   the above data is annoated with a id104 platform. the data is
   not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.

   please contact dayu yuan ([75]dayuyuan@google.com) for classifications
   or further information.
