------ update september 2018 ------

   it's been a year since torchmoji and deepmoji were released. we're
   trying to understand how it's being used such that we can make
   improvements and design better models in the future.

   you can help us achieve this by answering this [89]4-question google
   form. thanks for your support!

     torchmoji

     read our blog post about the implementation process [90]here.

   torchmoji is a [91]pytorch implementation of the [92]deepmoji model
   developped by bjarke felbo, alan mislove, anders s  gaard, iyad rahwan
   and sune lehmann.

   this model trained on 1.2 billion tweets with emojis to understand how
   language is used to express emotions. through id21 the
   model can obtain state-of-the-art performance on many emotion-related
   text modeling tasks.

   try the online demo of deepmoji [93]http://deepmoji.mit.edu! see the
   [94]paper, [95]blog post or [96]faq for more details.

overview

     * [97]torchmoji/ contains all the underlying code needed to convert a
       dataset to the vocabulary and use the model.
     * [98]examples/ contains short code snippets showing how to convert a
       dataset to the vocabulary, load up the model and run it on that
       dataset.
     * [99]scripts/ contains code for processing and analysing datasets to
       reproduce results in the paper.
     * [100]model/ contains the pretrained model and vocabulary.
     * [101]data/ contains raw and processed datasets that we include in
       this repository for testing.
     * [102]tests/ contains unit tests for the codebase.

   to start out with, have a look inside the [103]examples/ directory. see
   [104]score_texts_emojis.py for how to use deepmoji to extract emoji
   predictions, [105]encode_texts.py for how to convert text into
   2304-dimensional emotional feature vectors or
   [106]finetune_youtube_last.py for how to use the model for transfer
   learning on a new dataset.

   please consider citing the [107]paper of deepmoji if you use the model
   or code (see below for citation).

installation

   we assume that you're using [108]python 2.7-3.5 with [109]pip
   installed.

   first you need to install [110]pytorch (version 0.2+), currently by:
conda install pytorch -c pytorch

   at the present stage the model can't make efficient use of cuda. see
   details in the [111]hugging face blog post.

   when pytorch is installed, run the following in the root directory to
   install the remaining dependencies:
pip install -e .

   this will install the following dependencies:
     * [112]scikit-learn
     * [113]text-unidecode
     * [114]emoji

   then, run the download script to downloads the pretrained torchmoji
   weights (~85mb) from [115]here and put them in the model/ directory:
python scripts/download_weights.py

testing

   to run the tests, install [116]nose. after installing, navigate to the
   [117]tests/ directory and run:
cd tests
nosetests -v

   by default, this will also run finetuning tests. these tests train the
   model for one epoch and then check the resulting accuracy, which may
   take several minutes to finish. if you'd prefer to exclude those, run
   the following instead:
cd tests
nosetests -v -a '!slow'

disclaimer

   this code has been tested to work with python 2.7 and 3.5 on ubuntu
   16.04 and macos sierra machines. it has not been optimized for
   efficiency, but should be fast enough for most purposes. we do not give
   any guarantees that there are no bugs - use the code on your own
   responsibility!

contributions

   we welcome pull requests if you feel like something could be improved.
   you can also greatly help us by telling us how you felt when writing
   your most recent tweets. just click [118]here to contribute.

license

   this code and the pretrained model is licensed under the mit license.

benchmark datasets

   the benchmark datasets are uploaded to this repository for convenience
   purposes only. they were not released by us and we do not claim any
   rights on them. use the datasets at your responsibility and make sure
   you fulfill the licenses that they were released with. if you use any
   of the benchmark datasets please consider citing the original authors.
