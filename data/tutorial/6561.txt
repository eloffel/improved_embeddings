   record a 10-second video clip. you can use your mic to say something
   about it.

   download your video below, or [15]redo it.

   [16]start recording

   download it!

   (heads up, sharing doesn't work just yet. it should be be working
   soon!)

   [17]record a video

   share your machine with a screen captured video.

what is this?

   this experiment lets anyone explore how machine learning works, in a
   fun, hands-on way. you can teach a machine to using your camera, live
   in the browser     no coding required. you train a [18]neural network
   locally on your device, without sending any images to a server. that   s
   how it responds so quickly to you. watch this video to learn more:

what kind of things can i do?

   here are some links to things people have done so far: [20]make your
   hand say moo. [21]rock out by wiggling your fingers. and stay tuned,
   we   ll add more examples here soon. (want to share something with us?
   use the record button and share it on social media with
   #teachablemachine so we can check it out.)

any tips i should keep in mind?

   capture at least 30 images per class. be aware of when you   re pressing
   and releasing the button (that   s when it starts/stops capturing
   images). and you might need to capture lots of angles or variations of
   whatever it is you want your machine to recognize.

why isn   t my machine working the way i want it to?

   don   t worry. keep playing around. seeing what works and what doesn   t is
   one way to explore how machine learning works. keep in mind that your
   machine doesn   t have an understanding of higher level concepts, like
   faces or objects. it   s learning through the examples you give it. so if
   it   s not working the way you want, you might want to click the x to
   reset your classes and try out different approaches.

where can i find more things like this?

   check out [22]wekinator by rebecca fiebrink, one of the inspirations
   for this project. it lets anyone use machine learning through simple
   actions instead of code. [23]here are some interactive guides for
   learning about machine learning. and check out other fun projects like
   [24]this and [25]this.

are my images being stored on google servers?

   no. all the training is happening locally on your device.

how do i learn more about machine learning?

   [26]here   s an intro-level video explainer. [27]this site lets you
   interact with neural networks in more detail. and this [28]free online
   course lets you dive in even deeper.

how was this built?

   the image classification is powered by a [29]neural network. it was
   made possible by nikhil thorat and daniel smilkov, the team behind
   [30]tensorflow.js. it   s an open-source library that allows web
   developers to train and run machine learning models locally in the
   browser. the code for this experiment is open-sourced [31]here on
   github.

   we also made a boilerplate project which demonstrates how to use
   tensorflow.js to create projects of your own like teachable machine
   [32]here.

who made this?

   this experiment was a collaborative effort by friends from [33]st  j,
   [34]use all five and creative lab and pair teams at google.
