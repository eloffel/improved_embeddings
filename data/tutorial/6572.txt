competitive multi-agent environments

   this repository contains the environments for the paper [82]emergent
   complexity via multi-agent competition

dependencies

   use pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies. if you
   haven't used mujoco before, please refer to the [83]installation guide.
   the code has been tested with the following dependencies:
     * python version 3.6
     * [84]openai gym version 0.9.1 with mujoco 1.31 support (use
       [85]mujoco-py version 0.5.7)
     * [86]tensorflow version 1.1.0
     * [87]numpy version 1.12.1

installing package

   after installing all dependencies, make sure gym works with support for
   mujoco environments. next install gym-compete package as:
cd gym-compete
pip install -e .

   check install is successful by coming out of the directory and trying
   import gym_compete in python console. some users might require a sudo
   pip install.

trying the environments

   agent policies are provided for the various environments in folder
   agent-zoo. to see a demo of all the environments do:
bash demo_tasks.sh all

   to instead try a single environment use:
bash demo_tasks.sh <task>

   where <task> is one of: run-to-goal-humans, run-to-goal-ants,
   you-shall-not-pass, sumo-ants, sumo-humans and kick-and-defend
