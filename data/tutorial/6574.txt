neural-dep-srl

   this is the code for used in the papers [73]a simple and accurate
   syntax-agnostic neural model for dependency-based semantic role
   labeling and [74]encoding sentences with id197
   for id14.

dependencies

     * python 3
     * [75]theano 0.8.2
     * [76]lasagne 0.1

id14 data processing

   to run the model the first thing to do is create a dataset and all the
   files needed for the evaluation.
    1. place the conll-2009 dataset files with the same format as in
       [77]here in data/conll2009/
    2. place the embedding file [78]sskip.100.vectors in data/
    3. run scripts/srl_preproc.sh in order to obtain the preprocessed data
       you need for training and testing the model.
    4. place the development, test, and ood files in /data/conll/eval/ and
       rename them respectively dev-set_for_eval_gold,
       test-set_for_eval_gold, ood-set_for_eval_gold.
    5. place the dev, test, and ood files in /data/conll/eval/ with only
       the first 12 columns and as 13th column put your predicted
       predicate sense, and rename the files respectively
       dev-set_for_eval_ppred, test-set_for_eval_ppred,
       ood-set_for_eval_ppred

id14 training and testing

   6a. to train the sintax agnostic model run scripts/train.sh

   6b. to train the model with the graph convolutional network over syntax
   run scripts/train_id197.sh
    7. to test the trained model run scripts/test.sh

   the hyper-parameters on the scripts are the ones with which we obtained
   the best results.
