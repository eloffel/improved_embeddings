   technology.

   the blockchain is a digital, decentralised, distributed ledger.

   most explanations for the importance of the blockchain start with
   bitcoin and the history of money. but money is just the first use case
   of the blockchain. and it is unlikely to be the most important.

   it might seem strange that a ledger         a dull and practical document
   associated mainly with accounting         would be described as a
   revolutionary technology. but the blockchain matters because ledgers
   matter.

ledgers all the way down

   ledgers are everywhere. ledgers do more than just record accounting
   transactions. a ledger consists simply of data structured by rules. any
   time we need a consensus about facts, we use a ledger. ledgers record
   the facts underpinning the modern economy.

   ledgers confirm ownership. property title registers map who owns what
   and whether their land is subject to any caveats or encumbrances.
   hernando de soto [13]has documented how the poor suffer when they own
   property that has not been confirmed in a ledger. the firm is a ledger,
   as a network of ownership, employment and production relationships with
   a single purpose. a club is a ledger, structuring who benefits and who
   does not.

   ledgers confirm identity. businesses have identities recorded on
   government ledgers to track their existence and their status under tax
   law. the register of births deaths and marriages records the existence
   of individuals at key moments, and uses that information to confirm
   identities when those individuals are interacting with the world.

   ledgers confirm status. citizenship is a ledger, recording who has the
   rights and is subject to obligations due to national membership. the
   electoral roll is a ledger, allowing (and, in australia, obliging)
   those who are on that roll a vote. employment is a ledger, giving those
   employed a contractual claim on payment in return for work.

   ledgers confirm authority. ledgers identify who can validly sit in
   parliament, who can access what bank account, who can work with
   children, who can enter restricted areas.

   at their most fundamental level, ledgers map economic and social
   relationships.

   agreement about the facts and when they change         that is, a consensus
   about what is in the ledger, and a trust that the ledger is
   accurate         is one of the fundamental bases of market capitalism.

ownership, possession, and ledgers

   let   s make a distinction here that is crucial but easy to miss: between
   ownership and possession.

   take passports. each country asserts the right to control who crosses
   its borders, and each country maintains a ledger of which of its
   citizens have the right to travel. a passport is a physical item         call
   it a token         that refers back to this ledger.

   in the pre-digital world, possession indicated ownership of that right.
   the australian passport ledger consisted of index cards held in by the
   government of each state. border agents presented with a passport could
   surmise that the traveller who held it was listed on a distant ledger
   as allowed to travel. of course this left border control highly exposed
   to fraud.
   [0*o7jsv4im3zvc0lcd.]

   1944/4/2579

   possession implies ownership, but possession is not ownership. now
   modern passports allow the authorities to confirm ownership directly.
   their digital features allow airlines and immigration authorities to
   query the national passport database and determine that a passenger is
   free to travel.

   passports are a relatively straightforward example of this distinction.
   but as bitcoin has shown: money is a ledger, too.

   possession of a banknote token indicates ownership. in the nineteenth
   century the possessor            bearer            of a banknote had a right to draw on
   the issuing bank the value of the note. these banknotes were direct
   liabilities for the issuing bank, and were recorded on the banks   
   ledger. a regime of possession indicating ownership meant that
   banknotes were susceptible to be both stolen and forged.

   in our era fiat currencies a five dollar bill cannot be returned to the
   central bank for gold. but the relationship remains         the value of the
   bill is dependent on a social consensus about the stability of the
   currency and government that issued it. banknotes are not wealth, as
   zimbabweans and yugoslavians and weimar republic germans have
   unfortunately learned. a bill is a call on a relationship in a (now
   synthetic) ledger and if that relationship collapses, so does the value
   of the bill.

the evolution of the ledger

   for all its importance, ledger technology has been mostly unchanged    
   until now.

   ledgers appear at the dawn of written communication. ledgers and
   writing developed simultaneously in the ancient near east to record
   production, trade, and debt. clay tablets baked with cuneiform script
   detailed units of rations, taxes, workers and so forth. the first
   international    community    was arranged through a [14]structured network
   of alliances that functioned a lot like a distributed ledger.
   [0*-a0b-7owzy1wzpdn.]

   a fragment of a late babylonian cuneiform ledger, held by the british
   museum, 58278

   the first major change to ledgers appeared in the fourteenth century
   with the invention of double entry bookkeeping. by recording both
   debits and credits, double entry bookkeeping conserved data across
   multiple (distributed) ledgers, and allowed for the reconciliation of
   information between ledgers.

   the nineteenth century saw the next advance in ledger technology with
   the rise of large corporate firms and large bureaucracies. these
   centralised ledgers enabled dramatic increases in organisational size
   and scope, but relied entirely on trust in the centralised
   institutions.

   in the late twentieth century ledgers moved from analog to digital
   ledgers. for example, in the 1970s the australian passport ledger was
   digitised and centralised. a database allows for more complex
   distribution, calculation, analysis and tracking. a database is
   computable and searchable.

   but a database still relies on trust; a digitised ledger is only as
   reliable as the organisation that maintains it (and the individuals
   they employ). it is this problem that the blockchain solves. the
   blockchain is a distributed ledgers that does not rely on a trusted
   central authority to maintain and validate the ledger.

blockchain and the economic institutions of capitalism

   the economic structure of modern capitalism has evolved in order
   service these ledgers.

   oliver williamson, the 2009 nobel laureate in economics, argued that
   people produce and exchange in markets, firms, or governments depending
   on the relative transactions costs of each institution. williamson   s
   transactions cost approach provides a key to understanding what
   institutions manage ledgers and why.

   governments maintain ledgers of authority, privilege, responsibility
   and access. governments are the trusted entity that keeps databases of
   citizenship and the right to travel, taxation obligations, social
   security entitlements, and property ownership. where a ledger requires
   coercion in order to be enforced, the government is required.

   firms also maintain ledgers: proprietary ledgers of employment and
   responsibility, of the ownership and deployment of physical and human
   capital, of suppliers and customers, of intellectual property and
   corporate privilege. a firm is often described as a    nexus of
   contracts   . but the value of the firm comes from the way that nexus is
   ordered and structured         the firm is in fact a ledger of contracts and
   capital.

   firms and governments can use blockchains to make their work more
   efficient and reliable. multinational firms and networks of firms need
   to reconcile transactions on a global basis and blockchains can allow
   them to do so near-instantaneously. governments can use the
   immutability of the blockchain to guarantee that property titles and
   identity records are accurate and untampered. well-designed
   permissioning rules on blockchain applications can give citizens and
   consumers more control over their data.

   but blockchains also compete against firms and governments. the
   blockchain is an institutional technology. it is a new way to maintain
   a ledger         [15]that is, coordinate economic activity         distinct from
   firms and governments.
   [0*b2yba82kjwoafkvz.]

   the new economic institutions of capitalism

   blockchains can be used by firms, but they can also replace firms. a
   ledger of contracts and capital can now be decentralised and
   distributed in a way they could not before. ledgers of identity,
   permission, privilege and entitlement can be maintained and enforced
   without the need for government backing.

institutional cryptoeconomics

   this is what institutional cryptoeconomics studies: the institutional
   consequences of cryptographically secure and trustless ledgers.

   classical and neoclassical economists understand the purpose of
   economics as studying the production and distribution of scarce
   resources, and the factors which underpinned that production and
   distribution.

   institutional economics understands the economy as made of rules. rules
   (like laws, languages, property rights, regulations, social norms, and
   ideologies) allow dispersed and opportunistic people to coordinate
   their activity together. rules facilitate exchange         economic exchange
   but also social and political exchange as well.

   what has come to be called cryptoeconomics focuses on the economic
   principles and theory underpinning the blockchain and alternative
   blockchain implementations. it looks at game theory and incentive
   design as they relate to blockchain mechanism design.

   by contrast, institutional cryptoeconomics looks at the institutional
   economics of the blockchain and cryptoeconomy. like its close cousin
   institutional economics, the economy is a system to coordinate
   exchange. but rather than looking at rules, institutional
   cryptoeconomics focuses on ledgers: data structured by rules.

   institutional cryptoeconomics is interested in the rules that govern
   ledgers, the social, political, and economic institutions that have
   developed to service those ledgers, and how the invention of the
   blockchain changes the patterns of ledgers throughout society.

the economic consequences of the blockchain

   institutional cryptoeconomics gives us the tools to understand what is
   happening in the blockchain revolution         and what we can   t predict.

   blockchains are an experimental technology. where the blockchain can be
   used is an entrepreneurial question. some ledgers will move onto the
   blockchain. some entrepreneurs will try to move ledgers onto the
   blockchain and fail. not everything is a blockchain use case. we
   probably haven   t yet seen the blockchain killer app yet. nor can we
   predict what the combination of ledgers, cryptography, peer to peer
   networking will throw up in the future.

   this process is going to be extremely disruptive. the global economy
   faces (what we expect will be) a lengthy period of uncertainty about
   how the facts that underpin it will be restructured, dismantled, and
   reorganised.

   the best uses of the blockchain have to be    discovered   . then they have
   to be implemented in a real world political and economic system that
   has deep, established institutions that already service ledgers. that
   second part will not be cost free.

   ledgers are so pervasive         and the possible applications of the
   blockchain so all-encompassing         that some of the most fundamental
   principles governing our society are up for grabs.

institutional creative destruction

   we   ve been through revolutions like this before.

   it is common to compare the invention of bitcoin and the blockchain
   with the internet. the blockchain is internet 2.0         or internet 4.0.
   the internet is a powerful tool that has revolutionised the way we
   interact and do business. but if anything the comparison undersells the
   blockchain. the internet has allowed us to communicate and exchange
   better         more quickly, more efficiently.

   but the blockchain allows us to exchange differently. a better metaphor
   for the blockchain is the invention of mechanical time.

   before mechanical time, human activity was temporally regulated by
   nature: the crow of the rooster in the morning, the slow descent into
   darkness at night. as the economic historian douglas w. allen
   [16]argues, the problem was variability:    there was simply too much
   variance in the measurement of time     to have a useful meaning in many
   daily activities   .
   [0*6zkgvajsz4otzp9m.]

   the 12th century jayrun water clock

      the effect of the reduction in the variance of time measurement was
   felt everywhere   , allen writes. mechanical time opened up entirely new
   categories of economic organisation that had until then been not just
   impossible, but unimaginable. mechanical time allowed trade and
   exchange to be synchronised across great distances. it allowed for
   production and transport to be coordinated. it allowed for the day to
   be structured, for work to be compensated according to the amount of
   time worked         and for workers to know that they were being compensated
   fairly. both employers and employees could look at a standard,
   independent instrument to verify that a contract had been performed.

complete and incomplete smart contracts

   oliver williamson and ronald coase (who was also an economics nobel
   prize winner, in 1991) put contracts at the heart of economic and
   business organisation. contracts are at the centre of institutional
   cryptoeconomics. it is here that blockchains have the most
   revolutionary implications.

   smart contracts on the blockchain allows for contractual agreements to
   be automatically, autonomously, and securely executed. smart contracts
   can eliminate an entire class of work that currently maintains,
   enforces and confirms that contracts are executed         accountants,
   auditors, lawyers, and indeed much of the legal system.

   but the smart contracts are limited by what can be specified in the
   algorithm. economists have focused on the distinction between complete
   and incomplete contracts.

   a complete contract specifies what is to occur under every possible
   contingency. an incomplete contract allows the terms of the contract to
   be renegotiated in the case of unexpected events. incomplete contracts
   provide one explanation for why some exchanges take place in firms, and
   why others take place in markets, and provides a further guide to
   questions surrounding vertical integration and the size of the firm.

   complete contracts are impossible to execute, while incomplete
   contracts are expensive. the blockchain, though smart contracts, lowers
   the information costs and transactions costs associated with many
   incomplete contracts and so expands the scale and scope of economic
   activity that can be undertaken. it allows markets to operate where
   before only large firms could operate, and it allows business and
   markets to operate where before only government could operate.

   the precise details of how and when this will occur is a challenge and
   a problem for entrepreneurs to resolve. currently, oracles provide a
   link between the algorithmic world of the blockchain and the real
   world, trusted entities that convert information into data that can be
   processed by a smart contract.

   the real gains to be made in the blockchain revolution, we suggest, are
   in developing better and more powerful oracles         converting incomplete
   contracts to contracts that are sufficiently complete to be written
   algorithmically and executed on the blockchain.

   the merchant revolution of the middle ages was made possible by the
   development of merchant courts         effectively trusted oracles         that
   allowed traders to enforce agreements privately. for blockchain, that
   revolution seems yet to come.

whither government?

   the blockchain economy puts pressure on government processes in a whole
   host of ways, from taxation, to regulation, to service delivery.

   investigating these changes is an ongoing project of ours. but
   consider, for instance, how we regulate banks.

   prudential controls have evolved to ensure the safety and soundness of
   financial institutions that interact with the public. typically these
   controls (for example, liquidity and capital requirements) have been
   justified by the fact that depositors and shareholders are unable to
   observe the bank   s ledger. the depositors and shareholders are unable
   to discipline the firm and its management.

   bank runs occur when depositors discover (or simply imagine) that their
   bank might not be able to cover their deposits, and they rush to
   withdraw their money.
   [0*seqgn9fuh-fnwttc.]

   the bank run in mary poppins (1964)

   one possible application of the blockchain would allow depositors and
   shareholders to continuously monitor the bank   s reserves and lendings,
   substantially eliminating the information asymmetries between them and
   the bank management.

   in this world, market discipline would be possible. public trust in the
   immutability of the blockchain would ensure no false bank runs
   occurred. the role of the regulator might be limited to certifying the
   blockchain was correctly and securely structured.

   a more far reaching application would be a cryptobank         an autonomous
   blockchain application that borrows short and lends long, perhaps
   matching borrowers with lenders directly. a cryptobank structured
   algorithmically by smart contracts would have the same transparency
   properties as the bank with a public blockchain ledger but with other
   features that might completely neglect the need for regulators. for
   example, a cryptobank could be self-liquidating. at the moment the
   cryptobank began trading while insolvent, the underlying assets would
   be automatically disbursed to shareholders and depositors.

   it is unclear what regulatory role government should have in this
   world.

   [17]tyler cowen and alex tabarrok have argued that much government
   regulation appears to be designed to resolve asymmetric information
   problems         problems that, in a world of information ubiquity, often do
   not exist any more. blockchain applications significantly increase this
   information ubiquity, and make that information more transparent,
   permanent, and accessible.

   blockchains have their uses in what is being called    regtech            the
   application of technology to the traditional regulatory functions of
   auditing, compliance, and market surveillance. and we ought not to
   dismiss the possibility that there will be new economic problems that
   demand new consumer protections or market controls in the blockchain
   world.

   nevertheless, the restructuring and recreation of basic economic forms
   like banks will put pressure not just on how regulation is enforced,
   but what the regulation should do.

whither big business?

   the implications for big business are likely to be just as profound.
   business size is often driven by the need to cover the costs of
   business hierarchy         in turn due to incomplete contracts and
   technological necessity of large scale financial investment. that
   business model has meant that shareholder capitalism is the dominant
   form of business organisation. the ability to write more complete
   contracts on the blockchain means that entrepreneurs and innovators
   will be able to maintain ownership and control of their human capital
   and profit at the same time. the nexus between operating a successful
   business and access to financial capital has been weakening over time,
   but now might even be broken. the age of human capitalism is dawning.

   entrepreneurs will be able to write a valuable app and release it into
   the    wild    ready to be employed by anyone and everyone who needs that
   functionality. the entrepreneur in turn simply observe micro-payments
   accumulating in their wallet. a designer could release their design
   into the    wild    and final consumers could download that design to their
   3d printer and have the product almost immediately. this business model
   could see more (localised) manufacturing occur in australia than at
   present.

   the ability of consumers to interact directly with producers or
   designers will limit the role that middlemen play in the economy.
   logistics firms, however, will continue to prosper, but the advent of
   driverless transportation will see disruption to industry too.

   bear in mind, any disruption of business will also disrupt the company
   tax base. it may become difficult for government to tax business at
   all         so we might see greater pressure on sales (consumption) taxes and
   even poll taxes.

conclusion

   the blockchain and associated technological changes will massively
   disrupt current economic conditions. the industrial revolution ushered
   in a world where business models were predicated on hierarchy and
   financial capitalism. the blockchain revolution will see an economy
   dominated by human capitalism and greater individual autonomy.

   how that unfolds is unclear at present. entrepreneurs and innovators
   will resolve uncertainty, as always, through a process of trial and
   error. no doubt great fortunes will be made and lost before we know
   exactly how this disruption will unfold.

   our contribution is that we have a clear understanding of a model that
   can be deployed to provide clarity to the disruption as and when it
   occurs.
