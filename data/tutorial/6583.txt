   i hope i have been able to drive home how important basic statistical
   concepts are in machine learning and also put some light on important
   concepts like mean, median and mode.
   [12]basics of statistics for machine learning engineers
   essential statistical concepts if you are interested in machine

   in this post, we will take a look at some more essential concepts such
   as variance and standard deviation, percentiles and moments, covariance
   and bayes    theorem.

variance and standard deviation

   [0*gpvbh_rkt2o4jxhz.jpg]
   [13]source

   variance and standard deviation are essentially a measure of the spread
   of the data in the data set.

   variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. in
   mathematical terms this would mean:
   [0*yxyrdtoi90bmxdhm.]

   where   2 is the variance, n is the number of observations (whole
   population), x is the individual set of observations and    is the mean.
   taking the same example as we took before, if x is given by the
   following numbers,
x = [23, 40, 6, 74, 38, 1, 70]

   then the variance can be calculated as shown below.
observations = [23, 40, 6, 74, 38, 1, 70]
mean = 36
difference_from_the_mean = [13, 4, 30, 38, 2, 35, 34]
square_of_the_differences = [169, 16, 900, 1444, 4, 1225, 1156]
variance = (169+16+900+1444+4+1225+1156)/7 = 4914/7 = 702

   now one question may come to mind as why the variance is given as   2.
   this is because standard deviation is denoted as    and standard
   deviation is the square root of the variance. so in the above case, the
   standard deviation can be calculated as below.
   [0*2qrqtsgtbemni_1u.]

   standard deviation is an excellent way to identify outliers. data
   points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can be
   considered unusual. in many cases, data points that are more than two
   standard deviations away from the mean are not considered in analysis.
   we can talk about how extreme a data point is by asking the question
      how many sigmas away from the mean is this?   

percentiles and moments

   when a value is given x percentile, this means that x percentage of
   values in the distribution is below that value.

   moments try to measure the shape of the id203 distribution
   function. the zeroth moment is the total id203 of the
   distribution which is 1. the first moment is the mean. the second
   moment is the variance. the third moment is the skew which measures how
   lopsided the distribution is. the fourth moment is kurtosis which is
   the measure of how sharp is the peak of the graph.

   moments are important because, under some assumptions, moments are a
   good estimate of how the population id203 distribution is based
   on the sample distribution. we can even have a good feel of how far off
   the population moments are from our sample moments under some realistic
   assumptions. and once the population moments are known that means the
   shape of the population id203 distribution is known as well.

covariance and correlation

   [0*rf2b0rh1qeafhq8-.gif]

   let   s say we have two different attributes of something. covariance and
   correlation are the tools that we have to measure if the two attributes
   are related to each other or not.

   covariance measures how two variables vary in tandem to their means.
   the formula to calculate covariance is shown below.
   [0*43kcfiv5jnw7h1cq.]

   where x and y are the individual values of x and y ranging from i =
   1,2, .., n where the id203 that each value may occur is equal and
   is equal to (1/n). e(x) and e(y) are the means of x and y.

   correlation also measures how two variables move with respect to each
   other. a perfect positive correlation means that the correlation
   coefficient is 1. a perfect negative correlation means that the
   correlation coefficient is -1. a correlation coefficient of 0 means
   that the two variables are independent of each other. the formula for
   finding the correlation coefficient can be found using the following
   formula.
   [0*urwsgazzxg-lgcsh.]

   both correlation and covariance only measure the linear relationship
   between data. they will fail to discover any nth order relationship
   between the two. correlation is a special case of covariance when the
   data is standardized. if we are interested in only knowing if there is
   a relationship then correlation is a better measure as they also
   measure the extent of the relationship.

id203 and statistics

   we use a lot of id203 concepts in statistics and hence in machine
   learning, they are like using the same methodologies. in id203,
   the model is given and we need to predict the data. while in statistics
   we start with the data and predict the model. we look at id203
   and search from data distributions which closely match the data
   distribution that we have. then we assume that the function or the
   model must be the same as the one we looked into in id203 theory.

id155 and bayes    theorem

   [0*hsooqtytpxhkizi7.png]
   [16]source

   id155 is the study of the id203 of two things
   happening together. the way to do this is by applying bayes    theorem
   which provides a simple way for calculating conditional probabilities.

   speaking mathematically, the id203 of the model given the data is
   id203 of the data given the model times the ratio of the
   independent id203 of the model and the independent id203 of
   the data.
   [0*ke3gr8keq_f824mj.]

   bayes    theorem is simple but has profound implications. the degree of
   belief in a machine learning model can also be thought of as
   probabilities and machine learning can be thought of as learning models
   of data. thus, we can consider multiple models, find out the
   probabilities they have given the data and then consider the model
   which has the higher id203. in practice, this may not be that
   simple, but at least it will be easier to understand and not fish on
   routes with zero probabilities.
