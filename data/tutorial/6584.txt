   these days there is a [12]cambrian explosion of various data science
   and machine learning tools that make it very easy to start in machine
   learning. probably, you are someone who has heard about the buzzword
   and wanted to try it out yourself. maybe you have gone through
   tutorials on one of the hot and trending machine learning libraries
   such as [13]scikit-learn and want to have an idea on how to implement
   machine learning. you recognize that [14]you have all the prerequisites
   of a problem that make it suitable for machine learning. you have the
   data set and also a problem that seems to have a pattern to it, but you
   cannot pin it down using an algorithm. you threw the data set to the
   machine learning library and got something as an outcome.

   now, starts the problem. you don   t understand what this    something    is.
   more often than not this    something    is a collection of numbers in
   [15]a weird format. apart from better interpretability, the business
   for which your product or insights are built, wants to know if this is
   the best that can be done. as you are the one who implemented this,
   they want you to prove that this is the state of the art results and if
   not, it   s you who needs to improve the results. and secretly you are
   starting to realize that you have no clue what is happening around you.

   machine learning is a buzzword right now and there are many who would
   be trying their hands at it. therefore, it would help you a great deal
   if you are able to understand a little bit about the intricacies that
   make machine learning tools and libraries so powerful. in this post, we
   will look at the basic statistical concepts that make up the bedrock of
   analysis in machine learning.

types of data

   understanding different types of data will help you in choosing the
   different types of techniques that you may use to get insights into the
   data.

   the major types of data are:
     * numerical:

   [1*c3eq8juyicmux6-3yc6fuw.png]

   this represents some quantifiable thing that you can measure. this can
   be discrete, which is normally the counts of some event. as for
   example, how many times a person visits the same doctor when he is
   sick, or the number of clothes bought by a customer on an ecommerce
   platform. another flavor is that the numerical data can be continuous
   as well. a characteristic of continuous data is that the range can be
   infinite. an example maybe, how much rainfall happened in a given year
   and so on.
     * categorical:

   [1*p7o0puvttk5as1qyagpsfq.png]

   these are data that has no inherent numerical meaning, such as man,
   woman. or the state of birth of a group of people and so on. generally,
   numbers are assigned to these values but the numbers themselves don   t
   mean anything. one of the good ways to denote categorical values is
   through graphs. so, in the figure, the scientists    chandrasekhara
   venkata raman    and    jagadish chandra bose    both have the birthplace as
   india which is shown by the edges.
     * ordinal: this is the mixture of numerical and categorical data. an
       example is the ratings given by a customer as in 5 stars is better
       than 1 star.

mean median mode

   these are the measures of central tendency of a data set.
   [0*kpdxp8pwuq6mwavj.png]
   [16]source

   mean is given by the total of the values of the samples divided by the
   number of samples. in mathematical terms this would mean:
   [0*0vki9ov3jtpyevdc.]

   where x   is the mean and there are n values of x.    means that you need
   to take the sum of all the data points.

   below is an example where the mean of a set of data points is
   calculated.
   [0*436o8geqem4-e8ex.]

   this is a simple example taken to explain discrete data. [17]the mean
   can be calculated in case of continuous data as well.

   to calculate the median, sort the values and take the middle value. to
   illustrate let x denote the following numbers:
x = [23, 40, 6, 74, 38, 1, 70]

   in this case, you would need to sort the list first and then take the
   midpoint to find the median.
sorted_x = [1, 6, 23, 38, 40, 70, 74]

   in this case, the midpoint is 38 since the value 38 divides sorted x
   into 3 values which are smaller than 38 and three values which are
   higher than 38. now, in case there are even number of values then the
   average of the two middle values are taken as the median. the advantage
   of the median over the mean is that median is less susceptible to
   outliers. so, in situations where there is a high chance that [18]there
   may be outliers present in the data set, it is wiser to take the median
   instead of the mean. for example, to understand what is the per capita
   income of a country the median is taken because the rich may be
   extremely rich which would skew the average and show a different
   picture than what the average people might experience. in that case,
   probably, taking the median would give a better insight.

   mode represents the most common value in a data set. mode is most
   useful when you need to understand id91 or number of    hits   . for
   example, a retailer may want to understand the mode of sizes purchased
   so that he can set stocking labels optimally. say, store a has a mode
   of    small    while store b has a mode of    xxl   .

   in this post, we looked at some of the basic statistics that you will
   encounter while looking at data for machine learning. there are some
   more concepts that you need to know and so head over to [19]my next
   post.
