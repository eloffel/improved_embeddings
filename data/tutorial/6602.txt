1.9gb of urban dictionary definitions (1999 - may 2016)

   [rendertimingpixel.png]
   [9]dataset

   i've been meaning to post this for a while - hopefully someone manages
   to do something cool with it! posting anonymously because i'm not sure
   how protective the ud founders are, but i think they'd be cool the the
   data science community playing around with it.

   each word is on it's own line. here's the last line of the file to give
   you an idea of the structure:
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "572fa4e412bfe10f2cf1a640" }, "defid" : 9041433, "definitio
n" : "italian-american slang used for \"*****\", \"****\". if \"*****\" goes too
 heavy for one. and one wants to put it delicately, it can be used. especially i
n brooklyn ny.", "permalink" : "http://puchiacchia.urbanup.com/9041433", "thumbs
_up" : 0, "author" : "the benighted", "word" : "puchiacchia", "current_vote" : "
", "example" : "-you're such a *****!\r\n+what did you just say to me?!\r\n-alri
ght alright, you're a puchiacchia then lol!", "thumbs_down" : 0, "tags" : [  ],
"sounds" : [  ], "lowercase_word" : "puchiacchia" }

   you can use tail -f words.json if you're on linux (or mac?) to have a
   look yourself once you've extracted the file. here's an image of the
   prettified json: [10]http://i.imgur.com/nmkjsbc.png

   you can see that same definition with the api here:
   [11]http://api.urbandictionary.com/v0/define?defid=9041433 note that
   the _id property was added by me and can be disregarded. ditto for the
   lowercase_word property.

   unfortunately it's missing the last year of data, because it was
   scraped in may 2016, but perhaps someone will be able to grab the last
   year's worth and throw them in the comments if there's enough interest
   in this dataset. you can scrape word ids from here:
   [12]http://www.urbandictionary.com/yesterday.php?date=2017-03-29&page=2
   (note that each date has many pages) and then just throw them into the
   urbandictionary api link above. best bet would be to start one month
   prior (april), and just ignore if it's already in the db, because i'm
   not exactly sure what date in may i finished.

   it compressed to around 400mb. if someone could upload mirrors or make
   a torrent out of it and post it in the comments that'd be great because
   i won't be able to personally host it for more than a couple of months.
   also, it's a 7z file, which will be a bit weird for some, but there are
   freeware/open-source extractors for it on every major platform - just
   head over to google. here's the file:

       nitions_corpus/4828954
     * please post a link in the comments if you've made another mirror.

   cheers! :)

   you mean you don't want to teach an id56 how to auto-generate
   urban-dictionary words and definitions?

   i highly suspect that a lot of cultural insights are hidden in that
   data.

   as a simple example, you can try to automatically tag each definition
   with categories for the word and categories for the definition. then
   check how the trends to use innocent words for sex acts and to use sex
   related words for innocent things compare over time. or when people
   started entering definitions for celebrities, and what those
   celebrities were defined as.

   it gets even more interesting when you have datasets for other parts of
   the internet. how is the relation between unusual words appearing on
   4chan/somethingaweful/reddit/etc and them appearing on urban
   dictionary? how does the effect of different communities on urban
   dictionary change over time? how does the effect of urban dictionary on
   the internet change over time?

   can the effects of big events like the malaysian airplane mysteries,
   the 2008 economic crisis, etc. be witnessed in urban dictionary? how
   exactly, and what does that mean from a psychological standpoint?

   there's so much to learn from that data. if only i had infinite time
   and infinite storage.

   not the most noble thing but i know people who run bots, meme
   generators, and stuff like that for which this could be funny fuel.
   substitute the worst swear words for celebrity names, see which
   definitions are still funny.. crap like that :-d

   at my daughter's middle school the teachers use the urban dictionary to
   look up kid's terminology. it usually goes like this:
    1. kid calls someone a strange name.
    2. teacher gets involved and looks up definition.
    3. kid goes to principal's office.

   considering the shitty network they have, someone could create an
   offline urban dictionary for teacher use.
