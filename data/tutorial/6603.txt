full reddit submission corpus now available (2006 thru august 2015)

   [rendertimingpixel.png]
   [7]dataset

   the full reddit submission corpus is now available here:

   [8]http://reddit-data.s3.amazonaws.com/rs_full_corpus.bz2
   (42,674,151,378 bytes compressed)

   sha256sum:
   91a3547555288ab53649d2115a3850b956bcc99bf3ab2fefeda18c590cc8b276

   this represents all publicly available reddit submissions from january
   2006 - august 31, 2015).

   several notes on this data:

   data is complete from january 01, 2008 thru august 31, 2015. partial
   data is available for years 2006 and 2007. the reason for this is that
   the id's used when reddit was just a baby were scattered a bit -- but i
   am making an attempt to grab all data from 2006 and 2007 and will make
   a supplementary upload for that data once i'm satisfied that i've found
   all data that is available.

   i have added a key called "retrieved_on" with a unix timestamp for each
   submission in this dataset. if you're doing analysis on scores, late
   august data may still be too young and you may want to wait for the
   august and september additions that i will make available in october.

   this dataset represents approximately 200 million submission objects
   with score data, author, title, self_text, media tags and all other
   attributes available via the reddit api.

   this dataset will go nicely with the full reddit comment corpus that i
   released a couple months ago. the link_id from each comment corresponds
   to the id key in each of the submission objects in this dataset.

   next steps

   i will provide monthly updates for both comment data and submission
   data going forward. each new month usually adds over 50 million
   comments and approximately 10 million submissions (this fluctuates a
   bit). also, i will split this large file up into individual months in
   the next few days.

   better reddit search

   my goal now is to take all of this data and create a usable reddit
   search function that uses comment data to vastly improve search
   results. reddit's current search generally doesn't do much more than
   look at keywords in the submission title, but the new search i am
   building will use the approximately 2 billion comments to improve
   results. for instance, if someone does a search for einstein, the
   current search will return results where the submission title or self
   text contain the word einstein. using comments, the search i am
   building will be able to see how often einstein is mentioned in the
   body of comments and weight those submissions accordingly.

   an example of this would be if someone posted a question in
   [9]/r/askscience "how is the general theory of relativity different
   than the special theory of relativity?" many of the comments would
   contain "einstein" in the comment bodies, thereby making that
   submission relevant when someone does a search for "einstein." this is
   just one of the methods for improving reddit's search function. i hope
   to have a beta search in place in early december.

   when you do, add that as a webseed link.

   anything under 5gb you can also append .torrent to, and the torrent
   will be automagically created.

   that'd just be cruel if it was all in one file. i'm pretty sure the
   comments dataset was broken out by year through 2014 and then by month
   for 2015.

   keep me in the loop, i'll enjoy the data vicariously through you. i'd
   play myself but i already have too many side projects.

   i've wanted to build an 'inverse search' for reddit for years, but due
   to the data size, only intended to leech links for individual subs via
   the elasticsearch hack.

   the idea would be to index the content of the links, rather than (or in
   addition to) the text of the link or its comments. the link score would
   make a natural addition to full text scoring, not to mention the
   average link score for a given domain, although i'm not sure how you'd
   mix the two scores effectively

   you seem more than capable of doing this, would love to see it in your
   search app
