   is the code open source?

   sentiment140 isn't open source, but there are resources with open
   source code with a similar implementation:
     * [9]text classification for id31 by jacob perkins
     * [10]twitgraph by ran tavory
     * [11]twitter id31 using python and nltk by laurent
       luce
     * [12]twitter sentiment corpus by niek sanders

what algorithm are you using?

   we are using a maximum id178 classifier. [13]read about our machine
   learning approach.

   where is the training data?

   you can download our training data:
     * [14]stanford link
     * [15]google drive link

what is the format of the training data?

   the data is a csv with emoticons removed. data file format has 6
   fields:
   0 - the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
   1 - the id of the tweet (2087)
   2 - the date of the tweet (sat may 16 23:58:44 utc 2009)
   3 - the query (lyx). if there is no query, then this value is no_query.
   4 - the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
   5 - the text of the tweet (lyx is cool)
   if you use this data, please cite sentiment140 as your source.

how was your data collected and annotated?

   our approach was unique because our training data was automatically
   created, as opposed to having humans manual annotate tweets. in our
   approach, we assume that any tweet with positive emoticons, like :),
   were positive, and tweets with negative emoticons, like :(, were
   negative. we used the twitter search api to collect these tweets by
   using keyword search. this is described in our [17]paper.
   where is the tweet corpus for spanish?
   unfortunately, we do not provide the spanish data set.
   what did you use to build this?

   we built this using the following technologies:
     * twitter api
     * amazon ec2 (for the backend)
     * google closure (for the javascript library)
     * google visualization api (for the annotated timeline)
     * google charts api (for the pie and bar charts)
     * google sites (for this documentation)
     * google spreadsheets (for our feedback form)
     * google analytics

   if you are new to the field of id31, we recommend reading
   the following by pang and lee:
   [19]opinion mining and id31
   there are still many unsolved problems in id31. if you're
   interested, you can help us by working on one of the problems below.
     * building a classifier for subjective vs. objective tweets. we've
       focused mostly on classifying positive vs. negative correctly. we
       haven't looked at classifying tweets with sentiment vs. no
       sentiment very closely.
     * handling negation. words like no, not, and never are difficult to
       handle properly.

     * relevant papers:

     * isaac g. councill, ryan mcdonald, and leonid velikovich. 2010.
       what's great and what's not: learning to classify the scope of
       negation for improved id31. [[20]pdf]
     * potts, christopher. 2010. on the negativity of negation. [[21]pdf]

     handling comparisons. our id159 doesn't handle
   comparisons very well. for example, in the phrase "stanford is better
   than berkeley", the tweet would be considered positive for both
   stanford and berkeley using our id159 because it doesn't
   take into account the relation towards "better".

     the "aboutness" problem. given a tweet, automatically detect if the
   sentiment is towards an entity.
     * example:

     * about the term [google]: "i love google."
     * not about the term [google]: "you should google that."

     relevant papers:
     * target-dependent twitter sentiment classification [[22]pdf]

     determine context switches. sometimes tweets contain two different
   ideas. it would be good to be able to segment these two different ideas
   out. here's an example: "just chomped my way through a massive apple,
   was pretty tasty. now for work. business revision."

     building an accurate parser for tweets. dependency parsers, like the
   stanford parser, doesn't handle ungrammatical text very well because
   they were trained on corpuses like the wall street journal . it would
   be great to develop a parser that can handle informal text better.

     sarcasm detection.

     topic classification for tweets.

     tag clouds.  given a list of positive and negative tweets, what are
   the most meaningful words to put in a tag cloud?

     applying id31 to facebook messages. facebook messages
   don't have the same character limitations as twitter, so it's unclear
   if our methodology would work on facebook messages.

     internationalization. we focus only on english sentences, but twitter
   has many international users. it should be possible to use our approach
   to classify sentiment in other languages.

how did it start?

sentiment140 started as a class project from stanford university. we explored
various aspects of id31 classification in the final projects
for the following classes:

     * [23]cs224n natural language processing in spring 2009, taught
       by [24]chris manning
     * [25]cs224u natural language understanding in winter 2010, taught
       by [26]dan jurafsky and [27]bill maccartney
     * [28]cs424p social meaning and sentiment in autumn 2010, taught
       by [29]chris potts and [30]dan jurafsky
