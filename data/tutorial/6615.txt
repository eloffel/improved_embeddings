   a reduced redundancy usenet corpus (2005-2011)

   this corpus is a collection of public usenet postings. this corpus was
   collected between oct 2005 and jan 2011, and covers 47,860 english
   language, non-binary-file news groups (see list of newsgroups included
   with the corpus for details). despite our best efforts to clean this
   corpus, contains a very small percentage of non-english words and
   non-words. no automatic id147 was performed, and no text
   was tranformed. the corpus is untagged, raw text. it may be neccessary
   to process the corpus further to put the corpus in a format that suits
   your needs.

   method of transmission: this file is now hosted on a cloud-based web
   download service. please read the licensing information and then fill
   in the form below to be taken to the download page.
   for those who want the original corpus: the full, un-reduced, corpus
   (2005-2009) is still avaible as a public data set on amazon web
   services. you will need a free aws account to gain access. [8]click
   here to get the corpus through your aws account. it is 36gb,
   compressed. processing: all nntp headers were discarded [there is no
   way to recover them, and this is done to ensure the privacy of the
   authors.] all message bodies that had the same 128bit sha-1 hash as
   other message bodies were discarded (reducing duplication of documents
   from cross-posts). to reduce the amount of garbage data and non-english
   text in the corpus, the following pre-processing steps were taken:
     * all documents that were less than 500 words and greater than
       500,000 words were omitted.
     * documents that contained less than 90% english words were omitted.
       (english words were defined as words that are contained in a
       100,000 words dictionary of english).

   to anonymize the text, we aslo did the following:
     * replaced all of the obvious e-mail addresses with the token
       <emailaddress>.
     * replaced all of the obvious http urls with the token <url> , and
       news urls with <newsurl>.

   unlike previous versions of this corpus released between 2005 and 2012,
   this corpus had further redudant text removal algorithms applied to it.
   this made the corpus smaller, but we hope of higher quality.
   the two extra steps were the following:
   1) any sections of text that were obviously quotes of other posts were
   removed (for example lines beginning with the ">" character).
   2) a hashing algorithm was applied to all paragraphs, assigning a
   unique signature to each paragraph. any paragraphs that appeared more
   than twice in the corpus were removed.
   after applying this redudant text removal algorithm, the size of the
   corpus shrunk from 30 billion words to 7 billion words.
   corpus size:   over 7 billion words,
   data size:   over 8gb, compressed into a single file.
last update:  may, 2011.
