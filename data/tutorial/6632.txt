bayespy - bayesian python

   bayespy provides tools for bayesian id136 with python. the user
   constructs a model as a id110, observes data and runs
   posterior id136. the goal is to provide a tool which is efficient,
   flexible and extendable enough for expert use but also accessible for
   more casual users.

   currently, only id58ian id136 for
   conjugate-exponential family (variational message passing) has been
   implemented. future work includes variational approximations for other
   types of distributions and possibly other approximate id136 methods
   such as expectation propagation, laplace approximations, markov chain
   monte carlo (mcmc) and other methods. contributions are welcome.
