welcome to libpgm![7]  

   libpgm is an endeavor to make bayesian id203 graphs easy to use.
   the effort originates from daphne koller and nir friedman   s
   probabilistic id114 (2009), which provides an in-depth study
   of probabilistic id114 and their applications.

   libpgm was developed at cyberpoint labs during the summer of 2012 by
   charles cabot working under the direction of james ulrich and mark
   raugas. it is provided free of use in accordance with the new bsd

documentation[9]  

   the library consists of a series of importable modules, which either
   represent types of bayesian graphs, contain methods to operate on them,
   or both. the methods    individual documentation pages are found below:

   note that [27]numpy, [28]scipy, and python 2.7 are required for this
   library.

capabilities[29]  

   briefly, the capabilities of this library are:

     *

        sampling

               o forward sampling in a discrete-cpd id110
               o forward sampling in a linear gaussian-cpd bayesian
                 network
               o forward sampling in a hybrid (any cpd type) bayesian
                 network
               o forward sampling in a dynamic 2-tbn id110
               o id150 in a discrete-cpd id110 (given
                 evidence)

     *

        deterministic id136

               o compute the id203 distribution over a specific node
                 or nodes in a discrete-cpd id110 (given
                 evidence, if present)
               o compute the exact id203 of an outcome in a
                 discrete-cpd id110 (given evidence, if
                 present)

     *

        approximative id136

               o compute the approximate id203 distribution by
                 generating samples

     *

        learning

               o learn the cpds of a discrete-cpd id110, given
                 data and a structure
               o learn the structure of a discrete id110, given
                 only data
               o learn the cpds of a linear gaussian id110,
                 given data and a structure
               o learn the strcutre of a linear gaussian id110,
                 given only data
               o learn entire id110s (structures and
                 parameters) from data

input files[30]  

   because bayesian id203 graphs are large and contain a lot of
   data, the library works with .txt files as inputs. the formatting used
   is javascript object notation (json), with some flexibility (the
   [31]dictionary module has the capacity to transform python-style dicts
   to json, for instance). internally, the library stores these files as
   json objects from python   s [32]json library. for examples of the
   formatting, and of the particular data required for each different
   id110 type, see the example input files below:
     * [33]discrete id110
     * [34]linear gaussian id110
     * [35]hybrid id110
     * [36]dynamic discrete id110
