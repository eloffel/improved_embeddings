   today's world is full of data that is easily accessible for anyone. the
   problem now is how to make sense of this data and extract some useful
   insights from the terabytes of raw material. typically, this involves
   using machine learning tools - allowing you to build classifiers,
   cluster data, etc. many of these approaches give you models that
   describe the data accurately, but may be difficult to interpret. if you
   want to be able to understand the result more intuitively it is worth
   looking at id110s - a graphical representation that
   simplifies complex mathematical model into a most likely graph of
   dependencies between your variables. i will talk about bnfinder - a
   python library allowing you to take any tabular data and convert it to
   a much simplified representation of conditional dependencies between
   variables. it can be the used for classification of unseen objects
   while the connection structure can be interpreted even by a non
   specialist. bnfinder is publicly available under gnu gpl and it can be
   used by anyone on their data.

understanding your data with id110s (in python) by bartek
wilczynski pydata sv 2014

    1. 1. understanding your data with id110s (in python)
       bartek wilczy  ski bartek@mimuw.edu.pl university of warsaw pydata
       silicon valey, may 5th 2014
    2. [89]2. are you confused enough? or should i confuse you a bit more
       ? image from xkcd.org/552/
    3. [90]3. data show: confused students score better! data from eric
       mazur
    4. [91]4. there may be factors we haven't thought about     maybe
       confusion helps with learning?     or maybe there is an alternative
       explanation?     as long as these are just cartoon models     we cannot
       really rule out any structure paying attention being confused
       correct answer being confused correct answer or
    5. [92]5. what do i mean by data? sex age smoking stress lung heart
       feel m 0-20 never n no no great f 70 sometimes n minor no ok m
       50-70 daily y no severe not-so-well m 20-50 daily n no minor ok f
       70 never n no minor great f 20-50 sometimes y severe minor
       not-so-well f 20-50 never y no no great m 20-50 sometimes n minor
       no great m 50-70 never y severe no ok f 0-20 never n no severe ok m
       20-50 daily y no no ok m 0-20 daily n no no not-so-well m 20-50
       never n minor no ok .... ... ... ... ... ... ...
    6. [93]6. network of connections smoking (daily, sometimes, never) age
       (0-20,20-50, 50-70,70+) stressful job (yes,no) lung problems
       (no,minor,severe) heart problems (no,minor,severe) sex
       (male,female) how did you feel this morning? (great, ok,
       not-so-well, terrible)
    7. [94]7. what is a id110 ?     a directed acyclic graph
       without cycles     with nodes representing random variables     and
       edges between nodes representing dependencies (not necessarily
       causal)     each edge is directed from a parent to a child, so all
       nodes with connections to a given node constitute its set of
       parents     each variable is associated with a value domain and a
       id203 distribution conditional on parents' values
    8. [95]8. back to our confused students     let us consider our model of
       confused students     we can consider the model with an additional
       variable     we need to heve data on the additional variable to be
       predictive     sometimes we need to use    wrong    models if they are
       predictive paying attention being confused correct answer paying
       attention yes no confused 80% 0% not confused 20% 100% paying
       attention being confused correct answer paying attention yes no
       correct 50% 20% incorrect 50% 80%
    9. [96]9. can we find the    best    id110?     given a dataset
       with observations, we can try to find the    best    network topology
       (i.e. the best collection of parents' sets)     in order to do it
       automatically we need a scoring function to define what we mean by
          best        a score function is useful if it can be written as a sum
       over variables, i.e. the best network consists of best parent sets
       for variables (modulo acyclicity)
   10. [97]10. how to find the best network?     there are generally three
       main approaches to defining bn scores:     bayesian statistics, e.g.
       bde (herskovits et al. '95)     information theoretic, e.g. mdl (lam
       et al. '94)     hypothesis testing, e.g. mmpc (salehi et al. '10)    
       there are also hybrid approaches, like the recent mit (de campos
       '06) approach that uses id205 and hypothesis testing    
       we have two issues:     there are exponentially many potential parent
       sets     the desired network needs to have no cycles     the second
       issue is more important and makes the problem np-complete
       (chickering '96)
   11. [98]11. cycles are not always a problem     dynamic id110s
       are avariant of bn models that describe temporal dependencies     we
       can safely assume that the causal links only go forward in time    
       that breaks the problem of cycles as we now have two versions of
       each variable:    before    and    after    x1 x2 x3 x1 x1 t t+1 x2 x2 x3
       x3
   12. [99]12. different types of variables     another common situation is
       when we have different types of variables     we may know that only
       certain types of connections are causal     or we may be interested
       only in certain types of connections     this breaks the cycles as
       well mutations protein expression diseases
   13. [100]13. bnfinder     python library for id110s     a
       library for identification of optimal id110s     works
       under assumption of acyclicity by external constraints (disjoint
       sets of variables or dynamic networks)     fast and efficient
       (relatively)
   14. [101]14. example1     the simplest possible
   15. [102]15. now, parallellize!     since we have external constraints on
       acyclicity, we can search for parent sets independently     this
       leads to a simple parallelization scheme and good efficiency

   17. [104]17. active inactive
   18. [105]18. making the training set for    activity    variable
   19. [106]19. handling continuous data
   20. [107]20. network model
   21. [108]21. does it provide useful predictions?     12 positive and 4
       negative predictions tested     >90% success (1 error)
   22. [109]22. some more continuous data with perturbations
   23. [110]23.     8008 enhancers compiled from 15 chip experiments (almost
       20k binding peaks)     activity data for ~140 enhancers divided into
           3 tissues (meso, vm, sm)     5 stages (4-6,7-8,9-10,1112,13-16)    
       gene expression data for 5082 genes from the bdgp database
       wilczynski et al.plos comp.biol 2012
   24. [111]24. predictions validated: 19/20 correct stage, 10/20 correct
       tissue
   25. [112]25. summary     id110s can provide predictive models
       based on id155 distributions     bnfinder is an
       effective tool for finding optimal networks given tabular data. and
       it's open source!     it can be used as a commandline tool or as a
       library     it can use continuous data as well as discrete     can be
       run in parallel on multiple cores (with good efficiency)    
       convenience functions (cross-validation, roc plots) included
