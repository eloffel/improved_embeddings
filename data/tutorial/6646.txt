   you   re sold on self driving cars (sdc), right? you   ve read so much
   about the future of mobility and how disruptive self driving cars can
   be. you even keep coming back to this blog    now, let   s try to get some
   first principles about how they work and hopefully see what we can do
   to contribute to self driving progress.

   putting it simply, self driving car is about getting a 4k pounds, 4
   wheeled robot to follow a path. that path can be calculated globally,
   say [11]go from a to b like a taxi and/or locally, [12]going forward in
   a highway without departing the lane. in the process, the car should
   also adapt its speed to not hit objects and plan its path to avoid
   obstacles.

   now, let us assume the simplest case possible. we have a car in a
   highway without any other vehicles around and we want it to go forward
   keeping itself in the center of the lane. we will discuss more general
   cases in other posts or something    for now, see figure 1.
   [1*hkg4vvmaq8itmaqujiphwq.png]
   figure 1. highway lane keeping assist. we want the car to drive itself
   in the center of the lane.

   if you ask me, a human, how i   d solve the problem of keeping a car in
   the center of a lane. i   d say i would verify how far i   m from left and
   right lanes. if i   m too close to the left lane, i   d steer the vehicle
   to the right and vise-versa. i   d use my eyes and spatial intelligence
   to estimate how far each lane is. same thing for speed. if the car is
   too slow i   d press the gas, if it too fast i   d press the brakes. how
   much force or torque i   d place on the pedals and the steering wheel was
   heuristically learned since i was 18, back in brazil. let us forget
   about manual gears for now, since millennials don   t know about it
   anyways   

   the intuition above involved actuators (steering wheel and pedals),
   state measurement (how far i am from each lane and my current speed)
   and the knowledge of a desired state (keep myself in the middle of the
   lane as best as i can while following the speed limits). all that is
   represented in the block diagram of figure 2.

   figure 2. block diagram of the closed loop controls for self
   driving cars.

   assume next that actuation is granted because we hacked our cars to
   steer it programmatically. the problem reduces to measure where the car
   is in the lane and how to control it to the desired state.

sensors: getting the car to find where it is

   there are several ways to calculate how far the car is from each lane.
   if we want to use id161, we can place cameras pointing
   forward or sideways to see the road. classic id161 uses
   [13]edge detectors to estimate the lanes. we can also use deep learning
   to find the lanes         to train that we will need ground truth positions
   that comes either from hand labelling (not scalable) or from other
   sensors like lidars (better). lidars themselves are pretty good for
   finding lane lines because they reflect light differently from asphalt
   (surprise!).

   once we segment out the lanes in the image, we can use geometry to
   calculate their distance to the car. assuming the cameras are stable in
   the car, we can figure a pixel to inches transformation. i may write
   later about id161 and geometry for sdc, but if you are really
   curious already, check out [14]this book. in a [15]paper by ford, they
   used sideway cameras and calculated the position of the lanes using
   deep learning and hand labeled images.

   speed measurement is a bit easier to estimate and already provided by
   the car internals.

controls: actually self driving

   once we know where car is in the road and how fast it is going, we have
   to control it to the desired position and speed. another simplification
   is to assume we can divide the problem in two: longitudinal (how much
   throttle and brake) and lateral (how much torque on the steering
   wheels) controls. that break down will not always work. but we may be
   able to do that in a highway, where curves are gentle.

   the simplest controls method is the proportional integral derivative
   (pid) controller. note that there are several other ways to do
   controls, but we will stick to this one for simplicity. to understand
   how pids work save me some words and watch the (very good) video below:

   video 1. pid controls for self driving cars

   if you watched the video you know that there are 3 parameters to be
   defined for each controller. in a perfect world, we would know exactly
   how each actuation command moves the car. in other words, we would know
   the function that gets steering wheel angles and speed as inputs and
   outputs the car movement. in real life, we don   t know that function and
   modelling car dynamics is a kinda hard. see [17]this book if you
   believe that physics or it didn   t happen.

   we need that vehicle dynamics function to define the best pid. since
   that model of the car might not be perfect, in practice engineers
   usually have to do hand tuning of the pid until the car drives well
   enough. if the pid or whatever controls strategy was used to steer the
   car was not well tuned, we may get a system that wobbles the car
   between lanes.

   machine learning can be used for estimating a good vehicle model. when
   we have a good vehicle model, there exist other controls methods that
   may work better, like [18]lqr, [19]model-predictive control, etc. check
   out what the [20]stanford helicopter project did for instance.

a note about end-to-end self driving cars

   in the context of sdcs end-to-end driving refers to using deep learning
   to get a camera feed as input and output the driving decisions a human
   would take to drive the car. that doesn   t work well yet. yes, we can
   learn to regress images to steering wheel angles using deep learning.
   that doesn   t mean, for instance, that the deep neural network learned
   the physics of the problem. this is an innovative strategy and kinda
   works for defining steering wheel commands that goes to the pid loops
   as the desired path instead of center of the lane. this is particularly
   useful when there are no lanes to be detected. but neural nets
   generalize only so well as the test data follows a similar distribution
   to the training data. for example, neural nets have a hard time doing
   position recovery once the car start departing the lane. think about
   it, we don   t usually collect self driving car data falling asleep and
   waking up to recover the right position, neither do we drive recklessly
   to get the car in a weird positions in public roads for training
   purposes.

   i think that learning rules of physics from video is one of the most
   important lines of machine learning research right now. but there is
   only so much we can learn from a static dataset as used to train
   end-to-end self driving cars. [21]i argued before that something like
   [22]openai roboschool would be a much smarter and principled approach.

open problems

   if you were paying attention until now, you saw how many
   simplifications we had to make: highway only, separate longitudinal and
   lateral controls, imperfect vehicle dynamics model, simple pid
   controls, ground truths to find lanes in the road, etc.

   out of those problems, the ones regarded as the hardest are the
   perception problems, i.e. finding the lanes and drivable paths. that is
   fair to say since engineers know controls well enough for quite
   sometime now. if machine learning/id161 people can come up
   with good vehicle state and surroundings estimation, controls people
   are competent enough to know exactly what to do next. this helps to
   understand why most of the startups in sdc pitch themselves as
   localization or perception companies.

   that said, the way we discussed sdc in this post will only help solve
   the simplified highway problem. the full story will require dynamic
   path planning, handling other vehicles and people around in the
   streets. but let   s leave further discussions to future posts.
