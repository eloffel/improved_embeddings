   as we all know, there are pros and cons associated with every
   technology     and ai (artificial intelligence) is no exception to this
   rule. however, it becomes very important for us as technology consumers
   and producers to identify those challenges and minimize the associated
   risks and at the same time make sure that we take full advantage of
   this technology.

   in this article, i will break down the potential challenges that ai
   developers need to address to make sure that ai is accepted as a friend
   and not as a foe, given the kind of media attention it is getting    
   especially around the fact that it is going to take away our jobs.

ethical/moral challenges

   the widespread use of ai raised a number of issues that have yet to be
   addressed. as we know, ai bots are becoming better at mimicking human
   conversations. for example, in 2015, a bot named eugene goostman won
   the turing challenge for the first time. in this challenge, human
   raters used text input to converse with an unknown entity, then guessed
   whether they had been chatting with a human or a machine. eugene
   goostman fooled more than half of the human raters into thinking that
   they'd been talking to a human being.

   now, think about this capability getting into the wrong hands. what
   havoc could it wreck? how could it prove to be detrimental to society?
   the most popular are dating bots, where a computer program (chatbot)
   that uses artificial intelligence strikes up conversations with dating
   site users, enabling the scammer to "talk" with multiple potential
   victims at once. these discussions are primarily aimed to trick and get
   users to send them money or download malware onto their pc.

   this may also be targeting victims for identity theft or other criminal
   activities. this is one of the many ethical challenges that ai might
   pose to society.

legal challenges

   legal challenges related to ai's application in the financial industry
   could be related to the consequences of erroneous algorithms and data
   governance. erroneous algorithms, due to the lack of appropriate data,
   can leave a big dent in the profits of an organization by making
   incorrect and perhaps detrimental predictions. poor data governance can
   result in data breaches where customers' pii (personal identifiable
   information) that acts as a feedstock to an algorithm may get into the
   hands of hackers and can cause legal challenges for the organization.

autonomous weapons

   most researchers believe and agree that a superintelligence ai is
   unlikely to showcase human emotions like love or hate and that
   therefore, it cannot become intentionally benevolent or malevolent.
   however, the most likely scenario where it can pose a threat to the
   society is via autonomous weapons. these are weapons that ai systems
   are programmed to use to kill. if in the hands of the wrong person,
   these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. this could even lead
   to an ai war that would also result in mass causalities.

   it is worth mentioning that stephen hawking, elon musk, bill gates, and
   many other big names in science and technology have recently expressed
   concerns about the risks posed by ai. because ai has the potential and
   power to be more intelligent than any human, we have no sure way of
   predicting how it will behave.

ai myths

   not everything you hear about ai is true. let's look at few myths
   related to ai and clear up some of the most common misconceptions about
   it.

   after looking at a few challenges and threats related to ai, it is my
   duty to talk about its benefits as well. i couldn't find anything
   better than this visual produced by narrative science around how ai is
   helping business owners make data-driven decisions:

   [34]dave mccandless had stated that data is not the new oil     it   s the
   new soil, as it acts as a fertile land to nurture and grow the digital
   economy. ai can help organizations mine for the golden nuggets found
   within their databases by processing billions of data points in a
   fraction of minutes. the best part is that ai is dynamic in nature as
   it is always learning and adapting to the new trends.

   industries such as manufacturing, rpa technology has made simple yet
   time-consuming tasks automated and helped the industry to free its
   valuable resources to do more specialized work. it has helped leading
   organizations become more productive so that more time and money can be
   invested in engaging with the workforce. this, in turn, creates a solid
   and caring organizational culture and keep the employee turnover low.

   in the end, i would just like to say that the key to success with ai is
   to not be seduced by its capabilities. no technology offers a silver
   bullet. rather, organizations should focus on how they can responsibly
   reduce the ill effects of this technology by minimizing the challenges
   and leveraging the benefits and by creating a clear technology adoption
   roadmap that understands its core capabilities.
