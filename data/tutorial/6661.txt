[46]discovertext is sponsoring a student data challenge on    fake    news
detection using a corpus of 20 million    trump    tweets collected between april
and august 2016.

   the challenge
       build a model of fake news on twitter
       submit the model using a short video (=<60 seconds)
   requirements
       teams must use our dataset and online collaborative tools, which we
   will provide for free.
       data export is prohibited.
       the model must focus on the nature and scope of fake news itself, not
   external analyses of it.
       qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods models are all welcome.
       collaborative teams must include 2 or 3 students at any educational
   institution.
       faculty supervisors may join one or more teams.
       the challenge is open to students in any country.
       the final report simply needs to be in english.
       entry deadline is now extended to april 1, 2017
       see [47]video update #1 about the data samples
       links to videos presenting the model in 60 seconds or less on youtube
   must be tweeted with the hashtag #fakenewsdetection.

   prizes
   1st prize: $100 for each student.
   2nd prize: $50 for each student.
   3rd prize: $25 for each student.

   every team that submits a video will retain an academic discovertext
   license for the remainder of 2017.

   background
   there are many ways to explore the metadata, tweet text data, images,
   news links (both fake and real), to test and refine student hunches
   about the scope and nature of fake news disseminated on twitter. our
   goal is to share these models with academic research community and to
   support a variety of methodologies for human or automated fake news
   detection. there is no a priori labeled data or ground truth. everyone
   gets the same unlabeled data and the same tools to build models.
   everyone builds their own models. anyone can collaborate with anyone
   else on the system (not restricted to your team). how you define and
   deliver the model is entirely up to you. we have no idea what fake news
   is   yet. it seems to mean a lot of different things to different people.
   we are looking for models that make sense to most people.

   start here
       have each member of the team sign up for a free trial discovertext
   account.
        [48]https://discovertext.com/start-a-free-trial/
       send an email to info@discovertext.com with your team name and a list
   of team member names and emails.
       identify a student team leader who can manage the project and serve
   as a point of contact.

   training
       schedule a web meeting to go over some of the e-discovery, human
   coding, and machine-learning techniques.
       review the discovertext help guides and faqs:
