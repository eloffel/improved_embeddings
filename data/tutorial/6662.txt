   file photo: a bitcoin sign is seen in a window in toronto, canada, may
   8, 2014. reuters/mark blinch/file photo thomson reuters the blockchain
   revolution is coming   

   and it's going to fundamentally change how businesses operate.

   make no mistake    this revolution is at least as significant as the one
   brought about by the internet. it will disrupt every single business on
   the face of the earth.

   that's why it's vital that you learn to understand this technology. it
   will offer countless investing opportunities in the years ahead    and it
   will play a central role in future years in how you (and, without
   question, your children) work, do business, play, and operate in
   society.

   i know that sounds like a lot. but bear with me as i explain a bit   

   (and, if you want to hear from two of the world's blockchain experts
   about how this is going to happen - and how to invest in it - [113]sign
   up for our live webinar (it's on wednesday night in the u.s. and
   thursday morning in asia.))

understanding blockchain

   "blockchain" is one of those words that has the power to confuse even
   the smartest people. and the media is completely clueless about how
   this technology actually works.

   for starters, blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like
   bitcoin.

   the bitcoin blockchain allows us to transfer the bitcoin currency
   person to person without any intermediary. when i transfer u.s. dollars
   to you, we either have to do it in person - with me handing you cash -
   or through the banking system, which involves me telling my bank to
   send money to your bank account.

   (bitcoin with a capital "b" refers to the blockchain, whereas bitcoin
   with a lowercase "b" refers to the cryptocurrency.)

   but how does this actually work?

   think of the bitcoin blockchain as a giant excel spreadsheet that shows
   the complete transaction history and location of every bitcoin.

   every 10 minutes the spreadsheet gets updated as an additional "block"
   of new transactions is added to the spreadsheet.

   everyone can have their own copy of the spreadsheet. it's completely
   transparent.

   let's say jim sends 1 bitcoin to sally. when the transaction is
   processed by the blockchain, the spreadsheet is updated. jim's balance
   is decreased by a bitcoin, and sally's is credited one.

   but who updates the spreadsheet? and how do we stop people from trying
   to make false updates to the spreadsheet, awarding themselves more
   bitcoin, or trying to send the same bitcoin to two different people at
   the same time?

   that's the job of what are called nodes, which are also known as
   miners. nodes are the computers or large computer systems that support
   the bitcoin network and keep it running smoothly. nodes are run by
   individuals or groups of people who contribute money towards buying
   powerful computer systems, known as mining rigs.

   there are two types of nodes, full nodes and lightweight nodes.

   full nodes keep a complete copy of the blockchain (i.e., the giant
   excel spreadsheet). this is a record of every single transaction that
   has ever occurred. this is currently around 150 gigabytes in size. (for
   reference, the largest usb thumb drives usually max out at about 128
   gigabytes.)

   lightweight nodes, on the other hand, only download a fraction of the
   blockchain. lightweight nodes are used by most folks for bitcoin
   transactions. a lightweight node will communicate to a full node when
   it wants to transact.

   so the full nodes (or miners) run the spreadsheet, but how do they keep
   the spreadsheet synchronised between them all? this is the key,
   considering there's no limit to the number of people who can run their
   own full node.

   stansberry churchouse research

how do nodes process transactions?

   let's go back to jim and sally. jim wants to send 1 bitcoin to sally.

   sally creates a bitcoin wallet. anyone can create a bitcoin wallet in a
   couple of minutes (we wrote a complimentary report outlining how to do
   this, which you can access by [114]clicking here). when you create your
   wallet, there are two pieces of information created for you:
    1. your public key: also known as a public address, or your bitcoin
       address. it's a string of numbers and letters. think of it like an
       account user name.
    2. your private key: this is effectively your bitcoin password, and
       you need to keep it safe. if you lose it, it means you lose access
       to your bitcoin. (there's no centralised entity that can recover
       your password for you - it's not like if you forget your facebook
       password and you have email instructions sent to you to reset it.)
       - and if someone else gets it, they can take your bitcoin.

   sally tells jim her public key. jim opens his bitcoin wallet, puts in
   the instruction to send 1 bitcoin to sally's public address, enters in
   his private key (password) to authorise the transaction and hits send.

   stansberry churchouse research

   after a few minutes, sally checks her wallet again, and sees she now
   has a bitcoin in her wallet. but what's happening behind the scenes?

   first, the network (in this case a lightweight node) makes a quick
   check of the proposed transaction. it checks to see that jim has enough
   bitcoin in his account. and it checks if the address sally provided is
   a valid bitcoin address.

   after the transaction passes those two tests, the transaction gets
   bundled together with other pending transactions into a "block".

   that block then goes to the miners. the goal of the miners is to verify
   the block, and add it to the blockchain (i.e., update the spreadsheet).

   stansberry churchouse research

   how does a miner get to add a block to the blockchain? this is where
   brute force mining comes into play.

hashes, and how mining works

   to understand this, we need to touch upon hashes.

   a hash value is a series of numbers and letters strung together that
   looks something like this: 1gwv7fpx97hmavc6inruz36j5h2kfi803jnhg.

   a hash value is generated by pushing data through a mathematical
   formula called a hash function.

   another way to think of this is like the ingredients for a smoothie and
   a blender.

   you take your ingredients (your data), put it through a blender (the
   hash function) and you get your smoothie (the hash value).

   hashing is a one-way process. when you give me a hash value, i can't
   turn it back into its original input data, in the same way i can't turn
   my smoothie back into its original ingredients.

   stansberry churchouse research

   when miners are given a block of transactions to try and add to the
   blockchain, they are using a hash function to try and solve a
   cryptographic puzzle.

   the miners take the new block with all the transactions in it, combine
   it with a randomly generated number string (called a nonce), put it
   through a hash function and then get a particular hash value.

   what a miner is trying to do is find a hash value that starts with a
   specific number of 0s. they will keep trying different nonces until
   they get the necessary hash value.

   this trial and error computation is shown in step 1 and step 2 in the
   diagram below.

   stansberry churchouse research

   all the miners are in a race to find the correct hash value. this is
   because the miner who finds it (step 3) will broadcast the correct
   solution to the network (step 4), who will verify it is correct.

   stansberry churchouse research

   the new block then gets added to the blockchain (step 5), and the
   winning miner gets awarded 12 bitcoin by the blockchain for his
   success. this is worth around us$55,000 in today's prices.

   stansberry churchouse research

   sally's bitcoin transaction is now recorded in the blockchain. sally's
   bitcoin wallet is now credited a bitcoin, and jim's is debited one.

   the mining process then starts over again, with a whole new bunch of
   transactions bundled into a new block, and the miners all compete again
   to find the correct hash value.

bitcoin is the "proof of concept"

   in the media, bitcoin tends to hog the headlines when it comes to
   cryptocurrencies. but bitcoin itself is just the proof of concept for
   blockchain. bitcoin's success has shown the world it is possible for
   independent and fragmented entities (miners) to enable strangers to
   exchange value with no need for an intermediary. and it can be done in
   a completely transparent, verifiable and open way.

   as email is one use case for the internet, so too is bitcoin a single
   use case for blockchain. there will be countless uses for blockchain in
   the future    from contracts that don't require any intermediary to
   creating completely decentralised businesses built on blockchains. and
   there are countless opportunities for investors.

   if you're ready to get started with cryptocurrencies and blockhain,
   i'll be teaming up with the head of one of the most successful
   blockchain companies of all time and porter stansberry, the head of
   stansberry research (with which stansberry churchouse research is
   closely affiliated) [115]in a special live webinar on october 18 (or
   the morning of october 19 here in asia). this webinar will be a unique
   opportunity to expand your understanding of cryptocurrencies. you don't
   want to miss it.
