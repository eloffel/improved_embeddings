what is this?

   potara is a id57 system that relies on integer
   id135 (ilp) and sentence fusion.

   its goal is to summarize a set of related documents in a few sentences.
   it proceeds by fusing similar sentences in order to create sentences
   that are either shorter or more informative than those found in the
   documents. it then uses ilp in order to choose the best set of
   sentences, fused or not, that will compose the resulting summary.

   it relies on state-of-the-art (as of 2014) approaches introduced by
   gillick and favre for the ilp strategy, and filippova for the sentence
   fusion.

   it is compatible and tested with python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.

install

the easy way

   you should be able to install potara and its dependencies with pip
pip install potara

   you can also clone this repo and use the requirements.txt file to
   install dependencies

further requirements

   you will also need glpk, which is used to obtain an optimal summary
   (example for debian-based distro)
$ sudo apt-get install glpk

   for ubuntu-based distros you can use:
$ sudo apt-get install libglpk40

   you can check that the install run successfully by cloning the repo and
   running
$ python setup.py test

   if you have issues with install, you can check the .travis.yml file of
   the repo, which corresponds to a working build.

how to

   basically, you can use the following
from summarizer import summarizer
import document

s = summarizer()

# adding docs, preprocessing them and computing some infos for the summarizer
s.setdocuments([document.document('data/' + str(i) + '.txt')
                for i in range(1,10)])

# summarizing, where the actual work is done
s.summarize()

# you can then print the summary
print(s.summary)

   there's some preprocessing involved and a sentence fusion step, but i
   made it easily tunable. preprocessing may take a while (a few minutes)
   since there is a lot going on under the hood. default parameters are
   currently set for summarizing ~10 documents. you can summarize a
   smaller amount of documents by tweaking the "minbigramcount" parameter
   of the summarizer :

   s = summarizer(minbigramcount=2)

   summarizing less than 4 documents would probably yield a bad summary.

similarity models

   potara relies on similarity scores between sentences. these scores can
   be shallow using a cosine similarity, or "deep" using gensim id97
   semantic representation of words. for the second use case, you'll want
   to train your own model or use pretrained models. you may contact me if
   you want to use potara that way, and i may create a tutorial on the
   matter for the occasion.
