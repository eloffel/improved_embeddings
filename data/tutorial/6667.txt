   this project is about explaining what machine learning classifiers (or
   models) are doing. at the moment, we support explaining individual
   predictions for text classifiers or classifiers that act on tables
   (numpy arrays of numerical or categorical data) or images, with a
   package called lime (short for local interpretable model-agnostic
   explanations). lime is based on the work presented in [87]this paper
   ([88]bibtex here for citation). here is a link to the promo video:

   [89]kdd promo video

   our plan is to add more packages that help users understand and
   interact meaningfully with machine learning.

   lime is able to explain any black box classifier, with two or more
   classes. all we require is that the classifier implements a function
   that takes in raw text or a numpy array and outputs a id203 for
   each class. support for scikit-learn classifiers is built-in.

installation

   the lime package is on [90]pypi. simply run:
pip install lime

   or clone the repository and run:
python setup.py install

screenshots

   below are some screenshots of lime explanations. these are generated in
   html, and can be easily produced and embedded in ipython notebooks. we
   also support visualizations using matplotlib, although they don't look
   as nice as these ones.

two class case, text

   negative (blue) words indicate atheism, while positive (orange) words
   indicate christian. the way to interpret the weights by applying them
   to the prediction probabilities. for example, if we remove the words
   host and nntp from the document, we expect the classifier to predict
   atheism with id203 0.58 - 0.14 - 0.11 = 0.31.

tutorials and api

   for example usage for text classifiers, take a look at the following
   two tutorials (generated from ipython notebooks):
     * [95]basic usage, two class. we explain id79 classifiers.
     * [96]multiclass case

   for classifiers that use numerical or categorical data, take a look at
   the following tutorial (this is newer, so please let me know if you
   find something wrong):
     * [97]tabular data
     * [98]tabular data with h2o models

   for image classifiers:
     * [99]images - basic
     * [100]images - faces
     * [101]images with keras
     * [102]mnist with id79s

   for regression:
     * [103]simple regression

   the raw (non-html) notebooks for these tutorials are available
   [105]here.

   the api reference is available [106]here.

what are explanations?

   intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the
   model's behaviour. while the model may be very complex globally, it is
   easier to approximate it around the vicinity of a particular instance.
   while treating the model as a black box, we perturb the instance we
   want to explain and learn a sparse linear model around it, as an
   explanation. the figure below illustrates the intuition for this
   procedure. the model's decision function is represented by the
   blue/pink background, and is clearly nonlinear. the bright red cross is
   the instance being explained (let's call it x). we sample instances
   around x, and weight them according to their proximity to x (weight
   here is indicated by size). we then learn a linear model (dashed line)
   that approximates the model well in the vicinity of x, but not
   necessarily globally. for more information, [107]read our paper, or
   take a look at [108]this blog post.
