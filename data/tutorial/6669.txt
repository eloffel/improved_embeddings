how do i build an id86 system: tools?

   [20]january 26, 2017 [21]ehudreiter

   another academic (not an id86 expert) recently emailed me and asked    how
   do i build a simple id86 system    (in her case, to summarise the results
   of simulations).  good question, and one i have been asked many
   times.lets start by looking at tools.

commercial id86 tools

   the best id86 toolkit on the planet is [22]arria   s [23]articulator pro.
    of course i may be biased, because i helped to build articulator pro   
      it covers the complete data-to-text pipeline (including analytics as
   well as id86); has a plugin architecture so its easy to add in new
   algorithms and modules; is supported by extensive documention,
   tutorials, and training material; has been used, refined, and debugged
   for years within arria before being sold as a toolkit; and includes an
   [24]eclipse plugin for authoring.  enough, you probably get the idea!
   i am not an unbiased observer, but i do absolutely think that
   articulator pro is a great toolkit and the best way to build an id86
   system in 2017.

   unfortunately for academics and students, articulator pro is currently
   only available on a commercial license at commercial pricing.   perhaps
   this will change in the future, if so i will let people know.

   a number of arria   s competitors also offer id86 toolkits, but i dont
   have first-hand experience with these.  my impression is that automated
   insights [25]wordsmith is more a souped-up version of a
   [26]mail-merge tool than what i would consider to be an id86 toolkit.  i
   *think* yseop [27]compose has a bit more id86 functionality, and [28]ax
   semantics seem to have [29]some linguistics in its offering.  but this
   is all speculation since i havent actually tried any of these tools.
   if any of the above-mentioned companies make their tool available to
   me, i promise to honestly review it in this blog.  as far as i know,
   all of these tools (like articulator pro) are currently only available
   on a commercial license.

open-source id86 tools

   of course academics, students, and indeed many companies prefer
   open-source tools for building systems.  and there are quite a few good
   open-source toolkits available for building nlp systems, including
   [30]nltk and [31]gate.

   if we turn to id86, there are a number of open-source surface realisers
   available, including [32]simpleid86, [33]openid35, and [34]kpml.
   simpleid86 is probably the most widely used open-source realiser,
   especially by system-builders (as opposed to id86 researchers); it has
   the least functionality but also is the easiest to use and best
   documented.  i should again warn people that i may be biased about
   simpleid86 (as well as articulator pro), since i [35]created the
   original versions of simpleid86. but i   m still pretty sure that
   simpleid86 is the most widely used open-source realiser.

   there are also several    lightweight id86    packages which do things like
   morphological generation, such as [36]inflect and [37]inflection, which
   can be invoked from scripting languages such as python or ruby.

   of course what a lot of people want is a complete id86 system/framework
   which they can configure to their needs, without doing much
   programming.  the closest i have seen to this in the open-source world
   is [38]naturalowl, which can be used to generate descriptions of owl
   classes and individuals.

   there is a lot of interest in the research community in statistical
   id86, but i am not aware of any open-source statistical id86 toolkit
   which has been widely used outside the group which created it.  if i am
   wrong about this, let me know and i will update this blog!  the one
   partial exception is openid35, which [39]supports statistical language
   models.

conclusion

   we are starting to see good commercial tools for building id86 systems,
   such as arria   s articulator pro, but open-source id86 tools are limited.
