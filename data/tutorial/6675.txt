                          the spoken wikipedia corpora

   [swc-unites-wikipedia-with-academia.svg] the spoken wikipedia project
   unites volunteer readers of wikipedia articles. hundreds of spoken
   articles in multiple languages are available to users who are     for one
   reason or another     unable or unwilling to consume the written version
   of the article. we turn this speech resource into a time-aligned
   corpus, making it accessible for research and to foster new ways of
   interacting with the material.

   [3][posterhochkant.png]

   the swc is a corpus of aligned spoken wikipedia articles from the
   [4]english, [5]german, and [6]dutch wikipedia. this corpus has several
   outstanding characteristics:
     * hundreds of hours of aligned audio
     * from a diverse set of readers
     * about a diverse set of topics
     * in a well-researched textual genre
     * licensed under a free license ([7]cc by-sa 4.0)
     * annotations can be mapped back to the original html
     * phoneme-level alignments

                                      news

     * 2018-07: [8]state-of-the-art id103 using swc: uses the
       swc data to gain a wer reduction of 26%, achieves a wer of 14.
     * 2018-06: [9]experiments regarding correlation between syntax and
       id144 using swc: accepted @ interspeech 2018! see below at
       "publications".
     * 2017-12: our journal article in language resources and evaluation
       has been accepted! see below at "publications".
     * 2017-11: arne wrote [10]a blog post with examples for working with
       swc data (scroll down, it starts with validation and comparisons
       between xml and json)
     * 2017-10: new release of the finalized swc corpora (see below). more
       data, more quality, more annotation
     * please participate in our [11]rating experiment on speech quality
       (if you are a german speaker)!
     * have a look at the amazing [12]wikipedia-reader ([13]example data)
       which allows to hyperlisten to the spoken wikipedia (and is based
       on the swc); also have a look at the [14]paper which proves the
       amazingness :-).
     * the swc has its own [15]islrn.

                             the annotation format

   each article is tokenized into sections, sentences, and tokens. each
   token is normalized and the id172 is aligned to the audio.

   annotation layer visualized
   exemplary annotation of    500 hours of audio.    with swc annotation that
   binds text to audio above and html markup that adds hypertextuality
   below. the swc annotation marks sentences (s), tokens (t) and adds
   id172 information (n), which refers to the audio. note that the
   whitespace ([ ]) between words are original characters that are
   attached to the sentence but are not part of any token.

   we treat the html as a second layer of annotation to the plain text, as
   can be seen above. both annotations are linked by the exact text
   correspondence. in addition, we have a phoneme-level alignment, which
   is not pictured.

   have a look at [26]the swc schema definition (relaxng compact), which
   defines and explains the annotation in detail.
