global neural id35 parsing with optimality guarantees

   this repository contains the code for replicating results from
   [78]global neural id35 parsing with optimality guarantees at emnlp
   ([79]lee et al., 2016).

dependencies

     * java 8
          + sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
          + sudo apt-get update
          + sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
     * maven
          + sudo apt-get install maven
     * latest version of bazel
          + see installation instructions here:
            [80]https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install-ubuntu.ht
            ml
     * boost
          + sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
          + note that boost is not directly used, but it is a dependency
            for legacy reasons.

setting up

     * make user the java_home environment variable is set correctly, e.g.
          + export java_home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
     * run ./setup.sh to download data and compile jni binaries.
     * download and extract id35bank data from
       [81]https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2005t13.
     * move the id35bank_1_1 directory to the data directory.

running experiments

     * the experiments directory contains .conf files that specify
       experiments and stages of the experiment.
     * use ./run.sh <config> <goal> <port> to run an experiment that
       launches the specified goal stage and its dependent goal stages.
     * an experiment summary (e.g. progress, logs, and intermediate
       results) is hosted locally, and is accessible via a web browser at
       the given port, e.g. localhost:8080.

learning

     * training: ./run.sh experiments/train.conf train 8080
     * dev evaluation: ./run.sh experiments/eval.conf eval-checkpoints
       8081

demo

     * demo with the released model: ./run.sh experiments/demo.conf demo
       8080
     * go the experiment summary page to access the demo.
