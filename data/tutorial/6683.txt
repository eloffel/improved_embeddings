cornell amr semantic parser

quick start

   you can get started and parse a few simple sentences in under five
   minutes using our ami image (ami-bdc8d8d7). launch an ec2 instance
   (recommended r3.2xlarge at least) with our ami image. the code in the
   image is fully complied and ready to run. the ~/amr/do.sh command will
   quickly parse a few example sentences. the ami is based on ubuntu and
   the user name is ubuntu. the code repository is available [95]here.

requirements

   java 8.

preparing the repository

     * get all required resources: ./getres.sh (form the root of the
       repository)
     * compile: ant dist

pre-trained models

   a pre-trained model is available to download [96]here.

parsing

   given a file sentences.txt, which contains a sentence on each line, and
   a model file amr.sp, both located in the root of the repository:
java -xmx8g -jar dist/amr-1.0.jar parse rootdir=`pwd` modelfile=`pwd`/amr.sp sen
tences=`pwd`/sentences.txt

   the output files will be in experiments/parse/logs. to see the full set
   of options (including increasing the logging level), run:

   java -jar dist/amr-1.0.jar

preparing the data (required only for training and testing)

   to re-create our experiments, obtain the amr bank release 1.0
   ([97]ldc2014t12) form ldc. extract the corpus to the directory
   corpus/amr_anno_1.0.

   then run the following:
     * compile the code: ant dist
     * prepare the environment: utils/config.sh
     * prepare the data: utils/prepdata-ldc.sh
