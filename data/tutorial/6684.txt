readme.md

   easysrl builds logical forms for natural language sentences, by jointly
   modelling id35 and semantic role labelling. it uses an efficient a*
   parsing algorithm, meaning it can be used to process large corpora. a
   demo is online [69]here.

   if you use the parser for research, please cite the following paper:
@inproceedings{lewis:2015,
  title={joint a* id35 parsing and semantic role labelling},
  author={lewis, mike and he, luheng and zettlemoyer, luke},
  booktitle={empirical methods in natural language processing},
  year={2015}
}

   a pretrained model is available [70]here.

   if parsing questions, use [71]this model instead.

   basic usage:
    java -jar easysrl.jar --model modelfolder

   for id35 syntactic output, use:
    java -jar easysrl.jar --model modelfolder --outputformat id35bank

   for semantic role labelling output, use:
    java -jar easysrl.jar --model modelfolder --outputformat srl

   to get n-best parses:
    java -jar easysrl.jar --model modelfolder --nbest 10 --supertaggerbeam 0.001

   please contact mike lewis with any questions or feature requests (email
   address in the paper).
