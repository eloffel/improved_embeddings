   sequence to sequence models are the models which takes sequence input
   and outputs a sequence.

   sequence to sequence

   the encoder,which is a id56, takes input and encodes that to a vector.

   the last hidden state of the encoder gives the encoded vector.

   the encoded vector is repeated n times where n=number of time steps of
   output.

   the decoder, which is also a id56, takes encoded vector and previous
   states as inputs and gives the output.

the number of time steps in the encoder and decoder need not to be equal.

why id195?

   when you want to generate the output after seeing the whole input
   sentence, id195 model can be used.

   for example in machine translation, the first word in the translated
   sentence may depend upon the last word in the input sentence.

image captioning

   in image captioning, the textual description of an image is generated.

the training data consists of images with their corresponding captions.

   the encoder is now replaced with a convolutional neural network. the
   output from the last hidden state is given to a decoder id56.
