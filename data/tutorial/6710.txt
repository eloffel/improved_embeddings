ising model

model description

   in its simplest form, the ising model consists of a nxn lattice of
   binary variables $x_i \in \{-1,+1\}$ that are locally connected
   horizontally and vertically with pairwise potentials. there can also be
   an external field applied to the variables that biases them toward a
   particular state. the total energy of a simple ising model we consider
   here is defined as $$e = - j \sum_{(i,j) \in e} x_i x_j - j_b \sum_{i
   \in v} b_i x_i$$ where the first sum is over all edges of the lattice
   and the second over all nodes. $j, j_b, b_i$ are the strength of
   pairwise interactions, strength of external field, and per-pixel binary
   desired values. the corresponding un-normalized id203
   distribution over states of the lattice is: $$\pi(x) = exp\{ j
   \sum_{(i,j) \in e} x_i x_j + j_b \sum_{i \in v} b_i x_i \}$$

sampling from the model

   id150 can be used to draw samples from this distribution as
   follows: given a sample $x$, produce a candidate new sample $x'$ by
   flipping a single variable ($ x_i' = -x_i$). next, compute the
   acceptance id203: $$ \alpha(x'|x) = min(1,
   \frac{\pi(x')}{\pi(x)}) $$ and let the next sample be $x'$ with
   id203 $\alpha(x'|x)$, or repeat $x$ otherwise. clearly, if
   $\pi(x') > \pi(x)$, the state will transition to $x'$ with certainty.
   however, if $\pi(x') < \pi(x)$, the sample will only be accepted with
   some id203 that is based on how much worse it is.
   the id150 process is illustrated on the right, where the
   potential strengths $j, j_b$ can be manipulated. when $j$ is positive,
   the low energy states are smooth regions, as this minimizes the number
   of edges that connect nodes of different values. when $j$ is negative,
   the reverse happens as the model assigns higher probabilities to states
   with many crossing edges.

applications

   this example is a special case of an ising model, which is a special
   case of a pairwise markov random field, which is a special case of a
   markov random field (phew). these models are often used to "clean up"
   some set of raw, noisy measurements in various applications by
   incorporating more global knowledge, usually in form of soft smoothness
   constraints between neighboring measurements.

psuedocode

// naive gibbs sampler for the ising model
x = randomstate()
while true:
        // calculate id203 of this state and a proposal
        px = pi(x) // pi is the un-normalized id203 as defined above
        xnew = fliponebit(x)
        pnew = pi(xnew)

        // calculate transition id203 alpha
        transitionid203 = min(1, pnew/px)
        if uniformrandom(0,1) < transitionid203:
                x = xnew // transition to x'!
