finding lane lines on the road

   [80]udacity - self-driving car nanodegree

   [81]detected lane lines

   check out my write-up and results for this project [82]here on medium.

overview

   the lines on the road show us where the lanes are and act as a constant
   reference for where to steer the vehicle. naturally, one of the first
   things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to
   automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

   in this project i have created a pipeline to detect lane lines in
   images and videos using python and opencv.

getting started

   this project was derived from my fork of [83]udactiy's starter kit.

   the starter and instrutions for getting started with my fork are
   [84]here.
