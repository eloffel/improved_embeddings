   project #2 for udacity   s self-driving car nanodegree (sdcnd) is about
   using neural networks (specifically deep convolutional networks) to
   classify images of traffic signs. this is an important problem for
   self-driving cars, for being able to classify an image of a traffic
   sign according to its type will allow a self-driving car to make
   important decisions.

   if you missed my first sdcnd project update, you can find it [16]here.

the code and the details

   the code for this project can be found on github [17]here. i would
   recommend the project   s readme to audiences who are familiar with deep
   learning. the readme will have all the juicy details.

for those less machine-learning savvy   

   if you are interested in learning about deep learning and how it can be
   applied to image classification, i strongly recommend [18]machine
   learning is fun! part 3.

   i   ll try to keep the rest of this high-level for general audiences.

a high-level overview

   to classify images using a technique known as    deep learning,    you need
   lots of data         thousands of images. this is because a neural network
   that employs deep learning takes in each image and learns about it. the
   more examples, the more to learn from, and the better the performance.

   fortunately there is a [19]public dataset of german traffic signs that
   have already been correctly labeled. yes, german traffic signs. you can
   get a feel for the images in the dataset in the picture below.
   [1*jfxvebtpq2nsgl0qkbszdq.png]
   example images from the dataset from the [20]website.

   the dataset contains 43 different types of traffic signs that
   drastically vary in image quality. all images are in color and the
   dataset i used had all the images scaled down to 32x32 pixels         pretty
   grainy. in total there were around 47,000 images.

   the details of how deep neural networks work are pretty convoluted, but
   i   ll highlight some major points:
    1.    deep    means multiple layers.
    2. each layer    learns    to identify features about the images passed
       in.
    3. stringing these layers together, the network can identify    features
       of features.    for example, the first layer might identify lines,
       and the second layer groups of lines (like triangles). before long
       you have something that looks like a yield sign.
    4. neural networks learn what features are relevant to classifying the
       data on their own using the power of math.

   as more images get passed in, the network improves and gets better at
   classifying the signs. at the end, my network was 95% accurate. that
   accuracy number will vary some depending on the type of sign, by the
   way. since it saw more speed signs than turning signs, it will be
   better at identifying speed signs.

   to illustrate this and test my network, i downloaded five different
   german traffic signs from the web. the five images, after sizing down
   to 32x32, are shown below.

   the five downloaded images used to test my model.

   i ran these five images through my network, telling it to return what
   kind of sign it thinks the pictures represent and the certainty of its
   guess (softmax id203). the following table summarizes the
   results.

   the network was able to correctly identify all but the last sign         the
      go straight or left    sign. i find it somewhat comforting that the
   network classified the sign as    keep right,    which is at least similar.

   i really enjoyed this project. it was my first real foray into neural
   networks and deep learning. i plan to continue posting about the future
   udacity sdcnd projects i complete, so if you want to get updated when
   those come out you can follow me on medium (below).
