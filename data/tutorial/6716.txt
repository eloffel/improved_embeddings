   project #3 in the [16]udacity program involves using behavioral cloning
   and deep neural networks to teach a car to drive in a simulator.

   my code for this project is publicly available and can be found
   [17]here.

   if you missed my first project update, you can find it [18]here. the
   second project update is [19]here.

why a simulator

   while driving a car in a simulator is certainly not the same as driving
   a car in the real world, there are many similarities. given the current
   state of game graphics, images captured in a simulated environment
   (road, markers, landscape) are a good approximation of images that
   could be captured in the real world.

   of course the simulator also affords safety and ease-of-use. data
   collection is much simpler, and a failed model poses no threat to life.
   a simulator is a great platform in which to explore and hone various
   model architectures. a successful model might afterwards be implemented
   in a real car with real cameras.

training data and behavioral cloning

   the the goal of behavioral cloning is to collect data while exhibiting
   good behavior and then train a model to mimic that behavior with the
   collected data. while in a real-world setting this would involved
   mounting sensors on a car and driving around, in a simulator it looks
   more like this:

   this is actually important work, but also video games   .

   yep, that   s right. playing video games can help you build a
   self-driving car! the simulator is built in unity, a game engine, and
   in-game cameras capture images as the car drives around the track. the
   images that were captured while i was driving (hopefully well) were
   later fed into a neural network to teach the model how to drive
   properly. here   s an example image captured from the front-center of the
   car:
   [1*gsqldj9k4gztj9__mbsrdw.jpeg]
   track 1 in the simulator

   each image is captured with the accompanying steering angle. the images
   will be fed into the network, and the network   s job will be to match
   the appropriate steering angle. since tracks normally have a turn bias
   (in this case, left), when the images are loaded each image gets a copy
   that has been flipped horizontally with steering angle negated. both
   the original image and the flipped copy are fed into the network,
   balancing out the turn bias.

   i collected data for a few different scenarios. first, i drove the
   track in both directions a couple of times while trying to maintain
   ideal center-lane driving. this scenario represented the bulk of the
   data as it is the ideal behavior. second, i collected some    corrective   
   data by driving from the edge of the road back to the center in a
   variety of situations. the goal of the    corrective    data is to teach
   the car how to get back to the center if it gets out of line. third, i
   collected more data specifically for the corners and problem
   spots         where the car had the most trouble staying on the track. fourth
   and finally, i collected data on the second available track in the
   simulator. this second track is quite different (both the road and the
   landscape) and much more difficult. it exhibits steep slopes and much
   sharper, more frequent turns. the goal of collecting data on this quite
   different track was to help the model generalize a concept of    staying
   on the road.   

   here   s an image from the second, harder track:

model architecture

   the model architecture i chose is nearly identical to nvidia   s network
   for end-to-end learning for self driving cars (paper [20]here). the
   model features five convolutional layers and four fully-connected
   layers, looking something like this:
   [1*uly0ga0xf8twax8tuqa4va.png]
   source: [21]https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf (nvidia paper)

   each convolutional layer and fully-connected layer has elu activation,
   and a dropout layer with 30% drop-rate is implemented after each
   convolutional layer to help prevent overfitting in this large network.

   the convolutional layers capture abstracted features from the images.
   these abstracted features are fed into the fully-connected layers which
   serve as a steering controller. more on the model   s design can be read
   in nvidia   s paper [22]here.

training the model

   [23]keras was used to build and train the model, which provided quick
   and simple implementation. the adam optimizer was used, and the
   mean-squared-error was minimized. the model was trained in
   randomly-selected batches of 128 images for seven epochs, and 20% of
   the data was reserved for validation. in total, the model was trained
   using around 25,000 images.

the results

   after training, the car driven by the model was able to correctly
   traverse the first track. the car exhibited minimal over-correcting on
   the straight-aways, and it had a couple close calls with the edge of
   the road and the bridge. overall, it performed well on the first track:

   my car driving around track 1 in the simulator.

   as for the second track, it was unable to go much of anywhere, but this
   is not too surprising considering the majority of the data was gathered
   on the simpler track. i believe this model architecture could handle
   driving on the second track if i were to provide it with more data
   (especially at problem-spots) from the second track.
