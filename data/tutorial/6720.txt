ai tool aims to transform radiology

   published on july 14, 2015

   by elaine sanchez wilson

   with an annual caseload of nearly 6 million patient studies, a company
   like virtual radiologic (vrad) is hugely appealing to information
   technology firms looking to apply their algorithms in the healthcare
   space. the substantial amount of data generated from vrad   s vast
   teleradiology network of 2,100-plus client facilities is a goldmine for
   enterprising companies hoping to ensure appropriate learning and to
   build proper models.
   [53]richard socher, founder and ceo, metamind

   richard socher, founder and ceo, metamind

   that   s what metamind founder and chief executive richard socher had in
   mind when he approached vrad with an idea to collaborate on radiology
   diagnostics. specifically, the stanford graduate and founder of the
   palo alto, calif. based company was hoping to leverage his    deep
   learning    artificial intelligence (ai) solution to improve the speed,
   accuracy, and quality of how radiology is performed.

   vrad was intrigued, and a partnership was born.

      we think that, moving forward, the way radiology is practiced is going
   to change significantly over the next decade   for the benefit of
   both patients and physicians,    said shannon werb, chief information
   officer at vrad and author of the axis column    [54]critical findings.   
   the innovation and technology that metamind offers is going to be a big
   part of how it changes.   

   anonymized data from vrad   s clinical database of over 30 million
   patient studies is being used to train metamind   s ai software to search
   and    red flag    images that potentially show intracranial hemorrhaging
   (ih). without immediate medical treatment, ih can quickly lead to
   increased pressure in the brain and potentially damaged brain tissue or
   death.

   once an image is flagged, the patient   s study can be automatically
   escalated within the radiologist   s reading queue. it can also be
   assigned to the most appropriately experienced radiologist, so they can
   immediately direct their attention to the image, accurately diagnose
   the condition, and relay any critical findings back to the attending
   physician as quickly as possible.
   [55]shannon werb, cio, vrad

   shannon werb, cio, vrad

      because of the nature of our business, with our doctors being remote,
   we have worked hard to build technology solutions that automate the
   collection and organization of objective information the physician
   needs to interpret the studies,    werb said.    we   ve made major
   investments over the last two years, focusing on really automating, and
   what we   ve seen is increased quality and reduced turnaround time so we
   get the results back faster. three quarters in a row now our quality
   continues to improve.   

      our chief medical officer is very focused and has a clear vision: we
   want to have radiologists open studies and immediately have their
   eyeballs on the images,    werb continued.    we want doctors to be
   doctors, not performing administrative duties. they should not be
   looking for prior images or reports, dictating objective information
   like the number of views or the performed procedure, or even further
   flipping or rotating the images   all of that should be done for them.   

   metamind   s patent-pending deep-learning platform trains computer
   systems with high volume, complex information that includes text,
   images, and other data inputs, such as diagnostic radiology reports. it
   comprises a set of techniques that do not require domain experts to
   program knowledge into algorithms. instead, these techniques build
   models from labeled example inputs and learn by observing data.

   werb offered one scenario of a trauma case where a patient presents
   with an unknown condition yet suspecting significant trauma and
   undergoes a whole body scan. after receiving the study, vrad   s
   patent-pending workflow technology splits the study at the clavicles.
      we   d send the head imaging to the neuroradiologist, the body imaging
   to the body radiologist, they   d collaborate and deliver a single result
   back to the client accurately and very quickly,    he explained.    so for
   example in this case, we   d put eyeballs on images in about five
   minutes, and we   d get reports to the clients on average in about 11 or
   12 minutes really driving an improved outcome for the onsite trauma
   team assessing the patient.   

   working with metamind   s platform, vrad believes there is enough time in
   those five minutes to test images and produce what werb refers to as    a
   hint    suggesting high likelihood of intracranial hemorrhage.    with the
   technology, we can take that hint, and not just tap the doctor on the
   shoulder or put it on top of their worklist,    werb said.    we can
   actually close the study they are working on, open the new study in
   front of them, and tell them they need to read it immediately because a
   critical condition is likely here. in trauma situations, faster
   turnaround time is key. improving the quality by providing more of this
   objective information to the doctor up front allows them to provide a
   high-quality result.   

   vrad is currently focusing on intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary
   embolism, as they are at the top of the list of chronic conditions seen
   in emergency settings where patients need to be treated immediately.
   however, the partners see no limitation on where the collaboration
   could go.

      the validity and volume of clinical data are crucial in training deep
   learning algorithms. the more data you have, the better you can train
   them. given the amount of clinical data vrad has access to, this is
   really only the beginning of what we can do,    socher said.

   meanwhile, vrad has also filed a patent for the training and use of
      deep learning    algorithms and models in a telemedicine platform. the
   company plans to embed the technology into the services that it offers
   its clients, in addition to working with metamind to commercialize the
   algorithms and make them available to other organizations.

   vrad   s goal is to have the first algorithm clinically operational by
   year   s end, according to werb. for more information, visit [56]vrad and
