querying, analyzing and downloading

   the entire gdelt database is 100% free and open and you can
   download the raw datafiles, visualize it using the
   gdelt analysis service, or analyze it at limitless scale with google
   bigquery.

   the gdelt project is the largest, most comprehensive, and highest
   resolution open database of human society ever created. just the 2015
   data alone records nearly three quarters of a trillion emotional
   snapshots and more than 1.5 billion location references, while its
   total archives span more than 215 years, making it one of the largest
   open-access spatio-temporal datasets in existance and pushing the
   boundaries of "big data" study of global human society. its global
   id13 connects the world's people, organizations, locations,
   themes, counts, images and emotions into a single holistic network over
   the entire planet. how can you query, explore, model, visualize,
   interact, and even forecast this vast archive of human society?

   [11]gdelt analysis service

   free cloud-based service that offers a variety of tools and services to
   allow you to visualize, explore, and export gdelt - a great way to get
   started using gdelt for the first time.

   [12]google bigquery

   query, export, and even conduct sophisticated analyses and modeling of
   the entire dataset using standard sql, with even the most complex
   queries returning in near-realtime.

   [13]raw data files

   advanced users and those with unique use cases can download the entire
   underlying event and graph datasets in csv format - over 2.5tb for last
   year alone.

   [14]documentation

   all of gdelt's documentation in one place - user manuals, codebooks,
   lookup files, and id172 spreadsheets are all found here.

gdelt analysis service

   visualize, analyze, explore, and export gdelt right from your browser.

   the [15]gdelt analysis service is a free cloud-based service that
   offers a variety of tools and services to allow you to visualize,
   explore, and export both the gdelt event database and the gdelt global
   id13. this is a great way to get started exploring gdelt and
   what it can do for you, even if you don't have a technical background.

   note: the analysis service currently searches only gdelt 1.0, an
   upgrade is planned for later this year to integrate all of the gdelt
   2.0 datasets.

visualization & format translation

   fourteen different tools are available for geographic, [16]temporal,
   network, and [17]contextual visualizations of both the event database
   and global id13. no technical expertise is required - you
   just select the visualization you want, enter your query, and a few
   minutes later it is delivered right to your email inbox!

   a common thread we've heard from all of you is the need for a central
   set of tools that make it easier to work with gdelt and that can
   translate its rich multidimensional knowledgebase into file formats and
   visualizations that analysts and scholars can better make sense of and
   that are compatible with the toolkits and software you use each day. to
   this end, each of the tools offers the ability to output in a wide
   array of relevant file formats, from [18]csv to [19]google earth to
   [20]gephi, allowing you for example to construct a network of
   influencers around an industry and output it as a gephi file for
   further analysis.

data export

   often the gdelt analysis service is the best place to start when
   testing out a hypothesis or checking for an [21]emergent trend. you can
   instantly test out a new query, getting results back in just a few
   moments, iteratively adjusting your search to see if there is anything
   worth exploring further. when you find something of interest that you
   want to explore, visualize, or analyze in more detail, the analysis
   service has a wide range of export options, from speciality file
   formats to raw export of the underlying csv records.

   if you are trying to locate all attacks on civilians in a certain
   country over a four-month period, use the [22]timemapper tool to
   determine if there are enough matching events or if you need to adjust
   your query further, and then use the [23]exporter tool to download a
   csv file containing just the matching records.

   [24]try it now!

google bigquery

   leverage the world's most powerful database platform for realtime
   querying and analysis.

   given their massive size and complexity, most users will struggle to
   make full use of gdelt's datasets on their local computers. just the
   2015 gkg dataset alone weighs in at over 2.5tb and contains more than
   three quarters of a trillion emotional scores. to make analyses at such
   scales possible, all gdelt datasets are available in [25]google
   bigquery, with live datasets updated every 15 minutes. you can query,
   export, and even conduct sophisticated analyses and modeling of the
   entire dataset using standard sql, with even the most complex queries
   returning in near-realtime. see the [26]full list of tables available
   in bigquery.

gdelt + bigquery = query the planet

   from the very beginning, one of the greatest challenges in working with
   gdelt has been in how to interact with a dataset of this magnitude. few
   database platforms can handle a dataset this complex with the sheer
   variety of access patterns and the number of permutations of fields
   that are collected together into queries each day.

   google's bigquery database was custom-designed for datasets like gdelt,
   enabling [27]near-realtime adhoc querying over the entire dataset. this
   means that no matter how you access gdelt, what columns you look
   across, what kinds of operators you use, or the complexity of your
   query, you will still see results pretty much in near-realtime.

realtime analysis

   for us, the most groundbreaking part of having gdelt in bigquery is
   that it opens the door not only to fast complex querying and extracting
   of data, but also allows for the first time real-world [28]analyses to
   be run entirely in the database.

   imagine computing the most significant conflict interaction in the
   world by month over the past 35 years, or performing cross-tabbed
   correlation over different classes of relationships between a set of
   countries. such queries can be run entirely inside of bigquery and
   return in just a handful of seconds. this enables you to try out "what
   if" hypotheses on global-scale trends in near-real time.

raw data files

   download all of gdelt to your own computer.

   advanced users and those with unique use cases can download the entire
   underlying event and graph datasets in csv format. deep technical
   knowledge and extensive experience working with large datasets is
   required to make use of these datasets, with the 2015 gkg alone
   requiring more than 2.5tb.

                       [ukraine-protest-map-2014.jpg]

gdelt 1.0 event database

   the gdelt 1.0 event database contains over a quarter-billion records
   organized into a set of tab-delimited files by date. through march 31,
   2013 records are stored in monthly and yearly files by the date the
   event took place. beginning with april 1, 2013, files are created daily
   and records are stored by the date the event was found in the world's
   news media rather than the date it occurred (97%+ of events are
   reported within 24 hours of happening, but a small number of events
   each day are past events being mentioned for the first time - if an
   event has been seen before it will not be included again). files are
   zip compressed in tab delimited format, but named with a ".csv"
   extension to address some software packages that will not accept .txt
   or .tsv files.

   each morning, seven days a week, the latest daily update is posted by
   6am est. this file is named with the previous day's date in the format
   "yyyymmdd.export.csv.zip" (ie the morning of may 24, 2013 a new file
   called "20130523.export.csv.zip" is added). unix or linux users can
   easily set up a cronjob or other automatic scheduling processes to
   automatically download the latest daily update each morning and process
   it for watchboarding, forecasting, early warning, alert services, and
   [31]other applications.

   there is also a special gdelt 1.0 [32]"reduced" event dataset (1.1gb)
   that uses the "one a day" country-level filtering commonly used in
   older academic event databases. this version of the data will most
   closely match the aggregation level users with previous event analysis
   experience are familiar with and collapses the database on
   "date+actor1+actor2+eventcode" (ie every protest held anywhere in
   russia on a given day is collapsed to a single entry). this version is
   recommended only for those needing compatibility with analyses based on
   previous generations of academic event databases and covers the period
   january 1, 1979 to february 17, 2014. it is not updated.

                     [global-knowledge-graph-netvis.jpg]

gdelt 1.0 global id13 (gkg)

   the gdelt 1.0 global id13 begins april 1, 2013 and consists
   of two parallel data streams, one encoding the entire id13
   with all of its fields, and the other encoding only the subset of the
   graph that records "counts" of a set of predefined categories like
   number of protesters, number killed, or number displaced or sickened.
   such counts may occur independently of the cameo events in the primary
   gdelt event stream, such as mentions of those killed in industrial
   accidents (which are not captured in cameo) or those displaced by a
   natural disaster or sickened by a disease epidemic. in this way, the
   gkg counts file can be used to produce a daily "death tracker" to map
   all mentions of death across the world each day, or an "affected
   tracker" to indicate how many persons were sickened/displaced/stranded
   each day (at least as recorded in the global news media). these files
   are named as "yyyymmdd.gkg.csv.zip" and posted by 6am est each morning
   seven days a week.

   the second file is the full graph file, which contains the actual graph
   connecting all persons, organizations, locations, emotions, themes,
   counts, events, and sources together each day. it also contains a list
   of the eventids of each event found in the same article as the
   extracted information, allowing rich contextualization of events. these
   files are named as "yyyymmdd.gkgcounts.csv.zip" and posted by 6am est
   each morning seven days a week.

   the global id13 is currently in "alpha" release and may
   change over time as we introduce new capabilities and expand its
   underlying algorithms.

event cameo actor code lookups

   the gdelt 1.0 and 2.0 event databases use the cameo event taxonomy,
   which records the actors involved in an event as a series of
   3-character codes. these tab-delimited lookup files contain the
   human-friendly textual labels for each of those codes to make it easier
   to work with the data for those who have not previously worked with
   cameo. remember that [57]cameo country codes are only used in the
   "actor" fields, while [58]fips country codes are used in the "geo"
   fields.

event cameo event code lookups

   the gdelt 1.0 and 2.0 event databases use the cameo event taxonomy,
   which is a collection of more than 300 types of events organized into a
   hierarchical taxonomy and recorded in the files as a numeric code.
   these tab-delimited lookup files contain the human-friendly textual
   labels for each of those codes to make it easier to work with the data
   for those who have not previously worked with cameo.

gdelt 1.0 event database id172 files

   the comma-delimited (csv) files below are updated daily and record the
   total number of events in the gdelt 1.0 event database across all event
   types broken down by time and country. this is important for
   id172 tasks, to compensate the exponential increase in the
   availability of global news material over time. due to gdelt 2.0's live
   updating, we do not currently make id172 files available for
   gdelt 2.0, but you can easily construct your own id172 files by
   performing a basic summation over the 15 minute update files.

getting started with gdelt

   gdelt is the largest, highest resolution, and most detailed open
   dataset of global human society ever created. this means that working
   with it can require a lot of careful attention to things like
   id172 that are often unfamiliar to many disciplines. later this
   year we will be releasing a "getting started with gdelt" guide to walk
   you through how to work with the breathtakingly massive look at global
   society that is gdelt. for now, keep a close eye on the gdelt blog,
   where we post regular tutorials, examples and updates.
