the unigraph engine:

graph storage and traversal at lightning speed

   highly distributed, fully concurrent and scalable solution for storing
   interconnected data. file system and storage medium agnostic. optimized
   for flash with extremely low latencies, working with lsm and btree data
   structures
   engine

built to store terabytes of data on locally attached flash drives or in ram
with linear cpu scaling

embedded key-value store, optimized for fast storage and high throughput.
fully exploiting the high read/write rates offered by flash and ram
subsystems

   flexible configuration settings for workload optimization on a variety
   of production environments including pure memory, flash and hard disks.
   keys and values are stored as pure byte strings, without size
   limitation. various compression algorithms are supported.

storage system agnostic

   ram, ssd or hdd     the unigraph engine works on any medium and file
   system

immediate availability

   after import, your data is immediately available. no warm up time
   required, no indexes needed.

highly distributed

   from 1 to 100 nodes across datacenters. no problem. reshaping data has
   never been so easy

concurrent reads and writes

   concurrent reads and writes and fault tolerance provides support for
   real-time applications

storage concurrency

   in lsm, background processes like flush and compaction execute
   concurrently via threads

optimized encoding

   very fast and space optimized data encoding and decoding: (strings,
   floats, ints, etc.)

build your own, dedicated id13 by combining private and public
data

can the unigraph engine run on my own infrastructure?

   yes. if you have lots of data that you want to be transferred into a
   graph structure, the unigraph engine is the ideal solution. all you
   have to do is provide us with root access to a dedicated server on
   which we   ll install and configure the engine.

   please note: your data will be completely isolated from the data in
   unigraph.

i have private data. can i merge it with unigraph's?

   yes. the multigraph architecture allows us to create a copy of unigraph
   on a dedicated system and merge (reconcile) it with your existing data.
   we   ll take care of everything: infrastructure set up, api, data
   reconcilliation, etc.

   please note: your private data and the unigraph instance have to
   physically reside on your own infrastructure.

i don't have a dedicated infrastructure. can you help me?

   yes. we   ll setup a cluster of dedicated servers in the ovh global
   network. the required servers depend on the amount of data that will be
   stored and wether private data will be reconciled with unigraph   s.
   there are 5 datacenters located in france and canada to choose from. we
   cover the entire process: cluster management and monitoring, api
   availability, system updates and upgrades.

how do i import my data into the unigraph engine?

   the import feature currently supports the following formats: .xlsx,
   .xls, .csv & .tsv. you have to annotate your datasets and describe the
   relations between the nodes. don   t worry     even the most complex graphs
   take less than 15 min to annotate.

   the importer also provides several very powerful data cleaning
   features, to help you clean your data during import, if need be. for
   example: text processing (split, merge, regex, lowercase, capitalize   ),
   on the fly language detection and powerful conditional statements.

   of course, we can assist you and guide you through the process.

will my dedicated graph be updated with new unigraph data?

   yes. updates, upgrades and reconciliation will be taken care
   automatically for you.

starting from:

999    

   per month, vat excl. excl. includes the management and monitoring of
   your dedicated infrastructure.
