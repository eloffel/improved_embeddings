   low resource languages for emergent incidents (lorelei) is a
   darpa-sponsored program. the goal of the program is to dramatically
   advance the state of computational linguistics and human language
   technology to enable rapid, low-cost development of capabilities for
   low-resource languages.
   this web page serves as a portal for all information pertaining to the
   low resource (lore) hlt open evaluations of component technologies
   relevant to lorelei. for general questions and comments, please e-mail
   [110]lorehlt_poc@nist.gov.  for more information about a specific
   evaluation cycle, including evaluation documentation, see the
   year-specific sections below.  for general announcements and discussing
   regarding the lorehlt evaluation series, you can subscribe to the
   lorehlt mailing list hosted by nist, [111]lorehlt@nist.gov, by sending
   e-mail to [112]lorehlt_list-request@nist.gov with "subscribe" in the
   subject line.
