low resource languages for emergent incidents (lorelei)

[117]dr. boyan onyshkevych

   the u.s. government operates globally and frequently encounters
   so-called    low-resource    languages for which no automated human
   language technology capability exists. historically, development of
   technology for automated exploitation of foreign language materials has
   required protracted effort and a large data investment. current methods
   can require multiple years and tens of millions of dollars per
   language   mostly to construct translated or transcribed corpora. as a
   result, human language technology systems exist primarily for languages
   in widespread use or in high demand. with more than 7,000 languages in
   the world and the difficulty of predicting the next language for which
   technology will be needed, universal human language technology coverage
   by existing means is an unattainable goal.

   the goal of the low resource languages for emergent incidents (lorelei)
   program is to dramatically advance the state of computational
   linguistics and human language technology to enable rapid, low-cost
   development of capabilities for low-resource languages. with the
   understanding that even with perfect translation, there would still be
   too much material for analysts to use effectively, lorelei research
   will not be focused solely on machine translation. while lorelei
   technologies may include partial or fully automated id103
   and/or machine translation, the overall goal will not be translating
   foreign language material into english but providing situational
   awareness by identifying elements of information in foreign language
   and english sources, such as topics, names, events, sentiment and
   relationships.

   to accomplish this, the lorelei program will develop human language
   technology that eliminates the current reliance on huge,
   manually-translated, manually-transcribed or manually-annotated
   corpora, leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from
   related-language resources and fully exploiting a broad range of
   language-specific resources. the technologies resulting from lorelei
   research will be capable of supporting situational awareness based on
   low-resource foreign language sources within an extremely short time
   frame     starting as soon as 24 hours after a new language requirement
   emerges.

   lorelei technology is expected to be applicable to any incident in
   which a sudden need emerges for assimilation of information by u.s.
   government entities about a region of the world where low-resource
   languages are frequently used in formal and/or informal media. lorelei
   capabilities will be exercised to provide situational awareness based
   on information from any language, in support of emergent missions such
   as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, peacekeeping or infectious
   disease response.

   the lorelei program will hold an industry day on november 13, 2014.

selected darpa achievements

   darpa collaborated with industry on stealth technology.
   darpa   s stealth revolution
   in the early days of darpa   s work on stealth technology, have blue, a
   prototype of what would become the f-117a, first flew successfully in
   1977. the success of the f-117a program marked the beginning of the
   stealth revolution, which has had enormous benefits for national
   security.
   darpa microelectronics gave rise to today's gps devices.
   navigation in the palm of your hand
   early gps receivers were bulky, heavy devices. in 1983, darpa set out
   to miniaturize them, leading to a much broader adoption of gps
   capability.
   first rough conceptual design of the arpanet.
   paving the way to the modern internet
   arpa research played a central role in launching the information
   revolution. the agency developed and furthered much of the conceptual
   basis for the arpanet   prototypical communications network launched
   nearly half a century ago   and invented the digital protocols that gave
   birth to the internet.
