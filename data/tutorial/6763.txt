welcome to glottolog 3.4

   comprehensive reference information for the world's languages,
   especially the lesser known languages.

   information about the different languages, dialects, and families of
   the world ('languoids') is available in the [13]languages and
   [14]families sections. the [15]references section contains
   bibliographical information. you can query the bibliographical database
   by filtering the table view or using [16]a complex query involving
   genealogical affiliation, document type, and macro-area.

catalogue of languages and families

   glottolog provides a [17]comprehensive catalogue of the world's
   languages, language families and dialects. it assigns a unique and
   stable identifier (the glottocode) to (in principle) all languoids,
   i.e. all families, languages, and dialects. any variety that a linguist
   works on should eventually get its own entry. the languoids are
   organized via a genealogical classification (the glottolog tree) that
   is based on available historical-comparative research (see also the
   [18]languoids information section).

bibliography

   the [19]references section ('langdoc') provides a comprehensive
   collection of bibliographical data for the world's lesser known
   languages. it provides access to more than 180,000 references of
   descriptive works such as grammars, dictionaries, word lists, texts
   etc. search criteria include author, year, title, country, and
   genealogical affiliation. references can be downloaded as txt, bib,
   html, or with the [20]zotero firefox plugin.

   glottolog will be continuously expanded and improved with the help of
   their users. the input of expert linguists is crucial.
