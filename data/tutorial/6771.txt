alphago zero: learning from scratch

   artificial intelligence research has made rapid progress in a wide
   variety of domains from id103 and image classification to
   genomics and drug discovery. in many cases, these are specialist
   systems that leverage enormous amounts of human expertise and data.

   however, for some problems this human knowledge may be too expensive,
   too unreliable or simply unavailable. as a result, a long-standing
   ambition of ai research is to bypass this step, creating algorithms
   that achieve superhuman performance in the most challenging domains
   with no human input. in our most recent [35]paper, published in the
   [36]journal nature, we demonstrate a significant step towards this
   goal.

   starting from scratch
   [alphagozero-illustration-widescreen.width-320_oobyzmr.jpg]

   the paper introduces alphago zero, the latest evolution of [37]alphago,
   the first computer program to defeat a world champion at the ancient
   chinese game of go. zero is even more powerful and is arguably the
   strongest go player in history.
   previous versions of alphago initially trained on thousands of human
   amateur and professional games to learn how to play go. alphago zero
   skips this step and learns to play simply by playing games against
   itself, starting from completely random play. in doing so, it quickly
   surpassed human level of play and defeated the [38]previously published
   champion-defeating version of alphago by 100 games to 0.

   it is able to do this by using a novel form of [39]reinforcement
   learning, in which alphago zero becomes its own teacher. the system
   starts off with a neural network that knows nothing about the game of
   go. it then plays games against itself, by combining this neural
   network with a powerful search algorithm. as it plays, the neural
   network is tuned and updated to predict moves, as well as the eventual
   winner of the games.
   this updated neural network is then recombined with the search
   algorithm to create a new, stronger version of alphago zero, and the
   process begins again. in each iteration, the performance of the system
   improves by a small amount, and the quality of the self-play games
   increases, leading to more and more accurate neural networks and ever
   stronger versions of alphago zero.

   this technique is more powerful than previous versions of alphago
   because it is no longer constrained by the limits of human knowledge.
   instead, it is able to learn tabula rasa from the strongest player in
   the world: alphago itself.
   it also differs from previous versions in other notable ways.

     * alphago zero only uses the black and white stones from the go board
       as its input, whereas previous versions of alphago included a small
       number of hand-engineered features.
     * it uses one neural network rather than two. earlier versions of
       alphago used a    policy network    to select the next move to play and
       a    value network    to predict the winner of the game from each
       position. these are combined in alphago zero, allowing it to be
       trained and evaluated more efficiently.
     * alphago zero does not use    rollouts    - fast, random games used by
       other go programs to predict which player will win from the current
       board position. instead, it relies on its high quality neural
       networks to evaluate positions.

   all of these differences help improve the performance of the system and
   make it more general. but it is the algorithmic change that makes the
   system much more powerful and efficient.

   [alphago%2520efficiency.width-400_chomue6.png]
   alphago has become progressively more efficient thanks to hardware
   gains and more recently algorithmic advances

   after just three days of self-play training, alphago zero emphatically
   defeated the previously [40]published version of alphago - which had
   itself [41]defeated 18-time world champion lee sedol - by 100 games to
   0. after 40 days of self training, alphago zero became even stronger,
   outperforming the version of alphago known as    master   , which has
   defeated the world's best players and [42]world number one ke jie.

   [elo%2520ratings.width-400_ahxvkga.png]
   elo ratings - a measure of the relative skill levels of players in
   competitive games such as go - show how alphago has become
   progressively stronger during its development

   over the course of millions of alphago vs alphago games, the system
   progressively learned the game of go from scratch, accumulating
   thousands of years of human knowledge during a period of just a few
   days. alphago zero also discovered new knowledge, developing
   unconventional strategies and creative new moves that echoed and
   surpassed the novel techniques it played in the games against lee sedol
   and ke jie.

   these moments of creativity give us confidence that ai will be a
   multiplier for human ingenuity, helping us with [43]our mission to
   solve some of the most important challenges humanity is facing.

   discovering new knowledge
   [alphagozero-illustration-square.width-320_rdh0108.jpg]

   while it is still early days, alphago zero constitutes a critical step
   towards this goal. if similar techniques can be applied to other
   structured problems, such as protein folding, reducing energy
   consumption or searching for revolutionary new materials, the resulting
   breakthroughs have the potential to positively impact society.
