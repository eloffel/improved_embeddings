   #retrofitting manaal faruqui, [69]manaalfar@gmail.com

   this tool is used to post-process word vectors to incorporate knowledge
   from semantic lexicons. as shown in faruqui et al, 2015 these word
   vectors are generally better in performance on semantic tasks than the
   original word vectors. this tool can be used for word vectors obtained
   from any vector training model.

   ###requirements
    1. python 2.7

   ###data you need
    1. word vector file
    2. lexicon file (provided here)

   each vector file should have one word vector per line as follows (space
   delimited):-

   the -1.0 2.4 -0.3 ...

   ###running the program

   python retrofit.py -i word_vec_file -l lexicon_file -n num_iter -o
   out_vec_file

   python retrofit.py -i sample_vec.txt -l lexicons/ppdb-xl.txt -n 10 -o
   out_vec.txt

   where, 'n' is an integer which specifies the number of iterations for
   which the optimization is to be performed. usually n = 10 gives
   reasonable results.

   ###output file: out_vec.txt

   which are your new retrofitted and (hopefully) improved word vectors,
   enjoy !
