vectors in machine learning

why are matrices with dimensions nx1 called vectors

   if you are a machine learning engineer, one thing that you will work
   with day in and day out is a vector. vectors are ubiquitous in machine
   learning.
   [1*mqhx_x6_gwurbjnpn9wvca.jpeg]

   if you have taken any college-level physics or engineering, you
   probably think of vectors as something that has both magnitude and
   direction where the length of the vector is the magnitude and the
   orientation of the vector is the direction.

   for example, speed is a scalar quantity, but velocity is a vector
   because it has both magnitude and direction. you would define something
   to be a vector if both magnitude and direction are important to get
   complete idea about the impact of the variable. giving another example
   [13]time is not a vector quantity, but a time interval is.

   another [14]example of a vector is an area. how? now, if you just
   consider that area is the measure of a two-dimensional surface. in many
   cases we do not consider the direction of the surface. but sometimes we
   do. for example, you want to buy a plot of land to build a house. in
   most cases, the plot of land would be a flat land and the direction is
   upwards (direction of an area is perpendicular to the surface), but
   what if it   s on a mountain and the direction is not upwards but
   slanting. you will then probably make the part of the land flat before
   moving on to building a house.

vector components and basis vectors

   consider a cartesian coordinate system in a 3d space. the thing to
   remember about coordinates is they come with coordinate basis vectors.

   the coordinate basis vectors are of unit length in the units that the
   coordinate system is measured. and the direction is in the direction of
   the coordinate axes. generally, in case of a three-dimensional system,
   the   ,    and k   are considered to be the basis vectors of the x-axis,
   y-axis and z-axis respectively.

   once you have the coordinates and the unit vectors in place, you are in
   a position to find the components of your vector. a way to visualize
   the vector component, you can ask how far do i have to go in the x
   direction and how far do i have to go in the y direction. in other
   words, how many    unit vectors,    unit vectors and k   unit vectors are
   required.

   in other words, taking the above example shown in the diagram, 2   unit
   vectors, 3   unit vectors and 5k   unit vectors is a valid representation
   of the vector shown. and if you know the basis vectors then, of course,
   you don   t even need to write them up. you can simply take the values 2,
   3 and 5 and write them in an array, or stack them up (sets are not a
   good data structure as we want to preserve the sequence) and put a nice
   set of parenthesis around them.

   so, we can see the left hand side of the above equation, which we know
   to be a vector in the traditional sense, has resolved to be a 3 x 1
   dimensional matrix in case the space we consider is three dimensional.
   similarly, a vector in n dimensions can be written as a n x 1
   dimensional matrix. that is why if the second number of the dimension
   of a matrix is 1 we call it a vector. if you understand this, you will
   go a long way in understanding the matrix and high dimensional space
   manipulations commonly done in machine learning and ai.
