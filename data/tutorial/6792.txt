beginners guide to learn dimension reduction techniques

   [96]sunil ray, july 28, 2015

introduction

     brevity is the soul of wit

   this powerful quote by william shakespeare applies well to
   techniques used in data science & analytics as well. intrigued ? allow
   me to prove it using a short story.

   in may     2015, we conducted a [97]data hackathon ( a data science
   competition) in delhi-ncr, india.

   600_437817253

   we gave participants the challenge to identify [98]human activity
   recognition using smartphones data set. the data set had 561 variables
   for training model used for the identification of human activity in
   test data set.

   [99]human_data

   the participants in hackathon had varied experience and expertise
   level. as expected, the experts did a commendable job at identifying
   the human activity. however, beginners & intermediates struggled with
   sheer number of variables in the dataset (561 variables). under the
   pressure of time, these people tried using variables  really without
   understanding the significance level of variable(s).  they lacked the
   skill to filter information from seemingly high dimensional problems
   and reduce them to a few relevant dimensions     the skill of dimension
   reduction.

   further, this lack of skill came across in several forms in way of
   questions asked by various participants:
     * there are too many variables     do i need to explore each and every
       variable?
     * are all variables important?
     * all variables are numeric and what if they have multi-collinearity?
       how can i identify these variables?
     * i want to use decision tree. it can automatically select the right
       variables. is this a right technique?
     * i am using id79 but it is taking a high execution time
       because of high number of features
     * is there any machine learning algorithm that can identify the most
       significant variables automatically?
     * as this is a classification problem, can i use id166 with all
       variables?
     * which is the best tool to deal with high number of variable, r or
       python?

   if you have faced similar questions, you are reading the right article.
   in this article, we will look at various methods to identify the
   significant variables using the most common dimension reduction
   techniques and methods.

why dimension reduction is important in machine learning & predictive
modeling?

   the problem of unwanted increase in dimension is closely related to
   fixation of measuring / recording data at a far granular level then it
   was done in past. this is no way suggesting that this is a recent
   problem. it has started gaining more importance lately due to surge in
   data.

   lately, there has been a tremendous increase in the way sensors are
   being used in the industry. these sensors continuously record data and
   store it for analysis at a later point. in the way data gets captured,
   there can be a lot of redundancy. for example, let us take case of a
   motorbike rider in racing competitions. today, his position and
   movement gets measured by gps sensor on bike, gyro meters, multiple
   video feeds and his smart watch. because of respective errors in
   recording, the data would not be exactly same. however, there is very
   little incremental information on position gained from putting these
   additional sources. now assume that an analyst sits with all this data
   to analyze the racing strategy of the biker     he/ she would have a lot
   of variables / dimensions which are similar and of little (or no)
   incremental value. this is the problem of high unwanted dimensions and
   needs a treatment of dimension reduction.

   let   s look at other examples of new ways of data collection:
     * casinos are capturing data using cameras and tracking each and
       every move of their customers.
     * political parties are capturing data by expanding their reach on
       field
     * your smart phone apps collects a lot of personal details about you
     * your set top box collects data about which programs preferences and
       timings
     * organizations are evaluating their brand value by social media
       engagements (comments, likes), followers, positive and negative
       sentiments

   with more variables, comes more trouble! and to avoid this trouble,
   dimension reduction techniques comes to the rescue.

what are dimension reduction techniques?

   dimension reduction refers to the process of converting a set of data
   having vast dimensions into data with lesser dimensions ensuring that
   it conveys similar information concisely. these techniques are
   typically used while solving machine learning problems to obtain better
   features for a classification or regression task.

   let   s look at the image shown below. it shows 2 dimensions x1 and x2,
   which are let us say measurements of several object in cm (x1) and
   inches (x2). now, if you were to use both these dimensions in machine
   learning, they will convey similar information and introduce a lot of
   noise in system, so you are better of just using one dimension. here we
   have converted the dimension of data from 2d (from x1 and x2) to 1d
   (z1), which has made the data relatively easier to explain.

   [101]2d_1d

   in similar ways, we can reduce n dimensions of data set to k dimensions
   (k < n) . these k dimensions can be directly identified (filtered) or
   can be a combination of dimensions (weighted averages of dimensions) or
   new dimension(s) that represent existing multiple dimensions well.

   one of the most common application of this technique is image
   processing. you might have come across this facebook application    
      [102]which celebrity do you look like?   . but, have you ever
   thought about the algorithm used behind this?

   here   s the answer: to identify the matched celebrity image, we use
   pixel data and each pixel is equivalent to one dimension. in every
   image, there are high number of pixels i.e. high number of dimensions.
   and every dimension is important here. you can   t omit dimensions
   randomly to make better sense of your overall data set. in such
   cases, dimension reduction techniques help you to find the significant
   dimension(s) using various method(s). we   ll discuss these methods
   shortly.


what are the benefits of dimension reduction?

   let   s look at the benefits of applying dimension reduction process:
     * it helps in data compressing and reducing the storage space
       required
     * it fastens the time required for performing same computations. less
       dimensions leads to less computing, also less dimensions can allow
       usage of algorithms unfit for a large number of dimensions
     * it takes care of multi-collinearity that improves the model
       performance. it removes redundant features. for example: there is
       no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and
       inches).
     * reducing the dimensions of data to 2d or 3d may allow us to plot
       and visualize it precisely. you can then observe patterns more
       clearly. below you can see that, how a 3d data is converted into
       2d. first it has identified the 2d plane then represented the
       points on these two new axis z1 and z2.
       [103]image [4]
     * it is helpful in noise removal also and as result of that we can
       improve the performance of models.


what are the common methods to perform dimension reduction?

   there are many methods to perform dimension reduction. i have listed
   the most common methods below:

   1. [104]missing values: while exploring data, if we encounter missing
   values, what we do? our first step should be to identify the reason
   then impute missing values/ drop variables using appropriate methods.
   but, what if we have too many missing values? should we impute
   [105]missing values or drop the variables?

   i would prefer the latter, because it would not have lot more details
   about data set. also, it would not help in improving the power of
   model. next question, is there any threshold of missing values for
   dropping a variable? it varies from case to case. if the information
   contained in the variable is not that much, you can drop the variable
   if it has more than ~40-50% missing values.


   2. low variance: let   s think of a scenario where we have a constant
   variable (all observations have same value, 5) in our data set. do you
   think, it can improve the power of model? ofcourse not, because it has
   zero variance. in case of high number of dimensions, we should drop
   variables having low variance compared to others because these
   variables will not explain the variation in target variables.


   3. [106]id90: it is one of my favorite techniques. it can be
   used as a ultimate solution to tackle multiple challenges like missing
   values, outliers and identifying significant variables. it worked well
   in our data hackathon also. several data scientists used decision tree
   and it worked well for them.


   4. [107]id79: similar to decision tree is id79. i
   would also recommend using the in-built feature importance provided by
   id79s to select a smaller subset of input features. just be
   careful that id79s have a tendency to bias towards variables
   that have more no. of distinct values i.e. favor numeric variables over
   binary/categorical values.


   5. high correlation: dimensions exhibiting higher correlation can lower
   down the performance of model. moreover, it is not good to have
   multiple variables of similar information or variation also known
   as    multicollinearity   . you can use pearson (continuous variables) or
   polychoric (discrete variables) correlation matrix to identify the
   variables with high correlation and select one of them using
   [108]vif (variance inflation factor). variables having higher value (
   vif > 5 ) can be dropped.


   6. backward feature elimination: in this method, we start with all n
   dimensions. compute the sum of square of error (ssr) after eliminating
   each variable (n times). then, identifying variables whose removal has
   produced the smallest increase in the ssr and removing it finally,
   leaving us with n-1 input features.

   repeat this process until no other variables can be dropped. recently
   in [109]online hackathon organised by analytics vidhya (11-12 jun   15),
   data scientist who held second position used backward feature
   elimination in id75 to train his model.
   reverse to this, we can use    forward feature selection    method. in this
   method, we select one variable and analyse the performance of model by
   adding another variable. here, selection of variable is based on higher
   improvement in model performance.


   7. factor analysis: let   s say some variables are highly correlated.
   these variables can be grouped by their correlations i.e. all variables
   in a particular group can be highly correlated among themselves but
   have low correlation with variables of other group(s). here each group
   represents a single underlying construct or factor. these factors
   are small in number as compared to large number of dimensions. however,
   these factors are difficult to observe. there are basically two methods
   of performing factor analysis:
     * efa (exploratory factor analysis)
     * cfa (confirmatory factor analysis)


   8. principal component analysis (pca): in this technique, variables are
   transformed into a new set of variables, which are linear combination
   of original variables. these new set of variables are known as
   principle components. they are obtained in such a way that first
   principle component accounts for most of the possible variation of
   original data after which each succeeding component has the highest
   possible variance.

   the second principal component must be orthogonal to the first
   principal component. in other words, it does its best to capture the
   variance in the data that is not captured by the first principal
   component. for two-dimensional dataset, there can be only two principal
   components. below is a snapshot of the data and its first and second
   principal components. you can notice that second principle component is
   orthogonal to first principle component.[110] pca the principal
   components are sensitive to the scale of measurement, now to fix this
   issue we should always standardize variables before applying pca.
   applying pca to your data set loses its meaning. if interpretability of
   the results is important for your analysis, pca is not the right
   technique for your project.


is dimension reduction good or bad?

   recently, we received this question on our data science forum. here   s
   the complete [111]answer.


end note

   in this article, we looked at the simplified version of dimension
   reduction covering its importance, benefits, the commonly methods and
   the discretion as to when to choose a particular technique. in future
   post, i would write about the pca and factor analysis in more detail.

   did you find the article useful? do let us know your thoughts about
   this article in the comment box below. i would also want to know which
   dimension reduction technique you use most and why?

       hi!
       thanks for this interesting article. i found the introduction a
       very accessible way to motivate the use of id84
       techniques.
       one thing, though. you say:    now assume that an analyst sits with
       all this data to analyze the racing strategy of the biker     he
       would have a lot of variables / dimensions which are similar and of
       little (or no) incremental value   .
       why did you assume that the analyst is male?

       interesting overview of id84 techiniques. i
       would also like to highlight one more technique, namely the partial
       least squares (pls) regression. it is similar to the pca technique
       but uses the varianse in the response as well and therefore in some
       cases can give better results (a variable set with higher
       predictive power). i have used this techique to reduce the
       dimensionality of a set of genomic predictors in biology with
       conjuction with the abc (approximate bayesian computation method).
       also you can use some statistics to compress the data     i.e. take
       some sort of average over some measurements. i am being
       deliberately vague, since this has to include domain-specific in
       knowledge in order for the summary statistic to make sense.
