   alphago zero surpasses the level of human go world champions in just 36
   hours.
   zero to hero

deepmind has a bigger plan for its newest go-playing ai

   by [8]dave gershgornoctober 18, 2017

   alphago was never just about board games.

   alphabet   s ai research arm, deepmind, announced in an article in the
   journal nature today that it has built a final version of its prolific
   digital go master: alphago zero. the software is a distillation of
   previous systems deepmind has built: it   s more powerful, but simpler
   and doesn   t require the computational power of a google server to run.
   when pitted against the version of alphago that beat world champion lee
   sedol, alphago zero won 100-0.

   the most important new modification is how alphago zero learned to
   master the game. it doesn   t analyze data from go games humans have
   played before, unlike past versions. it learns only by playing the game
   against itself. alphago zero isn   t the first algorithm to learn from
   self-play   elon musk   s nonprofit openai has used similar techniques to
   [9]train an ai playing a video game   but its capabilities show that it   s
   one of the most powerful examples of the technology to date.

      by not using this human data, by not using human features or human
   expertise in any fashion, we   ve actually removed the constraints of
   human knowledge,    david silver, who led the alphago team, said.    it   s
   able to therefore create knowledge for itself.   

   that   s how the system earned its name: zero human knowledge.

critical to real world problems

   deepmind ceo demis hassabis says this approach is crucial to alphago   s
   applicability outside the lab or off the go board. by building an
   algorithm that can learn from a blank slate, the company says it can
   now be applied to other real world problems.

      for us alphago wasn   t just about winning the game of go, it was also a
   big step for us towards building general purpose learning algorithms,   
   he said.

   instead of go moves, deepmind claims the alphago zero algorithm will be
   able to learn the interactions between proteins in the human body to
   further scientific research, or the laws of physics to help create new
   building materials.

   the idea of using ai to help mine the vast potential combinations of
   molecules to built a super-battery or some other futuristic device
   isn   t new; hassabis has been saying it for years. but alphago zero
   represents the company   s first major vehicle that some researchers
   agree can help us get there.

how it works

   previously, alphago was a combination of ai strategies. deepmind   s
   first paper in nature last year showed that the algorithm learned for a
   while from how humans played the game, and then started to play itself
   to refine those skills. the    learning from humans    part is called
   supervised learning, while the self-play is called reinforcement
   learning. deepmind also built some code into how alphago interpreted
   the game board, like which pieces were its own and whether like pieces
   were next to each other.

      it left open this question: do we really need the human expertise?   
   says satinder singh, a professor specializing in id23
   at the university of michigan, who wrote a review of the new paper in
   nature.    [alphago zero] is a really pleasing, pure reinforcement
   learning success. pure learning through experience.   

   when building the first iterations of alphago, the team explored
   working on a system like alphago zero, but then the technology didn   t
   work.

   alphago zero doesn   t have hints from humans that previous systems had,
   like which pieces are whose or how to interpret the board. it simply
   sees black and white pieces, called stones, on the board. it plays
   itself thousands of times, randomly at first, rewarded for winning and
   punished for losing.

      if we learn the game of go purely through supervised learning, the
   best you could hope to do would be as good as the human you   re
   imitating       singh said.    through self-play you could learn something
   completely novel.   

   alphago zero could beat the version of alphago that faced lee sedol
   after training for just 36 hours and earned its 100-o score after 72
   hours. that previous version took    weeks    to train, according to
   deepmind. the team says they don   t know alphago zero   s upper limit   it
   got so strong that it didn   t seem worth training it anymore. it   s not
   brute computing power that did the trick either: alphago zero was
   trained on one machine with 4 of google   s speciality ai chips, tpus,
   while the previous version was trained on servers with 48 tpus.

beyond go

   deepmind has big plans for this algorithm, which it claims can be
   applied to a wide variety of problems with minor modifications.

      drug discovery, proteins, quantum chemistry, material design   material
   design, think about it, maybe there is a room-temperature
   superconductor out and about there,    hassabis says, alluding to a
   hypothetical metal that would be able to perfectly conduct electricity.
      i used to dream about that when i was a kid reading through my physics
   books. that would be the holy grail, a superconductor discovery.   

   deepmind said that it   s not releasing the code as it might for other
   projects. hassabis says outside researchers will likely be able to
   replicate parts of it from the nature paper.

   others in the field say that the simplicity of the approach was
   surprising, which bodes well for the algorithm being applicable to
   other areas. simple, general methods are valued in ai research because
   less effort is required to bring that same solution to other
   problems, tim salimans, an ai research scientist at openai told quartz
   in an email.

      i think the characterization as    as general as it can be for today   s
   cutting edge    is fair,    salimans said.    although it   s certainly not
   general enough to directly apply to these other problems it is not
   unreasonable to see it as a first step in potentially solving those
   other problems somewhere down the road.
