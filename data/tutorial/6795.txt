   welcome. i am a [33]mathematician and a physicist, and the chief
   scientist and a cofounder of [34]nutrino.
   i work in a number of scientific areas, primarily on deep learning and
   ai, general relativity, integrable systems, partial differential
   equations, and the foundations of quantum theory. i am particularly
   fascinated by [35]the problem of radiation reaction. i love
   applications of mathematics to everyday life, and my current work and
   research in nutrino is a brave attempt to form a new interdisciplinary
   field i like to call "mathematical nutrition".
   here you can find information about my [36]research, [37]teaching,
   [38]travels, and occasional ideas or projects i'm working on.

[42]30 amazing applications of deep learning

   [43]yaron / [44]march 16, 2017 / comments off on 30 amazing
   applications of deep learning / [45]ai, [46]mathematics,
   [47]philosophia naturalis, [48]writings

   over the last few years deep learning was applied to hundreds of
   problems, ranging from id161 to natural language processing.
   in many cases deep learning outperformed previous work. deep
   learning is heavily used in both academia to study intelligence and in
   the industry in building intelligent systems to assist humans in
   various tasks.

   the goal of this post is to share amazing applications of deep learning
   that i've seen. i hope this will excite people about the
   opportunities this field brings, as well as remind us that every
   new technology carries with it potential dangers. i believe the latter
   is especially true about deep learning, and i hope that by exposing
   people to all these amazing results i can encourage more discussion on
   the topic.
   [ins: :ins]

   there are many different applications and this list below is in no way
   exhaustive. so if you know of other cool applications i would
   appreciate it if you can mention them in the comments. to keep this
   easier to follow i organized the different applications by category:
     * [49]deep learning in id161 and pattern recognition
     * [50]deep learning in computer games, robots & self-driving cars
     * [51]deep learning creating sound
     * [52]deep learning doing art
     * [53]computer hallucinations, predictions and other wild things
     * [54]the future of ai

id161 and pattern recognition

1. reenacting politicians

   a group from the university of washington created a system that uses
   audio and synthesizes it with lip motion of a face in a video. the
   video shows quite a striking example of obama. [55]here is the original
   paper.

   cc_load_policy=1&iv_load_policy=3&loop=0&modestbranding=1&rel=0&showinf
   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

2. restore colors in b&w photos and videos

   don't like black and white images? no worries, [57]"let there be
   color!" is a computer system that can automatically restore colors in
   b&w photos. you can read more about it [58]here and see plenty other
   examples [59]here.

   deep learning network restores the color of old black & white photos.

   a similar approach can even be used to colorize old b&w films:

   iframe:
   [60]https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys5nmo4q0iy?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&
   cc_load_policy=1&iv_load_policy=3&loop=0&modestbranding=1&rel=0&showinf
   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

   the deep learning network actually learned patterns that naturally
   occur in photos - the sky is usually blue, clouds are often white/gray
   and grass is typically green in order to restore these colors. but it
   did so itself from its past experience without human intervention. it
   makes mistakes sometime, but they are pretty hard to spot. for example,
   here are two black & white photos with both what the computer guessed
   and the right answer to it. what do you think is the real image? feel
   free to write your guess in the comments below.
   [61]which colorization is correct?

   the computer restored the colors of these two b&w photos but made
   mistakes. can you guess which photos are the real ones?

3. pixel restoration csi style

   in the show [62]csi they often zoom into videos beyond the resolution
   of the actual video. this seemed completely unreliable and there are
   even a few videos on youtube like the one below where people explain
   they don't watch csi because that is unrealistic.

   iframe:
   [63]https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uom5kfziq0?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&
   cc_load_policy=1&iv_load_policy=3&loop=0&modestbranding=1&rel=0&showinf
   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

   well, it was unrealistic until deep learning. early in 2017, [64]google
   brain researchers trained a deep learning network to take very low
   resolution images of faces and predict what each face most likely looks
   like. they call the method [65]pixel recursive super resolution which
   enhances resolution of photos significantly. in the image below you can
   see the original 8x8 photos, the ground truth (which was the real face
   originally in the photos) and in the middle the guess of the computer.
   obviously it is not perfect, as it cannot be, but it is pretty
   unbelievable that the computer can guesstimate so well many of
   the features of the person in the photo.

   8x8 pixel photos were inputted into a deep learning network which tried
   to guess what the original face looked like. as you can see it was
   fairly close (the correct answer is under "ground truth").

4. real-time multi-person pose estimation

   deep learning networks can now greatly aid animators in estimating the
   poses of people. nowadays they can even do it in real-time. a [66]work
   by zhe cao et al taught a neural network to estimate the position of
   human's skeleton. in the video below you can see over a dozen people
   dancing, while the network knows where they are and how they move. this
   is done without having any devices on them, only by analyzing the
   video!

   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

5. describing photos

   we are all used to see computers automatically classify our photos. for
   example, [68]facebook can automatically tag your friends.
   similarly, [69]google photos can automatically label your photos for an
   easier search. in fact, take [70]a state-of-the-art network and train
   it on [71]id163, the biggest database of labelled image and it
   will be able to classify objects [72]better than a phd student who
   trained on the same task for over 100 hours.

   a deep learning network automatically segments an image and writes a
   short sentence describing each segment with a proper english grammar.

   but these are just labels, and deep learning allows taking it several
   steps forward and describe all the various elements in a photo. in
   a [73]work by [74]andrej karpathy and [75]li fei-fei, they trained a
   deep learning network to identify dozens of interesting areas in an
   image and write a sentence to describe what happens in each area. this
   means that the computer not only learned to classify the elements in
   the photo, but to actually describe them with english grammar. you can
   play with hundreds of other examples in [76]this demo.

6. changing gazes of people in photos

   this one is a little weird. imagine you have a photo of someone, like a
   friend or a relative. in [77]deepwarp, [78]ganin et al trained a deep
   learning network to change the gaze of the person. you can even try it
   with your own photos [79]here (warning: link doesn't always work).
   [80]http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/projects/deepwarp/data/4/circul
   ar.webm

7. real-time analysis of behaviors

   so deep learning networks know how to recognize and describe photos and
   they can estimate people poses. [81]deepglint is a solution that uses
   deep learning to get real-time insights about the behavior of cars,
   people and potentially other objects. this is an application of deep
   learning that is on the sketchy side, but it is worth being familiar
   with.

   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

8. iterating photos to create new objects

   [83]a work by nguyen et al let a deep learning network synthesize novel
   photos from existing ones. the results are beautiful and show how the
   network iteratively creates new photos of objects that were not in any
   way in the image before.

   iframe:
   [84]https://www.youtube.com/embed/epuljmtclcy?enablejsapi=1&autoplay=0&

   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

   the network created gorgeous photos of erupting volcanoes as well
   as [85]flowers, birds, faces and much more.

9. generating photos of galaxies

   computer generated galaxies and volcanoes. the architecture used here
   is called [86]id3 (gans).

   we don't really have to stop in terrestrial object when studying the
   natural world using deep learning. astronomers are now using deep
   learning to [87]create photos of galaxies as well as volcanoes.

10. translation

   [88]google translate app can now automatically [89]translate images
   with text in real-time to a language of your choice. just hold the
   camera on top of the object and your phone runs a deep learning network
   to read the image, [90]ocr it (i.e. convert it to text) and then
   translate it. languages will gradually stop being a barrier and we will
   be able to communicate with other humans universally.

   a photo of a packaged food taken by the phone, and google translate
   "reads" the text and replaces it with a text in english in real-time.

11. saving whales and classifying plankton!

   as we've seen, [91]convolutional neural networks are a deep learning
   architecture that learns to classify images amazingly well. this has
   thousands of applications from biology, astronomy, food and more. for
   example, by classifying photos of whales we can better study
   populations of endangered whales.

   o=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

   other examples are [93]plankton classification and [94]plant
   classification.

12. create new images

   a deep learning network generates new photos. for example, photos taken
   at daytime were converted to photos that seem to be taken at night.

   the same idea as in "let there be color!" can be used to for a deep
   learning network to create other types of new images. in [95]pix2pix,
   isola et al taught a deep learning network to perform multiple tasks :
   create real street scenes from colored blobs, create a map from a real
   aerial photo, turn day scenes into night and fill out the colors
   between edges of objects.

   draw the outline of a bag or a shoe and the deep learning network will
   color it for you. the results are pretty creative.

   the last example is pretty cool, in many cases the computer gets pretty
   creative about the designs of the objects.

13. reading text in the wild

   [96]oxford visual geometry group used deep learning to [97]"read text
   in the wild". this is an attempt to read text from photos and videos to
   extend google so we can search for for text from bbc news videos. try
   it out by tapping on the search below.

14. estimate solar savings potential

   [98]google sunroof uses aerial photos from google earth to create a 3-d
   model of your roof. the project uses deep learning neural networks to
   separate your roof from surrounding trees and shadows. it then uses the
   sun's trajectory and weather patterns to predict how much energy can be
   produced by installing solar panels on your roof.

   google sunroof predicts how much money you can save if you install
   solar panels. it uses deep learning to analyze the google earth aerial
   images.

computer games, robots & self-driving cars

15. winning atari breakout

   google's deepmind used a deep learning technique called deep
   id23 to teach a computer to play the [99]atari game
   breakout. the computer wasn't taught or programmed in any way specific
   to play the game. instead, it was given control of the keyboard while
   watching the score, and its goal was to maximize the score. initially,
   it sucks as the movements are mostly random. after two hours of
   playing the computer is an expert. after four hours of playing the
   computer realized that digging a tunnel through the wall is the most
   effective technique to beat the game.

   fo=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

16. beating people in dozens of computer games

   a list of games played by machines. in most games deep learning
   networks trains well enough to play better than a human player.

   don't like breakout? the deep learning community is currently (march
   2017) in a race to train computers to [101]beat people at almost any
   game you can think of, including: [102]space invaders,
   [103]doom, [104]pong, [105]gathering and dozen of other games. in the
   majority of these games deep learning networks already
   outperform experienced players. the computers were not programmed to
   play the games, instead they just played the games for a few hours and
   learned the rules by themselves.

17. playing doom : example of violence in computer games

   statistics of a doom game, where the computer beats an experienced
   human player in almost every parameter.

   but there are also some red flags when we let deep reinforcement
   learning networks play computer games. for example, when playing the
   game [106]doom, the computer kills twice better than a human player and
   gets killed much less. not to get overly apocalyptic about this, but it
   somehow reminded me of the 1992 film [107]universal soldier where van
   damme and dolph lundgren were reanimated after getting killed in
   vietnam. deep learning networks also adopted to be manipulative and
   aggressive in certain cases. when playing gathering, a red and blue
   agent compete on collecting apples (in green) while they can also shoot
   at each other. when the apples are scarce, one of the agents becomes
   aggressive and constantly shoots towards the the apple to prevent the
   other agent from collecting it.

18. self-driving cars

   everybody heard about this one, and now you can actually see them in
   action. in this video [109]a tesla electric vehicle drives without
   human intervention. notice how it distinguishes different type of
   objects, including people and road signs.

19. robotics

   deep learning is also heavily used in robotics these days. this is a
   field of itself which i won't get into, but at least two examples of my
   favorite robots by [111]bostondynamics: spotmini and [112]atlas. the
   robots react to people pushing them around, they also get up when
   falling, and can even take care of pretty elaborate tasks that require
   gentle and care, like unloading a dish washer.

20. try it yourself!

   several of silicon valley's most renown entrepreneurs recently launched
   a non-profit called [115]openai with the goal of democratizing ai and
   deep learning technology. they launched [116]universe, an open source
   platform that lets you test deep learning on hundreds of games and
   websites, so now you can train a deep learning network to play hundreds
   of different games by yourself!

sound

21. voice generation

   last year [118]google released wavenet and [119]baidu released deep
   speech, both are deep learning networks that generated
   voice automatically. you may ask what's the big deal? [120]siri and
   [121]alexa can talk as well. to date, text2voice systems were not
   completely autonomous in the way they created new voices, they were
   (manually) trained to do so. the systems created today learn to mimic
   human voices by themselves and improve with time. when letting an
   audience try to differentiate them from a real human speaking, it is
   much harder to do so. while we are not there yet in terms of automatic
   voice generation, deep learning is taking us a step closer to giving
   computers the ability to speak like humans do.

   if you like music, then it doesn't end here and in
   [123]this work by merlijn blaauw and jordi bonada they even taught a
   deep learning network to sing!

22. music composition

   the same technology used for voice recognition can also be used to
   train a deep learning network to produce music compositions. below is
   one example by francesco marchesani who trained the computer to compose
   music like my favorite classical composer chopin. after the computer
   learns the patterns and statistics that are unique to the music of
   chopin, it creates a completely new piece!

23. restoring sound in videos

   it almost sounds like it should not be possible to restore sound in
   muted videos, but remember there are people who can read other people's
   lips. in [125]a work by owens et al. a deep learning network was
   trained on videos in which people were hitting
   and scratching objects with a drumstick. after several iterations
   learning, the scientists muted the video and asked the computer to
   regenerate the sound it expects to hear - and the results
   are impressive:

   fo=1&fs=1&playsinline=0&autohide=2&theme=dark&color=red&controls=2&

   if this is not enough for you, how about making computers read lips?
   this is what lipnet can do, in a work by [127]oxford and google
   deepmind scientists. lipnet reached 93% success in reading people's
   lips where an average lipreader succeeds 52% of the time.

art

24. transferring style from famous paintings

   style transfer is a technique where a deep learning network can
   transfer artistic styles from known pieces of art to new images

   using deep learning style transfer technique to apply the styles of
   egyptian hieroglyphs, the crab nebula, and google maps to the mona
   lisa.

   a [129]2016 paper by gatys, ecker and bethge experimented with the
   following creative idea. take your favorite work of art and let a deep
   learning network study the patterns in the strokes, colors, and
   shading. plug into the network a new image and the network can transfer
   the style from the original artwork into your image.
   the web is loaded with new creative ways of applying this technique in
   new ways. for example, [130]@genekogan decided to go the other way
   around and applied style transfer to modify the mona lisa according to
   styles learned from egyptian hieroglyphs, the crab nebula, and google
   maps. you can [131]explore more of his and other artistic experiments.

   the method of style transfer go far beyond art and can even be used for
   photography. in [132]this paper by luan et al they transformed photos
   of building, flowers and landscapes. the results you see below are
   stunning (more in [133]this link), the photos are organized left to
   right (left=original, middle=style origin, right=result).

   results of style transfer on photos of buildings and landscapes
   (left=original, middle=style origin, right=output).


   want to try style transfer yourself? [134]deepart.io create apps that
   use deep learning to learned hundreds of different styles which you can
   apply to your photos.

25. automatically writing wikipedia articles, math papers, computer code and
even shakespeare

   this text reads like shakespeare, but was actually written by a deep
   learning (lstm) network who read a lot of shakespeare.

   deep learning networks can be trained on various types of text. here
   the network generates a wikipedia article from scratch.

   another architecture of deep learning is called [135]long short-term
   memory (lstm) and performs amazing well on textual input. in an
   appropriately titled blog post called "the unreasonable effectiveness
   of recurrent neural networks" by [136]andrej karpathy, karpathy let a
   deep learning network "read" shakespeare, wikipedia, math papers and
   computer code. the results? the computer wrote like shakespeare and
   also wrote wikipedia-like articles (note that the yahoo link doesn't
   really exist an the computer "hallucinated" it). the computer was also
   capable of writing [137]fake math papers, and even [138]computer code!
   this is a computer program that writes computer programs. note that the
   text, code and math the computer writes doesn't necessarily make sense
   all the time, but it is only reasonable to expect it will get there.

26. handwriting

   this is a handwritten text created by a computer, and not a hand! tap
   on it to generate your own texts on the blog of alex graves.

   i keep showing the computer generating digital text or art, but today
   the computer can also handwrite. [139]alex graves from the university
   of toronto [140]taught a computer to have its own handwriting in a wide
   variety of styles. [141]tap on the handwriting below to write your own
   text in whichever style you like.

computer hallucinations, predictions and other wild things

27. predicting demographics and election results

   demographics predicted by a deep learning network after only viewing
   photos of cars in each state.

   gebru et al took 50 million [142]google street view images and
   [143]explored what a deep learning network can do [144]with them. the
   results are outstanding, as the computer learned to localize and
   recognize cars. it detected over 22 million cars including their make,
   model, body type, and year. why stop there? the model was actually able
   to predict the demographics of each area by the car makeup. there were
   many insights that are beyond the scope of this blog post, but just a
   cool association it found which is a fun example: "if the number of
   sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher
   than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a
   democrat during the next presidential election (88% chance); otherwise,
   it is likely to vote republican (82%)."

28. deep dreaming

   this next example is going to mess your brain up, so my apologies in
   advance. in late 2015 [145]google researchers found a way to use deep
   learning to let the computer enhance features in images. this technique
   can be used in different ways, one of which is called deep dreaming,
   which lets the computer hallucinate on top of an existing photo. the
   scientists called it deep dreaming because the photos that are
   generated often resemble dreams.

   the computer hallucinates imaginary buildings and structures on top of
   this hill.

   for example in this photo the computer hallucinated structures and
   buildings on top of a mountain. the hallucination vary depending on
   what the neural network was exposed to before, and there are hundreds
   of examples online where the computer is [146]dreaming animals, cars,
   people, buildings. some of the deep dreams are actually deep nightmares
   and can be very disturbing.

   sometimes deep dreams should be more appropriately called "deep
   nightmares". nightmares perceived by the deep learning network.

   youtube is packed nowadays with videos of the computer deep dreaming
   [147]fear & loathing in las vegas, [148]alice in wonderland,
   [149]imaginary cities, [150]vincent van gogh and even [151]donald
   trump. but my two favorites and also potentially the wildest ones
   are the pouff - a trip to the grocery store:

   and this video about a journey on the deep dream, which zooms further
   into other imaginative visions (play with sound).

29. ai invents and hacks its own crypto to avoid eavesdropping

   [154]google brain created [155]two neural networks for security
   purposes, one that creates its own [156]cryptographic algorithm to
   protect their messages and the other network is trying to crack it. the
   network performed very well at devising new crypto mechanisms but not
   as good at hacking them.

30. deep learning networks creating deep learning networks

   [157]neural complete is a deep learning code that can generate new deep
   learning networks. it is not only written in python, but also is
   trained on generating python code. super cool and saves time to other
   (lazy =)) deep learning developers.

   neural complete is a deep learning network that can write deep learning
   code!

31. predicting earthquakes

   harvard scientists used deep learning to teach a computer
   to perform [158]viscoelastic computations, these are the computations
   used in predictions of earthquakes. until their paper, such
   computations were very computer intensive, but this application of deep
   learning [159]improved calculation time by 50,000%. when it comes to
   earthquake calculation, timing is important and this improvement can be
   vital in saving life.

the future of ai

   i hope this post excited you about the applications of deep learning
   and about its potential to help solving some of the problems humanity
   is facing. at the same time it is important to remember and respect the
   fact that every new technology brings with it potential dangers. ai
   safety is really a huge topic that deserves its own blog post that i
   will hopefully write in the future. for now, i would just like to
   mention that there are a lot of people collaborating to ensure ai is
   used in a way that will benefit humanity. i highly recommend
   following ventures like [160]openai, [161]partnership on
   ai, [162]allen institute for artificial intelligence, as well as to be
   well aware of [163]the concerns regarding ai safety as well as the
   [164]optimistic vs. pessimistic views about it.
