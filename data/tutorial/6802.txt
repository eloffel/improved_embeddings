ranking popular deep learning libraries for data science

posted by [40]michael li on october 12, 2017

   [41]gold blog
   at [42]the data incubator, we pride ourselves on having the most up to
   date data science curriculum available. much of our curriculum is based
   on feedback from corporate and government partners about the
   technologies they are using and learning. in addition to their feedback
   we wanted to develop a data-driven approach for determining what we
   should be teaching in our [43]data science corporate training and our
   [44]free fellowship for masters and phds looking to enter data science
   careers in industry. here are the results.

the rankings

   below is a ranking of 23 open-source deep learning libraries that are
   useful for data science, based on github and stack overflow activity,
   as well as google search results. the table shows standardized scores,
   where a value of 1 means one standard deviation above average (average
   = score of 0). for example, caffe is one standard deviation above
   average in github activity, while deeplearning4j is close to average.
   see below for methods.

   [45][dl_libraries_rank.jpg.png]

results and discussion

   the ranking is based on equally weighing its three components: github
   (stars and forks), stack overflow (tags and questions), and google
   results (total and quarterly growth rate). these were obtained using
   available apis. coming up with a comprehensive list of deep learning
   toolkits was tricky     in the end, we scraped five different lists that
   we thought were representative (see methods below for details).
   computing standardized scores for each metric allows us to see which
   packages stand out in each category. the [46]full ranking is here,
   while the [47]raw data is here.

   tensorflow dominates the field with the largest active
   communitytensorflow is at least two standard deviations above the mean
   on all calculated metrics. tensorflow has almost three times as many
   github forks and more than six times as many stack overflow questions
   than the second most popular framework, caffe. first open-sourced by
   the google brain team in 2015, tensorflow has climbed over more senior
   libraries such as theano (4) and torch (8) for the top spot on our
   list. while tensorflow is distributed with a python api running on a
   c++ engine, several of the libraries on our list can utlize tensorflow
   as a back-end and offer their own interfaces. these include keras (2),
   which will [48]soon be part of core tensorflow and sonnet (6). the
   popularity of tensorflow is likely due to a combination of its
   general-purpose deep learning framework, flexible interface,
   good-looking computational graph visualizations, and google   s
   significant developer and community resources.

   caffe has yet to be replaced by caffe2

   caffe takes a strong third place on our list with more github activity
   than all of its competitors (excluding tensorflow). caffe is
   traditionally thought of as more specialized than tensorflow and was
   developed with a focus on image processing, objection recognition, and
   pre-trained convolutional neural networks. facebook released caffe2
   (11) in april 2017, and it already ranks in the top half the deep
   learning libraries. caffe2 is a more lightweight, modular, and scalable
   version of caffe that includes recurrent neural networks. caffe and
   caffe2 are separate repos, so data scientists can continue to use the
   orginial caffe. however, there are migration tools such as [49]caffe
   translator that provide a means of using caffe2 to drive existing caffe
   models.

   keras is the most popular front-end for deep learing

   keras (2) is highest ranked non-framework library. keras can be used as
   a front-end for tensorflow (1), theano (4), mxnet (7), cntk (9), or
   deeplearning4j (14). keras performed better than average on all three
   metrics measured. the popularity of keras is likely due to its
   simplicity and ease-of-use. keras allows for fast protoyping at the
   cost of some of the flexibility and control that comes from working
   directly with a framework. keras is favorited by data scientists
   experimenting with deep learning on their data sets. the development
   and popularity of keras continues with r studio recently releasing
   [50]an interface in r for keras.

   theano continues to hold a top spot even without large industry support

   in a sea of new deep learning frameworks, theano (4) has the distiction
   of the oldest library in our rankings. theano pioneered the use of the
   computational graph and remains popular in the research community for
   deep learning and machine learning in general. theano is essentially a
   numerical computation library for python, but can be used with
   high-level deep learning wrappers like lasagne (15). while google
   supports tensorflow (1) and keras (2), facebook backs pytorch (5) and
   caffe2 (11), mxnet (7) is the offical deep learning framework of amazon
   web services, and microsoft designed and maintains cntk (9), theano
   remains popular without offical support from a technology industry
   giant.

   sonnet is the fastest growing library

   early in 2017 google   s deepmind publicly released the code for sonnet
   (6), a high-level object oriented library built on top of tensorflow.
   the number of pages returned in google search resutls for sonnet has
   grown by 272% from this quarter compared to the last, the largest of
   all the libraries we ranked. although google aquired the british
   artifical intelligence company in 2014, deepmind and google brain have
   remained mostly independent teams. deepmind has a focus on artifical
   general intelligence and sonnet can help a user build on top of their
   specific ai ideas and research.

   python is the language of deep learning interfaces

   pytorch (5), a framework whose sole interface is in python, is the
   second fastest growing library on our list. compared to last quarter,
   pytorch had 236% more google search results. out of the 23 open-source
   deep learning frameworks and wrappers we ranked, only three did not
   have interfaces in python: dlib (10), matconvnet (20), and opennn (23).
   c++ and r interfaces were available in just seven and six of the 23
   libraries, respectively. while the data science community is somewhat
   close to a consensus when it comes to using python, there are still
   many options for deep learning libraries.


limitations

   as with any analysis, decisions were made along the way. all source
   code and data is on [51]our github page. the full list of deep learning
   libraries came from a few sources.

   naturally, some libraries that have been around longer will have higher
   metrics, and therefore higher ranking. the only metric that takes this
   into account is the google search quarterly growth rate.

   the data presented a few difficulties:
     * neural designer and wolfram mathematica are proprietary and were
       removed
     * cntk is also called microsoft cognitive toolkit, but we only used
       the originial ctnk name
     * neon was changed to nervana neon
     * paddle was changed to paddlepaddle
     * some libraries were obviously derivatives of other libraries, such
       as caffe and caffe2. we decided to treat libraries individidually
       if they had unique github repositories.


methods

   all source code and data is on [52]our github page.

   we first generated a list of 23 open-source deep learning libraries
   [53]from [54]each of [55]five [56]different [57]sources, and then
   collected metrics for all of them, to come up with the ranking. github
   data is based on both stars and forks, stack overflow data is based on
   tags and questions containing the package name, and google results are
   based on total number of google search results over the last five years
   and the quarterly growth rate of results calculated over the past three
   months as compared to the prior three months.

   a few other notes:
     * several of the libraries were common words (caffe, chainer,
       lasagne), for this reason the search terms used to determine the
       number of google search results included the library name and the
       term    deep learn
       ing   .
     * any unavailable stack overflow counts were converted to zero count.
     * counts were standardized to mean 0 and deviation 1, and then
       averaged to get github and stack overflow scores, and, combined
       with serch results, the overall score.
     * some manual checks were done to confirm github repository location.

   all data was downloaded on september 14, 2017.
