[7]horovod: an open source distributed deep learning framework for tensorflow
by uber

   we all know the advances and the tremendous progress that has taken
   place in deep learning over the past few years. whether it be image
   processing, forecasting or id103, it has had its magic
   everywhere. and [10]uber? it aims at applying this very knowledge and
   concept into their business, in areas that vary from self-driving
   research to trip forecasting or fraud prevention, deep learning has
   helped them in enabling their engineers as well as data scientists in
   the creation of better experiences for all their users.

   [11]tensorflow, an open source software library for machine
   intelligence is becoming an increasingly preferred deep learning
   library at uber for a number of reasons. to begin with, the framework
   is known to be one of the most widely used open source frameworks for
   deep learning, which makes it easier for all the new users because of
   the platform they are provided with. it is a combination of high
   performance along with low-level model details. in addition to this,
   tensorflow also has an end-to-end support for a wide variety of deep
   learning use cases whether it be from conducting a research to
   deploying models in production on cloud servers, or even self-driving
   vehicles in that case.

   in the month of september, uber engineering pulled back the curtain on
   an internal machine learning-as-a-service platform codenamed as
   [12]michelangelo that aimed at making machine learning very accessible
   and also made the deployment of these systems much easier to build as
   well.

   now, here, you are presented with horovod, an open source distributed
   training framework for tensorflow that is a component of the deep
   learning toolkit of michelangelo and which comes with a goal of making
   distributed deep learning fast and easier to use. now, how did this
   come up? with the current requirements of uber, and after trying out
   various methods to resolve the challenges they were currently facing
   and will continue to do so, they decided to work upon their own
   implementation's to address the needs of uber and hence came to adopt
   baidu   s draft implementation of the tensorflow ring- allreduce
   algorithm and then converted the code into a stand-alone python package
   that was then named as harovod, that also received its name from a
   russian folk dance in which the dancers performed with their arms that
   were linked in a circle, just like how the distributed tenser flow
   processes used horovod to communicate with each other.

   they then replaced the baidu's ring-all reduce implementation with
   nccl(nvidia's collective communication library) that is nvidia   s
   library for collective communication which provides a version of
   ring-all reduce that is highly optimized. soon after, nccl 2 with its
   ability to run ring- allreduce across multiple machines, enabled them
   even further to take advantage of its many boosting optimizations
   related to performance. following the procedure, they also added
   support for models that fit inside a single server, potentially on
   multiple gpus. and then, finally, they made several improvements in
   their api inspired by feedbacks that they received from their initial
   users of the same. this new api allowed them in bringing down the
   number of operations that a user had to introduce to their single gpu
   program to four.

   uber uses this very software to run training models for deep learning
   tasks that run gpu's in hundreds, for research and ultimately acts as a
   guidance for self-driving cars, fraud detection and image
   classification. this training of deep learning involves feedback among
   nodes and hence requires all the nodes to be operational at the same
   time. when a developer uses horovod, a library call is included within
   the program, and, during run-time, a software agent launches the number
   of copies that are required to run the application.

   one of the unique properties of horovod includes its ability to
   interleave communication and computation coupled along with the ability
   to batch small allreduce operations, which in return results in
   improved performance. a batching feature which is called as tensor
   fusion.

   and what's more? you can also use horovod to your advantage for your
   team   s machine learning use cases, too!
