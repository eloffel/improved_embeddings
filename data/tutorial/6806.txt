google's machine learning site teaches the basics of robotics

   all right, we know that someday the robots are going to take over. so
   you might as well get with the program. make it a partnership. we don't
   mean robots like you see in sci-fi movies, walking around with shiny
   metal limbs. anything that's controlled by a program is a robot. so
   most robots aren't visible in the ordinary sense of the word, they're
   just part of the system.
   a machine can respond to body movements, facial gestures, or just
   leaving the scene. the very fact that you're not there can be an
   instruction. bob recalls talking to an engineer who had just come from
   an automated factory in kentucky. it made small electric motors, like
   the kind in vacuum cleaners and sewing machines. the factory floor was
   all dark. you could just see red and blue tiny lights blinking. after
   all, the machines didn't need light, why waste money on lighting?
   this kind of thing is increasing and there's a joke about it that goes
   like this: the factory of the future will only need two attendants: a
   man and a dog. the man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there
   to bark when the man falls asleep.
   so google is going to teach us how to operate machinery without even
   going to the factory. the dog will be out of a job. go to
   teachablemachine.withgoogle.com. they'll teach you how to do it. no
   charge. it's a great introduction to "machine learning," which is
   already a hot career field.
   machine learning powers supercomputers such as ibm's watson. it's used
   in facial recognition software and you see it in photo apps. other
   areas include robotics and medicine. then there's siri, alexa and
   google home, or any system that uses voice recognition. it's all
   machine learning.
   to create your own machine learning demo, you don't need to install
   anything. just go to "google's teachable machine" and start. you will
   need a computer that has a built-in camera, which most do now, or you
   can buy a clip-on camera for older machines; they're cheap.
   in less than a minute, we trained google's website to show a photo,
   play a sound, or talk to us. when joy moved her arm across her computer
   screen, she got a white cat waving its paws. when she was still, she
   got a fluffy pomeranian dog. when she pulled her bangs back, a rabbit
   appeared. we played the air guitar to get a music clip, drummed on the
   desk to do a drum solo and put a thumb to our lips to get a trombone.
   now all of these results are pretty useless, but their point is they
   could just as easily be a result that produced some other action or
   even many actions. but we had to "train" the machine first. that meant
   holding down the "train" button on the website while waving our arms or
   whatever gesture we wanted to associate with a photo, a music clip or a
   voice. we made the voice say "way to go!" when we flexed our muscles.
   as an aside here, it struck bob that this could be an immediate
   response to danger. when the bad guys come in pointing a gun at you,
   just throw up your hands in surrender and that action will immediately
   call the police, seal the doors, release the sleeping gas or whatever.
   if you want to go further, there's wekinator.org. it offers a free
   online course, machine learning for musicians and artists, from
   goldsmith university in london. (it's $20 a month if you want college
   credit.) it's quite techie, but it might just launch a new career. they
   say it's the only such class oriented toward art and music.
   the numbers report
   healthline.com claims there are 156,000 apps dealing with health and
   wellness. start now and you may live long enough to check them all. the
   food and drug administration regulates about 200 health sites. this
   reminds bob that it also annually checks about the same number of
   possibly dangerous chemicals in everyday use. there are roughly 81,000
   of those, so it may take a while.
   given the situation, it's really going to be up to your own judgment.
   fox news reported that developers of three wellness apps, including the
   popular runtastic, created by an adidas subsidiary, as well as mit's
   spinoff cardiio and my baby's beat by matis, paid combined fines of
   $30,00 for overstating their claims.
   bmc medicine, a medical journal, reported that apps claiming to
   determine the right insulin doses for diabetics provide no protection
   against, and may even contribute to, errors.
   cookies
   the new android system, called oreo, is rolling out to phones over the
   next several months. nexus and pixel phones get it first.
   techlicious.com has a great article on this, with all the details. here
   are the highlights we think worth mentioning.
   "dots." in the corner of each app icon, such as the facebook logo,
   you'll see a dot if there are notifications for you. if you're tired of
   seeing the same notification when you swipe down from the top of the
   screen, you can snooze it for 15 minutes or longer. you also get more
   control of how you're notified.
   you can also set the wi-fi assistant to automatically connect to the
   highest quality and safest wi-fi networks. suspect wi-fi areas, such as
   airports, won't connect automatically.
   wherever you connect, your data is protected because it is transmitted
   through a google-operated virtual private network. to enable this
   feature once your oreo update has arrived, go to settings, then google,
   then networking, then wi-fi assistant.
