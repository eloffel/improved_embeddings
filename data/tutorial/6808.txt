   plaidml is an advanced and portable tensor compiler for enabling deep
   learning on laptops, embedded devices, or other devices where the
   available computing hardware is not well supported or the available
   software stack contains unpalatable license restrictions.

   plaidml sits underneath common machine learning frameworks, enabling
   users to access any hardware supported by plaidml. plaidml supports
   keras, onnx, and ngraph.

   as a component within the [106]ngraph compiler stack, plaidml further
   extends the capabilities of specialized deep-learning hardware
   (especially gpus,) and makes it both easier and faster to access or
   make use of subgraph-level optimizations that would otherwise be
   bounded by the compute limitations of the device.

   as a component under [107]keras, plaidml can accelerate training
   workloads with customized or automatically-generated tile code. it
   works especially well on gpus, and it doesn't require use of cuda/cudnn
   on nvidia* hardware, while achieving comparable performance.

   it works on all major operating systems: linux, macos, and windows.

getting started

   for most platforms, getting started with accelerated deep learning is
   as easy as running a few commands (assuming you have python (v2 or v3)
   installed. if this doesn't work, see the [installation instructions]:
virtualenv plaidml
source plaidml/bin/activate
pip install plaidml-keras plaidbench

   choose which accelerator you'd like to use (many computers, especially
   laptops, have multiple):
plaidml-setup

   next, try benchmarking mobilenet id136 performance:
plaidbench keras mobilenet

   or, try training mobilenet:
plaidbench --batch-size 16 keras --train mobilenet

validated hardware

   vertex.ai runs a comprehensive set of tests for each release against
   these hardware targets:
     * amd
          + r9 nano
          + rx 480
          + vega 10
     * intel
          + hd4000
          + hd graphics 505
     * nvidia
          + k80, gtx 780, gt 640m
          + gtx 1070, 1050

validated networks

   we support all of the keras application networks from current versions
   of 2.x. validated networks are tested for performance and correctness
   as part of our continuous integration system.
     * id98s
          + inception v3
          + resnet50
          + vgg19
          + xception
          + mobilenet
          + densenet
          + shufflenet
     * lstm
          + examples/imdb_lstm.py (from keras)

installation instructions

   see detailed per-platform instructions [108]here.

plaidvision and plaidbench

   we've developed two open source projects:
     * [109]plaidvision provides a simple shell for developing vision
       applications using your webcam
     * [110]plaidbench is a performance testing suite designed to help
       users compare the performance of different cards and different
       frameworks

hello vgg

   one of the great things about keras is how easy it is to play with
   state of the art networks. here's all the code you need to run vgg-19:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import numpy as np
import os
import time

os.environ["keras_backend"] = "plaidml.keras.backend"

import keras
import keras.applications as kapp
from keras.datasets import cifar10

(x_train, y_train_cats), (x_test, y_test_cats) = cifar10.load_data()
batch_size = 8
x_train = x_train[:batch_size]
x_train = np.repeat(np.repeat(x_train, 7, axis=1), 7, axis=2)
model = kapp.vgg19()
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='categorical_crossid178',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

print("running initial batch (compiling tile program)")
y = model.predict(x=x_train, batch_size=batch_size)

# now start the clock and run 10 batches
print("timing id136...")
start = time.time()
for i in range(10):
    y = model.predict(x=x_train, batch_size=batch_size)
print("ran in {} seconds".format(time.time() - start))
