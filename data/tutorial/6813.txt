google's learning software learns to write learning software

   [ai_builds_ai-01.png]
   hotlittlepotato

   white-collar automation has become a common buzzword in debates about
   the growing power of computers, as software shows potential to take
   over some work of [39]accountants and [40]lawyers.
   artificial-intelligence researchers at google are trying to automate
   the tasks of highly paid workers more likely to wear a hoodie than a
   coat and tie   themselves.

   in a project called automl, google   s researchers have taught
   machine-learning software to build machine-learning software. in some
   instances, what it comes up with is more powerful and efficient than
   the best systems the researchers themselves can design. google says the
   system recently scored a record 82 percent at categorizing images by
   their content. on the harder task of marking the location of multiple
   objects in an image, an important task for augmented reality and
   autonomous robots, the auto-generated system scored 43 percent. the
   best human-built system scored 39 percent.

   such results are significant because the expertise needed to build
   cutting-edge ai systems is in scarce supply   even at google.    today
   these are handcrafted by machine learning scientists and literally only
   a few thousands of scientists around the world can do this,    said
   google ceo sundar pichai last week, briefly namechecking automl at a
   launch event for [41]new smartphones and other gadgets.    we want to
   enable hundreds of thousands of developers to be able to do it.   

   automl remains a research project. somewhat ironically, right now it
   takes exactly the kind of rare ai expertise this technology seeks to
   automate to get it working. but a growing number of researchers outside
   google are working on this technology, too. if ai-made ai becomes
   practical, machine learning could spread outside of the tech industry,
   for example in [42]healthcare and [43]finance, much faster.

   at google, automl could accelerate pichai   s    ai first    strategy,
   through which the company is using machine learning to run more
   efficiently and create new products. researchers from the company   s
   google brain research group or the london-based deepmind research lab
   it acquired in 2014 have helped slash power bills in [44]company data
   centers, and sped up google   s ability to [45]map new cities, for
   example. automl could make those experts more productive, or help
   less-skilled engineers build powerful ai systems by themselves.

       apple just joined tech's great race to democratize ai

   google lists just over 1,300 people on its research website, not all of
   whom specialize in ai. it has many thousands more software engineers.
   google parent alphabet has 27,169 employees engaged in research and
   development, according to its most recent annual financial filing.

   google declined to make anyone available to discuss automl. researchers
   outside the company say the idea of automating some work of ai experts
   has become a research hotspot   and is needed as ai systems become more
   complex.

   much work in what is called metalearning or learning to learn,
   including google   s, is aimed at speeding up the process of deploying
   id158s. that technique involves feeding data
   through networks of math operations loosely inspired by studies of
   neurons in the brain.

   that may sound highly sophisticated, but a good part of getting neural
   networks to perform useful tricks like processing audio comes down to
   well-paid grunt work. experts must use instinct and trial and error to
   discover the right architecture for a neural network.    a large part of
   that engineer   s job is essentially a very boring task, trying multiple
   configurations to see which ones work better,    says roberto calandra, a
   researcher at university of california berkeley. the challenge is
   getting harder, he says, because researchers are building larger
   networks to tackle tougher problems.

   calandra began researching metalearning after spending two frustrating
   weeks trying to get a robot to learn to walk during his phd studies in
   2013. he tried an experimental technique to automatically tune its
   software, which was based on a machine learning technique less complex
   than a neural network. the recalcitrant machine walked within a day.

   generating a neural-network design from scratch is harder than tweaking
   the settings of one that already exists. but recent research results
   suggest it   s getting closer to becoming practical, says mehryar mohri,
   a professor at nyu.

   mohri is working on a system called adanet, in a collaboration that
   includes researchers at google   s new york office. when given a
   collection of labeled data, it builds a neural network layer by layer,
   testing each addition to the design to ensure it improves performance.
   adanet has shown capable of generating neural networks that can
   accomplish a task as well as a standard, hand-built network that   s
   twice as large. that   s promising, says mohri, because many companies
   are trying to cram more powerful ai software [46]onto mobile devices
   with limited resources.

   making it easier to generate and deploy complex ai systems might come
   with drawbacks. recent research has shown that it is all too easy to
   accidentally make systems with a biased view of the world, for example
   that [47]   mexican    is a bad word, or have a tendency to [48]associate
   women with domestic chores. mohri argues that reducing the tedious
   hand-tuning required to make use of neural networks could make it
   easier to detect and prevent such problems.    it   s going to make
   people   s hands more free to tackle other aspects of the problem,    he
   says.

   if and when google gets automl working well enough to be a practical
   tool for programmers, its effects could be felt beyond the company
   itself. pichai hinted last week that he wanted to make the tool
   available outside of google.    we want to democratize this,    he said,
   echoing lofty language used to [49]promote ai services offered by his
   cloud computing unit.
