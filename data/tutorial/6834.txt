tensorflow id195 text summarization

   this branch uses new tf.contrib.id195 apis in tensorflow r1.1. for
   r1.0 users, please check [76]branch tf1.0
     __________________________________________________________________

   this is an implementation of sequence-to-sequence model using a
   bidirectional gru encoder and a gru decoder. this project aims to help
   people start working on abstractive short text summarization
   immediately. and hopefully, it may also work on machine translation
   tasks.

dataset

   please check [77]harvardnlp/sent-summary.

usage

setup environment

with gpu

   if you want to train the model and have nvidia gpus (like gtx 1080, gtx
   titan, etc), please setup cuda environment and install tensorflow-gpu.
> pip3 install -u tensorflow-gpu==1.1

   you can check whether the gpu works by
> python3
>>> import tensorflow
>>>

   and make sure there are no error outputs.

without gpu

   if you don't have a gpu, you can still use the pretrained models and
   generate summaries using your cpu.
> pip3 install -u tensorflow==1.1

model and data

   files should be organized like this.

   please find these files in the harvardnlp/sent-summary and rename them
   as
duc2003/input.txt -> test.duc2003.txt
duc2004/input.txt -> test.duc2004.txt
giga/input.txt -> test.giga.txt

train model

   > python3 script/train.py can reproduce the experiments shown below.

   by doing so, it will train 200k batches first. then do generation on
   [giga, duc2003, duc2004] with beam_size in [1, 10] respectively every
   20k batches. it will terminate at 300k batches. also, the model will be
   saved every 20k batches.

test model

   > python3 script/test.py will automatically use the most updated model
   to do generation.

   to do customized test, please put input data as
data/test.your_test_name.txt

   change script/test.py line 13-14 from
datasets = ["giga", "duc2003", "duc2004"]
geneos = [true, false, false]

   to
datasets = ["your_test_name"]
geneos = [true]

   for advanced users, python3 src/summarization.py -h can print help.
   please check the code for details.

implementation details

bucketing

   in tensorflow r0.11 and earlier, using bucketing is recommended. r1.0
   provides dynamic id56 id195 framework which is much easier to
   understand than the tricky bucketing mechanism.

   we use dynamic id56 to generate compute graph. there is only one
   computing graph in our implemention. however, we still split the
   dataset into several buckets and use data from the same bucket to
   create a batch. by doing so, we can add less padding, leading to a
   better efficiency.

attention mechanism

   the attention mechanism follows [79]bahdanau et. al.

   we follow the implementation in tf.contrib.id195. we refine the
   softmax function in attention so that paddings always get 0.

id125

   for simplicity and flexibility, we implement the id125 algorithm
   in python while leave the network part in tensorflow. in testing, we
   consider batch_size as beam_size. the tensorflow graph will generate
   only 1 word, then some python code will create a new batch according to
   the result. by iteratively doing so, id125 result is generated.

   check step_beam(...) in bigru_model.py for details.

results

   we train the model for 300k batches with batch size 80. we clip all
   summaries to 75 bytes. for duc datasets, we eliminate eos and generate
   12 words. for giga dataset, we let the model to generate eos.
