opennre

   an open-source framework for neural id36.

   contributed by [75]tianyu gao, [76]xu han, [77]shulian cao, [78]lumin
   tang, [79]yankai lin, [80]zhiyuan liu

   if you want to learn more about neural id36, visit
   another project of ours [81]nrepapers.

   big update: the project has been completely reconstructed and is
   faster, more extendable and the codes are easier to read and use now.
   if you need get to the old version, please refer to branch
   [82]old_version.

   new features:
     * json data support.
     * multi gpu training.
     * validating while training.

overview

   it is a tensorflow-based framwork for easily building relation
   extraction (re) models. we divide the pipeline of id36
   into four parts, which are embedding, encoder, selector (for distant
   supervision) and classifier. for each part we have implemented several
   methods.
     * embedding
          + id27
          + position embedding
     * encoder
          + pid98
          + id98
          + id56
          + bidirection id56
     * selector
          + attention
          + maximum
          + average
     * classifier
          + softmax id168
          + output

   all those methods could be combined freely.

   we also provide training and testing framework for sentence-level re
   and bag-level re. a plotting tool is also in the package.

   this project is under mit license.

requirements

     * python (>=2.7)
     * numpy (>=1.13.3)
     * tensorflow (>=1.4.1)
          + cuda (>=8.0) if you are using gpu
     * matplotlib (>=2.0.0)
     * scikit-learn (>=0.18)

data format

   for training and testing, you should provide four json files including
   training data, testing data, id27 data and relation-id
   mapping data.

training data & testing data

   training data file and testing data file, containing sentences and
   their corresponding entity pairs and relations, should be in the
   following format
[
    {
        'sentence': 'bill gates is the founder of microsoft .',
        'head': {'word': 'bill gates', 'id': 'm.03_3d', ...(other information)},
        'tail': {'word': 'microsoft', 'id': 'm.07dfk', ...(other information)},
        'relation': 'founder'
    },
    ...
]

   important: in the sentence part, words and punctuations should be
   separated by blank spaces.

id27 data

   id27 data is used to initialize id27 in the
   networks, and should be in the following format
[
    {'word': 'the', 'vec': [0.418, 0.24968, ...]},
    {'word': ',', 'vec': [0.013441, 0.23682, ...]},
    ...
]

relation-id mapping data

   this file indicates corresponding ids for relations to make sure during
   each training and testing period, the same id means the same relation.
   its format is as follows
{
    'na': 0,
    'relation_1': 1,
    'relation_2': 2,
    ...
}

   important: make sure the id of na is always 0.

provided data

nyt10 dataset

   nyt10 is a distantly supervised dataset originally released by the
   paper "sebastian riedel, limin yao, and andrew mccallum. modeling
   relations and their mentions without labeled text.". here is the
   download [83]link for the original data.

   we've provided a toolkit to convert the original nyt10 data into json
   format that opennre could use. you could download the original data +
   toolkit from [84]google drive or [85]tsinghua cloud. further
   instructions are included in the toolkit.

installation and quick start

    1. install all the required package.
    2. clone the opennre repository:

git clone https://github.com/thunlp/opennre.git

   since there are too many history commits of this project and the .git
   folder is too large, you could use the following command to download
   only the latest commit:
git clone https://github.com/thunlp/opennre.git --depth 1

    3. make data folder in the following structure

opennre
|-- ...
|-- data
    |
    |-- {dataset_name_1}
    |   |
    |   |-- train.json
    |   |-- test.json
    |   |-- word_vec.json
    |   |-- rel2id.json
    |
    |-- {dataset_name_2}
    |   |
    |   |-- ...
    |
    |-- ...

   you could use your own data or download datasets provided above.
    4. run train_demo.py {dataset_name} {encoder_name} {selector_name}.
       for example, if you want to train model with pid98 as the encoder
       and attention as the selector on the nyt dataset, run the following
       command

python train_demo.py nyt pid98 att

   currently {encoder_name} includes pid98, id98, id56 and biid56, and
   {selector_name} includes att (for attention), max (for maximum) and ave
   (for average). the model will be named as
   {dataset_name}_{encoder_name}_{selector_name} automatically.

   the checkpoint of the best epoch (each epoch will be validated while
   training) will be saved in ./checkpoint and results for plotting
   precision-recall curve will be saved in ./test_result by default.
    5. use draw_plot.py to check auc, average precision, f1 score and
       precision-recall curve by the following command

python draw_plot.py {model_name_1} {model_name_2} ...

   all the results of the models mentioned will be printed and
   precision-recall curves containing all the models will be saved in
   ./test_result/pr_curve.png.
    6. if you have the checkpoint of the model and want to evaluate it,
       run test_demo.py {dataset_name} {encoder_name} {selector_name}. for
       example:

python test_demo.py nyt pid98 att

   the prediction results will be stored in
   test_result/nyt_pid98_att_pred.json.

additional modules

id23 (feng et al. 2018)

   we have implemented a id23 module following [86](feng
   et al. 2018). there might be some slight differences in implementation
   details. the rl code is in nrekit/rl.py, and it can be added to any
   models by running:
python train_demo.py {dataset_name} {encoder_name} {selector_name} rl

   for example, by running python train_demo.py nyt pid98 att rl, you will
   get a pid98_att model trained by rl.

   for how the rl module helps alleviate false positive problem in ds
   data, please refer to the paper.
