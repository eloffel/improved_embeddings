your tl;dr by an ai: a deep reinforced model for abstractive summarization

   romain paulus, caiming xiong and richard socher

   the last few decades have witnessed a fundamental change in the
   challenge of taking in new information. the bottleneck is no longer
   access to information; now it   s our ability to keep up. we all have to
   read more and more to keep up-to-date with our jobs, the news, and
   social media. we   ve looked at how ai can improve people   s work by
   helping with this information deluge and one potential answer is to
   have algorithms automatically summarize longer texts.

   training a model that can generate long, coherent, and meaningful
   summaries remains an open research problem. in fact, generating any
   kind of longer text is hard for even the most advanced deep learning
   algorithms. in order to make summarization successful, we introduce two
   separate improvements: a more contextual word generation model and a
   new way of training summarization models via id23
   (rl).

   the combination of the two training methods enables the system to
   create relevant and highly readable multi-sentence summaries of long
   text, such as news articles, significantly improving on previous
   results. our algorithm can be trained on a variety of different types
   of texts and summary lengths. in this blog post, we present the main
   contributions of our model and an overview of the natural language
   challenges specific to text summarization.
   figure 1: illustration of our model generating a multi-sentence summary
   from a news article. for each generated word, the model pays attention
   to specific words of the input and the previously generated output.

extractive vs. abstractive summarization

   id54 models can work in one of two ways: by
   extraction or by abstraction. extractive models perform
   "copy-and-paste" operations: they select relevant phrases of the input
   document and concatenate them to form a summary. they are quite robust
   since they use existing natural-language phrases that are taken
   straight from the input, but they lack in flexibility since they cannot
   use novel words or connectors. they also cannot paraphrase like people
   sometimes do. in contrast, abstractive models generate a summary based
   on the actual    abstracted    content: they can use words that were not in
   the original input. this gives them a lot more potential to produce
   fluent and coherent summaries but it is also a much harder problem as
   you now require the model to generate coherent phrases and connectors.

   even though abstractive models are more powerful in theory, it is
   common for them to make mistakes in practice. typical mistakes include
   incoherent, irrelevant or repeated phrases in generated summaries,
   especially when trying to create long text outputs. they historically
   lacked a sense of general coherence, flow and readability. in this
   work, we tackle these issues and design a more robust and coherent
   abstractive summarization model.

   in order to understand our new abstractive model, let   s first define
   the basic building blocks and then introduce our new training scheme.

reading and generating text with encoder-decoder models

   [409]recurrent neural networks (id56s) are deep learning models that can
   process sequences (e.g. text) of variable length and compute useful
   representations (or hidden state) for each phrase.  these networks
   process each element of the sequence (in this case, each word) one by
   one; for each new input in the sequence, the network outputs a new
   hidden state as a function of that input and the previous hidden state.
   in this sense, the hidden state calculated at each word is a function
   of all the words read up to that point.
   figure 2: a recurrent neural network reads an input sentence by
   applying the same function (in green) on individual words.
   the input (reading) and output (generating) id56s can be combined in a
   joint model where the the final hidden state of the input id56 is used
   as the initial hidden state of the output id56. combined in this way,
   the joint model is able to read any text and generate a different text
   from it. this framework is called an encoder-decoder id56 (or id195)
   and is the basis of our summarization model. in addition, we replace
   the traditional encoder id56 by a bidirectional encoder, which uses two
   different id56s to read the input sequence: one that reads the text from
   left-to-right (as illustrated in figure 4) and another that reads from
   right-to-left. this helps our model to have a better representation of
   the input context.
   figure 4: encoder-decoder id56 models can be used to solve
   sequence-to-sequence tasks in natural language such as summarization.

a new attention and decoding mechanism

   to make our model outputs more coherent, we allow the decoder to look
   back at parts of the input document when generating a new word with a
   technique called temporal attention. instead of relying entirely on its
   own hidden state, the decoder can incorporate contextual information
   about different parts of the input with an attention function. this
   attention is then modulated to ensure that the model uses different
   parts of the input when generating the output text, hence increasing
   information coverage of the summary.

   in addition, to make sure that our model doesn't repeat itself, we also
   allow it to look back at the previous hidden states from the decoder.
   in a similar fashion, we define an intra-decoder attention function
   that can look back at previous hidden states of the decoder id56s.
   finally, the decoder combines the context vector from the temporal
   attention with the one from the intra-decoder attention to generate the
   next word in the output summary. figure 5 illustrates the combination
   of these two attention functions at a given decoding step.
   figure 5: two context vectors (marked    c   ) are computed from attending
   over the encoder hidden states and decoder hidden states. using these
   two contexts and the current decoder hidden state (   h   ), a new word is
   generated (on the right) and added to the output sequence.

how to train this model? supervised learning vs. id23

   to train this model on real-world data like news articles, a common way
   is to use the teacher forcing algorithm: a model generates a summary
   while using a reference summary, and the model is assigned a
   word-by-word error (or    local supervision   , as shown in figure 6) each
   time it generates a new word.
   figure 6: model training with supervised learning. each generated word
   gets a training supervision signal, calculated by comparing it against
   the ground truth summary word at the same position.

   this method can be used to train any sequence generation model based on
   recurrent neural networks, with very decent results. however, for our
   particular task, summaries don't have to match a reference sequence
   word by word in order to be correct. as you can imagine, two humans may
   generate very different summaries of the same news article, sometimes
   using different styles, words or sentence orders, while still being
   considered good summaries.

   the problem with teacher forcing here is that as soon as the first few
   words are generated, the training is misguided: it sticks strictly to
   the one officially correct summary and cannot adjust to a potentially
   correct but different beginning.

   taking this into consideration, we can do better than the word-by-word
   approach of teacher forcing. a different kind of training called
   id23 (rl) can be applied here.

   at first, the rl algorithm lets the model generate its own summary,
   then it uses an external scorer to compare the generated summary
   against the ground truth. this scorer then indicates to the model how
   "good" the generated summary was. if the score is high, then the model
   can update itself to make such summaries more likely to appear in the
   future. otherwise, if the score is low, the model will get penalized
   and change its generation procedure to prevent similar summaries. this
   reinforced model is very good at increasing the summarization score
   that evaluates the entire sequence rather than a word-by-word
   prediction.
   figure 7: in id23, the model doesn   t have a local
   supervision signal for every predicted word, but instead is trained
   with a reward signal that depends on the entire output and the
   reference summary.

how to evaluate summarization?

   what exactly is this scorer, and how does it tell if summaries are
   "good"? since asking a human to manually evaluate millions of summaries
   is long and impractical at scale, we rely on an automated evaluation
   metric called [410]id8 (recall-oriented understudy for gisting
   evaluation). id8 works by comparing matching sub-phrases in the
   generated summaries against sub-phrases in the ground truth reference
   summaries, even if they are not perfectly aligned. different variants
   of id8 (id8-1, id8-2, id8-l) all work in the same fashion but
   use different sub-sequence lengths.

   while id8 scores have a good correlation with human judgment in
   general, the summaries with the highest id8 aren't necessarily the
   most readable or natural ones. this became an issue when we trained our
   model to maximize the id8 score with id23 alone. we
   observed that our models with the highest id8 scores also generated
   barely-readable summaries.

   to bring the best of both worlds, our model is trained with teacher
   forcing and id23 at the same time, being able to make
   use of both word-level and whole-summary-level supervision to make it
   more coherent and readable. in particular, we find that id8-optimized
   rl helps improve recall (i.e all important information that needs to be
   summarized is indeed summarized) and word level learning supervision
   ensures good language flow, making the summary more coherent and
   readable.
   figure 8: combination of supervised learning (in red) and reinforcement
   learning (in purple), showing how our model can learn both local and
   global rewards and optimize both for readability and overall id8
   score.
   until recently, the highest id8-1 score for abstractive summarization
   on the id98/daily mail dataset was 35.46. the combination of our
   intra-decoder attention id56 model with joint supervised and rl training
   improves this score to 39.87, and 41.16 with rl only. figure 9 shows
   other summarization scores for existing models and ours. even though
   our pure rl model has higher id8 scores, our supervised+rl model has
   a higher readability, hence is more relevant for this summarization
   task. note that see et al. use a slightly different data format, hence
   their results are not directly comparable with ours and the others but
   still give a good reference point.
   figure 9: summarization results on the id98/daily mail dataset,
   comparing our model against existing abstractive and extractive
   approaches.

sample outputs

   what does such a large improvement mean in terms of real summaries?
   here we show a couple of multi-sentence summaries based on documents
   from the development split of the dataset. our model and its simpler
   baselines generated these, after training on the [411]id98/daily mail
   dataset. as you can see, the summaries have significantly improved but
   there   s still more work needed to make them perfect.

   google wallet says it has changed its policy when storing users' funds
   as they will now be federally-insured (file photo)

   for those who use google wallet, their money just became safer with
   federal-level insurance.

   google confirmed to yahoo finance in a statement that its current
   policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users
   of the mobile transfer service (similar to paypal and venmo) in
   multiple federally-insured banking institutions.

   this is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their
   wallet balance because the federal deposit insurance corporation
   insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000.

   currently, google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the
   fdic.

   however, a google spokesperson told yahoo finance that the current
   policy has changed. (...)

   our main contributions. new words that are not present in the original
   article are shown in green. repeated phrases in the summaries are shown
   in red.

conclusion

   our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art in multi-sentence
   summary generation, outperforming existing abstractive models and
   extractive baselines. we believe that our contributions - the
   intra-decoder attention module and the combined training objective -
   could improve other sequence generation tasks, especially for long
   outputs.

   our work also touches on the limit of automatic id74 such
   as id8, and shows that better metrics are required to evaluate - and
   optimize - summarization models. an ideal metric will correlate well
   with human judgment both in terms of summary coherence and readability.
   when such a metric is used with our reinforced summarization model
   summaries may improve even further.
