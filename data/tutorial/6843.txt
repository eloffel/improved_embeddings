pyteaser

   pyteaser takes any news article and extract a brief summary from it.
   it's based on the original [81]scala project.

   summaries are created by ranking sentences in a news article according
   to how relevant they are to the entire text. the top 5 sentences are
   used to form a "summary". each sentence is ranked by using four
   criteria:
     * relevance to the title
     * relevance to keywords in the article
     * position of the sentence
     * length of the sentence

installation:

   requires python 2.7. (need collections.counter)
sudo pip install pyteaser

   these dependency packages will be automatically installed:
pillow
lxml
cssselect
jieba
beautifulsoup

   note: if you're installing on windows, you have to install one of the
   dependency package lxml manually using:
easy_install lxml==2.3.3

   more information about this issue here:
   [82]https://github.com/xiaoxu193/pyteaser/issues/17

usage:

sample command:

>>> from pyteaser import summarizeurl
>>> url = 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/twitter-forward-secrecy_n_43
26599.html'
>>> summaries = summarizeurl(url)
>>> print summaries

output

["twitter\'s move is the latest response from u.s. internet firms following disc
losures by former spy agency contractor edward snowden about widespread, classif
ied u.s. government surveillance programs.", "\\"since then, it has become clear
er and clearer how important that step was to protecting our users\' privacy.\\"
", "the online messaging service, which began scrambling communications in 2011
using traditional https encryption, said on friday it has added an advanced laye
r of protection for https known as \\"forward secrecy.\\"", "\\"a year and a hal
f ago, twitter was first served completely over https,\\" the company said in a
blog posting.", " \\"i\'m glad this is the direction the industry is taking.\\"
\\n\\n(reporting by jim finkle; editing by andrew hay)"]


   you can use summarize(title, text) directly if you already have the
   text and the title. otherwise you must install python goose to extract
   text from url.
