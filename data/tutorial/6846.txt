vanilla lstm with numpy

october 8, 2017

   this is inspired from [4]minimal character-level language model with a
   vanilla recurrent neural network, in python/numpy by [5]andrej
   karpathy.

   the blog post updated in december, 2017 based on feedback from
   [6]@alexsherstinsky; thanks!

   this is a simple implementation of long short-term memory (lstm) module
   on numpy from scratch. this is for learning purposes. the network is
   trained with stochastic id119 with a batch size of 1 using
   adagrad algorithm (with momentum).

   you can download the jupyter notebook from
   [7]http://blog.varunajayasiri.com/ml/numpy_lstm.ipynb

   the model usually reaches an error of about 45 after 5000 iterations
   when tested with [8]100,000 character sample from shakespeare. however
   it sometimes get stuck in a local minima; reinitialize the weights if
   this happens.

   you need to place the input text file as `input.txt` in the same folder
   as the python code.
