companion jupyter notebooks for the book "deep learning with python"

   this repository contains jupyter notebooks implementing the code
   samples found in the book [95]deep learning with python (manning
   publications). note that the original text of the book features far
   more content than you will find in these notebooks, in particular
   further explanations and figures. here we have only included the code
   samples themselves and immediately related surrounding comments.

   these notebooks use python 3.6 and keras 2.0.8. they were generated on
   a p2.xlarge ec2 instance.
