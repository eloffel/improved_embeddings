basics of id203 for data science explained with examples

   [96]dishashree gupta, february 2, 2017

introduction

     statistically, the id203 of any one of us being here is so
     small that you   d think the mere fact of existing would keep us all
     in a contented dazzlement of surprise


                                            lewis thomas

   for anyone taking first steps in data science, id203 is a must
   know concept. concepts of id203 theory are the backbone of many
   important concepts in data science like inferential statistics to
   id110s. it would not be wrong to say that the journey of
   mastering statistics begins with id203.

   in this guide, i will start with basics of id203. then i   ll
   introduce binomial distribution, central limit theorem, normal
   distribution and z-score. if they sound scary right now     just hold on
   for a few minutes. i have explained each concept with an example.

   i have explained each concept in a simplistic manner to avoid overload
   of mathematical concepts. at the end of the guide, i have given you two
   fun and exciting challenges. go though them and post your answer in the
   comments sections. let   s see how many of you can answer them correctly.

   let   s explore id203 together!

1. what is id203?

   simply put, id203 is an intuitive concept. we use it on a daily
   basis without necessarily realising that we are speaking and applying
   id203 to work.

   life is full of uncertainties. we don   t know the outcomes of a
   particular situation until it happens. will it rain today? will i pass
   the next math test? will my favorite team win the toss? will i get a
   promotion in next 6 months? all these questions are examples of
   uncertain situations we live in. let us map them to few common
   terminology which we will use going forward.
     * experiment     are the uncertain situations, which could have
       multiple outcomes. whether it rains on a daily basis is an
       experiment.
     * outcome is the result of a single trial. so, if it rains today, the
       outcome of today   s trial from the experiment is    it rained   
     * event is one or more outcome from an experiment.    it rained    is one
       of the possible event for this experiment.
     * id203 is a measure of how likely an event is. so, if it is
       60% chance that it will rain tomorrow, the id203 of outcome
          it rained    for tomorrow is 0.6

why do we need id203?

   in an uncertain world, it can be of immense help to know and understand
   chances of various events. you can plan things accordingly. if it   s
   likely to rain, i would carry my umbrella. if i am likely to have
   diabetes on the basis of my food habits, i would get myself tested. if
   my customer is unlikely to pay me a renewal premium without a reminder,
   i would remind him about it.

   so knowing the likelihood might be very beneficial.


2. random variables

   to calculate the likelihood of occurence of an event, we need to put a
   framework to express the outcome in numbers. we can do this by mapping
   the outcome of an experiment to numbers.

   let   s define x to be the outcome of a coin toss.

   x = outcome of a coin toss

   possible outcomes:
     * 1 if heads
     * 0 if tails

   let   s take another one.

   suppose, i win the game if i get a sum of 8 while rolling two fair
   dice. i can define my random variable y to be (the sum of the upward
   face of two fair dice )

   y can take values = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)

   a few things to note about random variables:
     * each value of the random variable may or may not be equally likely.
       there is only 1 combination of dice, with sum 2{(1,1)}, while a sum
       of 5 can be achieved by {(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)}. so, 5 is more
       likely to occur as compared to 2. on the contrary, the likelihood
       of a head or a tail in a coin toss is equal and 50-50.
     * sometimes, the random variables can only take fixed values, or
       values only in a certain interval. for example in a dice, the top
       face will only show values between 1 and 6. it cannot take a 2.25
       or a 1.5. similarly, when a coin is flipped, it can only show heads
       and tails and nothing else. on the other hand, if i define my
       random variable to be the amount of sugar in orange. it can take
       any value like 1.4g, 1.45g, 1.456g, 1.4568g as so on. all these
       values are possible and all infinite values between them are also
       possible. so, in this case, the random variable is continuous with
       a possibility of all real numbers.
     * don   t think random variable as a traditional variable (even though
       both are called variables) like y=x+2, where the value of y is
       dependent on x. random variable is defined in terms of the outcome
       of a process. we quantify the process using the random variable.


3. calculating id203 by principle of counting

   let   s say you went to a fair. there is a stall playing the game of
   spinning wheel. there are two colors evenly spread on the wheel     red
   and green. if you land on red, you lose, if you land on green you win.

   so what happens when you spin the wheel? you either win or you lose?
   there is no third outcome in this case. if the wheel is fair, there is
   a 50% chance of winning and 50% chance of losing.

   next, suppose the organizer decides to increase the prize money and
   reduce the green area. now only   ^th area is green and   ^th is red.

   how likely are you to win now?

   only 25%! this 25% or .25 is the id203 of winning.

two throws of a dice

   the next stall is our favorite dice stall, where we win if we get a sum
   of 8 in two throws. let   s see if we have more chances to win here.

   let   s take random variable x to be the sum of two throws. x can take
   values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). let   s see the id203
   of each number.

   let   s see the id203 of each number.

   there are 6 possibilities in the first throw (we can get any number)
   and same 6 in the second. so total number if combinations would be 36.

   let   s see how:

   2{(1,1)}  => 1/36

   3{(1,2),(2,1)} => 2/36

   4{(2,2),(3,1),(1,3)} => 3/36

   5{(1,4),(4,1),(2,3),(3,2)} => 4/36

   6{(3,3),(1,5),(5,1),(2,4),(4,2)} => 5/36

   7{(1,6),(6,1),(2,5),(5,2),(3,4),(4,3)} => 6/36

   8{(2,6),(6,2),(3,5),(5,3),(4,4)} => 5/36

   9{(3,6),(6,3),(5,4),(4,5)} => 4/36

   10{(4,6),(6,4),(5,5)} => 3/36

   11{(5,6),(6,5)} => 2/36

   12{(6,6)} = > 1/36

   so, the chance of success here is 5/36 or approximately 1 in 7, while
   failure is 31/36. so, unless the stall rewards me 7x of the money i bet
   on winning, it is a bad game to participate in.

   we can write this as:
     * p (success)= 5/36
     * p (failure)= 31/36

   you can also see that the total id203 is 1. there are only these
   2 possibilities.

   let   s see how these probabilities look like. the id203 function
   for a discrete random variable is the id203 mass function. it
   shows the exact probabilities for a particular value of the random
   variable.

   here is an important thing to note, a sum of 2.5 is not possible on the
   throw of two dice. so essentially, my random variable is discrete.
   there are only fixed integer values that it can take and we can see the
   probabilities of each occurring.

4. binomial distribution

   most of the times, the situations we encounter are pass-fail type. the
   democrats either win or lose the election. i either get a heads or
   tails on the coin toss. you either win or lose your football game
   (assuming that there is always a forced outcome). so there are only two
   outcomes     win and lose or success and failure. the likelihood of the
   two may or may not be the same.

   let us understand this through an interesting example.

   let   s say your football team is playing a series of 5 games against
   your opponent. who ever wins more games (out of 5) wins the title.

   let us say, your team might is more skilled and has 75% chances of
   winning. so, there is a 25% chance of losing it.

   what is the id203 of you winning the series? is it 75% or is it
   something else?

   let us find out. what are the possible scenarios in playing 5 games?

   wwwww, wwwwl, wwwll, wwlll, wllll, lllll, lwwww and so on   .

   so for the first game, there are two possibilities, you either win or
   lose, again for the second game we have two possibilities. assuming
   that the first game has no effect on the outcome of the second     no one
   gets tired, no one gets under pressure after losing etc.

   so let   s define our random variable x to be a number of wins in 5
   games. remember id203 of winning is 0.75 and losing is 0.25.
   assume that a tie doesn   t happen.

   x=number of wins in 5 games

   so the first game has 2 outcomes     win and lose, second again has 2 and
   so on.

   so total possibilities is 2*2*2*2*2 = 32
     * p (x=0) denotes the id203 that you lose all the games and
       there is only one way that can happen i.e. {lllll} =
       0.25*0.25*0.25*0.25*0.25 (multiplying the probabilities of losing
       the each time, lost first time and second time and third time and
       so on..)
     * p(x=1) denotes the id203 that you win only 1 game i.e.(wllll
       or lwlll or llwll or lllwl or llllw). so there are 5 cases where
       you win 1 game = 5*0.75*0.25*0.25*0.25*0.25=0.0146

   while we can count each of these possible outcomes, it becomes very
   exhaustive and intensive exercise. let us take help of combinatorics
   here. choose 2 wins out of 5 games = ^5c[2 ]()

   so, the id203 for getting k successes in n bernoulli trails is
   given by:

   p(x=k) = ^nc[k ]p^k q^n-k  ,  [here p is the id203 of success and
   q is the id203 of failure]

   let   s see how this comes.
     * p(x=2) denotes the id203 that you win 2 games. so there are
       ^5c[2]() = 10 cases where you win 2 games. hence id203 =
       10*0.75*0.75*0.25*0.25*0.25=0.088
     * p(x=3) denotes the id203 that you win 3 games. so, there are
       ^5c[3]() =10 cases where you win 3 games. hence id203 =
       10*0.75*0.75*0.75*0.25*0.25=0.264
     * similarly,  p(x=4) = 0.395
     * p(x=5) = 0.237

   what we just calculated were discrete probabilities for a binomial
   distribution. if we look at these probabilities we get something like:

   [prob2.png]

   as you can see the id203 of winning the series is much higher
   than 0.75.

   the general definition of a binomial distribution is the discrete
   id203 distribution of the number of success in a sequence of n
   independent bernoulli trials (having only yes/no or true/false
   outcomes).

   if the events are equally likely to occur i.e. p = q = 0.5, the
   id203 distribution looks something like the graph below. here the
   id203 of success and failure is the same.

   [prob3.png]

   what difference do we see in the two id203 distributions?  the
   first one is skewed towards right. reason being the likelihood to win
   is more, hence more wins are more likely than more losses.

   in the second case when wins and losses are equally likely, so the
   distribution is symmetrical.


   let   s assume that id203 of winning and losing is equal. p=q=0.5

   now, what if i increase my number of trials? what if i play 20 games of
   football with a id203 of winning and losing to be 50-50? there
   are a lot more possibilities and combinations. the bars get thinner and
   thinner.

   the bars get thinner and thinner.

   [prob4.png]

   what if i play an infinite number of times with equal id203 for
   winning and losing?

   the bars get infinitely small and the id203 distribution looks
   something like a continuous set of bars which are very close, almost
   continuous. this now becomes a id203 density function. notice
   that this now becomes a continuous function.

   [prob5.png]

   let   s point out some interesting things that happened.
     * the probabilities are high for the mean values of the random
       variables. when we were playing 5 football games, the random
       variable (x = the wins) could take values between 0     5. the mean
       value being 2.5. the id203 is highest for 2 and 3. when we
       move towards the continuous curve, the id203 is highest for
       the exact mean
     * the probabilities are low as we move away from the mean.


5. continuous random variables

   let   s see some cases where the random variables are continuous. let   s
   say the weatherman is trying to measure the amount of rainfall that
   will happen tomorrow.

   let   s say the rainfall likely to happen is around 2 cm. but will it be
   exactly 2 cm? it can be 2.001 or 2.000001 or 2.000000001 and an
   infinite number of values in between. it   s even impossible for us to
   measure if it   s exactly 2 cm.

   so, we calculate the id203 of it, being in a range. we calculate
   the id203 of rainfall being in the range of 2 cm to 2.01 cm. it
   will be the sum of probabilities for all values between 2 and 2.01. the
   area under the id203 density function with limits 2 and 2.01 will
   give us that.

   [prob6.png]

   the id203 density function may or may not be symmetrical.

life of an insect

   suppose there is an insect whose lifespan ranges from 0 to 16 days.
   we   re looking for the id203 that it will die in around 5 to 6
   days. again we would need the sum of probabilities for all values
   between 5 days and 6 days.

   we look at the id203 density function and find the area of the
   graph under the limits of 5 and 6. we can use definite integration
   under the desired limits for the id203 density to find the area.
   we   re often interested in the id203 of a range of values rather
   than the id203 of an exact value.

   [prob7.png]

   we can now imagine that the id203 at a particular point would be
   the area of the thinnest possible bar we can imagine. to calculate the
   id203 at x, we would need the area from x to x+  , where    is very
   very small.

   the total id203 density function would then be the collection of
   all such areas / probabilities.

   the formula of the id203 density function can be written as:

   [prob8.png]

   for a point x,    is the small value right after the point x.  we try to
   calculate the id203 from x to x+   , with limit if    tends to 0.


6. the central limit theorem

   so when you have huge amount of data, you can be confused how to make
   sense of it. it is difficult to know what   s happening underneath it. to
   tackle this problem, what we do is take a small chunk of data & look at
   it. but we won   t be satisfied with just a single chunk. we   d try to
   look at multiple chunks to be sure of results.

   let   s say we have the cholesterol levels of all the people in india, we
   can look at the mean, median and mode of the data.  maybe plot a
   histogram with sensible ranges and look at the data. let   s assume this
   is how the data looks like. the mean of this data is 153.2

   [prob9.png]

   but this huge amount of data is really tough to process. to process it,
   we take the data of some 50 people and calculate their mean.

   we again take a sample of some 50 people and calculate the mean and we
   keep doing that for quite a number of times. we now plot the means of
   these samples.
   [prob10.png]

   we see that these sample means form a frequency distribution which
   looks very symmetrical. the frequency around the mean of the actual
   data is the highest and gradually reduces as we move away from the mean
   on the either side.

   so when we take means of cholesterol levels of 50 people, again and
   again, we observe the mean values are around 150-160. only a few mean
   values is more than 170 and less than 140. there are very, very few
   over 190 or less than 110.

   we can easily convert the frequencies to see probabilities. if we
   divide the frequency of a bin (range like 110 to 120) by the total
   number of data points, we get the probabilities of each bin. so, now
   the frequency distribution becomes a id203 distribution of the
   same shape. the id203 distribution approaches more and more
   towards

   the id203 distribution approaches more and more towards symmetry,
   when the sample size that we use to create those means, is very large.
   as the sample size approaches infinity, the id203 distribution
   becomes a perfectly symmetrical where the center of the curve is the
   mean of the population. the curve is known as normal distribution.


what is a normal distribution?

   the normal distribution informally called as a bell curve looks like
   this:

   [prob11.png]

   the equation of the normal distribution happens to be:

   here    is the mean of the data while    is the standard deviation of the
   data.

   the normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical about the mean. the
   probabilities move similarly in both directions around the mean. the
   total area under the curve is 1, since summing up all the possible
   probabilities would give 1.

   the distribution might vary a bit depending upon how spread the data
   is. if the data has a very high range and standard deviation, the
   normally distributed curve would be spread out and flatter, since a
   large number of values would be sufficiently away from the mean.

   also, if a lot of values are away from the mean, the id203 for
   data being around the mean also drops. similarly, if the standard
   deviation is low, which means most of the values are near around the
   mean, there is high id203 of the sample mean being around the
   mean and the distribution is a lot skinnier. the higher the standard
   deviation, the thicker and flatter the curve.

   [prob12.png]

   let   s summarise the main points we saw:
     * area under a id203 density function gives the id203 for
       the random variable to be in that range.
     * if i have a population data and i take random samples of equal size
       from the data, the sample means are approximately normally
       distributed
     * there is large id203 for the means to be around the actual
       mean of the data, than to be farther away
     * normal distributions for higher standard deviations are flatter as
       compared to those for lower standard deviations


7. area under the normal distribution

   now, let   s say i have a dataset of cholesterol levels of a number of
   patients and we need to calculate the id203 of how many patients
   are healthy.

   the mean value (  ) for cholesterol of all the patients is equal to 150
   and standard deviation (  ) is equal to 15. the id203 density
   function is a normal distribution given by the above equation.

   we need to calculate the id203 of cholesterol levels to be
   between 135 (150-15) and 165 (150+15)     the healthy cholesterol range.

   can you see that the healthy patients that we are talking about are one
   standard deviation on either side of the mean? this means we need to
   calculate the area under the curve with 135 and 165 as limits. don   t
   worry, this area for normal distribution is already calculated for us
   and is ~68%.

   so always for a normally distributed data, around 68% of the data falls
   within 1 standard deviation of the mean. so id203 of the data
   being within 1 standard deviation if the mean = 0.68

   [prob13.png]

   let   s also calculate the id203 of being 2 standard deviations
   away from the mean. let   s say we need to warn the patients who are two
   standard deviations away.

   this means 150+30 and 150-30.

   the range of area to be calculated now is 120 to 180.

   to your surprise, 95% of the values fall in this range.

   [prob14.png]

   so the major chunk of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of
   the mean. so, we can safely say, that for the data to be more than 2
   standard deviations away from the mean is highly unlikely     only 5%
   likely.

   so, 95% of the patients have their cholesterol levels between 120 and
   180. and the remaining 5% are really critical and different from the
   average values.


8. z scores

   we will encounter a lot of cases, where we would need to know the
   id203 for the data to be less than or more than a particular
   value. this value will not be equal to 1   or 2   away from the mean.

   the distance in terms of number of standard deviations, the observed
   value is away from the mean, is the standard score or the z score.

   a positive z score indicates that the observed value is z standard
   deviations above the mean. negative z score indicates that the value is
   below the mean.

   observed value =   +z   [   is the mean and    is the standard deviation]

   in our cholesterol example, let   s see where 172 falls on the
   distribution. we will calculate the z score to find the percentage of
   people having cholesterol less than 172.

   172 = 150+z*15

   here, we see that 172 is 1.47 {(142-150)/15} standard deviations more
   than the mean. this 1.47 is known as the z value.

   now, we would need to use these limits to calculate the area under the
   curve. remember that the area under the curve is 1. let   s calculate the
   id203 of people having a cholesterol level of less than 172.

   to your happiness, you will never have to actually calculate the area
   under the normal curve, we have the [97]z table that can be used to
   calculate the probabilities for particular z values. the rows of the z
   table have the z score in tens, while the hundredths decimal is given
   by the columns. the value is the area under the curve less than that z
   score.

   [prob15.png]

   for a particular z score, we can look into the table to find the
   id203 for values to fall less than that particular z value. it
   can be    ve or +ve. if we look out for 1.47, we find that ~93% data
   falls less than that. therefore, 93% patients have cholesterol less
   than 172. also, we can safely say that 7% have cholesterol more than
   172.


9. challenges

   hope you found the guide simple and useful. i hope some one would have
   given this early in my career. here are a few challenges for you to
   try:

   challenge 1: contrary to the popular expectation, try calculating the
   id203 of getting 50 heads and 50 tails on 100 flips of fair
   coins? this expectation is known as the gambler   s fallacy! an
   approximate answer would suffice!

   challenge 2: try another one     in the united states, the average iq is
   100, with a standard deviation of 15. what percentage of the population
   would you expect to have an iq more than 120?

   post your answers in the comments section.


end notes

   i hope you liked reading the article. to summarize, there are numerous
   mathematical and everyday problems that are solved using id203
   and the properties of normal distribution. problems ranging from
   biology to industrial automation, id203 is ubiquitous     can   t
   live with it, can   t do without it.

       challenge 2 answer     9.18%
       approach:
       population mean=100, sd = 15. so z= (120-100)/15 = 1.33 . use the z
       table and z=1.33 corresponds to 0.9082 which is the area under the
       curvefrom -infinity to 120. but we need people with iq greater than
       120 , so 1-0.9082= 0.0918 ==>9.18%
       challenge 1 : however is little unclear for me.
       we can have 100h,99h1t,98h2t,      ..50h50t,49h,51t            1h99t,100t. so
       n=101.
       p(head)= 0.5, p(tail)=0.5
       event of 50h50t occurring is 1. so p(x=1)=101c1 x 0.5^1 x 0.5^100 =
       3.98*e-29

            for challenge 1, think of it as 100 bernoulli trials where
            id203 of getting heads is 0.5 and getting tails is also
            0.5. now you need 50 heads and 50 tails out of 100 trials. so
            select 50 success out of 100, and apply the probabilities. so
            the answer would be 100c50 (0.5)^50 (0.5)^50.
            so here p i.e. the id203 of getting heads is 0.5 and q
            i.e. the id203 of getting tails is 0.5. we need k
            success which is 50, out of n trials which is 100.

       fair coins? this expectation is known as the gambler   s fallacy! an

       solution 1 :
       binom.dist(number_success, trails, id203_success,cumulative)
       cumulative = false, since we are calculating point id203.
       number_success = 50 , no.of trails = 100, id203 of either
       head/tail on flipping a coin = 1/2 = 0.5,
       binom.dist(50,100,0.5,false)     using excel formula, we will get
       0.079 = 7.9%

       is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. what percentage of the
       population would you expect to have an iq more than 120?
       solution :
       normal distribution , since it is a measurement of iq and has range
       excel formula :    norm.dist(expected prob,mean,stdev,cumulative)    
       more than 120 means even to infinity. it wil be difficult to
       calculate till infinity. so,    >120    is equal to    <= 120'
       so , 1     norm(120,100,15,true) = 1     0.908 = 0.0918 = 9.18%

       could someone hep me to solve following two questions
       we repeatedly toss a biased coin with id203 0.6 of landing
       heads and id203 0.4 of landing tails, a group is maximal
       sequence of consecutive tosses that land on same side. for
       instance, the group of httththtt are (h)(ttt)(h)(t)(h)(tt)
       then what is the expected number of group after 10 tosses?
       what is the id203 of (strictly) exceeding 6 groups after 10
       tosses?
