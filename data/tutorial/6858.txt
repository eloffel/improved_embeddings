sling - a natural language frame semantics parser

   [99]build status

   the aim of the sling project is to learn to read and understand
   wikipedia articles in many languages for the purpose of knowledge base
   completion, e.g. adding facts mentioned in wikipedia (and other
   sources) to the [100]wikidata knowledge base. we use [101]frame
   semantics as a common representation for both id99
   and document annotation. the sling parser can be trained to produce
   frame semantic representations of text directly without any explicit
   intervening linguistic representation.

   the sling project is still work in progress. we do not yet have a full
   system that can extract facts from arbitrary text, but we have built a
   number of the subsystems needed for such a system. the sling frame
   store is our basic framework for building and manipulating frame
   semantic graph structures. the [102]wiki flow pipeline can take a raw
   dump of wikidata and [103]convert this into one big frame graph. this
   can be loaded into memory so we can do fast graph traversal for
   id136 and reasoning over the knowledge base. the wiki flow pipeline
   can also take raw wikipedia dumps and [104]convert these into a set of
   documents with structured annotations extracted from the wiki markup.
   this also produces [105]phrase tables that are used for mapping names
   to entities. there is a [106]sling python api for accessing all this
   information and we also have a [107]bot for uploading extracted facts
   to wikidata.

the sling parser

   the sling parser is used for annotating text with frame semantic
   annotations. it is a general transition-based frame semantic parser
   using bi-directional lstms for input encoding and a transition based
   recurrent unit (tbru) for output decoding. it is a jointly trained
   model using only the text tokens as input and the transition system has
   been designed to output frame graphs directly without any intervening
   symbolic representation.

   [108]sling neural network architecture.

   the sling framework includes an efficient and scalable [109]frame store
   implementation as well as a [110]neural network jit compiler for fast
   parsing at runtime.

   a more detailed description of the sling parser can be found in this
   paper:
     * michael ringgaard, rahul gupta, and fernando c. n. pereira. 2017.
       sling: a framework for frame id29.
