dilated recurrent neural networks

   tensorflow implementation of [75]dilated recurrent neural networks
   (dilatedid56).

                           [76][combined_did56.png]

   for more about dilatedid56, please see our nips [77]paper. if you find
   this work useful and use it on your own research, please cite our
   paper.

getting started

   the light weighted demo demonstrates how to construct a multi-layer
   dilatenid56 with different cells, hidden structures and dilations for
   the task of permuted sequence classification on mnist. although most of
   the code is straightforward, we would like to provide examples for
   different network constructions.

   below is an example that constructs a 9-layer dilatedid56 with vanilla
   id56 cells. the hidden dimension is 20. and the number of dilatation
   starts with 1 at the bottom layer and ends with 256 at the top layer.
cell_type = "id56"
hidden_structs = [20] * 9
dilations = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]

   the current version of the code supports three types of cell: "id56",
   "lstm", and "gru". of course, the code also supports the case where the
   dilation rate at the bottom layer is greater than 1 (as shown on the
   right hand side of figure 2 in our [78]paper).

   an example of constructing a 4-layer dilatedid56 with gru cells is shown
   below. the number of dilations starts at 4. it is worth mentioning
   that, the number of dilations does not necessarily need to increase
   with the power of 2. and the hidden dimensions for different layers do
   not need to be the same.
cell_type = "gru"
hidden_structs = [20, 30, 40, 50]
dilations = [4, 8, 16, 32]

   tested environment: tensorflow 1.3 and numpy 1.13.1.
