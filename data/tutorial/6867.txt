requirements

     * [128]pandas
     * [129]joblib
     * [130]sklearn
     * [131]numpy
     * [132]tensorflow

soft requirements

   deepchem has a number of "soft" requirements. these are packages which
   are needed for various submodules of deepchem but not for the package
   as a whole.
     * [133]rdkit
     * [134]six
     * [135]mdtraj

easy install via conda

conda install -c deepchem -c rdkit -c conda-forge -c omnia deepchem=2.1.0

   note: easy install installs the latest stable version of deepchem and
   does not install from source. if you need to install from source make
   sure you follow the steps [136]here.

using a docker image

   using a docker image requires an nvidia gpu. if you do not have a gpu
   please follow the directions for [137]using a conda environment in
   order to get gpu support you will have to use the [138]nvidia-docker
   plugin.
# this will the download the latest stable deepchem docker image into your image
s
docker pull deepchemio/deepchem

# this will create a container out of our latest image with gpu support
nvidia-docker run -i -t deepchemio/deepchem

# you are now in a docker container whose python has deepchem installed
# for example you can run our tox21 benchmark
cd deepchem/examples
python benchmark.py -d tox21

# or you can start playing with it in the command line
pip install jupyter
ipython
import deepchem as dc

installing from source in a conda environment

   you can install deepchem in a new conda environment using the conda
   commands in scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh installing via this
   script will ensure that you are installing from the source.
git clone https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem.git      # clone deepchem source
code from github
cd deepchem

   if you don't want gpu support:
bash scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh deepchem         # if you don't want gpu
support

   if you want gpu support:
gpu=1 bash scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh deepchem         # if you want gpu
support

   note : gpu=0 bash scripts/install_deepchem_conda.sh deepchem will also
   install cpu supported deepchem.
source activate deepchem
python setup.py install                                # manual install
nosetests -a '!slow' -v deepchem --nologcapture        # run tests

   this creates a new conda environment deepchem and installs in it the
   dependencies that are needed. to access it, use the conda activate
   deepchem command (if your conda version >= 4.4) and use source activate
   deepchem command (if your conda version < 4.4).

   check [139]this link for more information about the benefits and usage
   of conda environments. warning: segmentation faults can [140]still
   happen via this installation procedure.

faq and troubleshooting

    1. deepchem currently supports both python 2.7 and python 3.5, and is
       supported on 64 bit linux and mac osx. note that deepchem is not
       currently maintained for python 3.6 or with other operating
       systems.
    2. question: i'm seeing some failures in my test suite having to do
       with mkl intel mkl fatal error: cannot load libmkl_avx.so or
       libmkl_def.so.
       answer: this is a general issue with the newest version of
       scikit-learn enabling mkl by default. this doesn't play well with
       many linux systems. see [141]bvlc/caffe#3884 for discussions. the
       following seems to fix the issue
conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
conda remove mkl mkl-service
    3. note that when using ubuntu 16.04 server or similar environments,
       you may need to ensure libxrender is provided via e.g.:

sudo apt-get install -y libxrender-dev

getting started

   two good tutorials to get started are [142]id197
   and [143]multitask_networks_on_muv. follow along with the tutorials to
   see how to predict properties on molecules using neural networks.

   afterwards you can go through other [144]tutorials, and look through
   our examples in the examples directory. to apply deepchem to a new
   problem, try starting from one of the existing examples or tutorials
   and modifying it step by step to work with your new use-case. if you
   have questions or comments you can raise them on our [145]gitter.

benchmarks

   in depth benchrmarking tables for deepchem models are available on
   [146]moleculenet.ai

gitter

   join us on gitter at [147]https://gitter.im/deepchem/lobby. probably
   the easiest place to ask simple questions or float requests for new
   features.

about us

   deepchem is possible due to notable contributions from many people
   including peter eastman, evan feinberg, joe gomes, karl leswing, vijay
   pande, aneesh pappu, bharath ramsundar and michael wu (alphabetical
   ordering). deepchem was originally created by [148]bharath ramsundar
   with encouragement and guidance from [149]vijay pande.

   deepchem started as a [150]pande group project at stanford, and is now
   developed by many academic and industrial collaborators. deepchem
   actively encourages new academic and industrial groups to contribute!
