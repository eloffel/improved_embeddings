   ava  [1]dataset [2]explore [3]download [4]challenge [5]about

   ava is a project that provides audiovisual annotations of video for
   improving our understanding of human activity. the annotated videos are
   all 15 minute long movie clips. each of the clips has been exhaustively
   labeled by human annotators, and the use of movie clips in the dataset
   is expected to enable a richer variety of recording conditions and
   representations of human activity.

   we provide the following annotations.

ava actions dataset

   the ava dataset densely annotates 80 atomic visual actions in 430
   15-minute movie clips, where actions are localized in space and time,
   resulting in 1.62m action labels with multiple labels per human
   occurring frequently. a detailed description of our contributions with
   this dataset can be found in our accompanying [6]cvpr '18 paper.

   ava v2.2 is now available for [7]download. it is the basis of a
   [8]challenge in partnership with the [9]activitynet workshop at cvpr
   2019.

ava spoken activity datasets

   ava activespeaker: associates speaking activity with a visible face, on
   the ava v1.0 videos, resulting in 3.65 million frames labeled across
   ~39k face tracks. a detailed description of this dataset is in our
   [10]arxiv paper. the labels are [11]available for download here.

   ava speech densely annotates audio-based speech activity in ava v1.0
   videos, and explicitly labels 3 background noise conditions, resulting
   in ~46k labeled segments spanning 45 hours of data. a detailed
   description of this dataset is in our [12]interspeech '18 paper. the
   labels are [13]available for download here.
