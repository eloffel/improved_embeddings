deepmind and blizzard open starcraft ii as an ai research environment

   deepmind's scientific mission is to push the boundaries of ai by
   developing systems that can learn to solve complex problems. to do
   this, we design agents and test their ability in a wide range of
   environments from the purpose-built [35]deepmind lab to established
   games, such as [36]atari and [37]go.

   testing our agents in games that are not specifically designed for ai
   research, and where humans play well, is crucial to benchmark agent
   performance. that is why we, along with our [38]partner blizzard
   entertainment, are excited to announce the release of sc2le, a set of
   tools that we hope will accelerate ai research in the real-time
   strategy game starcraft ii. the sc2le release includes:
     * a [39]machine learning api developed by blizzard that gives
       researchers and developers hooks into the game. this includes the
       release of tools for linux for the first time.

     * a [40]dataset of anonymised game replays, which will increase from
       65k to more than half a million in the coming weeks.

     * an open source version of deepmind   s toolset, [41]pysc2, to allow
       researchers to easily use blizzard   s feature-layer api with their
       agents.

     * a series of simple rl mini-games to allow researchers to test the
       performance of agents on specific tasks.

     * a [42]joint paper that outlines the environment, and reports
       initial baseline results on the mini-games, supervised learning
       from replays, and the full 1v1 ladder game against the built-in ai.

   [001_social_dsp_960x480.width-400_e6biqnd.png]
   starcraft ii is a science-fiction based real-time strategy game,
   released in 2010

   starcraft and starcraft ii are among the biggest and most successful
   games of all time, with players competing in tournaments for more than
   20 years. the original game is also already used by ai and ml
   researchers, who compete annually in the [43]aiide bot competition.
   part of starcraft   s longevity is down to the rich, multi-layered
   gameplay, which also makes it an ideal environment for ai research.

   for example, while the objective of the game is to beat the opponent,
   the player must also carry out and balance a number of sub-goals, such
   as gathering resources or building structures. in addition, a game can
   take from a few minutes to one hour to complete, meaning actions taken
   early in the game may not pay-off for a long time. finally, the map is
   only partially observed, meaning agents must use a combination of
   memory and planning to succeed.

   the game also has other qualities that appeal to researchers, such as
   the large pool of avid players that compete online every day.  this
   ensures that there is a large quantity of replay data to learn from -
   as well as a large quantity of extremely talented opponents for ai
   agents.

   even starcraft   s action space presents a challenge with a choice of
   more than 300 basic actions that can be taken. contrast this with atari
   games, which only have about 10 (e.g. up, down, left, right etc). on
   top of this, actions in starcraft are hierarchical, can be modified and
   augmented, with many of them requiring a point on the screen. even
   assuming a small screen size of 84x84 there are roughly 100 million
   possible actions available.

   actions available to both humans and agents depend on the units
   selected

   this release means researchers can now tackle some of these challenges
   using blizzard   s own tools to build their own tasks and models.

   our [44]pysc2 environment wrapper helps by offering a flexible and
   easy-to-use interface for rl agents to play the game. in this initial
   release, we break the game down into    feature layers   , where elements
   of the game such as unit type, health and map visibility are isolated
   from each other, whilst preserving the core visual and spatial elements
   of the game.

   the release also contains a series of    mini-games    - an established
   technique for breaking down the game into manageable chunks that can be
   used to test agents on [45]specific [46]tasks, such as moving the
   camera, [47]collecting mineral shards or selecting units.  we hope that
   researchers can test their techniques on these as well as propose new
   mini-games for other researchers to compete and evaluate on.

   mini-games
   simple rl mini-games will allow researchers to test the performance of
   agents on specific tasks

   our initial investigations show that our agents perform well on these
   mini-games. but when it comes to the full game, even strong baseline
   agents, such as [48]a3c, cannot win a single game against even the
   easiest built-in ai. for instance, the following video shows an
   early-stage training agent (left) which fails to keep its workers
   mining, a task that humans find trivial. after training (right), the
   agents perform more meaningful actions, but if they are to be
   competitive, we will need further breakthroughs in deep rl and related
   areas.

   [trained_agent_grab.width-320_kaq9ltm.png]

   one technique that we know allows our agents to learn stronger policies
   is imitation learning. this kind of training will soon be far easier
   thanks to blizzard, which has committed to ongoing releases of hundreds
   of thousands of anonymised replays gathered from the starcraft ii
   ladder. these will not only allow researchers to train supervised
   agents to play the game, but also opens up other interesting areas of
   research such as sequence prediction and long-term memory.

   our hope is that the release of these new tools will build on the work
   that the ai community has already done in starcraft, encouraging more
   deeprl research and making it easier for researchers to focus on the
   frontiers of our field.

   we look forward to seeing what the community discovers.
