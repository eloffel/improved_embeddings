   [14]artificial intelligence (ai) and [15]machine learning (ml) are some
   of the hottest topics right now.

   the term    ai    is thrown around casually every day. you hear aspiring
   developers saying they want to learn ai. you also hear executives
   saying they want to implement ai in their services. but quite often,
   many of these people don   t understand what ai is.

   once you   ve read this article, you will understand the basics of ai and
   ml. more importantly, you will understand how [16]deep learning, the
   most popular type of ml, works.

   this guide is intended for everyone, so no advanced mathematics will be
   involved.

background

   the first step towards understanding how deep learning works is to
   grasp the differences between important terms.

artificial intelligence vs machine learning

     artificial intelligence is the replication of human intelligence in
     computers.

   when ai research first started, researchers were trying to replicate
   human intelligence for specific tasks         like playing a game.

   they introduced a vast number of rules that the computer needed to
   respect. the computer had a specific list of possible actions, and made
   decisions [17]based on those rules.

     machine learning refers to the ability of a machine to learn using
     large data sets instead of hard coded rules.

   ml allows computers to learn by themselves. this type of learning takes
   advantage of the processing power of modern computers, which can easily
   process large data sets.

supervised learning vs unsupervised learning

     [18]supervised learning involves using labelled data sets that have
     inputs and expected outputs.

   when you train an ai using supervised learning, you give it an input
   and tell it the expected output.

   if the output generated by the ai is wrong, it will readjust its
   calculations. this process is done iteratively over the data set, until
   the ai makes no more mistakes.

   an example of supervised learning is a weather-predicting ai. it learns
   to predict weather using historical data. that training data has inputs
   (pressure, humidity, wind speed) and outputs (temperature).

     [19]unsupervised learning is the task of machine learning using data
     sets with no specified structure.

   when you train an ai using unsupervised learning, you let the ai make
   logical classifications of the data.

   an example of unsupervised learning is a behavior-predicting ai for an
   e-commerce website. it won   t learn by using a labelled data set of
   inputs and outputs.

   instead, it will create its own classification of the input data. it
   will tell you which kind of users are most likely to buy different
   products.

now, how does deep learning work?

   you   re now prepared to understand what deep learning is, and how it
   works.

   deep learning is a machine learning method. it allows us to train an ai
   to predict outputs, given a set of inputs. both supervised and
   unsupervised learning can be used to train the ai.

   we will learn how deep learning works by building an hypothetical
   airplane ticket price estimation service. we will train it using a
   supervised learning method.

   we want our airplane ticket price estimator to predict the price using
   the following inputs (we are excluding return tickets for simplicity):
     * origin airport
     * destination airport
     * departure date
     * airline

neural networks

   let   s look inside the brain of our ai.

   like animals, our estimator ai   s brain has neurons. they are
   represented by circles. these neurons are inter-connected.
   [1*laegau-vdsr_pclmcgbikq.jpeg]

   the neurons are grouped into three different types of layers:
    1. input layer
    2. hidden layer(s)
    3. output layer

   the input layer receives input data. in our case, we have four neurons
   in the input layer: origin airport, destination airport, departure
   date, and airline. the input layer passes the inputs to the first
   hidden layer.

   the hidden layers perform mathematical computations on our inputs. one
   of the challenges in creating neural networks is deciding the number of
   hidden layers, as well as the number of neurons for each layer.

   the    deep    in deep learning refers to having more than one hidden
   layer.

   the output layer returns the output data. in our case, it gives us the
   price prediction.
   [1*6pjho0kpciy_f5xbghnzsq.png]

   so how does it compute the price prediction?

   this is where the magic of deep learning begins.

   each connection between neurons is associated with a weight. this
   weight dictates the importance of the input value. the initial weights
   are set randomly.

   when predicting the price of an airplane ticket, the departure date is
   one of the heavier factors. hence, the departure date neuron
   connections will have a big weight.

   each neuron has an [22]activation function. these functions are hard to
   understand without mathematical reasoning.

   simply put, one of its purposes is to    standardize    the output from the
   neuron.

   once a set of input data has passed through all the layers of the
   neural network, it returns the output data through the output layer.

   nothing complicated, right?

training the neural network

   training the ai is the hardest part of deep learning. why?
    1. you need a large data set.
    2. you need a large amount of computational power.

   for our airplane ticket price estimator, we need to find historical
   data of ticket prices. and due to the large amount of possible airports
   and departure date combinations, we need a very large list of ticket
   prices.

   to train the ai, we need to give it the inputs from our data set, and
   compare its outputs with the outputs from the data set. since the ai is
   still untrained, its outputs will be wrong.

   once we go through the whole data set, we can create a function that
   shows us how wrong the ai   s outputs were from the real outputs. this
   function is called the [23]cost function.

   ideally, we want our cost function to be zero. that   s when our ai   s
   outputs are the same as the data set outputs.

how can we reduce the cost function?

   we change the weights between neurons. we could randomly change them
   until our cost function is low, but that   s not very efficient.

   instead, we will use a technique called [24]id119.

   id119 is a technique that allows us to find the minimum of a
   function. in our case, we are looking for the minimum of the cost
   function.

   it works by changing the weights in small increments after each data
   set iteration. by computing the derivative (or gradient) of the cost
   function at a certain set of weight, we   re able to see in which
   direction the minimum is.

   to minimize the cost function, you need to iterate through your data
   set many times. this is why you need a large amount of computational
   power.

   updating the weights using id119 is done automatically.
   that   s the magic of deep learning!

   once we   ve trained our airplane ticket price estimator ai, we can use
   it to predict future prices.

where can i learn more?

   there are many other types of neural networks: [26]convolutional neural
   networks for [27]id161 and [28]recurrent neural networks for
   [29]natural language processing.

   if you want to learn the technical aspect of deep learning, i suggest
   taking an online course.

   currently, one of the best courses for deep learning is [30]andrew ng   s
   [31]deep learning specialization. if you   re not interested in getting a
   certificate, you don   t need to pay for the course. you can audit it for
   free instead.

   if you have any questions, or want more technical explanations of the
   concepts, please ask below!

in summary   

     * deep learning uses a neural network to imitate animal intelligence.
     * there are three types of layers of neurons in a neural network: the
       input layer, the hidden layer(s), and the output layer.
     * connections between neurons are associated with a weight, dictating
       the importance of the input value.
     * neurons apply an activation function on the data to    standardize   
       the output coming out of the neuron.
     * to train a neural network, you need a large data set.
     * iterating through the data set and comparing the outputs will
       produce a cost function, indicating how much the ai is off from the
       real outputs.
     * after every iteration through the data set, the weights between
       neurons are adjusted using id119 to reduce the cost
       function.
