how ai detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning

   by [57]paul voosenjul. 6, 2017 , 2:00 pm

   jason yosinski sits in a small glass box at uber   s san francisco,
   california, headquarters, pondering the mind of an artificial
   intelligence. an uber research scientist, yosinski is performing a kind
   of brain surgery on the ai running on his laptop. like many of the ais
   that will soon be powering so much of modern life, including
   self-driving uber cars, yosinski   s program is a deep neural network,
   with an architecture loosely inspired by the brain. and like the brain,
   the program is hard to understand from the outside: it   s a black box.

   this particular ai has been trained, using a vast sum of labeled
   images, to recognize objects as random as zebras, fire trucks, and seat
   belts. could it recognize yosinski and the reporter hovering in front
   of the webcam? yosinski zooms in on one of the ai   s individual
   computational nodes   the neurons, so to speak   to see what is prompting
   its response. two ghostly white ovals pop up and float on the screen.
   this neuron, it seems, has learned to detect the outlines of faces.
      this responds to your face and my face,    he says.    it responds to
   different size faces, different color faces.   

   no one trained this network to identify faces. humans weren   t labeled
   in its training images. yet learn faces it did, perhaps as a way to
   recognize the things that tend to accompany them, such as ties and
   cowboy hats. the network is too complex for humans to comprehend its
   exact decisions. yosinski   s probe had illuminated one small part of it,
   but overall, it remained opaque.    we build amazing models,    he says.
      but we don   t quite understand them. and every year, this gap is going
   to get a bit larger.   

   each month, it seems, deep neural networks, or deep learning, as the
   field is also called, [58]spread to another scientific discipline. they
   can predict the best way to synthesize organic molecules. they can
   detect genes related to autism risk. they are even changing how science
   itself is conducted. the ais often succeed in what they do. but they
   have left scientists, whose very enterprise is founded on explanation,
   with a nagging question: why, model, why?

   that interpretability problem, as it   s known, is galvanizing a new
   generation of researchers in both industry and academia. just as the
   microscope revealed the cell, these researchers are crafting tools that
   will allow insight into the how neural networks make decisions. some
   tools probe the ai without penetrating it; some are alternative
   algorithms that can compete with neural nets, but with more
   transparency; and some use still more deep learning to get inside the
   black box. taken together, they add up to a new discipline. yosinski
   calls it    ai neuroscience.   

opening up the black box

   loosely modeled after the brain, deep neural networks are spurring
   innovation across science. but the mechanics of the models are
   mysterious: they are black boxes. scientists are now developing tools
   to get inside the mind of the machine.
   [gg_aionline_3.png?itok=lsyewy7h]
   graphic: g. grull  n/science

   marco ribeiro, a graduate student at the university of washington in
   seattle, strives to understand the black box by using a class of ai
   neuroscience tools called counter-factual probes. the idea is to vary
   the inputs to the ai   be they text, images, or anything else   in clever
   ways to see which changes affect the output, and how. take a neural
   network that, for example, ingests the words of movie reviews and flags
   those that are positive. ribeiro   s program, called local interpretable
   model-agnostic explanations (lime), would take a review flagged as
   positive and create subtle variations by deleting or replacing words.
   those variants would then be run through the black box to see whether
   it still considered them to be positive. on the basis of thousands of
   tests, lime can identify the words   or parts of an image or molecular
   structure, or any other kind of data   most important in the ai   s
   original judgment. the tests might reveal that the word    horrible    was
   vital to a panning or that    daniel day lewis    led to a positive review.
   but although lime can diagnose those singular examples, that result
   says little about the network   s overall insight.

   new counterfactual methods like lime seem to emerge each month. but
   mukund sundararajan, another computer scientist at google, devised a
   probe that doesn   t require testing the network a thousand times over: a
   boon if you   re trying to understand many decisions, not just a few.
   instead of varying the input randomly, sundararajan and his team
   introduce a blank reference   a black image or a zeroed-out array in
   place of text   and transition it step-by-step toward the example being
   tested. running each step through the network, they watch the jumps it
   makes in certainty, and from that trajectory they infer features
   important to a prediction.

   sundararajan compares the process to picking out the key features that
   identify the glass-walled space he is sitting in   outfitted with the
   standard medley of mugs, tables, chairs, and computers   as a google
   conference room.    i can give a zillion reasons.    but say you slowly dim
   the lights.    when the lights become very dim, only the biggest reasons
   stand out.    those transitions from a blank reference allow sundararajan
   to capture more of the network   s decisions than ribeiro   s variations
   do. but deeper, unanswered questions are always there, sundararajan
   says   a state of mind familiar to him as a parent.    i have a 4-year-old
   who continually reminds me of the infinite regress of    why?      

   the urgency comes not just from science. according to a directive from
   the european union, companies deploying algorithms that substantially
   influence the public must by next year create    explanations    for their
   models    internal logic. the defense advanced research projects agency,
   the u.s. military   s blue-sky research arm, is pouring $70 million into
   a new program, called explainable ai, for interpreting the deep
   learning that powers drones and intelligence-mining operations. the
   drive to open the black box of ai is also coming from silicon valley
   itself, says maya gupta, a machine-learning researcher at google in
   mountain view, california. when she joined google in 2012 and asked ai
   engineers about their problems, accuracy wasn   t the only thing on their
   minds, she says.    i   m not sure what it   s doing,    they told her.    i   m
   not sure i can trust it.   

   rich caruana, a computer scientist at microsoft research in redmond,
   washington, knows that lack of trust firsthand. as a graduate student
   in the 1990s at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh, pennsylvania,
   he joined a team trying to see whether machine learning could guide the
   treatment of pneumonia patients. in general, sending the hale and
   hearty home is best, so they can avoid picking up other infections in
   the hospital. but some patients, especially those with complicating
   factors such as asthma, should be admitted immediately. caruana applied
   a neural network to a data set of symptoms and outcomes provided by 78
   hospitals. it seemed to work well. but disturbingly, he saw that a
   simpler, transparent model trained on the same records suggested
   sending asthmatic patients home, indicating some flaw in the data. and
   he had no easy way of knowing whether his neural net had picked up the
   same bad lesson.    fear of a neural net is completely justified,    he
   says.    what really terrifies me is what else did the neural net learn
   that   s equally wrong?   

   today   s neural nets are far more powerful than those caruana used as a
   graduate student, but their essence is the same. at one end sits a
   messy soup of data   say, millions of pictures of dogs. those data are
   sucked into a network with a dozen or more computational layers, in
   which neuron-like connections    fire    in response to features of the
   input data. each layer reacts to progressively more abstract features,
   allowing the final layer to distinguish, say, terrier from dachshund.

   at first the system will botch the job. but each result is compared
   with labeled pictures of dogs. in a process called id26, the
   outcome is sent backward through the network, enabling it to reweight
   the triggers for each neuron. the process repeats millions of times
   until the network learns   somehow   to make fine distinctions among
   breeds.    using modern horsepower and chutzpah, you can get these things
   to really sing,    caruana says. yet that mysterious and flexible power
   is precisely what makes them black boxes.

[62]ai is changing how we do science. get a glimpse

   gupta has a different tactic for coping with black boxes: she avoids
   them. several years ago gupta, who moonlights as a designer of
   intricate physical puzzles, began a project called glassbox. her goal
   is to tame neural networks by engineering predictability into them. her
   guiding principle is monotonicity   a relationship between variables in
   which, all else being equal, increasing one variable directly increases
   another, as with the square footage of a house and its price.

   gupta embeds those monotonic relationships in sprawling databases
   called interpolated lookup tables. in essence, they   re like the tables
   in the back of a high school trigonometry textbook where you   d look up
   the sine of 0.5. but rather than dozens of entries across one
   dimension, her tables have millions across multiple dimensions. she
   wires those tables into neural networks, effectively adding an extra,
   predictable layer of computation   baked-in knowledge that she says will
   ultimately make the network more controllable.

   caruana, meanwhile, has kept his pneumonia lesson in mind. to develop a
   model that would match deep learning in accuracy but avoid its opacity,
   he turned to a community that hasn   t always gotten along with machine
   learning and its loosey-goosey ways: statisticians.

   in the 1980s, statisticians pioneered a technique called a generalized
   additive model (gam). it built on id75, a way to find a
   linear trend in a set of data. but gams can also handle trickier
   relationships by finding multiple operations that together can massage
   data to fit on a regression line: squaring a set of numbers while
   taking the logarithm for another group of variables, for example.
   caruana has supercharged the process, using machine learning to
   discover those operations   which can then be used as a powerful
   pattern-detecting model.    to our great surprise, on many problems, this
   is very accurate,    he says. and crucially, each operation   s influence
   on the underlying data is transparent.

   caruana   s gams are not as good as ais at handling certain types of
   messy data, such as images or sounds, on which some neural nets thrive.
   but for any data that would fit in the rows and columns of a
   spreadsheet, such as hospital records, the model can work well. for
   example, caruana returned to his original pneumonia records.
   reanalyzing them with one of his gams, he could see why the ai would
   have learned the wrong lesson from the admission data. hospitals
   routinely put asthmatics with pneumonia in intensive care, improving
   their outcomes. seeing only their rapid improvement, the ai would have
   recommended the patients be sent home. (it would have made the same
   optimistic error for pneumonia patients who also had chest pain and
   heart disease.)

   caruana has started touting the gam approach to california hospitals,
   including children   s hospital los angeles, where about a dozen doctors
   reviewed his model   s results. they spent much of that meeting
   discussing what it told them about pneumonia admissions, immediately
   understanding its decisions.    you don   t know much about health care,   
   one doctor said,    but your model really does.   

   sometimes, you have to embrace the darkness. that's the theory of
   researchers pursuing a third route toward interpretability. instead of
   probing neural nets, or avoiding them, they say, the way to explain
   deep learning is simply to do more deep learning.

     if we can't ask     why they do something and get a reasonable
     response back, people will just put it back on the shelf.

     mark riedl, georgia institute of technology

   like many ai coders, mark riedl, director of the entertainment
   intelligence lab at the georgia institute of technology in atlanta,
   turns to 1980s video games to test his creations. one of his favorites
   is frogger, in which the player navigates the eponymous amphibian
   through lanes of car traffic to an awaiting pond. training a neural
   network to play expert frogger is easy enough, but explaining what the
   ai is doing is even harder than usual.

   instead of probing that network, riedl asked human subjects to play the
   game and to describe their tactics aloud in real time. riedl recorded
   those comments alongside the frog   s context in the game   s code:    oh,
   there   s a car coming for me; i need to jump forward.    armed with those
   two languages   the players    and the code   riedl trained a second neural
   net to translate between the two, from code to english. he then wired
   that translation network into his original game-playing network,
   producing an overall ai that would say, as it waited in a lane,    i   m
   waiting for a hole to open up before i move.    the ai could even sound
   frustrated when pinned on the side of the screen, cursing and
   complaining,    jeez, this is hard.   

   riedl calls his approach    rationalization,    which he designed to help
   everyday users understand the robots that will soon be helping around
   the house and driving our cars.    if we can   t ask a question about why
   they do something and get a reasonable response back, people will just
   put it back on the shelf,    riedl says. but those explanations, however
   soothing, prompt another question, he adds:    how wrong can the
   rationalizations be before people lose trust?   

   back at uber, yosinski has been kicked out of his glass box. uber   s
   meeting rooms, named after cities, are in high demand, and there is no
   surge pricing to thin the crowd. he   s out of doha and off to find
   montreal, canada, unconscious pattern recognition processes guiding him
   through the office maze   until he gets lost. his image classifier also
   remains a maze, and, like riedl, he has enlisted a second ai to help
   him understand the first one.
   [vol-700-2.jpg?itok=gryrstye]

   researchers have created neural networks that, in addition to filling
   gaps left in photos, can identify flaws in an artificial intelligence.

   first, yosinski rejiggered the classifier to produce images instead of
   labeling them. then, he and his colleagues fed it colored static and
   sent a signal back through it to request, for example,    more volcano.   
   eventually, they assumed, the network would shape that noise into its
   idea of a volcano. and to an extent, it did: that volcano, to human
   eyes, just happened to look like a gray, featureless mass. the ai and
   people saw differently.

   next, the team unleashed a generative adversarial network (gan) on its
   images. such ais contain two neural networks. from a training set of
   images, the    generator    learns rules about imagemaking and can create
   synthetic images. a second    adversary    network tries to detect whether
   the resulting pictures are real or fake, prompting the generator to try
   again. that back-and-forth eventually results in crude images that
   contain features that humans can recognize.

   yosinski and anh nguyen, his former intern, connected the gan to layers
   inside their original classifier network. this time, when told to
   create    more volcano,    the gan took the gray mush that the classifier
   learned and, with its own knowledge of picture structure, decoded it
   into a vast array of synthetic, realistic-looking volcanoes. some
   dormant. some erupting. some at night. some by day. and some, perhaps,
   with flaws   which would be clues to the classifier   s knowledge gaps.

   their gan can now be lashed to any network that uses images. yosinski
   has already used it to identify problems in a network trained to write
   captions for random images. he reversed the network so that it can
   create synthetic images for any random caption input. after connecting
   it to the gan, he found a startling omission. prompted to imagine    a
   bird sitting on a branch,    the network   using instructions translated by
   the gan   generated a bucolic facsimile of a tree and branch, but with no
   bird. why? after feeding altered images into the original caption
   model, he realized that the caption writers who trained it never
   described trees and a branch without involving a bird. the ai had
   learned the wrong lessons about what makes a bird.    this hints at what
   will be an important direction in ai neuroscience,    yosinski says. it
   was a start, a bit of a blank map shaded in.

   the day was winding down, but yosinski   s work seemed to be just
   beginning. another knock on the door. yosinski and his ai were kicked
   out of another glass box conference room, back into uber   s maze of
   cities, computers, and humans. he didn   t get lost this time. he wove
   his way past the food bar, around the plush couches, and through the
   exit to the elevators. it was an easy pattern. he   d learn them all
   soon.
