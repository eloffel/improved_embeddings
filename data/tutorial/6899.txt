[29]recurrent vs id56s: which is better for nlp?

   $\begingroup$

   there are recurrent neural networks and id56s. both
   are usually denoted by the same acronym: id56. according to
   [31]wikipedia, recurrent nn are in fact recursive nn, but i don't
   really understand the explanation.

   moreover, i don't seem to find which is better (with examples or so)
   for natural language processing. the fact is that, although socher uses
   recursive nn for nlp in his [32]tutorial, i can't find a good
   implementation of id56s, and when i search in
   google, most of the answers are about recurrent nn.

   besides that, is there another dnn which applies better for nlp, or it
   depends on the nlp task? deep belief nets or stacked autoencoders? (i
   don't seem to find any particular util for convnets in nlp, and most of
   the implementations are with machine vision in mind).

   finally, i would really prefer dnn implementations for c++ (better yet
   if it has gpu support) or scala (better if it has spark support) rather
   than python or matlab/octave.

   i've tried deeplearning4j, but it's under constant development and the
   documentation is a little outdated and i can't seem to make it work.
   too bad because it has the "black box" like way of doing things, very
   much like scikit-learn or weka, which is what i really want.

   recurrent neural networks are recurring over time. for example if you
   have a sequence

   x = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l']

   this sequence is fed to a single neuron which has a single connection
   to itself.

   at time step 0, the letter 'h' is given as input.at time step 1, 'e' is
   given as input. the network when unfolded over time will look like
   this.

   id56

   a recursive network is just a generalization of a recurrent network. in
   a recurrent network the weights are shared (and dimensionality remains
   constant) along the length of the sequence because how would you deal
   with position-dependent weights when you encounter a sequence at
   test-time of different length to any you saw at train-time. in a
   recursive network the weights are shared (and dimensionality remains
   constant) at every node for the same reason.

   this means that all the w_xh weights will be equal(shared) and so will
   be the w_hh weight. this is simply because it is a single neuron which
   has been unfolded in time.

   this is what a id56 looks like. recursive neural
   network

   it is quite simple to see why it is called a id56.
   each parent node's children are simply a node similar to that node.

   the neural network you want to use depends on your usage. in
   [45]karpathy's blog, he is generating characters one at a time so a
   recurrent neural network is good.

   but if you want to generate a parse tree, then using a recursive neural
   network is better because it helps to create better hierarchical
   representations.

   if you want to do deep learning in c++, then use cuda. it has a nice
   user-base, and is fast. i do not know more about that so cannot comment
   more.

   in python, theano is the best option because it provides automatic
   differentiation, which means that when you are forming big, awkward
   nns, you don't have to find gradients by hand. theano does it
   automatically for you. this feature is lacked by torch7.

   theano is very fast as it provides c wrappers to python code and can be
   implemented on gpus. it also has an awesome user base, which is very
   important while learning something new.

   $\begingroup$

   large recurrent neural networks are considered maybe the most powerful
   model for nlp. a great article written by a. karpathy on recurrent
   neural networks and character level modeling is available at
   [49]http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/id56-effectiveness/

   having tried a large number of libraries for deep learning (theano,
   caffe etc.). i would strongly suggest the use torch7 which is
   considered the state-of-the-art tool for nns and it supported by nyu,
   facebook ai and google deepmind. torch7 is based on lua and there are
   so many examples that you can easily familiarize with. a lot of code
   can be found on github, a good start would be
   [50]https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm.

   finally, the beauty of lua is that luajit can be injected very easily
   in java, python, matlab etc.
