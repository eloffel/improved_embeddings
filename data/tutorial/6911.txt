chihuahua or muffin? my search for the best id161 api

   this popular internet meme demonstrates the alarming resemblance shared
   between chihuahuas and muffins. these images are commonly shared in
   presentations in the artificial intelligence (ai) industry (myself
   included).

   but one question i haven   t seen anyone answer is just how good is
   modern ai at removing the uncertainty of an image that could resemble a
   chihuahua or a muffin? for your entertainment and education, i   ll be
   investigating this question today.
   [1*svedxiwftr5_1x2ct5thva.jpeg]

   binary classification has been possible since the [13]id88
   algorithm was invented in 1957. if you think ai is hyped now, the new
   york times reported in 1958 that the invention was the beginning of a
   computer that would    be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce
   itself and be conscious of its existence.    while id88 machines,
   like the [14]mark 1, were designed for image recognition, in reality
   they can only discern patterns that are linearly separable. this
   prevents them from learning the complex patterns found in most visual
   media.

   no wonder the world was disillusioned and an [15]ai winter ensued.
   since then, [16]multi-layer perceptions (popular in the 1980s) and
   [17]convolutional neural networks (pioneered by [18]yann lecun in 1998)
   have greatly outperformed [19]single-layer perceptions in image
   recognition tasks.

   with large labelled data sets like [20]id163 and powerful [21]gpu
   computing, more advanced neural network architectures like [22]alexnet,
   [23]vgg, [24]inception, and [25]resnet have achieved state-of-the-art
   performance in id161.

id161 and image recognition apis

   if you   re a machine learning engineer, it   s easy to experiment with and
   fine-tune these models by using pre-trained models and weights in
   either [26]keras/tensorflow or [27]pytorch. if you   re not comfortable
   tweaking neural networks on your own, you   re in luck. virtually all the
   leading technology giants and promising startups claim to    democratize
   ai    by offering easy-to-use id161 apis.

   which one is the best? to answer this question, you   d have to clearly
   define your business goals, product use cases, test data sets, and
   metrics of success before you can compare the solutions against each
   other.

   in lieu of a serious inquiry, we can at least get a high-level sense of
   the different behaviors of each platform by testing them with our toy
   problem of differentiating a chihuahua from a muffin.

conducting the test

   to do this, i split the canonical meme into 16 test images. then i use
   [28]open source code written by engineer [29]gaurav oberoi to
   consolidate results from the different apis. each image is pushed
   through the six apis listed above, which return high confidence labels
   as their predictions. the exceptions are microsoft, which returns both
   labels and a caption, and [30]cloudsight, which uses human-ai hybrid
   technology to return only a single caption. this is why cloudsight can
   return eerily accurate captions for complex images, but takes 10   20
   times longer to process.

   below is an example of the output. to see the results of all 16
   chihuahua versus muffin images, [31]click here.

   how well did the apis do? other than [32]microsoft, which confused this
   muffin for a stuffed animal, every other api recognized that the image
   was food. but there wasn   t an agreement about whether the food was
   bread, cake, cookies, or muffins. google was the only api to
   successfully identify muffin as the label that is most probable.

   let   s look at a chihuahua example.
   [1*ysw4o__m5exzzcccx-nevw.jpeg]

   again, the apis did rather well. all of them realized that the image is
   a dog, although a few of them missed the exact breed.

   there were definite failures, though. microsoft returned a blatantly
   wrong caption three separate times, describing the muffin as either a
   stuffed animal or a teddy bear.
   [1*rddnfns0to8pzjqfqrjphw.jpeg]

   google was the ultimate muffin identifier, returning    muffin    as its
   highest confidence label for 6 out of the 7 muffin images in the test
   set. the other apis did not return    muffin    as the first label for any
   muffin picture, but instead returned less relevant labels like    bread   ,
      cookie   , or    cupcake.   

   however, despite its string of successes, google did fail on this
   specific muffin image, returning    snout    and    dog breed group    as
   predictions.
   [1*cwsxk4jgzl7ii7apa_3u4g.jpeg]

   even the world   s most advanced machine learning platforms are tripped
   up by our facetious chihuahua versus muffin challenge. a human toddler
   beats deep learning when it comes to figuring out what   s food and
   what   s fido.

so which id161 api is the best?
