mateplus

   this repository contains code for an extended version of the
   [71]mate-tools semantic role labeler. most extensions are described in
   [72]roth and woodsend, 2014. unpublished extensions include feature
   selection routines and some currently undescribed additional
   functionalities.

   june 2015: the current version achieves state-of-the-art performance on
   the conll-2009 data set. with f1-scores of 87.33 in-domain and 76.38
   out-of-domain, it is the best performing system for srl in english to
   date. with an in-domain f1-score of 81.38, it is also the best srl
   system available for german. a demo is available online [73]here.

   september 2015: this repository now also includes code for our
   frame-semantic srl model introduced in [74]roth and lapata, 2015. this
   model achieves a state-of-the-art f1-score of 76.88 on identifying and
   labeling arguments in framenet 1.5 full texts (using gold frames).
   installation instructions are provided below. if you want to try out
   the frame-semantic srl model online, please use the demo [75]here.

dependencies

   the following libraries and model files need to be downloaded in order
   to run mateplus on english text:
     * bernd bohnet's dependency parser and model files ([76]anna-3.3.jar
       and conll2009-st-english*.model)^1
     * the wsj tokenizer from stanford corenlp
       ([77]stanford-corenlp-3.x.jar)
     * a recent java port of liblinear ([78]liblinear-x.jar)
     * the most recent mateplus srl model (june 2015), available from
       google drive [79]here

   in order to run the framenet and context extensions of mateplus (i.e.,
   framat and framat+context), please also download the following
   dependencies:
     * framenet version 1.5, available from icsi berkeley [80]here
     * semafor (for frame identification, including mstparser for
       preprocessing), available from cmu [81]here
     * stanford corenlp (for coreference resolution), available from
       stanford [82]here
     * glove 1.0a + pre-trained vectors (september 2015), available from
       google drive [83]here
     * the most recent framat srl model (september 2015), available from
       google drive [84]here

   to run mateplus on german text, additional preprocessing libraries need
   to be downloaded:
     * bernd bohnet's joint parsing model ([85]transition-1.30.jar,
       pet-ger-s2a-x and lemma-ger-3.6.model)
     * opennlp tokenizer (libraries from [86]apache-opennlp-1.5.3* and
       de-token.bin)
     * the most recent mateplus srl model for german (june 2015),
       available from google drive [87]here

   if you want to run mateplus on german text using [88]parzu as an
   external dependency parser (recommended for non-newswire text), please
   use [89]this model from google drive.

running mateplus

   if copies of all required libraries and models are available in the
   subdirectories lib/ and models/, respectively, mateplus can simply be
   executed as a standalone application using the scripts scripts/parse.sh
   and scripts/parse_framenet.sh. these scripts run necessary
   preprocessing tools on a given input text file (assuming one sentence
   per line), and apply our state-of-the-art model for identifying and
   role labeling of semantic predicate-argument structures. for german,
   please use the script scripts/parse-ger.sh (recommended for newswire
   text) or scripts/parse-ger-ext.sh (recommended for non-newswire text).

   it is also possible to apply the mateplus srl model on already
   preprocessed text in the conll 2009 format, using the java class
   se.lth.cs.srl.parse. since mateplus is trained based on preprocessed
   input from specific pipelines, however, we strongly recommend to use
   the complete pipeline to achieve best performance.
