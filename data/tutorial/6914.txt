the essential nlp guide for data scientists (with codes for top 10 common nlp
tasks)

   [97]nss, october 26, 2017

introduction

   organizations today deal with huge amount and wide variety of data    
   calls from customers, their emails, tweets, data from mobile
   applications and what not. it takes a lot of effort and time to make
   this data useful. one of the core skills in extracting information from
   text data is natural language processing (nlp).

   natural language processing (nlp) is the art and science which helps us
   extract information from text and use it in our computations and
   algorithms. given then increase in content on internet and social
   media, it is one of the must have still for all data scientists out
   there.

   whether you know nlp or not, this guide should help you as a ready
   reference for you. through this guide, i have provided you with
   resources and codes to run the most common tasks in nlp.

   once you have gone through this guide, feel free to have a look at our
   [98]video course on natural language processing (nlp).


why did i create this guide?

   after having been working on nlp problems for some time now, i have
   encountered various situations where i needed to consult hundred of
   different of sources to study about the latest developments in the form
   of research papers, blogs and competitions for some of the common nlp
   tasks.

   so, i decided to bring all these resources to one place and make it a
   one-stop solution for the latest and the important resources for these
   common nlp tasks. below is the list of tasks covered in this article
   along with their relevant resources. let   s get started.


table of contents

    1. id30
    2. lemmatisation
    3. id27s
    4. part-of-speech tagging
    5. named entity disambiguation
    6. id39
    7. id31
    8. semantic text similarity
    9. id46
   10. text summarisation


1. id30

   what is id30?: id30 is the process of reducing the
   words(generally modified or derived) to their word stem or root form.
   the objective of id30 is to reduce related words to the same stem
   even if the stem is not a dictionary word. for example, in the english
   language-
    1. beautiful and beautifully are stemmed to beauti
    2. good, better and best are stemmed to good, better and best
       respectively

   paper: the [99]original paper by martin porter on porter algorithm for
   id30.

   algorithm: [100]here is the python implementation of porter2 id30
   algorithm.

   implementation: here is how you can stem a word using the porter2
   algorithm from the id30 library.

   #!pip install id30
   from id30.porter2 import stem
   stem("casually")


2. lemmatisation

   what is lemmatisation?: lemmatisation is the process of reducing a
   group of words into their lemma or dictionary form. it takes into
   account things like pos(parts of speech), the meaning of the word in
   the sentence, the meaning of the word in the nearby sentences etc.
   before reducing the word to its lemma. for example, in the english
   language-
    1. beautiful and beautifully are lemmatised to beautiful and
       beautifully respectively.
    2. good, better and best are lemmatised to good, good and good
       respectively.

   paper 1: [101]this paper discusses different methods for performing
   lemmatisation in great detail. a must read if you want to know hoe
   traditional lemmatisers work.

   paper 2: [102]this is an excellent paper which addresses the problem of
   lemmatisation for variation rich languages using deep learning.

   dataset: [103]this is the link for treebank-3 dataset which you can use
   if you wish to create your own lemmatiser.

   implementation: below is an implementation of an english lemmatiser
   using spacy.

   #!pip install spacy
   #python -m spacy download en
   import spacy
   nlp=spacy.load("en")
   doc="good better best"

   for token in nlp(doc):
       print(token,token.lemma_)


3. id27s

   what is id27s?: id27s is the name of the techniques
   which are used to represent natural language in vector form of real
   numbers. they are useful because of computers    inability to process
   natural language. so these id27s capture the essence and
   relationship between words in a natural language using real numbers. in
   id27s, a word or a phrase is represented in a fixed dimension
   vector of length say 100.

   so for example-

   a word    man    might be represented in a 5-dimension vector as


   where each of these numbers is the magnitude of the word in a
   particular direction.


   blog: [104]here is an article which explains id27s in great
   detail.

   paper: [105]a very good paper which explains word vectors in detail. a
   must-read for an in-depth understanding of word vectors.

   tool: [106]a browser based tool for visualising word vectors.

   pre-trained word vectors: here is an exhaustive list of
   [107]pre-trained word vectors in 294 languages by facebook.

   implementation: here is how you can obtain pre-trained word vector of a
   word using the gensim package.

   download the [108]google news pre-trained word vectors from here.

   #!pip install gensim
   from gensim.models.keyedvectors import keyedvectors
   word_vectors=keyedvectors.load_id97_format('googlenews-vectors-nega
   tive300.bin',binary=true)
   word_vectors['human']

   implementation: here is how you can train your own word vectors using
   gensim

   sentence=[['first','sentence'],['second','sentence']]
   model = gensim.models.id97(sentence,
   min_count=1,size=300,workers=4)


4. part-of-speech tagging

   what is part-of-speech tagging?: in simplistic terms, part-of-speech
   tagging is the process of marking up of words in a sentence as nouns,
   verbs, adjectives, adverbs etc. for example, in the sentence-

      ashok killed the snake with a stick   

   the parts-of-speech are identified as    

   ashok propn
   killed verb
   the det
   snake noun
   with adp
   a det
   stick noun
   . punct

   paper 1: this [109]paper by choi aptly titled the last gist to the
   state-of-the-art presents a novel method called dynamic feature
   induction which achieves state-of-the-art on id52 task

   paper 2: [110]this paper presents performing unsupervised id52
   using anchor id48.

   implementation: here is how we can perform id52 using spacy.

   #!pip install spacy
   #!python -m spacy download en
   nlp=spacy.load('en')
   sentence="ashok killed the snake with a stick"
   for token in nlp(sentence):
      print(token,token.pos_)


5. named entity disambiguation

   what is named entity disambiguation?: named entity disambiguation is
   the process of identifying the mentions of entities in a sentence. for
   example, in the sentence-

      apple earned a revenue of 200 billion usd in 2016   

   it is the task of named entity disambiguation to infer that apple in
   the sentence is the company apple and not a fruit.

   named entity, in general, requires a knowledge base of entities which
   it can use to link entities in the sentence to the knowledge base.

   paper 1: [111]this paper by huang makes use of deep semantic
   relatedness models based on deep neural networks along with
   knowledgebase to achieve a state-of-the-art result on named entity
   disambiguation.

   paper 2: [112]this paper by ganea and hofmann make use of local neural
   attention along with id27s and no manually crafted features.


6. id39

   what is id39?: id39 is the task
   of identifying entities in a sentence and classifying them into
   categories like a person, organisation, date, location, time etc. for
   example, a ner would take in a sentence like    

      ram of apple inc. travelled to sydney on 5th october 2017   

   and return something like

   ram
   of
   apple org
   inc. org
   travelled
   to
   sydney gpe
   on
   5th date
   october date
   2017 date

   here, org stands for organisation and gpe stands for location.

   the problem with current ners is that even state-of-the-art ner tend to
   perform poorly when they are used on a domain of data which is
   different from the data, the ner was trained on.



   paper: [113]this excellent paper makes use of bi-directional lstms and
   combines supervised and unsupervised learning methods to achieve a
   state-of-the-art result in id39 in 4 languages.

   implementation: here is how you can perform id39
   using spacy.

   import spacy
   nlp=spacy.load('en')sentence="ram of apple inc. travelled to sydney on
   5th october 2017"
   for token in nlp(sentence):
      print(token, token.ent_type_)


7. id31

   what is id31?: id31 is a broad range of
   subjective analysis which uses natural language processing techniques
   to perform tasks such as identifying the sentiment of a customer
   review, positive or negative feeling in a sentence, judging mood via
   voice analysis or written text analysis etc. for example-

      i did not like the chocolate ice-cream        is a negative experience of
   ice-cream.

      i did not hate the chocolate ice-cream        may be considered as a
   neutral experience

   there is a wide range of methods which are used to perform sentiment
   analysis starting from taking a count of negative and positive words in
   a sentence to using lstms with id27s.

   blog 1: [114]this article focuses on performing id31 on
   movie tweets

   blog 2: [115]this article focuses on performing id31 of
   tweets during the chennai flood.

   paper 1: [116]this paper takes the supervised learning method approach
   with naive bayes method to classify imdb reviews.

   paper 2: [117]this paper makes use of unsupervised learning method with
   lda to identify aspects and sentiments of user-generated reviews. this
   paper is outstanding in the sense that it addresses the problem of
   shortage of annotated reviews.

   repository: [118]this is an awesome repository of the research papers
   and implementation of id31 in various languages.

   dataset 1: [119]multi-domain sentiment dataset version 2.0

   dataset 2: [120]twitter id31 dataset

   competition: [121]a very good competition where you can check the
   performance of your models on the id31 task of movie
   reviews of rotten tomatoes.

   [122]perform twitter id31 your self.

8. semantic text similarity

   what is semantic text similarity?: semantic text similarity is the
   process of analysing similarity between two pieces of text with respect
   to the meaning and essence of the text rather than analysing the syntax
   of the two pieces of text. also, similarity is different than
   relatedness.

   for example    

   car and bus are similar but car and fuel are related.

   paper 1: [123]this paper presents the different approaches to measuring
   text similarity in detail. a must read paper to know about the existing
   approaches at a single place.

   paper 2: [124]this paper introduces id98s to rank a pair of two short
   texts

   paper 3: [125]this paper makes use of tree-lstms which achieve a
   state-of-the-art result on semantic relatedness of texts and semantic
   classification.


9. id46

   what is id46?: id46 is the task
   of identifying the language in which the content is in.  it makes use
   of statistical as well as syntactical properties of the language to
   perform this task. it may also be considered as a special case of text
   classification.

   blog: [126]in this blog post by fasttext, they introduce a new tool
   which can identify 170 languages under 1mb of memory usage.

   paper 1: [127]this paper discusses 7 methods of id46
   of 285 languages.

   paper 2: [128]this paper describes how deep neural networks can be used
   to achieve state-of-the-art results on automatic language
   identification.


10.  text summarisation

   what is text summarisation?: text summarisation is the process of
   shortening up of a text by identifying the important points of the text
   and creating a summary using these points. the goal of text
   summarisation is to retain maximum information along with maximum
   shortening of text without altering the meaning of the text.

   paper 1: [129]this paper describes a neural attention model based
   approach for abstractive sentence summarization.

   paper 2: [130]this paper describes how sequence-to-sequence id56s can be
   used to achieve state-of-the-art results on text summarisation.

   repository: [131]this repository by google brain team has the codes for
   using a sequence-to-sequence model customised for text summarisation.
   the model is trained on gigaword dataset.

   application: [132]reddit   s autotldr bot uses text summarisation to
   summarise articles into the comments of a post. this feature turned out
   to be very famous amongst the reddit users.

   implementation: here is how you can quickly summarise your text using
   the gensim package.

   from gensim.summarization import summarize
   sentence="id54 is the process of shortening a text
   document with software, in order to create a summary with the major
   points of the original document. technologies that can make a coherent
   summary take into account variables such as length, writing style
   and syntax.automatic data summarization is part of machine
   learning and data mining. the main idea of summarization is to find a
   subset of data which contains the information of the entire set. such
   techniques are widely used in industry today. search engines are an
   example; others include summarization of documents, image collections
   and videos. document summarization tries to create a representative
   summary or abstract of the entire document, by finding the most
   informative sentences, while in image summarization the system finds
   the most representative and important (i.e. salient) images. for
   surveillance videos, one might want to extract the important events
   from the uneventful context.there are two general approaches to
   id54: extraction and abstraction. extractive methods
   work by selecting a subset of existing words, phrases, or sentences in
   the original text to form the summary. in contrast, abstractive methods
   build an internal semantic representation and then use natural language
   generation techniques to create a summary that is closer to what a
   human might express. such a summary might include verbal innovations.
   research to date has focused primarily on extractive methods, which are
   appropriate for image collection summarization and video
   summarization."
   summarize(sentence)


end notes

   so this was all about the most common nlp tasks along with their
   relevant resources in the form of blogs, research papers, repositories
   and applications etc. if you feel, there is any great resource on any
   of these 10 tasks that i have missed or you want to suggest adding
   another task, then please feel free to comment with your suggestions
   and feedback.

       hi ..this is a nice summary of all things nlp      .. having dirtied
       my hand in text for a while i would request you to add a disclaimer
       to the overall blog stating that all the stuff mentioned above is
       for narrow purposes. let me explain ..take summarization for e.g.    
       just pick a random para from wiki and run the same code above and
       you ll see what i am talking about. same thing for ner etc. so if
       practitioners really want decent accuracy they have to first
       generate./ gather data set from the domain , train each of these
       algos/variants and then only bother running them. telling them that
       these libraries are plug and play is a little misleading. i hope
       you don   t get offended. this is purely from the perspective of
       keeping things real
