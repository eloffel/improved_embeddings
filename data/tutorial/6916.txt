exciting id86 research topics (june 2017)

   [20]june 20, 2017june 20, 2017 [21]ehudreiter

   i had an academic visitor last week, who i hadnt seen in 15 years; he
   had worked in id86 20 years ago and then moved to other fields.  after
   some general catchup, my colleague asked me what id86 research i was
   working on and hoped to work on.  in other words, what did i personally
   find really exciting and valuable in id86 research in 2017?  a good
   question, i summarise my response below.  note that i am focusing on my
   academic interest and research at the [22]university of aberdeen. i
   cannot say much about my work at [23]arria in a public forum, because
   of commercial confidentiality.  however,  most of these research topics
   are also commercially relevant, as described below.

   please note that this is a personal research statement, about topics
   which i personally find really exciting and want to work on!   other
   people will undoubtedly will find other topics more exciting, which is
   great; the id86 field will make more progress if its researchers pursue
   a variety of interests, instead of all jumping on the same bandwagon.

text and graphics

   if we want to communicate information to people, when is it best to use
   words, and when is it better to use a visualisation?   how can words
   and visualisations be combined to get the best of both worlds?  how
   should users interact with a multimodal text+graphics system?

   this is a really fascinating academic and intellectual question, which
   raises deep questions about when language is the best way to
   communicate, and when it isnt.  its also a very important question in
   applied/commercial id86.  as above i cannot say much about my arria work
   here, but it is a matter of public record that i have an arria patent
   on [24]method and apparatus for annotating a graphical output.

   id86 researchers have been working on this on-and-off for at least 30
   years.  i myself wrote [25]my first paper on text/graphics back in
   1990, and this blog includes an entry on [26]text or graphics?
   however, in retrospect the 1990s research on text/graphics lacked solid
   empirical/experimental foundations.  lots of interesting theoretical
   insights (hopefully including my 1990 paper) and impressive-looking
   systems, but not enough careful evaluation and experimentation.
   fortunately, recent work in this area is much more solid from this
   perspective, such as [27]gkatzia et al   s work on the effectiveness of
   textual forecasts vs weather graphics for communicating weather
   information.  i think rigorous empirical/experimental work is
   absolutely the way to make progress on this topic, and i hope to start
   working on text/graphics in an academic (as well as commercial) context
   soon.

narrative

   in a lot of cases, the best way to communicate with people
   linguistically is to tell them stories.  many people believe that
   language evolved as a story telling mechanism, and certainly our brains
   seem    wired    to understand and respond to stories.

   narrative again is both a really interesting intellectual and academic
   challenge, and very important commercially.  on the academic side, a
   huge amount is known about storytelling in psychology, linguistics,
   literary theory, and education, but little of this has been utilised by
   the id86 community.  on the commercial side, arria tells clients that
      we help your data tell its story   , and other id86 companies similarly
   emphasise that they produce stories about data.

   despite the intellectual and commercial importance of storytelling,
   there has not been a huge amount of work in this in the academic id86
   community.  there has been work in the creativity community on
   producing fictional stories, but its not straightforward to translate
   this into the id86 task of producing stories about real-world data.  but
   its exciting that we now have [28]workshops that brings together id86
   and creativity research.  that   s definitely a step forward. i myself
   first got involved with narrative in the babytalk project ([29]reiter
   et al 2008, [30]mckinlay et al 2010), and am now looking for a phd
   student to work on [31]advanced data storytelling.

language grounding

   i   ve always been fascinated by the relationship between language and
   the world.  in particular, what do words    mean    in the context of
   real-world data?  for example, what shapes can be described as spikes,
   what rgb values can be described as red, what times can be described as
   evening, and what motions can be described as drifting?  this is surely
   one of the most fundamental questions about language.

   the link between language and the real world is obviously hugely
   important from a philoophical and intellectual perspective.   but
   although there has been a lot of philosophical discussion about this
   topic, its only recently that people in the nlp community have started
   exploring this issue from a more empirical and experimental
   perspective.  this work is partially driven by increasing commercial
   interest, especially in automatic image captioning.

   i worked on this area in the early 2000s, which culminated in an aij
   special issue on connecting language to the world, which included a
   good (for the time) [32]overview paper and [33]a paper on our work on
   time expressions in weather forecasts.  more recently, work on
   grounding language has been dominated by machine learning approaches,
   especially for image captioning.  which leaves me with mixed feelings;
   on the one hand thing this is a good application of ml from a pragmatic
   perspective, but on the other hand i find it difficult to derive
   intellectual insights on language grounding from ml work.  in recent
   years i have been working with colleagues to explore this issue from a
   fuzzy logic perspective, in a way which still provides intellectual
   insights (eg, [34]ramos-soto et al 2017)

evaluation

   high quality testing of scientific hypotheses, including    evaluation   
   in nlp, is clearly of paramount importance in making scientific
   progress.  in science as a whole, we have seen again and again that
   sloppy hypothesis testing may make us happier in the short term, but is
   likely to lead us into a dead-end in the longer term.

   as any reader of this blog will quickly discover, i am unhappy with the
   lack of rigour in current academic nlp evaluations, especially compared
   to [35]evaluations in clinical medicine.  of course one could argue
   that less-than-ideal evaluations in nlp are unlikely to kill people
   (which is the case in medicine), but i still strongly feel that we need
   to    up our game    and improve the quality and rigour of our evaluations.
    it also would be good if academic evaluations could include issues
   which are very important in real-world commercial id86 (and nlp), such
   as worst-case performance.

   i have written and spoken about evaluation issues many times, for
   example my [36]2009 cl paper and [37]2016 naacl invited talk.  but it
   remains an area where progress can seem very slow, and in particular
   there seems to be a lot of work on details (tweaking id74
   and statistical tests) but not nearly enough discussion of fundamental
   issues (eg, what is the proper role of id74 in nlp).
   there are also serious [38]change management issues in changing the
   behaviour of the research community.  in any case, my current work in
   this area includes [39]reviewing what we know about the validity of
   id7.
