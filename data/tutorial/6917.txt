text or graphics?

   [20]december 26, 2016january 4, 2017 [21]ehudreiter

   if we need to present some data to a person, when does it make sense to
   use a textual summary, when does it make sense to use some kind of
   graphic (ie, [22]information visualisation), and when is the best
   option to use a combination of text and graphics?

   i have been working on text and graphics for decades; my first
   [23]paper on the topic was published in 1990, and my first [24]opinion
   piece in 1998.  i just reread this opinion piece; i still believe in
   most of what i said in it, but it is striking how little experimental
   data was presented in this paper.  maybe this was a sign of the times?

basic principles

   many of the basics haven   t changed much in the 19 years since i wrote
   my 1998 opinion piece.

   practical constraints: graphics are not possible for information
   delivered by radio, sms text message, or other words-only medium; they
   also may be inappropriate for many visually-impaired users.  hence text
   is preferred in such contexts.  on the other hand, text is not
   appropriate  for users who dont know the language the text is written
   in, and some language-impaired individuals (eg, non-verbal autistic
   people).

   type of information: abstract information such as causality,
   provenance, and data quality concerns may best be communicated in
   words; on the other hand graphics may be best for identifying specific
   components in a complex visual object (eg, a location on a map or a
   widget in a complex user interface).

   users: people vary widely in whether they are    visual thinkers    or
      verbal thinkers   ; this obviously impacts their preferred media.  this
   is especially important when users are expected to remember the
   information.  also, in many contexts domain experts are better at
   interpreting complex graphics than domain novices (see babytalk
   discussion below).

   use of information: i have mostly worked on decision support, that is
   providing information to help people make decisions (eg, how to treat a
   patient).  text and graphics can also be used for persuasion, including
   behaviour change (eg, encourage people to stop smoking).  another
   important use case is [25]exploratory data analysis, where a human
   analyst explores a data set looking for general insights; this plays an
   important role in many scientific discoveries.

text and graphics for decision support: babytalk

   the [26]babytalk project focused on developing an id86 system which
   summarised clinical data about babies in neonatal intensive care
   (nicu).  in babytalk, as well as in some predecessor projects, we did
   several studies which compared the effectiveness (for decision support)
   of textual and visual presentations of babytalk clinical data.  to
   summarise the key findings (i give references below to the actual
   research papers, which i encourage interested people to read)
     * human-written text summaries were the most effective presentation
       mechanism.  computer-generated texts and visualisations were
       equally effective on average, but on some data sets texts computer
       texts were better, and on others visualisations were better.  this
       suggests that a combination of textual summary and data
       visualisation would be the best approach.
     * experienced clinicians were much better at interpreting complex
       visualisations than junior clinicians.  there is a suggestion that
       this is partially because experienced clinicians are better at
       focusing on what   s important, while junior clinicians may get
       distracted by noise or clinically unimportant data.
     * clinicians *preferred* visualisations, even if they made better
       decisions when presented with a textual summary.  this could
       patially be because they are used to looking at visualisations, and
       hence more comfortable with this

   i believe these findings generalise, and indeed i have observed similar
   things in other projects and indeed in my work for arria.  however, i
   dont have formal experimental data about text/graphics from these other
   projects.

text and graphics for persuasion: saferdriver

   a recent research student at aberdeen, [27]daniel braun, looked at
   using textual and graphical feedback to encourage drivers to drive more
   safely.  his system analysed driving data (acquired using gps
   tracking), identified occasions of inappropriate behaviour (such as
   speeding), and provided feedback reports to drivers about these
   problems.  daniel has not yet published all of his findings, and it is
   not for me to    steal his thunder    by revealing unpublished
   findings here.  but one of his papers does discuss user   s reactions to
   different presentations, including a textual feedback report and a map
   showing where inappropriate behaviour occurred.  he found that if
   forced to choose, participants preferred the textual feedback report to
   the map; however what they really wanted was to see both.

   i have informally observed similar reactions in other behaviour change
   projects i have worked on, such as [28]stop (smoking cessation), but i
   again dont have experimental data about text/graphics from these
   projects.   in general i think graphics-only presentations are unusual
   for persuasion and behaviour change, since text is needed to present
   rationale and logical arguments, give encouragement and highlight
   success, etc.  however text+graphics is often more powerful than text
   on its own.

text and graphics for exploratory data analysis

   i personally have not worked on exloratory data analysis, where
   analysts spend large amounts of time (sometimes weeks or months)
   investigating large data sets and looking for general insights.  this
   is a very different task from decision-support (where a subject matter
   expert looks at the data in order to make a specific decision),
   especially since many decision-making tasks are expected to be done in
   minutes or hours, not weeks or months.  i am not aware of any research
   on using textual summaries of data to support exploratory data
   analysis, although there have been a few studies which looked at using
   texts to summarise results of statistical analyses, simulation runs,
   what-if scenarios, etc.  but for the core task of directly examining
   the data, i think interactive visualisation workbenches are probably
   superior to any textual alternative i am aware of.  although it is very
   difficult to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of visualisation
   tools in this context, as plaisant and others have pointed out; for
   example it is difficult to run a controlled experiment comparing
   different approaches to supporting eda because eda takes a long time
   (days, weeks, months) and there is huge variability in the skill and
   effectiveness of analysts doing eda.

summary

   the clearest message from the above is that the best approach is
   usually to combine text and graphics when presenting information.  in
   other words, the best answer to the question    text or graphics?    is to
   use text *and* graphics.  the two media have different strengths and
   weaknesses, so the best approach is to use both, preferably integrated
   into a combined presentation.  this is the approach [29]arria has
   taken, for example by automatically producing [30]annotated graphs.

       thanks ehud for the great summary. dimitra and i did some work on
       graphics vs. speech for conveying uncertainty for decision making.
       we found that there are significant gender differences between
       multi-modal, text, and graphical versions of the task, where for
       women, use of text results in a 87% increase in task success over
       graphics. multimodal presentations lead to a 44% increase for all
       adults, compared to graphics. people are also more confident of
       their judgements when using the multimodal representations.
