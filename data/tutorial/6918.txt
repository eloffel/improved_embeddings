id86 and machine learning

   [19]december 12, 2016december 18, 2016 [20]ehudreiter

   i am often asked about my views on the role of machine learning (ml)
   and statistical nlp more generally in the context of natural language
   generation (id86).  i will get (some of) them off of my chest here!

some things really annoy me about ml and id86

   first off, there are some things which really annoy me about current
   work on ml in id86.

   lack of awareness of previous (non-ml) work in id86.  for example, i was
   astonished at a paper presented at a major acl conference in 2016,
   which described a neural network ml approach to generating point
   weather forecasts.  this paper showed no awareness of the decades of
   work in the id86 community on generating point weather forecasts.  the
   paper claimed its results were better than state of the art, but to me
   the forecasts looked considerably worse than what we were producing 15
   years ago in the [21]sumtime project (which of course the authors were
   not aware of).

   evaluation using [22]id7 and similar metrics. i have no problem in
   using id7 to provide development feedback (which is what it was
   orginally proposed for), but evaluating an id86 system using id7 is
   meaningless, the correlation with human and task evaluations is very
   weak.  i have written and spoken about this elsewhere, for example in
   a [23]computational linguistics paper and an [24]invited naacl talk.
   in fairness, many ml for id86 papers do present human evaluations, but
   there are also many such papers which just rely on id7 evaluations.

   poor worst-case performance. my experience with ml is that it is
   brittle, ie ml systems do silly things in unusual cases.  for example,
   for many years my applications for credit cards were usually rejected
   by the statistical/ml models used to approve such applicants, despite
   the fact that i was long-term employed in a stable and decently paying
   job, and had never missed a loan payment.  i assume this because in
   financial terms i am unusual (eg, own neither a house nor a car), so
   the models didnt know what to do with me (rule-based systems also make
   mistakes, but these are straightforward to fix; in contrast, its
   effectively impossible to fix undesirable behaviour in a    deep
   learning    system).  my experience with ml systems for id86 is similar;
   even if they generate good texts in most cases, they
   occasionally generate bizarre and inappropriate texts (and the
   evaluations are always of average case performance, not worst case
   performance).  this behaviour may be acceptable in some contexts (eg,
   image descriptions to support image search), but it is not appropriate
   for the id86 systems which summarise and explain data to help people
   make decisions, which is what i am interested in.

   lack of corpora and training data. ml systems of course need training
   data, which for a data-to-text system means parallel text-data corpora.
    unfortunately for most of the applications i am interested in, such
   corpora and training data do not exist.  i   m hearing a growing number
   of people make similar observations about ml in other areas of nlp and
   ai, in both the academic and commercial worlds.  for example, at naacl
   2016, [25]the other invited talk (not mine) was by regina barzilay, who
   described how she had to abandon corpus and ml techniques when trying
   to help a local hospital solve a real-world nlp problem, because there
   wasn   t enough training data for ml and statistical approaches.

good uses of ml in id86

   now that i   ve gotten my    rants    off my chest, i   d like to say that i
   think that are many places where ml and statistical techniques can be
   really useful in id86.  they key is to put aside the view that a 100% ml
   approach is a    magic bullet    which will solve all of the (id86) world   s
   problems, and instead regard ml/statistical techniques as useful tools
   for solving specific problems and making specific choices in id86
   systems, in combination with non-ml techniques.  especially for
   linguistic    how to say    choices that affect readability (instead of
      what to say    choices that affect content), since (a) we can use
   general corpora of english (or whatever language we are working on), we
   dont need domain-specific parallel data-text corpora; and (b) in terms
   of worst-case performance, generating unreadable texts is less of a
   concern than generating incorrect and misleading texts.

   to take a concrete example, consider the id86 task of deciding whether
   a or an should be used in front of a word (eg, an apple but a banana).
    clearly we want to primarily take a ml/statistical/corpus approach, by
   counting how often a and an occur in front of a word in a corpus (eg,
   the relative frequency in the corpus of a apple and an apple). it would
   be madness to try to manually write rules to encode this information!
   on the other hand, there are some special cases, such as currencies
   (eg, an   80 meal) and quoted strings (eg, they hired an    engineer    who
   was clueless), which are best handled by rules.  thus,
   statistical/corpus approaches should absolutely be used to make the a
   vs an decision, but best performance requires supplementing them with
   rules.

   this kind of approach makes sense for many other id86 linguistic
   decisions, including adjective ordering (eg, big red dog vs red big
   dog), synonym selection (eg, wind speed eased but not voting rates
   eased), and pronominalisation (eg, john went shopping vs he went
   shopping).  and many other choices as well; this list is illustrative,
   not exhaustive!   these tasks require a much more sophisticated
   approach then simply counting frequencies in a corpus (as with a vs
   an), but i think an ml/statistical approach makes a lot of sense,
   especially if augmented by rules.

   there are some decisions which statistical/ml approaches should not be
   used for, either because rules are well understood (eg, adjective
   before head noun in english np), or because the decision depends on a
      house style   , and needs to be explicitly parametrisable (such as quote
   transposition    she said    hello.      vs   she said    hello   .  ).  so
   ml/statistical techniques are not a panacea.  but they are certainly
   useful in many places!

   i also think there is huge potential for using statistical/ml
   techniques for testing and quality assurance (which is really important
   in commercial id86 work).  for example, we can check the correctness of
   inflected forms in a lexicon by seeing if they occur in a corpus, and
   (more ambitiously) we may be able to use language models to detect
      unlikely    sentences which should be reviewed by a human.

summary

   i think ml and statistical techniques can be very useful in id86, but
   they are not a panacea.  they are the best approach for solving many
   id86 problems, especially we add rules when appropriate (ie, dont insist
   on 100% pure ml). but in many contexts they are inappropriate, and
   other techniques make more sense.

   in other words, i take a very    pragmatic    (engineering?) approach to
   ml/statistical techniques, in nlp and ai generally as well as in id86.
   let   s choose the best tool for the job based on evidence of how well
   our tools work in different contexts.  and sometimes the best tool is
   ml/statistical techniques, but sometimes a different tool is best.

       nice article. i certainly agree that finding appropriate training
       data for building id86 systems is difficult. in some domains such as
       sports and weather, such data is easier to come by, but can often
       be incomplete. great point regarding the difficulty in fixing
       undesirable behaviour in a learnt system, as this greatly affects
       end user acceptance.

       great post, ehud, thanks for sharing. it   s good to have metrics and
       automatic evaluations (what you can   t measure you can   t improve),
       but as you say that   s not the whole story, and the best automatic
       metric is only as good as it is a proxy for the real variable
       you   re trying to measure. what i like to do when reviewing papers
       is to ask for sample system output, as that can help get a sense.of
       how good generated outputs are (more feasible in journal articles,
       due to space limitations).
