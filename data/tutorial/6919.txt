why isnt there more open-source id86 software?

   [20]march 17, 2017march 17, 2017 [21]ehudreiter

   one of the organisers of the [22]iid862017 conference recently asked me
   if i would be willing to participate in a possible panel or discussion
   session on open-source id86 software (presumably because of my
   experience with [23]simpleid86).  he also asked me to suggest other
   possible panelists who had developed successful open-source id86
   software (which i took to mean software which was used beyond the
   developer   s own research group).  i thought about this, and it was
   disheartening how few such people and projects came to mind, especially
   if i discounted systems which  seemed to be    dead    in the sense of no
   longer being maintained, such as fuf/surge and tg/2.  it was also
   striking that most of the open-source systems i could think of where
   realisers.  for example, despite decades of research on referring
   expression generation in id86, i couldnt think of a single open-source
   referring-expression generator which met the above criteria.  lots of
   code was been written to generate referring expressions, but none of it
   (to my knowledge) has become successful open-source software.  why not?

too much effort?

   creating open-source software is a lot of work.  as i learnt with
   simpleid86, turning something we used internally at aberdeen into a tool
   which others could use required a lot of extra effort to make the tool
   more flexible and robust, and of course better-documented.  plus a fair
   amount of continuing work to support users who had problems or
   questions, and who wanted bugs to be fixed.   so why should a developer
   do this for something which he gives away for free?  good question, but
   this hasnt stopped people from writing effective open-source software
   in other areas.

more commercial id86 developers needed?

   over most of its history id86 has been dominated by academics, with very
   little commercial work.   i suspect commercial developers are more
   likely to develop good open-source software, because they have a better
   background in software engineering, and also because of cv/career
   benefits.  if a developer is applying for a job, its really helpful to
   list open-source software he or she has worked on; i   ve never seen this
   mentioned in an academic job interview.  anyways, there is a lot more
   commercial interest in id86 these days, lets see if it leads to more
   open-source id86 software.   a related point is that some companies
   effectively pay their staff to work on open-source software which the
   company uses; again hopefully commercial interest in id86 will encourage
   this kind of thing.

more awareness of open-source needed?

   there are in fact a number of id86-related projects on github and other
   open-source platforms (including for referring expression generation),
   but few of them are widely used.  of course, this is probably true of
   most github projects! but i wonder if more of these projects would be
   used if people were more aware of them.  the id86 community is pretty
   bad at letting its members know about software resources; the closest
   thing i   ve seen to a community resource listing is the [24]acl id86
   resources portal, which is years out of date.  lack of awareness is
   something the community can do something about, by publicising
   resources better (maybe i should do this in a future blog entry??)

final thoughts

   the optimistic view is that we   ll see more open-source id86 software in
   the future, as the fields grows and becomes more commercial, especially
   if the community supports this by doing a better job of publicising
   open-source.  hopefully this will happen!
