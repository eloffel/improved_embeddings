relation-autoencoder

   this is the code used in the paper [69]discrete-state variational
   autoencoders for joint discovery and factorization of relations by
   diego marcheggiani and ivan titov.

   if you use this code, please cite us.

data processing

   to run the model the first thing to do is create a dataset. you need a
   file like data-sample.txt. the file must be tab-separated an with the
   following fields:

   lexicalized dependency path between arguments (entities) of the
   relation, first entity second entity entity types of the first and
   second entity trigger word id of the sentence raw sentence pos tags of
   the entire sentence relation between the two entities if any (used only
   for evaluation)

   in order to create the dataset you need the oiepreprocessor.py script
   once for each dataset partition: train, dev, and test.
python processing/oiepreprocessor.py --batch-name train data-sample.txt sample.p
k
python processing/oiepreprocessor.py --batch-name dev data-sample.txt sample.pk
python processing/oiepreprocessor.py --batch-name test data-sample.txt sample.pk

   now, your dataset with all the indexed features is in sample.pk

training models

   to train the model run the oieinduction.py file with all the required
   arguments:
python learning/oieinduction.py --pickled_dataset sample.pk --model_name discret
e-autoencoder --model ac --optimization 1 --epochs 10 --batch_size 100 --relatio
ns_number 10 --negative_samples_number 5 --l2_id173 0.1 --alpha 0.1 --s
eed 2 --embed_size 10 --learning_rate 0.1

   for any questions, please drop me a mail at marcheggiani [at] uva [dot]
