tree_id56

   theano implementation of tree id56s aka id56s.

   includes implementation of treelstms as described in "improved semantic
   representations from tree-structured id137"
   by kai sheng tai, richard socher, and christopher d. manning.

   also includes implementation of treegrus derived using similar methods.

   you may immediately run "dummy" demos via simple_demo.py and
   modulo_demo.py.

   code for evaluation on the stanford sentiment treebank (used by the
   paper) is also available in sentiment.py. to run this, you'll need to
   download the relevant data.

   step-by-step for cloning this repo and getting the sentiment model
   running:

   from your shell, run
git clone https://github.com/ofirnachum/tree_id56.git
git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/treelstm.git
cd treelstm
./fetch_and_preprocess.sh

   this will download the datasets, the word vectors, and do some
   preprocessing on the data. once this is complete, go into the tree_id56
   directory and start a python shell. in that shell, we'll preprocess the
   word vectors:
import data_utils
vocab = data_utils.vocab()
vocab.load('../treelstm/data/sst/vocab-cased.txt')
words, embeddings = \
    data_utils.read_embeddings_into_numpy(
        '../treelstm/data/glove/glove.840b.300d.txt', vocab=vocab)

import numpy as np
np.save('../treelstm/data/words.npy', words)
np.save('../treelstm/data/glove.npy', embeddings)

   after exiting the python shell, you can run the sentiment training
   directly
python sentiment.py

   the first couple lines of output should be
