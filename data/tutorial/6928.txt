tree2seq: tree-to-sequence attentional id4

   we have proposed a novel syntactic aid4 model, "[80]tree-to-sequence
   attentional id4" [1]. we extend an original
   sequence-to-sequence model [2] with the source-side phrase structure.
   our model has an attention mechanism that enables the decoder to
   generate a translated word while softly aligning it with source phrases
   and words. [81]here is an online demo of tree2seq.

description

   c++ codes of the syntactic attention-based id4
   (aid4) model.
    1. attentiontreeencdec.xpp: our aid4 model, "tree-to-sequence
       attentional id4"
    2. attentionencdec.xpp: baseline aid4 model [3]
    3. /data/: tanaka corpus (en-jp) [4]

requirement

     * eigen, a template libary for id202
       ([82]http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=main_page)
     * n3lp, c++ libaray for neural network-based nlp
       ([83]https://github.com/hassygo/n3lp)
     * boost, c++ library for tree structure ([84]http://www.boost.org/)
     * option: enju, a syntactic parser for english
       ([85]http://kmcs.nii.ac.jp/enju/?lang=en)

usage

    1. modify the paths of eigen_location, share_location and
       boost_location. see makefile.
    2. $ bash setup.sh
    3. $./tree2seq (then, training the attentiontreeencdec model starts.)
    4. modify main.cpp if you want to change the model.

   (!) attention: i prepare a small corpus of tanaka corpus. you need over
   100,000 parallel corpus.
