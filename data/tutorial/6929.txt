overview

     * [53]eigen is versatile.
          + it supports all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices
            to arbitrarily large dense matrices, and even sparse matrices.
          + it supports all standard numeric types, including
            std::complex, integers, and is easily extensible to [54]custom
            numeric types.
          + it supports various [55]matrix decompositions and [56]geometry
            features.
          + its ecosystem of [57]unsupported modules provides many
            specialized features such as non-linear optimization, matrix
            functions, a polynomial solver, fft, and much more.
     * [58]eigen is fast.
          + expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries
            and enable [59]lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate.
          + [60]explicit vectorization is performed for sse 2/3/4, avx,
            avx2, fma, avx512, arm neon (32-bit and 64-bit), powerpc
            altivec/vsx (32-bit and 64-bit), zvector (s390x/zec13) simd
            instruction sets, and since 3.4 mips msa with graceful
            fallback to non-vectorized code.
          + fixed-size matrices are fully optimized: dynamic memory
            allocation is avoided, and the loops are unrolled when that
            makes sense.
          + for large matrices, special attention is paid to
            cache-friendliness.
     * [61]eigen is reliable.
          + algorithms are carefully selected for reliability. reliability
            trade-offs are [62]clearly documented and [63]extremely
            [64]safe [65]decompositions are available.
          + eigen is thoroughly tested through its own [66]test suite
            (over 500 executables), the standard blas test suite, and
            parts of the lapack test suite.
     * [67]eigen is elegant.
          + the api is extremely [68]clean and expressive while feeling
            natural to c++ programmers, thanks to expression templates.
          + implementing an algorithm on top of eigen feels like just
            copying pseudocode.
     * [69]eigen has good compiler support as we run our test suite
       against many compilers to guarantee reliability and work around any
       compiler bugs. eigen also is standard c++98 and maintains very
       reasonable compilation times.

documentation

     * [70]eigen 3 documentation: this includes a [71]getting started
       guide, a [72]long tutorial, a [73]quick reference, and page about
       [74]porting from eigen 2 to eigen 3.

     * [75]eigen development branch documentation

     * [76]eigen 2 documentation (old): this includes the [77]eigen 2
       tutorial.

     * [78]faq (frequently asked questions)

     * [79]presentations and talks

requirements

   eigen doesn't have any dependencies other than the c++ standard
   library.

   we use the cmake build system, but only to build the documentation and
   unit-tests, and to automate installation. if you just want to use
   eigen, you can use the header files right away. there is no binary
   library to link to, and no configured header file. eigen is a pure
   template library defined in the headers.

license

   eigen is [80]free software. starting from the 3.1.1 version, it is
   licensed under the [81]mpl2, which is a simple weak copyleft license.
   common questions about the mpl2 are answered in the official [82]mpl2
   faq.

   earlier versions were licensed under the lgpl3+.

   note that currently, a few features rely on third-party code licensed
   under the lgpl: simplicialcholesky, amd ordering, and constrained_cg.
   such features can be explicitly disabled by compiling with the
   eigen_mpl2_only preprocessor symbol defined. furthermore, eigen
   provides interface classes for various third-party libraries (usually
   recognizable by the <eigen/*support> header name). of course you have
   to mind the license of the so-included library when using them.

   virtually any software may use eigen. for example, closed-source
   software may use eigen without having to disclose its own source code.
   many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using eigen
   right now, as well as many bsd-licensed projects.

   see the [83]mpl2 faq for more information, and do not hesitate to
   [84]contact us if you have any questions.

compiler support

   eigen is standard c++98 and so should theoretically be compatible with
   any compliant compiler. whenever we use some non-standard feature, that
   is optional and can be disabled.

   eigen is being successfully used with the following compilers:
     * [85]gcc, version 4.8 and newer. older versions of gcc might work as
       well but they are not tested anymore.
     * [86]msvc (visual studio), 2012 and newer. be aware that enabling
       intellisense (/fr flag) is known to trigger some internal
       compilation errors. the old 3.2 version of eigen supports msvc
       2010, and the 3.1 version supports msvc 2008.
     * [87]intel c++ compiler. enabling the -inline-forceinline option is
       highly recommended.
     * [88]llvm/clang++, version 3.4 and newer. (the 2.8 version used to
       work fine, but it is not tested with up-to-date versions of eigen)
     * xcode 7 and newer. based on llvm/clang.
     * [89]mingw, recent versions. based on gcc.
     * qnx's qcc compiler.

   regarding performance, eigen performs best with compilers based on gcc
   or llvm/clang. see [90]this page for some known compilation issues.

   quick eigen development chat happens over irc, but the main place for
   eigen development discussion remains the [107]eigen mailing list. some
   user support also happens over irc, but the main place for eigen user
   support is the [108]users forum.

contributing to eigen

   eigen is written and maintained by volunteers. you can contribute in
   many ways to help: give support to new users, write and improve
   documentation, helping with bugs and other issues in bugzilla,

   eigen is also using code that we copied from other sources. they are
   acknowledged in our sources and in the mercurial history, but let's
   also mention them here:
   intel corporation sse code for 4x4 matrix inversion [231]taken from
   here.
   [232]tim davis amd reordering simplicial sparse cholesky factorization
   adapted from [233]suitesparse
   julien pommier sse implementation of exp,log,cos,sin math functions
   from [234]gmm++
   [235]yousef saad incompletelut preconditioner coming from [236]itsol
   [237]minpack authors algorithms for non linear optimization.

   special thanks to [238]tuxfamily for the wonderful quality of their
   services, and the gcc compile farm project that gives us access to many
   various systems including arm neon.

   papers, see the [239]bibtex page.
