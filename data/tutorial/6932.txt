tellina

   tellina uses natural language processing (nlp) to translate an english
   sentence, such as "find text file in the current folder", into a bash
   command, such as find . -name "*.txt".

   you can try it now at [79]http://tellina.rocks . or, you can install it
   locally; this document tells you how.

installation

install tensorflow

   tellina uses tensorflow (>=r1.0).

   follow the instructions on the [80]tensorflow website. the simplest way
   is to install using [81]pip3.

install other dependencies:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

set up tellina_learning_module submodule:

git submodule update --init --remote
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
make submodule

   to update the tellina_learning_module in the future, run:
make submodule

set up databases:

make db

run webapp:

make run

   to experiment with the translation model locally, make sure to set
   following control variables correctly.

control variables:

website_develop (website/views.py)

  - true, start the web server without importing the tensorflow translation modu
le (no server start delay, suggested setting when testing peripheral website fun
ctions)
  - false (default), start the web server and translate new queries (5-10 secs s
erver start delay due to tensorflow graph building)

cache_translations (website/views.py)

  - true, cache translation results for natural language queries that were seen
  - false (default), run translation model on every query, regardless of whether
 it has been seen or not

cpu_only (website/backend_interface.py)

  - true (default), run tellina on cpu
  - false, run tellina on gpu if and only if the host machine has gpu installed
