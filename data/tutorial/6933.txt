success with styles

   predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among
   publishers and aspiring writers alike. we examine the quantitative
   connection, if any, between writing style and successful literature.
   based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive
   power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary
   works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more
   prominent in successful writings.
