higher-order coreference resolution with coarse-to-fine id136

introduction

   this repository contains the code for replicating results from
     * [101]higher-order coreference resolution with coarse-to-fine
       id136
     * [102]kenton lee, [103]luheng he, and [104]luke zettlemoyer
     * in naacl 2018

getting started

     * install python (either 2 or 3) requirements: pip install -r
       requirements.txt
     * download pretrained id27s and build custom kernels by
       running setup_all.sh.
          + there are 3 platform-dependent ways to build custom tensorflow
            kernels. please comment/uncomment the appropriate lines in the
            script.
     * run one of the following:
          + to use the pretrained model only, run setup_pretrained.sh
          + to train your own models, run setup_training.sh
               o this assumes access to ontonotes 5.0. please edit the
                 ontonotes_path variable.

training instructions

     * experiment configurations are found in experiments.conf
     * choose an experiment that you would like to run, e.g. best
     * training: python train.py <experiment>
     * results are stored in the logs directory and can be viewed via
       tensorboard.
     * evaluation: python evaluate.py <experiment>

demo instructions

     * command-line demo: python demo.py final
     * to run the demo with other experiments, replace final with your
       configuration name.

batched prediction instructions

     * create a file where each line is in the following json format (make
       sure to strip the newlines so each line is well-formed json):

{
  "clusters": [],
  "doc_key": "nw",
  "sentences": [["this", "is", "the", "first", "sentence", "."], ["this", "is",
"the", "second", "."]],
  "speakers": [["spk1", "spk1", "spk1", "spk1", "spk1", "spk1"], ["spk2", "spk2"
, "spk2", "spk2", "spk2"]]
}

     * clusters should be left empty and is only used for evaluation
       purposes.
     * doc_key indicates the genre, which can be one of the following:
       "bc", "bn", "mz", "nw", "pt", "tc", "wb"
     * speakers indicates the speaker of each word. these can be all empty
       strings if there is only one known speaker.
     * run python predict.py <experiment> <input_file> <output_file>,
       which outputs the input jsonlines with predicted clusters.

other quirks

     * it does not use gpus by default. instead, it looks for the gpu
       environment variable, which the code treats as shorthand for
       cuda_visible_devices.
     * the training runs indefinitely and needs to be terminated manually.
       the model generally converges at about 400k steps.
