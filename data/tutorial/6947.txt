open source toolkits for id103

looking at cmu sphinx, kaldi, htk, julius, and isip  |  february 23rd, 2017

   as members of the [9]deep learning r&d team at svds, we are interested
   in comparing [10]recurrent neural network (id56) and other approaches to
   id103. until a few years ago, the state-of-the-art for
   id103 was a [11]phonetic-based approach including separate
   components for pronunciation, [12]acoustic, and [13]language models.
   typically, this consists of id165 language models combined with
   [14]id48 (id48). we wanted to start with this as a
   baseline model, and then explore ways to combine it with newer
   approaches such as baidu   s [15]deep speech. while summaries exist
   explaining these baseline phonetic models, there do not appear to be
   any easily-digestible blog posts or papers that compare the tradeoffs
   of the different freely available tools.

   this article reviews the main options for free id103
   toolkits that use traditional id48 and id165 language models. for
   operational, general, and customer-facing id103 it may be
   preferable to purchase a product such as [16]dragon or [17]cortana. but
   in an r&d context, a more flexible and focused solution is often
   required, and that is why we decided to develop our own speech
   recognition pipeline. below we list the top contenders in the free or
   open source world, and rate them on several characteristics.

   comparison of open source and free id103 toolkits

   this analysis is based on our subjective experience and the information
   available from the repositories and toolkit websites. this is also not
   an exhaustive list of id103 software, most of which are
   listed [18]here (which goes beyond open source). a 2014 paper by gaida
   et.al. evaluates the performance of [19]cmu sphinx, [20]kaldi, and
   [21]htk. note that htk is not strictly open source in its usual
   interpretation, as the code cannot be redistributed or re-purposed for
   commercial use.

   programming languages: depending on your familiarity with different
   languages, you may naturally prefer one toolkit over another. all of
   the listed options except for [22]isip have python wrappers available
   either on the main site or found quickly with a web search. of course,
   the python wrappers may not expose the full functionality of the core
   code available in the toolkit. cmu sphinx also has wrappers in several
   other programming languages.

   development activity: all of the projects listed have their origins in
   academic research. cmu sphinx, as may be obvious from its name, is a
   product of carnegie mellon university. it   s existed in some form for
   about 20 years, and is now available on both github (with [23]c and
   [24]java versions there) and [25]sourceforge, with recent activity on
   both. both the java and c versions appear to have only one contributor
   on github, but this doesn   t reflect the historical reality of the
   project (there are 9 administrator and more than a dozen developers on
   the sourceforge repo). kaldi has its academic roots from a 2009
   workshop, with its code now hosted on [26]github with 121 contributors.
   htk started its life at cambridge university in 1989, was commercial
   for some time, but is now licenced back to cambridge and is not
   available as open source software. while its latest version was updated
   in december of 2015, the prior release was in 2009. [27]julius has been
   in development since 1997 and had its last major release in september
   of 2016 with a somewhat active [28]github repo consisting of three
   contributors, which again is unlikely to reflect reality. isip was the
   first state-of-the-art open source id103 system, and
   originated from mississippi state. it was developed mostly from 1996 to
   1999, with its last release in 2011, but the project was mostly defunct
   before the emergence of github.^[29]1

   comparison chart of github interest for id103 toolkits

   community: here we looked at both mailing and discussion lists and the
   community of developers involved. cmu sphinx has online discussion
   forums and active interest in its repos. however, we wonder if the
   duplication of repos in both sourceforge and github are blocking more
   widespread contribution. in comparison, kaldi has both forums and
   mailing lists as well as an active github repo. htk has mailing lists
   but no open repository. the user forum link on the julius web site is
   broken but there may be more information on the japanese site. isip is
   primarily targeted for educational purposes and the mailing list
   archives are no longer functional.

   tutorials and examples: cmu sphinx has very readable, thorough, and
   easy to follow documentation; kaldi   s documentation is also
   comprehensive but a bit harder to follow in my opinion. however, kaldi
   does cover both the phonetic and deep learning approaches to speech
   recognition. if you are not familiar with id103, htk   s
   tutorial documentation (available to registered users) gives a good
   overview to the field, in addition to documentation on actual design
   and use of the system. the julius project is focused on japanese, and
   the most current documentation is in japanese^[30]2, but they also are
   actively translating to english and provide that documentation as well;
   there are some examples of running id103 [31]here.
   finally, the isip project has some documentation, but is a little more
   difficult to navigate.

   trained models: even though a main reason to use these open or free
   tools is because you want to train specialized recognition models, it
   is a big advantage when you can speak to the system out of the box. cmu
   sphinx includes english and many [32]other models ready to use, with
   the documentation for connecting to them with python included right in
   the [33]github readme. kaldi   s instructions for decoding with existing
   models is hidden deep in the documentation, but we eventually
   discovered a model trained on some part of an english voxforge dataset
   in the egs/voxforge subdirectory of the repo, and recognition can be
   done by running the script in the online-data subdirectory. we didn   t
   dig as deeply into the other three packages, but they all come with at
   least simple models or appear to be compatible with the format provided
   on the [34]voxforge site, a fairly active crowdsourced repository of
   id103 data and trained models.

   in the future, we will discuss how to get started using cmu sphinx. we
   also plan to follow up on our earlier deep learning post with one that
   applies neural networks to speech, and will compare the neural net   s
   recognition performance to that of cmu sphinx. in the meantime, we
   always love feedback and questions on our blog posts, so let us know if
   you have additional perspective on these toolkits or others.
