   by [41]matthew mayo, kdnuggets.

   data preparation, cleaning, pre-processing, cleansing, wrangling.
   whatever term you choose, they refer to a roughly related set of
   pre-modeling data activities in the machine learning, data mining, and
   data science communities.

                            data prep in crisp-dm
                 data preparation in the [42]crisp-dm model.

   for example, the all-knowing wikipedia defines [43]data cleansing as:

     ...is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt
     or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and
     refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or
     irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or
     deleting the dirty or coarse data. data cleansing may be performed
     interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing
     through scripting.

   [44]data wrangling, for comparison, is defined by wikipedia as:

     ...the process of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw"
     form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption
     of the data with the help of semi-automated tools. this may include
     further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a
     statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. data
     munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which
     begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source,
     "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing
     the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the
     resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.

   while i would first point out that i am not thrilled with the term
   "[45]data sink," i would go on to say that it is "identifying
   incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and
   then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data" in the
   context of "mapping data from one 'raw' form into another..." all the
   way up to "training a statistical model" which i like to think of data
   preparation as encompassing, or "everything from data sourcing right up
   to, but not including, model building." that is the
   vague-yet-oddly-precise definition we'll move forward with.

   keep in mind, however, that this article covers one particular set of
   data preparation techniques, and additional, or completely different,
   techniques may be used in a given circumstance, based on requirements.
   you should find that the prescription held herein is one which is both
   orthodox and general in approach.


step 1: preparing for the preparation


   first, let's stress what everyone else has already told you: it could
   be argued that this data preparation phase is not a preliminary step
   prior to a machine learning task, but actually an integral component
   (or even a majority) of what a typical machine learning task would
   encompass. for our purposes, however, we will separate the data
   preparation from the modeling as its own regimen.

   as python is the ecosystem, much of what we will cover will be
   [46]pandas related. for the uninitiated, pandas is a data manipulation
   and analysis library, is one of the cornerstones of the python
   scientific programming stack, and is a great fit for many of the tasks
   associated with data preparation.

   data preparation can be seen in the crisp-dm model shown above (though
   it can be reasonably argued that "data understanding" falls within our
   definition as well). we can also equate our data preparation with the
   framework of the kdd process -- specifically the first 3 major steps --
   which are selection, preprocessing, and transformation. we can break
   these down into finer granularity, but at a macro level, these steps of
   the kdd process encompass what data wrangling is.

                                 kdd process
                              the kdd process.

   while readers should be able to follow this guide with few additional
   resources, for those interested in a more holistic take on pandas,
   helpful information can be found in the following:
     * [47]10 minutes to pandas, pandas documentation
     * [48]intro to pandas data structures, by greg reda
     * [49]modern pandas (in 7 parts), by tom augspurger

   for some feedback on the data preparation process from 3 insiders --
   sebastian raschka, clare bernard, and joe boutros -- read this
   interview before moving on:
     * [50]data preparation tips, tricks, and tools: an interview with the
       insiders, by matthew mayo


step 2: exploratory data analysis


   [51]exploratory data analysis (eda) is an integral aspect of any
   greater data analysis, data science, or machine learning project.
   understanding data before working with it isn't just a pretty good
   idea, it is a priority if you plan on accomplishing anything of
   consequence. in her article [52]the value of exploratory data analysis,
   chloe mawer explains:

     at a high level, eda is the practice of using visual and
     quantitative methods to understand and summarize a dataset without
     making any assumptions about its contents. it is a crucial step to
     take before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling
     because it provides the context needed to develop an appropriate
     model for the problem at hand and to correctly interpret its
     results.

   the basic gist is that we need to know the makeup of our data before we
   can effectively select predictive algorithms or map out the remaining
   steps of our data preparation. throwing our dataset at the hottest
   algorithm and hoping for the best is not a strategy.

   knowing our requirements are also important: if having a human-readable
   output is a high priority in order reason our results, using a neural
   network is likely not going to cut it. a decision tree may be not
   provide the highest classification accuracy in a given scenario, but
   perhaps any such sacrifice in accuracy would be acceptable in exchange
   for a decipherable process (and cue the hate mail).

   chloe states that eda usually involves a combination of the following
   methods:
     * univariate visualization of and summary statistics for each field
       in the raw dataset
     * bivariate visualization and summary statistics for assessing the
       relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target
       variable of interest (e.g. time until churn, spend)
     * multivariate visualizations to understand interactions between
       different fields in the data
     * id84 to understand the fields in the data that
       account for the most variance between observations and allow for
       the processing of a reduced volume of data
     * id91 of similar observations in the dataset into
       differentiated groupings, which by collapsing the data into a few
       small data points, patterns of behavior can be more easily
       identified

   it should be noted that her article stresses the importance of
   visualization in the eda process, as opposed to simple summarization
   alone. also, we won't spend much time on the more advanced aspects of
   eda (id84 & id91 of observations) in this
   step, as i hope to write something more in-depth on these topics in the
   near future.

   for a more complete overview of why eda is important (and often not
   given its fair credit), [53]read chloe's article.

                                  eda iris
     an excerpt of a distribution visualization of the [54]iris dataset.

   for an example exploratory data analysis process as applied to the
   titanic dataset, read:
     * [55]titanic eda, by tarek dib

   to get an idea of using [56]seaborn, a statistical data visualization
   library, to visualize a dataset distribution see:
     * [57]visualizing the distribution of a dataset, seaborn
       documentation

   a pair of additional libraries which may be useful for data
   exploration:

       epstein
     * [59]pandas-profiling - create html profiling reports from pandas
       dataframe objects, by jos polfliet

   for a quick word on categorical data, see the following:

     * [61]generating a wordcloud in python, by andreas mueller


step 3: dealing with missing values


   there are all sorts of strategies for dealing with missing data, and
   none of them are applicable universally. some people will say "never
   use instances which include empty values." others will argue "never use
   an attribute's mean value to replace missing values." conversely, you
   may hear more complex methods endorsed wholesale, such as "only first
   id91 a dataset into the number of known classes and then using
   intra-cluster regression to calculate missing values is valid."

   listen to none of this. "never" and "only" and other inflexible
   assertions hold no value in the nuanced world of data finessing;
   different types of data and processes suggest different best practices
   for dealing with missing values. however, since this type of knowledge
   is both experience and domain based, we will focus on the more basic
   strategies which can be employed.

                                missing piece
                 another one of those pesky missing values.

   some common methods for dealing with missing values include:
     * dropping instances
     * dropping attributes
     * imputing the attribute mean for all missing values
     * imputing the attribute median for all missing values
     * imputing the attribute mode for all missing values
     * using regression to impute attribute missing values

   as mentioned above, clearly the type of modeling methods being employed
   will have an effect on your decision -- for example, id90 are
   not amenable to missing values. additionally, you could technically
   entertain any statistical method you could think of for determining
   missing values from the dataset, but the listed approaches are tried,
   tested, and commonly used approaches.

   as our discussion here is python and pandas based, here is relevant
   information:
     * [62]working with missing data, pandas documentation
     * [63]pandas.dataframe.fillna, pandas documentation

   there are a lot of ways to accomplish filling missing values in a
   pandas dataframe with what it is you want them replaced with. here are
   a few basic examples:

   for some additional views on dealing with missing values, particularly
   imputation, see:
