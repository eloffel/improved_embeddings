25 questions to test a data scientist on support vector machines

   [96]ankit gupta, october 5, 2017

introduction

   you can think of machine learning algorithms as an armory packed with
   axes, sword and blades. you have various tools, but you ought to learn
   to use them at the right time. as an analogy, think of    regression    as
   a sword capable of slicing and dicing data efficiently, but incapable
   of dealing with highly complex data. on the contrary,    support vector
   machines    is like a sharp knife     it works on smaller datasets, but on
   them, it can be much more stronger and powerful in building models.

   this skilltest was specially designed for you to test your knowledge on
   id166 techniques and its applications. more than 550 people registered
   for the test. if you are one of those who missed out on this skill
   test, here are the questions and solutions.

   here is the [97]leaderboard for the participants who took the test.


helpful resources

   here are some resources to get in depth knowledge in the subject.
     * [98]essentials of machine learning algorithms (with python and r
       codes)
     * [99]understanding support vector machine algorithm from examples
       (along with code)


skill test questions and answers

   question context: 1     2

   suppose you are using a linear id166 classifier with 2 class
   classification problem. now you have been given the following data in
   which some points are circled red that are representing support
   vectors.

   1) if you remove the following any one red points from the data. does
   the decision boundary will change?

   a) yes
   b) no

   solution: a

   these three examples are positioned such that removing any one of them
   introduces slack in the constraints. so the decision boundary would
   completely change.


   2) [true or false] if you remove the non-red circled points from the
   data, the decision boundary will change?

   a) true
   b) false

   solution: b

   on the other hand, rest of the points in the data won   t affect the
   decision boundary much.


   3) what do you mean by generalization error in terms of the id166?

   a) how far the hyperplane is from the support vectors
   b) how accurately the id166 can predict outcomes for unseen data
   c) the threshold amount of error in an id166

   solution: b

   generalisation error in statistics is generally the out-of-sample error
   which is the measure of how accurately a model can predict values for
   previously unseen data.


   4) when the c parameter is set to infinite, which of the following
   holds true?

   a) the optimal hyperplane if exists, will be the one that completely
   separates the data
   b) the soft-margin classifier will separate the data
   c) none of the above

   solution: a

   at such a high level of misclassification penalty, soft margin will not
   hold existence as there will be no room for error.


   5) what do you mean by a hard margin?

   a) the id166 allows very low error in classification
   b) the id166 allows high amount of error in classification
   c) none of the above

   solution: a

   a hard margin means that an id166 is very rigid in classification and
   tries to work extremely well in the training set, causing overfitting.


   6) the minimum time complexity for training an id166 is o(n2). according
   to this fact, what sizes of datasets are not best suited for id166   s?

   a) large datasets
   b) small datasets
   c) medium sized datasets
   d) size does not matter

   solution: a

   datasets which have a clear classification boundary will function best
   with id166   s.


   7) the effectiveness of an id166 depends upon:

   a) selection of kernel
   b) kernel parameters
   c) soft margin parameter c
   d) all of the above

   solution: d

   the id166 effectiveness depends upon how you choose the basic 3
   requirements mentioned above in such a way that it maximises your
   efficiency, reduces error and overfitting.


   8) support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision
   surface.

   a) true
   b) false

   solution: a

   they are the points closest to the hyperplane and the hardest ones to
   classify. they also have a direct bearing on the location of the
   decision surface.


   9) the id166   s are less effective when:

   a) the data is linearly separable
   b) the data is clean and ready to use
   c) the data is noisy and contains overlapping points

   solution: c

   when the data has noise and overlapping points, there is a problem in
   drawing a clear hyperplane without misclassifying.


   10) suppose you are using rbf kernel in id166 with high gamma value. what
   does this signify?

   a) the model would consider even far away points from hyperplane for
   modeling
   b) the model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for
   modeling
   c) the model would not be affected by distance of points from
   hyperplane for modeling
   d) none of the above

   solution: b

   the gamma parameter in id166 tuning signifies the influence of points
   either near or far away from the hyperplane.

   for a low gamma, the model will be too constrained and include all
   points of the training dataset, without really capturing the shape.

   for a higher gamma, the model will capture the shape of the dataset
   well.


   11) the cost parameter in the id166 means:

   a) the number of cross-validations to be made
   b) the kernel to be used
   c) the tradeoff between misclassification and simplicity of the model
   d) none of the above

   solution: c

   the cost parameter decides how much an id166 should be allowed to    bend   
   with the data. for a low cost, you aim for a smooth decision surface
   and for a higher cost, you aim to classify more points correctly. it is
   also simply referred to as the cost of misclassification.


   12)

   suppose you are building a id166 model on data x. the data x can be error
   prone which means that you should not trust any specific data point too
   much. now think that you want to build a id166 model which has quadratic
   id81 of polynomial degree 2 that uses slack variable c as
   one of it   s hyper parameter. based upon that give the answer for
   following question.

   what would happen when you use very large value of c(c->infinity)?

   note: for small c was also classifying all data points correctly

   a) we can still classify data correctly for given setting of hyper
   parameter c
   b) we can not classify data correctly for given setting of hyper
   parameter c
   c) can   t say
   d) none of these

   solution: a

   for large values of c, the penalty for misclassifying points is very
   high, so the decision boundary will perfectly separate the data if
   possible.


   13) what would happen when you use very small c (c~0)?

   a) misclassification would happen
   b) data will be correctly classified
   c) can   t say
   d) none of these

   solution: a

   the classifier can maximize the margin between most of the points,
   while misclassifying a few points, because the penalty is so low.


   14) if i am using all features of my dataset and i achieve 100%
   accuracy on my training set, but ~70% on validation set, what should i
   look out for?

   a) underfitting
   b) nothing, the model is perfect
   c) overfitting

   solution: c

   if we   re achieving 100% training accuracy very easily, we need to check
   to verify if we   re overfitting our data.


   15) which of the following are real world applications of the id166?

   a) text and hypertext categorization
   b) image classification
   c) id91 of news articles
   d) all of the above

   solution: d

   id166   s are highly versatile models that can be used for practically all
   real world problems ranging from regression to id91 and
   handwriting recognitions.


   question context: 16     18

   suppose you have trained an id166 with linear decision boundary after
   training id166, you correctly infer that your id166 model is under fitting.

   16) which of the following option would you more likely to consider
   iterating id166 next time?

   a) you want to increase your data points
   b) you want to decrease your data points
   c) you will try to calculate more variables
   d) you will try to reduce the features

   solution: c

   the best option here would be to create more features for the model.


   17) suppose you gave the correct answer in previous question. what do
   you think that is actually happening?

   1. we are lowering the bias
   2. we are lowering the variance
   3. we are increasing the bias
   4. we are increasing the variance

   a) 1 and 2
   b) 2 and 3
   c) 1 and 4
   d) 2 and 4

   solution: c

   better model will lower the bias and increase the variance


   18) in above question suppose you want to change one of it   s(id166)
   hyperparameter so that effect would be same as previous questions i.e
   model will not under fit?

   a) we will increase the parameter c
   b) we will decrease the parameter c
   c) changing in c don   t effect
   d) none of these

   solution: a

   increasing c parameter would be the right thing to do here, as it will
   ensure regularized model


   19) we usually use feature id172 before using the gaussian
   kernel in id166. what is true about feature id172?

   1. we do feature id172 so that new feature will dominate other
   2. some times, feature id172 is not feasible in case of
   categorical variables
   3. feature id172 always helps when we use gaussian kernel in
   id166

   a) 1
   b) 1 and 2
   c) 1 and 3
   d) 2 and 3

   solution: b

   statements one and two are correct.


   question context: 20-22

   suppose you are dealing with 4 class classification problem and you
   want to train a id166 model on the data for that you are using one-vs-all
   method. now answer the below questions?

   20) how many times we need to train our id166 model in such case?

   a) 1
   b) 2
   c) 3
   d) 4

   solution: d

   for a 4 class problem, you would have to train the id166 at least 4 times
   if you are using a one-vs-all method.


   21) suppose you have same distribution of classes in the data. now, say
   for training 1 time in one vs all setting the id166 is taking 10 second.
   how many seconds would it require to train one-vs-all method end to
   end?

   a) 20
   b) 40
   c) 60
   d) 80

   solution: b

   it would take 10  4 = 40 seconds


   22) suppose your problem has changed now. now, data has only 2 classes.
   what would you think how many times we need to train id166 in such case?

   a) 1
   b) 2
   c) 3
   d) 4

   solution: a

   training the id166 only one time would give you appropriate results


   question context: 23     24

   suppose you are using id166 with linear kernel of polynomial degree 2,
   now think that you have applied this on data and found that it
   perfectly fit the data that means, training and testing accuracy is
   100%.

   23) now, think that you increase the complexity(or degree of polynomial
   of this kernel). what would you think will happen?

   a) increasing the complexity will overfit the data
   b) increasing the complexity will underfit the data
   c) nothing will happen since your model was already 100% accurate
   d) none of these

   solution: a

   increasing the complexity of the data would make the algorithm overfit
   the data.


   24) in the previous question after increasing the complexity you found
   that training accuracy was still 100%. according to you what is the
   reason behind that?

   1. since data is fixed and we are fitting more polynomial term or
   parameters so the algorithm starts memorizing everything in the data
   2. since data is fixed and id166 doesn   t need to search in big hypothesis
   space

   a) 1
   b) 2
   c) 1 and 2
   d) none of these

   solution: c

   both the given statements are correct.


   25) what is/are true about kernel in id166?

   1. id81 map low dimensional data to high dimensional space
   2. it   s a similarity function

   a) 1
   b) 2
   c) 1 and 2
   d) none of these

   solution: c

   both the given statements are correct.

            initially, it is known that there is a underfitting situation.
            and solution of 16th question suggest that underfitting can be
            reduced by introducing more variables in the model. that means
            model will become more complex if we introduce variables and
            in such case we can say that we are reducing the bias and
            increasing the variance.

       for question 19, the third option seems true as well because the
       gaussian kernel in id166 is a similarity function and so the scale of
       the features influences the classifier significantly. can you
       please comment on this?

       answer to question 1 is wrong, but only because the question is
       worded incorrectly. right now, it asks if the classification
       boundary will change if all circled points are removed. the answer
       provided assumes only 1 point is removed. the solution provided is
       only correct if the question was re-written to say,    will the
       classification boundary change if one or two of the circled points
       are removed?
