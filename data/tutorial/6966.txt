data analysis in python: interactive confusion matrix with facets dive,
pandas, scikit-learn

   [49]jan pomik  lek 2017-10-28[50] machine learning, [51]open source[52]
   2 comments

   the [53]facets project by google   s    people+ai research initiative   
   (pair) offers two open source visualization tools for data analytics    
   facets overview and facets dive. today, we are going to look at facets
   dive and demonstrate how to use it for an interactive confusion matrix
   for a multiclass classification problem using python, pandas and
   scikit-learn.

setup

   there are two distinct phases to using facets dive: creating an
   analysis, and then sharing it with other people. today we   ll look at
   creating interactive display widgets, and leave the    sharing    part for
   the next post.

   facets dive can be installed as a jupyter notebook extension. setting
   things up is straightforward     the facets project page has pleasantly
   [54]clear instructions.

interactive example

   so, let   s see facets dive in action, on a simple machine learning
   experiment. we   ll build a multiclass classifier on 20newsgroups with
   scikit-learn, put all test set predictions into a pandas dataframe, and
   finally display an interactive confusion matrix that lets you inspect
   each individual error:

   [56]https://rare-technologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/facets_div
   e_20newsgroups-widget_only.html

   if the facets dive widget above is too cramped on your monitor,
   [57]click here to open it in a new full-width browser window.

   the cool thing about this visualization is that it   s not a static image
   or screenshot! it   s fully interactive. click on any individual data
   point (=one 20newsgroups email) inside the confusion matrix in the
   middle, and see the email details appear in the pink pane on the right.

   this makes error analysis and sanity checking of the predictions a
   breeze. see those emails that were expected to be rec.autos, but were
   predicted as misc.forsale? now you can easily see why.

   such visual insights make it clearer what steps are necessary to
   improve your classifier performance (here: better data cleanup, since
   the classifier was essentially correct, or even rethinking the task
   assumption that each email belongs to exactly one category, which is
   clearly violated in a number of cases).

   you will probably note that only 8 (out of 20) labels are displayed in
   both rows and columns. the remaining 12 are grouped under    other   . this
   helps to keep the visualization uncluttered. on the other hand, the
   confusion matrix may get somewhat distorted. facets dive always
   displays the most common (frequent) labels. if the most frequent
   predicted labels are different from the most frequent expected labels
   (as in our case), we don   t get a clean alignment of rows and columns.

   try dragging the blue sliders in the faceting pane until it shows the
   full list of labels, so you see the complete confusion matrix. if the
   number of labels is reasonable (or your monitor large enough), this is
   the best way to display and inspect the model predictions.

   the downside of showing a full set of labels is that the matrix may not
   fit on the screen. here   s what it looks like in our case (showing only
   the top 12 facet rows).

summary

   facets dive is a simple yet powerful data visualization tool that will
   save you a lot of time analyzing errors in data experiments, or
   communicating your results to stakeholders     concretely and visually.
   the animated regrouping of data points when sliding parameters gets
   extra points during presentations. i have used it in several projects
   here in rare and absolutely love it.

   a facets dive widget can be easily embedded into any web page, as shown
   above. it can even be sent as a single-file attachment through email to
   your colleagues or boss. no python or obscure dependency installations
   required! such simple    deployment    and hassle-free sharing of results
   is a super practical, if often overlooked, feature and we   ll cover how
   to do it with facets dive in part 2 next week. edit: [58]part 2 is
   here!
