   the suggested upper merged ontology (sumo) and its domain ontologies
   form the largest formal public ontology in existence today. they are
   being used for research and applications in search, linguistics and
   reasoning. sumo is the only formal ontology that has been mapped to all
   of the [8]id138 lexicon. sumo is written in the [9]suo-kif language.
   sumo is free and owned by the ieee. the ontologies that extend sumo are
   available under [10]gnu general public license. [11]adam pease is the
   technical editor of sumo.

   features
     * [12]mappings to all of id138
     * [13]language generation templates for hindi, chinese, italian,
       german, czech and english
     * tools for browsing, editing, inferencing and nlp with sumo are
       found in the sigmakee ([14]source, [15]api, [16]docker image) and
       sigmanlp ([17]source, [18]api, [19]docker image) systems
     * largest free, formal ontology available, with ~25,000 terms and
       ~80,000 axioms when all domain ontologies are combined. these
       consist of [20]sumo itself, the [21]mid-level ontology (milo), and
       ontologies of [22]communications, [23]countries and regions,
       [24]distributed computing and [25]user interfaces, [26]economy,
       [27]finance, [28]automobiles and [29]engineering components,
       [30]food, [31]dining, [32]sports, [33]shopping catalogs and
       [34]hotels, [35]geography, [36]government and [37]justice,
       [38]language taxonomy, [39]law, [40]media and [41]music, military
       ([42]general, [43]devices, [44]processes, [45]people), [46]north
       american industrial classification system, [47]people and their
       [48]emotions, [49]physical elements, [50]transnational issues,
       [51]transportation and its [52]details, [53]viruses, [54]weather,
       [55]world airports, and [56]weapons of mass destruction. see also a
       large amount of instance content from dbpedia about [57]people and
       the [58]yago, project which includes millions of facts from
       wikipedia merged with sumo, and an initial merge of the mondial
       [59]geographical data with sumo. the open biomedical ontologies are
       lightly [60]mapped to sumo. additional ontologies of terrorism are
       available on request.
     * richly axiomatized, not just a taxonomy. all terms are formally
       defined. meanings are not dependent on a particular id136
       implementation.

   documentation and other resources
     * an introductory [61]talk, [62]podcasts and a [63]blog about sumo
       and sigma
     * some good [64]examples that show why simple search isn't enough and
       that we need id136 to synthesize information from multiple
       sources
     * look at [65]historical versions of sumo
     * we ask that people working with sumo cite our [66]primary paper and
       [67]book in any publications
     * [68]conformance testing for sumo
     * translation of [69]sumo into owl and [70]id138 3.0 in owl
     * id138 in [71]tptp format
     * some thoughts on an ontology development [72]process and ontology
       development [73]pitfalls
     * an introduction to [74]resolution theorem proving
     * [75]frequently asked questions
     * a [76]word sense frequency analysis based on id138 semcor that
       can be used for simple id51. this was done on
       wn 1.6 but could be rerun with the [77]automatic remappings to 2.0
     * a [78]very big graph of the taxonomy in sumo v 1.75 (too big to
       display in a browser, download and view in a drawing application)
