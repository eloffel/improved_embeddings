reference implementation of recursive cortical network (rcn)

   reference implementation of a two-level rcn model on mnist
   classification. see the science article "a generative vision model that
   trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based captchas" and
   [79]vicarious blog for details.

     note: this is an unoptimized reference implementation and is not
     intended for production.

setup

   note: python 2.7 is supported. the code was tested on osx 10.11. it may
   work on other system platforms but not guaranteed.

   before starting please make sure gcc is installed (brew install gcc)
   and up to date in order to compile the various dependencies
   (particularly numpy).

   clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/vicariousinc/science_rcn.git

   simple install:
cd science_rcn
make

   manual install (setting up a virtual environment beforehand is
   recommended):
cd science_rcn
python setup.py install

run

   if you installed via make you need to activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

   to run a small unit test that trains and tests on 20 mnist images using
   one cpu (takes ~2 minutes, accuracy is ~60%):
python science_rcn/run.py

   to run a slightly more interesting experiment that trains on 100 images
   and tests on 20 mnist images using multiple cpus (takes <1 min using 7
   cpus, accuracy is ~90%):
python science_rcn/run.py --train_size 100 --test_size 20 --parallel

   to test on the full 10k mnist test set, training on 1000 examples
   (could take hours depending on the number of available cpus, average
   accuracy is ~97.7+%):
python science_rcn/run.py --full_test_set --train_size 1000 --parallel --pool_sh
ape 25 --perturb_factor 2.0

datasets

   we used the following datasets for the science paper:

   captcha datasets
     * [81]recaptcha (from [82]google.com)
     * [83]botdetect (from [84]captcha.com)
     * [85]paypal (from [86]paypal.com)
     * [87]yahoo (from [88]yahoo.com)

   mnist datasets
     * original (available at [89]http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
     * [90]with occlusions (by us)
     * [91]with noise (by us)

mnist licensing

   yann lecun (courant institute, nyu) and corinna cortes (google labs,
   new york) hold the copyright of mnist dataset, which is a derivative
   work from original nist datasets. mnist dataset is made available under
   the terms of the creative commons attribution-share alike 3.0 license.
