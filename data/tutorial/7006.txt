   [1]view on github

this repo contains the tensorflow implementation of the paper    [2]question
answering on knowledge bases and text using universal schema and memory
networks   .

dependencies

     * tensorflow <= 0.12

training

   i have set up training with most default params on a very small dataset
   so that it is easier to get started. just running the script should
   work.
/bin/bash run.sh ./config.sh

data

   the processed data (train/dev/test split) is stored in data_formatted/
   directory. to download the kb files used for the project run,
sh get_data.sh

   after downloading the data, you will have to change the appropriate
   entries in the config.sh file (kb_file and text_kb_file).

pretrained embeddings

   the embeddings used for initializing the network can be downloaded from
   [3]here

model outputs

   we are also releasing the output predictions of our model for
   comparison. find them in the model_outputs directory.

trained model

   we are also sharing our pretrained model. get it [4]here. the following
   will load the model and get the answers from the dev set. please change
   the config appropriately.
sh run.sh ./test_from_saved_model.sh
