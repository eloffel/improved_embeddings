   code for paper [5]chains of reasoning over entities, relations, and
   text using recurrent neural networks

abstract

   our goal is to combine the rich multistep id136 of symbolic logical
   reasoning with the generalization capabilities of neural networks. we
   are particularly interested in complex reasoning about entities and
   relations in text and large-scale knowledge bases (kbs). this paper
   proposes three significant modeling advances: (1) we learn to jointly
   reason about relations, entities, and entity-types; (2) we use neural
   attention modeling to incorporate multiple paths; (3) we learn to share
   strength in a single id56 that represents logical composition across all
   relations. on a largescale freebase+clueweb prediction task, we achieve
   25% error reduction, and a 53% error reduction on sparse relations due
   to shared strength. on chains of reasoning in id138 we reduce error
   in mean quantile by 84% versus previous state-of-the-art.

instructions for running the code

data

   get the data from [11]here. (note: this might change soon, as i will
   release an updated version of the dataset)

   to get the correct format to run the models,
cd data
/bin/bash make_data_format.sh <path_to_input_data> <output_dir>

   for example you can run,
cd data
/bin/bash make_data_format.sh examples/data_small_input examples/data_small_outp
ut

model

   to start training, first checkout [12]run_scripts/config.sh. this
   defines all the hyperparams and other inputs to the network. after
   specifying model parameters, to start training run,
cd run_sripts
/bin/bash train.sh ./config.sh
