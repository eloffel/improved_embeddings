                            the clueweb12 dataset

   the clueweb12 dataset was created to support research on information
   retrieval and related human language technologies. the dataset consists
   of 733,019,372 english web pages, collected between february 10, 2012
   and may 10, 2012. clueweb12 is a companion or successor to the
   [23]clueweb09 web dataset. distribution of clueweb12 began in january
   2013.


   information about the progress of the clueweb12 dataset is available
   [24]here.


exploring the clueweb12 dataset

   if you have login credentials for the [25]clueweb09 dataset, you may
   use them for logging into the [26]clueweb12-b13 search engine until
   january 31, 2014. after february 1, 2014, to use this service, you will
   need to have signed a clueweb12 data license agreement with carnegie
   mellon university. there is no charge to use the lemur project's
   clueweb12 online services (see below). if you need login credentials,
   please contact [27]jamie callan.


obtaining a copy of the clueweb12 dataset

   the clueweb12 datasets are distributed by carnegie mellon university
   for research purposes only. a dataset may be obtained from carnegie
   mellon by signing a data license agreement with carnegie mellon
   university, and paying a fee that covers the cost of distributing the
   dataset.

   the process for obtaining a clueweb12 dataset is described below. this
   process takes two weeks. please allow enough time. we do not have the
   power to hurry the university administrators that must approve your
   license.
    1. sign an [28]organizational agreement . this agreement must be
       signed by a person with the authority to sign agreements on behalf
       of your organization. the person signing must also initial each
       page of the agreement on the bottom right corner.
       the organizational data license typically applies to a single
       research group or unit within a larger legal entity. for example,
       in a university, the organizational license might apply to a
       research group consisting of a few professors, and the students and
       staff doing research with them. in this case, the organization
       would be the name of the research group (e.g., the information
       retrieval laboratory), and the corporation/legal entity would be
       the name of the university.
    2. send the complete copy (all six pages) of the signed organizational
       agreement to jess maguire at the language technologies institute.
       the preferred method of sending the signed organization agreement
       is to scan it into a pdf and email it to jess
       (jlm4 at andrew dot cmu dot edu). if you cannot send a pdf, you can
       fax the agreement. the fax number is +1 412-268-6298. if you choose
       to fax the organizational agreement, please notify jess by email
       (jlm4 at andrew dot cmu dot edu) so that we know to look for your
       fax.
    3. provide order information to jess maguire by email or fax:
         1. which version of the dataset you want: the full dataset or the
            "trec 2013 category b" subset;
         2. which type of invoice you want: pdf (fast) or paper (slow);
         3. mail and email address to which the invoice should be sent;
         4. mailing address and telephone number to which the datasets
            should be sent (fedex requires both the shipping address and
            telephone number);
         5. preferred shipping method (1 day, 3 day, 1 week); and
         6. method of payment (wire transfer, check, credit card).
    4. we will send you an email confirmation that we have received your
       order.
    5. we will send you an invoice for payment, by mail and/or email. the
       costs of each dataset are shown below.
