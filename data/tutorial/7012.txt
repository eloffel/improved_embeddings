   in a previous article, i listed [11]10 cool deep learning projects
   based on [12]apache mxnet. well, here are 10 more, a nice mix of model
   implementations and applications.

   if you have an mxnet project that i haven   t listed to far, please get
   in touch!

model implementations

#1         densenet

   [13]bruinxiong/densenet.mxnet
   densenet.mxnet - a mxnet implementation of densenet (with bc
   structure)github.com

   this is an implementation of the densenet-bc architecture as described
   in the [14]densely connected convolutional networks, by by gao huang,
   zhuang liu, kilian q. weinberger and laurens van der maaten.

   this architecture contains shorter connections between layers close to
   the input and those close to the output. they help models train more
   efficiently and predict more accurately.

#2         binary neural networks

   [15]hpi-xnor/bmxnet
   contribute to bmxnet development by creating an account on
   github.github.com

   this project implement binary neural networks, as described in
   [16]bmxnet: an open-source binary neural network implementation based
   on mxnet by haojin yang, martin fritzsche, christian bartz and
   christoph meinel.

   these networks use weights are binary values! at the cost of minimal
   accuracy loss, these networks are both much smaller and much faster
   than their floating-point counterparts.

#3         mask r-id98 (image segmentation)

   [17]tusimple/mx-maskrid98
   mx-maskrid98 - an mxnet implementation of mask r-id98github.com

   this is an implementation of the mask r-id98 architecture, based on
   [18]the self-titled paper by kaiming he, georgia gkioxari, piotr doll  r
   and ross girshick

   this architecture is an evolution of fast r-id98 and does a very good
   job at object segmentation. if case you didn   t know, tusimple build
   [19]autonomous driving systems :)

#4         yolo9000 (id164)

   [20]zhreshold/mxnet-yolo
   mxnet-yolo         yolo: you only look once real-time object
   detectorgithub.com

   this project performs id164 based on the [21]yolo9000:
   better, faster, stronger research paper by joseph redmon and ali
   farhadi.

   at 40 frames per second, yolov2 gets 78.6 mean average precision,
      outperforming state-of-the-art methods like faster rid98 with resnet
   and ssd while still running significantly faster   .

#5    stn-ocr (text detection and text recognition)

   [22]bartzi/stn-ocr
   stn-ocr         code for the paper stn-ocr: a single neural network for text
   detection and text recognitiongithub.com

   this project implements the model described in [23]stn-ocr: a single
   neural network for text detection and text recognition, by christian
   bartz, haojin yang and christoph meinel.

applications

#6    head pose estimation

   [24]laodar/id98_head_pose_estimator
   id98_head_pose_estimator - a simple and fast mxnet version id98 based
   head pose estimatorgithub.com

   this model is a simple id98 that does a good job at detecting head
   poses.
   [1*styvgddtkdg4nr0tuwlokq.png]

#7         realtime multi-person pose estimation

   [25]dragonfly90/mxnet_realtime_multi-person_pose_estimation
   mxnet_realtime_multi-person_pose_estimation - this is a mxnet version
   of realtime_multi-person_pose_estimation, origin   github.com

   this project implements an mxnet version of the model described in
   [26]realtime multi-person 2d pose estimation using part affinity fields
   by zhe cao, tomas simon, shih-en wei and yaser sheikh.

   this is amazing.

#8         id31

   [27]sookinoby/sentiment-analysis2
   sentiment-analysis2 - sentiment ananlysis in keras and
   mxnetgithub.com

   this tutorial shows you how to build a id31 model , based
   on [28]convolutional neural networks for sentence classification by
   yoon kim. the author provides clear notebooks using both keras and
   mxnet. very nicely done!

#9 & #10    image detection on mobile

   [29]leliana/whatsthis
   contribute to whatsthis development by creating an account on
   github.github.com
   [30]pppoe/whatsthis-ios
   whatsthis-ios - mxnet whatthis example for iosgithub.com

   let   s not forget mobile application developers. these twin projects
   show you how to use an mxnet model in android and ios apps.

   that   s it for today. thanks for reading.
