   i started working with machine learning in the college, but i never
   went deeper (get it?) until learned about convolutional neural network
   (id98). at the beginning, i was a little confused about how id98 really
   works, how equal id98 was compared to a common neural network.

   in order to understand id98 in an easy way you have to know about neural
   network and how they work, because the idea of learning is the same in
   both cases. in a second moment, knowing what a convolution is and what
   it can do is the key to understand what   s happening inside the id98.

   i suppose that by being here reading this, you already know about a
   common neural network and how it works. in this way, let   s talk about
   convolution.

   [14]convolution is a mathematical operation that basically takes two
   functions (f and g) to produce a third one (f*g). the math behind this
   is pretty easy, in the way that if you know a little bit about integral
   you are ready to go (i will not enter into this math). there   s no
   physical meaning in the convolution operation, but i will show what it
   can do.

   in the context of id98, a convolution is the treatment of a matrix by
   another called kernel. this has been applied in image processing before
   the creation of id98. i believe that the gif below is well able to
   exemplify how this process occurs.

   in words, what happens is this: the kernel is moving in the input, from
   left to right and from top to bottom, and each one of the values on the
   kernel is multiplied by the value on the input on the same position.
   the results obtained by the multiplication are then summed and the
   local output is generated. let   s look the first position of the gif: we
   multiply and sum the values (0*7) + (-1*7) +(0*6) +(-1*7) +(5*7)
   +(-1*6) +(0*6) +(-1*6) +(0*4) and get the value 9. we move the kernel
   and repeat the process again to create all the output.

   this can be used for blurring, embossing, edge detection and much more.
   let   s take one picture and apply some kernels to obtain something easy
   to understand. i took a picture of my little friend batman and applied
   3 kernels, as we can see:

   convolution edge enhance
   [1*qrpdkdbkx3sqdkvwfqjuxa.png]
   convolution edge detect

   this is very nice, right? with one picture and one kernel, we can
   create something that can be useful for us. but there are some
   questions that we have to ask: what will happen if we don   t know what
   kind of kernel that can lead us to our goal? how many kernels are
   necessary to extract information that we need to our goal?

   id98 works exactly on top of that. if you have a classification problem,
   the id98 will learn a group of kernels that can give you the information
   that you need to get in your goal. this way, the learning process
   learns kernels that are useful to the problem of classification. in
   this learning process, we can discover kernels that are good in
   extracting relevant information to the problem.

   finally, we can then say that id98 is not a 7-headed monster or a magic
   trick, it is just math. i hope this text can help someone who is lost
   as i was.

   cheers :d
