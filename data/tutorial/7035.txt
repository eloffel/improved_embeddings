simple. adaptive. neural.

   we think that artificial intelligence is going to be the next big thing
   in our nearby future. it will bring humanity to a new era of access and
   organization of information. language translation is probably the most
   complex of the human tasks for a machine to learn but it is also the
   one with the greatest potential to make the world a single family.

   with this project we want to give our contribution to the evolution of
   machine translation toward singularity. we want to consolidate the
   current state of the art into a single easy to use product, evolve it
   and keeping it an open to integrate the greatest opportunities in
   machine intelligence like deep learning.

   to achieve our goals we need a better mt technology that is able to
   extract more from data, adapt to context and be easy to deploy. we know
   that the challenge is big, but the reward is potentially so big that we
   think it is worth trying hard.

about moderid4

   moderid4 is a context-aware, incremental and distributed general
   purpose id4 technology based on tensorflow
   transformer model. moderid4 is:
     * easy to use and scale with respect to domains, data, and users.
     * trained by pooling all available projects/customers data and
       translation memories in one folder.
     * queried by providing the sentence to be translated and optionally
       some context text.

   moderid4 goal is to deliver the quality of multiple custom engines by
   adapting on the fly to the provided context.

   you can find more information on: [106]http://www.moderid4.eu

your first translation with moderid4

installation

   read [107]install.md

   the distribution includes a small dataset (folder examples/data/train)
   to train and test translations from english to italian in three
   domains.

create an engine

   we will now demonstrate how easy it is to train your first engine with
   mmt. please notice however that the provided training set is tiny and
   exclusively intended for this demo. if you wish to train a proper
   engine please follow the instructions provided in this guide:
   [108]create an engine from scratch.

   creating an engine in moderid4 is this simple:
$ ./mmt create en it examples/data/train --train-steps 6000

   this command will start a fast training process that will last
   approximately 30mins; not enough to achieve good translation
   performance, but enough to demonstrate its functioning.

start the engine

$ ./mmt start

   you can stop it with the command stop.

start translating

   let's now use the command-line tool mmt to query the engine with the
   sentence hello world and context computer:
$ ./mmt translate "this is an example"
si tratta di un esempio

   note: you can query mmt directly via rest api, to learn more on how to
   do it, visit the [109]translate api page in the project wiki.

how to import a tmx file

   importing a tmx file is very simple and fast. we will use again the
   command-line tool mmt:
$ ./mmt import -x /path/to/file.tmx
importing example... [========================================] 100.0% 00:35
import success

evaluating quality

   how is your engine performing vs the commercial state-of-the-art
   technologies?

   should i use google translate or moderid4 given this data?

   evaluate helps you answer these questions.

   before training, mmt has removed sentences corresponding to 1% of the
   training set (or up to 1200 lines at most). during evaluate these
   sentences are used to compute the blue score and matecat post-editing
   score against the mmt and google translate.

   with your engine running, just type:
./mmt evaluate

   the typical output will be
testing on 980 sentences...

matecat post-editing score:
  mmt              : 75.10 (winner)
  google translate : 73.40 | api limit exeeded | connection error

id7:
  mmt              : 37.50 (winner)
  google translate : 36.10 | api limit exeeded | connection error

translation speed:
  mmt              :  1.75s per sentence
  google translate :  0.76s per sentence


   if you want to test on a different test-set just type:
./mmt evaluate --path path/to/your/test-set

   notes: to run evaluate you need internet connection for google
   translate api and the matecat post-editing score api. mmt comes with a
   limited google translate api key.

   matecat kindly provides unlimited-fair-usage, access to their api to
   mmt users.

   you can select your google translate api key by typing:
./mmt evaluate --gt-key your_google_translate_api_key

   if you don't want to use google translate just type a random key.

what's next?

create an engine from scratch

   following this readme you have learned the basic usage of moderid4.
   most users would be interested in creating their own engine with their
   own data, you can find more info in the wiki [110]create an engine from
   scratch

see api documentation

   moderid4 comes with built-in rest api that allows the user to control
   every single feature of mmt via a simple and powerful interface. you
   can find the [111]api documentation in the [112]moderid4 wiki.

run moderid4 cluster

   you can setup a cluster of mmt nodes in order to load balancing
   translation requests. in fact also tuning and evaluation can be
   drastically speed-up if runned on an mmt cluster. you can learn more on
   the wiki page [113]mmt cluster.

use advanced configurations

   if you need to customize the properties and behaviour of your engines,
   you can specify advanced settings in their configuration files. you can
   learn how on the wiki page [114]advanced configurations

enterprise edition

   mmt community is free, is open source and welcomes contributions and
   donations. mmt community is sponsored by its funding members
   (translated, fbk, uedin and taus) and the european commission.

   we also have an mmt enterprise edition, managed by the mmt company and
   not available on github, with some extra features:
     * pre-trained generic and custom models in 45 language pairs (and
       more to come!) on multiple billion words of premium data.
     * support for cluster of servers for higher throughput, load
       balancing and high availability.
     * support for 71 files formats without format loss (office, adobe,
       localization, etc).
     * enterprise customer support via video conference call, phone and
       email on business hours (cet) and optionally 24x7.
     * custom developments billed per hour of work.
