state-of-the-art result for all machine learning problems

last update: 20th februray 2019

news: i am looking for a collaborator esp who does research in nlp, computer
vision and id23. if you are not a researcher, but you are
willing, contact me. email me: [68]yxt.stoaml@gmail.com

   this repository provides state-of-the-art (sota) results for all
   machine learning problems. we do our best to keep this repository up to
   date. if you do find a problem's sota result is out of date or missing,
   please raise this as an issue (with this information: research paper
   name, dataset, metric, source code and year). we will fix it
   immediately.

   you can also submit this [69]google form if you are new to github.

   this is an attempt to make one stop for all types of machine learning
   problems state of the art result. i can not do this alone. i need help
   from everyone. please submit the google form/raise an issue if you find
   sota result for a dataset. please share this on twitter, facebook, and
   other social media.
