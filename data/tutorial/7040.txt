   if you follow ai you might have heard about the advent of the
   potentially revolutionary id22. i will show you how you can
   start using them today.

   geoffrey hinton is known as the father of    deep learning.    back in the
   50s the idea of deep neural networks began to surface and, in theory,
   could solve a vast amount of problems. however, nobody was able to
   figure out how to train them and people started to give up. hinton
   didn   t give up and in 1986 showed that the idea of id26
   could train these deep nets. however, it wasn   t until 5 years ago in
   2012 that hinton was able to demostrate his breakthrough, because of
   the lack of computational power of the time. this breakthrough set the
   stage for this decade   s progress in ai.

   and now, on october 26, 2017, he has released a paper on a new
   groundbreaking concept, id22.

     note: for a deeper explanation on how capsules work check out
     [16]part 2. also, the research papers can be found [17]here and
     [18]here.

problems with traditional neural networks

   up until now convolutional neural networks (id98s) have been the
   state-of-the-art approach to classifying images.

   id98s work by accumulating sets of features at each layer. it starts of
   by finding edges, then shapes, then actual objects. however, the
   spatial relationship information of all these features is lost.

   this is a gross oversimplification, but you can think of a id98 like
   this:
if (2 eyes && 1 nose && 1 mouth) {
  it's a face!
}

   you might be thinking that this sounds pretty good, it makes sense, and
   it does. although, we might run into a few problems, take this picture
   of kim kardashian for example:
   [1*ix1qckelhektszuzafrgjg.png]

   yikes! there   s definitely two eyes, a nose and a mouth, but something
   is wrong, can you spot it? we can easily tell that an eye and her mouth
   are in the wrong place and that this isn   t what a person is supposed to
   look like. however, a well trained id98 has difficulty with this
   concept:
   [1*h-be4uj-a7n6_qx-k03kkq.png]

   in addition to being easily fooled by images with features in the wrong
   place a id98 is also easily confused when viewing an image in a
   different orientation. one way to combat this is with excessive
   training of all possible angles, but this takes a lot of time and seems
   counter intuitive. we can see here the massive drop in performance by
   simply flipping kim upside down:

   finally, convolutional neural networks can be susceptible to white box
   adversarial attacks. which is essentially embedding a secret pattern
   into an object to make it look like something else.

id22 to the rescue!

   architecture of capsnet

   the introduction of id22 gives us the ability to take full
   advantage of spatial relationship, so we can start to see things more
   like:
if (2 adjacent eyes && nose under eyes && mouth under nose) {
  it's a face!
}

   you should be able to see that with this definition our neural net
   shouldn   t be as easily fooled by our misshapen kardashian.

   this new architecture also achieves significantly better accuracy on
   the following data set. this data set was carefully designed to be a
   pure shape recognition task that shows the ability to recognize the
   objects even from different points of view. it beat out the
   state-of-the-art id98, reducing the number of errors by 45%.
   [1*ghnuo-a3vyj0qtqhxskgpw.png]
   capsnet was able to identify the bottom images were within the same
   category (animals, humans, airplanes, cars, trucks) as the correspoding
   top image far better than id98s.

   further more, in their most recent paper, they found that capsules show
   far more resistance to white box adversarial attack than a baseline
   convolutional neural network.

training capsnet

   i have pieced together a repo that is an implementation of hinton   s
   paper (many thanks to [21]naturomics). in order to use the capsule
   network model you first need to train it.

   the following guide will get you a model trained on the mnist data set.
   for those of you who don   t know, mnist is a data set of handwritten
   digits and is a good baseline for testing out machine learning
   algorithms.

   start by cloning the [22]repo:
git clone [23]https://github.com/bourdakos1/capsule-networks.git

   then install the requirements and download the dataset:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python download_data.py

   start training!
python main.py

   the mnist data set is 60,000 training images. by default the model will
   be trained for 50 epochs at a batch size of 128. an epoch is one full
   run through the training set. since the batch size is 128 it will do
   about 468 batches per epoch.

   note: training might take a very long time if you don   t have a gpu. you
   can read [24]this article on how to speed up training time.

making id136s

   once our model is fully trained we can test it by running the following
   command:
python main.py --is_training false

final thoughts

   id22 seem awesome, but they are still babies. we could see
   problems in the future when training huge datasets, but i have faith.

   if you enjoyed reading this and want more, there   s a [25]part 2!

   p.s. here is a great video that i recommend taking the time to watch.
