                                 page not found

   this file does not exist and there was no index.html found in the
   current directory or 404.html in the root directory.

why am i seeing this?

   you may have deployed the wrong directory for your application. check
   your firebase.json and make sure the public directory is pointing to a
   directory that contains an index.html file.

   you can also add a 404.html in the root of your site to replace this
   page with a custom error page.
