risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical and social benefits 
on a massive number of critically ill inpatients who exhibit adverse 
outcomes including, but not limited to, cardiac arrests, respiratory 
arrests, and septic shocks.

results reflect the importance of adopting the 
concepts of personalized medicine in critical 
care settings; significant accuracy and

for the patients' heterogeneity.
