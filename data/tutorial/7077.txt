posters   &   prizes  
  
the poster and exhibition sessions will be
held on monday and tuesday night. this is
  
a relaxed event, and the usual way in
  
  
  
which research is communicated at the
major machine learning conferences. we
  
encourage everyone to make the best
  
posters they can:  there will be prizes to
  
  
give away to posters and presenters that
shine. check your allocation (on the
  
website ,   or   at   the   end   of   this   programme).  
  
tutors  
  
  
several tutors are around to help with the
  
practicals. seek them out for help; you will
  
 for questions
see them in blue tshirts.
  
  
after the practicals, ask them on piazza
  
  
and   someone   is   sure   to   respond.  
  
piazza   q&a  
please ask as many questions as
  
possible! to make this easier, we have an
  
  
online question and answering tool called
piazza. you can ask questions, associate
  
  
them with speci c tutorials or practicals,
  
answer questions from other attendees
and get answers from the speakers. check

evening   events  

we   have   two   social   activities   for   everyone   at   the   indaba   to   get   to   know   each   other   better.  

these   are   inclusive   events   for   everyone   to   meet,   and   to   build   collaborations   and  

friendships.

deep   learning   indaba   2017  

be   the   talking   drums   of   africa   renewed:    

sharing   knowledge   beyond   the   indaba  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
we designed the deep learning indaba as a gathering of our african community to teach,
  
learn and debate the state-of-the-art in machine learning and arti cial intelligence. our
  
  
aim during the week will be to build an understanding of the principles and practice of
  
modern machine learning. of equal
importance is the creation of an environment that
  
  
enables continental collaborations, a raised awareness of the breadth of machine learning
     
  
career-paths,   and   that   fosters   new   understandings   and   friendships.

we leave the legacy of this indaba
to you, its participants. to each of
  
you we ask: take your experiences
  
and the lessons you will have learnt,
  
in your own
and replicate
  
  
  
universities, residences,
labs, and
  
of ces. spread your understanding
  
of machine learning as far as you
  
  
can. this is the way that you will
take ownership of the  eld; how
  
you will  strengthen african machine
  
  
learning .  
   
the indaba will host over 300 people, with representatives from 22 african countries,
  
  
comprising 33 african research institutions. but we received more than 750 applications.
  
for every person that will attend the indaba, there is more than one person who we could
not accommodate. this makes it critical for us to take our knowledge and experiences and
  
to   share   it   with   others.  
  
 to make this possible, all the  tutorials will be recorded and available online each day to
  
re-watch and share. the  practical material will be available for everyone to use, teach
  
  
from, and modify. we   ll be creating  new pages on our website with other useful resources
scholarship and funding opportunities, and
(including other
  
  
infrastructure resources). and a  machine learning and data science in africa network
  
  
mailing-list (join now)--a way to connect to the continental community working in
  
machine learning and data science in all its forms--so we can more easily ask each other
  
questions,   share   research   and   job   opportunities,   and   build   collaborations.  
   
  
the  drum language of the kele people, sophisticated and proud, once spread knowledge
to the far reaches of their communities. these talking drums of africa are no longer with
  
  
us. but they can be renewed, in us. as the indaba closes, this will be our call-to-action: to
  
be the talking drums of africa renewed. to share what we know. to carry our lessons as
far as we can. to use it for the good of our societies. to work towards a shared purpose
  
  
that   secures   our   continent   s   place   at   the    rendezvous   of   victory .

the indaba is grateful to our sponsors, all committed to strengthening
  
african machine learning. each of the sponsors will be represented at the
  
  
indaba, and attendees can meet with them to get a sense of the ways
they use machine learning is used in practice, learn about their work, and
  
  
to better understand the potential career paths on offer. read more about
