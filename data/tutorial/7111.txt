who did what : a large-scale person-centered cloze dataset

   we have constructed a new "who-did-what" dataset of over 200,000
   fill-in-the-gap (cloze) multiple choice reading comprehension problems
   constructed from the ldc english gigaword newswire corpus. the wdw
   dataset has a variety of novel features. first, in contrast with the
   id98 and daily mail datasets (hermann et al., 2015) we avoid using
   article summaries for question formation. instead, each problem is
   formed from two independent articles --- an article given as the
   passage to be read and a separate article on the same events used to
   form the question. second, we avoid anonymization --- each choice is a
   person named entity. third, the problems have been filtered to remove a
   fraction that are easily solved by simple baselines, while remaining
   84% solvable by humans. we report performance benchmarks of standard
   systems and propose the wdw dataset as a challenge task for the
   community. ( [6]article here )
