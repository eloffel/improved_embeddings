[7]a curated list of dedicated resources- tensorflow libraries

   nov. 9, 2017, 2:45 p.m. [8]by: kirti bakshi [9]edit

   tensorflow libraries

   we all by now know that tensorflow, that was developed for internal
   google use by google brain is an open-source software library that is
   used for dataflow programming across a wide range of tasks and is used
   for both production and research at google. [10]tensorflow, an
   extraordinary symbolic math library, is used for [11]machine learning
   applications such as neural networks.

   in this article, we will look at various tensorflow libraries and get
   an outlook on them:

   1. lattice:

   tensorflow lattice is a library that provides a rich and intuitive set
   of monotonicity constraints configurable and id173s per
   feature and includes tensorflow estimators for classification and
   regression with the very common setups for lattice models:
     * calibrated linear
     * calibrated lattice
     * random tiny lattices (rtl)
     * embedded tiny lattices (etl)

   github: [12]lattice

   2. tf.contrib.learn:

   it is a simplified interface for deep/machine learning-now part of
   tensorflow and is a high-level machine learning api that makes it easy
   to train, configure, and evaluate a variety of machine learning models.

   github: [13]tf.contrib.learn

   3. tensorflow.rb:

   for all the ruby developers, this library is a tensorflow native
   interface for ruby with the use of swig.

   github: [14]tensorflow.rb

   4. tflearn:

   this is a modular and transparent deep learning library that features a
   higher-level api for tensorflow in order to speed-up and facilitate
   experimentations while remaining both fully transparent and compatible
   with it at the same time.

   github: [15]tflearn

   5. tensorflow-slim:

   tf-slim is a lightweight library that is used for training, defining,
   and evaluating complex models in [16]tensorflow and whose components
   can be freely mixed with native tensorflow, as well as other
   frameworks, such as tf.contrib.learn.
     * it allows the user to define models much more compactly by
       eliminating boilerplate code.
     * makes it easy to extend complex models, and to warm start training
       algorithms by using pieces of pre-existing model checkpoints.
     * makes developing models simple by providing commonly used
       regularizers.

   6. tensorframes:

   tensorframes- tensorflow on spark enables you to manipulate dataframes
   of spark's with [17]tensorflow programs and provides a scala dsl,
   python bindings, and a small runtime to run and express tensorflow
   computation graphs.

   github: [18]tensorframes

   7. tensorforce:

   tensorforce that is focused on providing clear apis, readability is an
   open source id23 library that also aims at providing
   modularization in order to deploy id23 solutions both
   in practice as well as research.

   this open source library is built on top of tensorflow.

   in short terms, tensorforce is an open source library built on top of
   tensorflow and is used for applied id23.

   github: [19]tensorforce

   8. tensorflowonspark:

   a recent framework called tensorflowonspark is an open source library(
   q1 2017) that is meant for scalable tensorflow learning, this very new
   framework supports scalable training and inferencing on spark clusters
   and also enables easy experimentation for algorithm designs. it
   supports all tensorflow functionalities, including model & data
   parallelism, synchronous & asynchronous learning, and tensorboard. it
   provides flexibility in architecture for data ingestion to tensorflow
   and network protocols for server-to-server communication. it comes with
   a python api that makes the integration with existing spark libraries
   like mllib noticeably easy.

   github: [20]tensorflowonspark

   9. caffe-tensorflow:

   a library that is used to convert caffe models into the format of
   tensorflow.

   github: [21]caffe-tensorflow

   10. keras:

   keras, an open source neural network library that is written in python
   focuses on being minimal, modular and extensible and was designed in
   order to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it.
   this library whose primary author and maintainer is a google engineer
   named fran  ois chollet was developed as part of the research effort of
   project oneiros (open-ended neuro-electronic intelligent robot
   operating system).

   11. syntaxnet-neural models of syntax:

   syntaxnet is a neural-network natural language processing(nlp)
   framework for [22]tensorflow and is an implementation of the models
   that were described in globally normalized transition-based neural
   networks, andor et al in the year 2016.

   12. keras-js:

   this is used to run keras models in your browser, with gpu support that
   are trained using tensorflow backend. models are created using weights
   that are serialized from the corresponding hdf5 file directly from the
   keras json-format configuration file. also, the focus of this library
   is on forward-pass id136 only and it also works in node, but only
   in cpu mode.

   compatibility of library version:
     * keras 2.0.4
     * tensorflow 1.1.0

   github: [23]keras-js

   13. nnflow:

   it is a simple framework that enables read-in root ntuples by their
   conversion to a numpy array and then their further use in google
   tensorflow.

   14. sonnet:

   sonnet is deep mind's library used for building complex neural
   networks. this library is built on top of tensorflow.

   15. tensorpack:

   tensorpack is a neural network toolbox on tensorflow that focuses on
   large datasets and on training speed.
