extensible id4

   this is a repository for the extensible id4
   toolkit xid4. the over-arching goal of xid4 is that it be easy to use
   for research, and thus it supports a modular design that means that new
   methods should be easy to implement by adding new modules. it is coded
   in python based on [83]dynet.

   more information can be found in the [84]documentation.

   if you use xid4 in a research paper, we'd appreciate if you cite the
   following system description:
@inproceedings{neubig18xid4,
    title = {{xid4}: the extensible id4 toolkit},
    author = {graham neubig and matthias sperber and xinyi wang and matthieu fel
ix and austin matthews and sarguna padmanabhan and ye qi and devendra singh sach
an and philip arthur and pierre godard and john hewitt and rachid riad and limin
g wang },
    booktitle = {conference of the association for machine translation in the am
ericas (amta) open source software showcase},
    address = {boston},
    month = {march},
    year = {2018}
