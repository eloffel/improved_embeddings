id22 and the limitations of id98s

   by [48]soham chatterjee | november 16, 2017 | [49]0
   machine learning

   convolutional neural networks are considered the state-of-the-art in
   id161 related machine learning tasks. soham chatterjee
   highlights the limitations of id98s and discusses alternate models that
   closely mirror the way the human brain work. he uses professor geoffrey
   hinton   s paper, [50]dynamic routing between capsules, to establish
   certain points.

   convolutional neural networks, popularly called id98s, have been around
   for a while; in fact, they are our go-to algorithm for any computer
   vision related task. id98s are, as of now, the final answer when it
   comes to id161 related machine learning tasks. they are used
   widely in object recognition systems, self-driving cars, etc. they can
   even be used to create new paintings based on the patterns of famous
   painters of the past! part of what makes them so widely used is that
   they are really good at what they do.

   however, in this article, i am trying to accomplish a rather hard task
       highlight the limitations of id98s and present an alternative model of
   id161 that is modeled more closely to how the brain actually
   works. i   ll be referring to professor geoffrey hinton   s paper, called
   [51]dynamic routing between capsules (published november 07, 2017), to
   make certain points.

      all that is rotten in the state of denmark   

   in the id163 competition, which has 1000 labels, the vgg-16 net has
   a top 5% error of 8.70% and the inception-v3 net has a top 1% accuracy
   of 80% in id163. moreover, id98s have been shown to be transferable,
   meaning that they can be trained on a set of images and then, by
   re-training only a small subset of its layers, they can be used to make
   predictions on a completely different set of images.

   but whenever we have something that works really well, we tend to stop
   innovating and accept that as the best way of doing it. henry ford once
   said that,    if i had asked people what they wanted, they would have
   said     faster horses!   . this attitude is also true when it comes to
   id98s.

   most of the latest developments in id98s have come by making them deeper
   and more complex. we use a large number of training images and push
   more layers in different combinations to make them perform well. it is
   almost as if we are trying to brute force a correct prediction from
   these networks. with more complex networks, we need more computational
   power, which makes them less scalable and less likely to be actually
   used in practice.

   we seem to have become so accustomed to the fact that they perform so
   well, that we have stopped trying to figure out where they go wrong and
   how we might improve them. in case of id98s, they do go wrong in a
   couple of places.

      what is wrong with convolutional neural nets?   

   that is the name of a [52]talk that professor hinton, one of the first
   pioneers of neural networks, has been delivering for quite a while now.
   in his talk, he also explains an alternative model to the vision
   problem that he calls id22. he has recently published a
   paper on this topic, titled [53]dynamic routing between capsules. we
   shall look into this model soon, but before that, i   ll highlight some
   of the areas where id98s fall short according to professor hinton.

   strike one

   one of professor hinton   s biggest argument for what is wrong with id98s
   is that they do not encode the position and orientation of the object
   into their predictions.

   the main reason that id98s did not work well initially was because they
   could only make predictions on an image if the image that they were
   trained on and the test image were almost perfectly aligned. what this
   means is that if a id98 is trained on images of dogs sitting in a
   certain position in a certain part of an image, then they will only be
   able to identify dogs in test images that are sitting in similar
   positions in similar parts of the image. even a slight position shift
   will throw off the id98   s prediction.

   [54]machine learning

   alexnet, which was the first major id98 and which won the id163
   competition in 2012, solved this problem by training the id98 on
   augmented images. that is, they took an image and created many versions
   of it by tilting it, inverting it, rotating it and so on. this helped
   alexnet to learn an internal representation of an image with many
   different viewpoints.

    [55] id22

   that, you would agree, is    very creative    problem-solving. show a human
   an image of say an aardvark and it can still identify that aardvark
   whether it is tilted or inverted and so on.

    [56] machine learning

   id98s are very bad at encoding these different representations of pose
   and orientation within themselves. this problem in the id98 is what
   professor hinton called the invariance vs. equivariance problem.

   the final label of an image or the final prediction of the id98 is
   viewpoint invariant. so, even if the final label is a face, the id98
   should be able to identify it as a face whether it is small or large or
   upside down and it should create an internal representation of the
   position of that face.

   id98s do not do that. they completely lose all their internal data about
   the pose and the orientation of the object and they route all the
   information to the same neurons that may not be able to deal with this
   kind of information.

   professor hinton argues that we should have equivariance in the network
       a way to map changes in the viewpoint and pose to changes in the
   neural activities of the network.

   take a look at this image from his talk. can you try and identify which
   continent that is? if you said that it looks a bit like australia then
   you are correct. however, if you flip the image and look at it taking
   the right hand side of the image as the frame of reference, then it
   sort of looks like africa, and you would still be correct.

   this simple exercise shows that our perception of an image, or the kind
   of information that we draw from an image, depends heavily upon our
   point of reference. this makes sense even in our day-to-day life.

   every time we see something, we set up a rectangular point of reference
   and we derive information from that image based on that rectangular
   reference, something that id98s don   t do. instead, they rely on a single
   reference point, and sometimes none at all, to understand images.
   therefore, if we are to model vision close to how humans see, then id98s
   are not the way to go.

   strike two

   strike two is based on the mechanism that id98s use to make predictions.

   a id98 makes predictions by looking at an image and then checking to see
   if certain components are present in that image or not. if they are,
   then it classifies that image accordingly.

   if a id98 is asked to identify the first image below, then it will
   identify it as a face. however, if asked to predict what the image on
   the right is, it will still identify it as a face!

   [57]id22

   it does this because the id98 only checks to see if certain features,
   like eyes, ears, a mouth, and a nose, are present in the image.
   however, the id98 does not check the relative locations of these
   features to each other.

   this shortcoming can be traced back to the pooling layer.

   in the pooling layer, we generally take the input vector and then
   select the largest pixel intensities in our receptive field. this is a
   non-learnable feature and the reason it is done because it reduces
   computation cost and also helps select the important features from an
   image. basically put, it just performs a sub-sampling of features.

   however, at the same time, the pooling layer loses a lot of the
   positional information about a feature. this means that the pooling
   layer ignores where certain features have occurred, leading again to
   invariance among features.

   in real life, however, we take into account the relationship of objects
   with the surroundings and their orientation to identify objects. in
   id98s, these orientations and their surroundings are not taken into
   account.

   moreover, when we see an image and we see the same image slightly
   darkened, we can still identify it as the same. on the other hand, if
   you see an image and see a covariant transformation of that image, you
   will not be able to identify them as the same. it makes sense,
   therefore, for a neural network that is detecting images to check for
   the intensities and the pose of the image, instead of its covariance
   structure, that a id98 usually does.

   strike three

   finally, how the id98 routes data from the lower levels to the higher
   levels are fundamentally wrong.

   in a id98, all low-level details are sent to all the higher level
   neurons. these neurons then perform further convolutions to check
   whether certain features are present. this is done by striding the
   receptive field and then replicating the knowledge across all the
   different neurons.

   professor hinton argues that instead of having the information go
   through all the neurons, like in a conventional id98, it is better to
   route the image to specific neurons that have the capability to deal
   with those features. even in the brain, we have certain areas that are
   dedicated to deciphering certain kinds of information and it makes
   sense to do the same in neural networks to get better predictions.

   according to professor hinton, if a lower level neuron has identified
   an ear, it then makes sense to send this information to a higher level
   neuron that deals with identifying faces and not to a neuron that
   identifies chairs. if the higher level face neuron gets a lot of
   information that contains both the position and the degree of certainty
   from lower level neurons of the presence of a nose, two eyes and an
   ear, then the face neuron can identify it as a face.

   his solution is to have capsules, or a group of neurons, in lower
   layers to identify certain patterns. these capsules would then output a
   high-dimensional vector that contains information about the id203
   of the position of a pattern and its pose. these values would then be
   fed to the higher-level capsules that take multiple inputs from many
   lower-level capsules.

   in the case of a face, the lower level capsules would route information
   about the pose and the id203 of the presence of ears, nose, eyes,
   etc, to a higher level face capsule. since capsules are effectively
   smaller neural networks, the output of each capsule would be quite high
   dimensional. the face capsule would then take this high dimensional
   data and be able to tell whether a face is present or not, by comparing
   the relative    closeness    of the different low-level features.

   since we are dealing with high dimensional data across all the layers,
   the id203 of this    closeness    would get lesser and lesser as the
   dimensions increase. this would also reduce errors in the system.

   in id98s, by routing all the lower level information to all the higher
   level layers not only are we increasing our computational cost, but we
   are also sending data to neurons that are not adept at dealing with
   such information.

   this is the final nail in the coffin for id98s and the reason why we
   need an alternative.

   so what is the alternative?

   before we look at what the alternative is, let   s see what the problems
   with id98s were again:
    1. orientation and placements of various parts of the objects in the
       image are not taken into account: a face is not a face if the eyes
       are located beside the ears and the nose is below the mouth.
    2. routing of high dimensional data to specific neurons to improve
       predictions: send the vector of the mouth prediction to the neurons
       that deal with the prediction of faces, and not to the one that
       predicts cars.
    3. there is no encoding of pose and orientation of the image: neural
       activities need to be different for same objects with different
       poses.

   capsules in the brain

   one of the motivations behind the capsule net comes from how neurons in
   the brain are arranged.

   in any neural network architecture, there is only a single flow of
   information. low-level neurons get information from the input and they
   translate that into higher and higher dimensions to make sense of the
   data and find a decision boundary. and to put it in very blunt and
   basic terms, we decide that the neuron with the loudest bark is telling
   us the correct answer.

   this kind of architecture is inspired by the brain, but it is not how
   the brain works. in the brain, there are various regions which deal
   with understanding certain kinds of information. here, the key word is
      region    and not    neurons   . in the brain, an entire group of neurons
   help in making a decision.

   but what is the advantage of using    regions    or a bunch of neurons
   instead of a single one? dimensionality. neurons in a neural network
   can take an input vector, correlate that with a weight vector, and see
   if they correlate. but they cannot compare two input or activity
   vectors.

   for example, we have a group of neurons that can identify a wheel and
   another group of neurons that can identify a car door. both of these
   groups of neurons outputs a vector, which obviously is of high
   dimensionality. then by being able to compare these two vectors, in
   high dimensions, we can check whether they    add up    to form a car.

   by being able to correlate between two activity vectors, we can extract
   more information and do a lot of other useful calculations. if two such
   activity vectors are similar in higher dimensions, then it becomes a
   much better agreement, as it is in a higher dimension and there is a
   lesser chance of disparity. hence, predictions become more accurate and
   we are able to filter out noise, as high dimensional coincidences do
   not happen.

   the capsule net

   a capsule is a group of neurons that has the ability to identify
   certain kinds of objects and also tell us the position of that object
   in that image.

   a low level capsule says that if it is activated, there is a high
   id203 that the entity it is built to see is present in the image
   and its location is here. this low-level capsule then routes its
   information to a higher level capsule that can make sense of that data.

   the high-level capsule gets similar data from many different lower
   level capsules that tells it that it has seen something, an object, and
   this is how sure it is that the thing it has seen is actually present
   there. it looks at all this data and finds a tight cluster of
   predictions and then outputs another vector, which is again fed to
   another higher level output.

   the outcome:
     * problem 3 is solved: we can transfer knowledge about the pose and
       orientation of the image.
     * problem 2 solved: we have achieved routing and high dimensionality.

   now let   s see how the capsules work and actually transfer data.

   capsule implementation

   [58]machine learning

   in the image we can see two layers of capsules. the lower layer
   consists of the capsules that can identify a mouth and a nose.
     * t[i]     has the coordinate/pose of the mouth
     * p[i]     has the id203 that the entity is a mouth
     * t[h]     has the coordinate/pose of the nose
     * p[h]     has the id203 that the entity is a nose

   now, we multiply the coordinate given by the mouth capsule and the
   coordinate given by the nose capsule with t[ij] and t[hj] respectively.

   here, t[ij] and t[h][j] are weight matrices that after being
   multiplied, give the position that the face should have with respect to
   the mouth and nose respectively.

   so t[ij] * t[i] and t[hj] * t[h] give us two different poses of the
   face.

   if t[ij] * t[i] and t[hj] * t[h] are similar, then we have a face.

   this brings out a covariance of activities rather than that of weight
   vectors.

   the matrices t[ij] and t[hj] are viewpoint invariant and they represent
   the relationship between the mouth and the face. so even if we get a
   different viewpoint, the capsules will be able to encode it and as long
   as the product between the capsules pose and weight vectors match, we
   can translate that to a successful prediction.

   this is how the capsules interact with each other and use pose between
   objects to make predictions. now, problem 1 has also been solved.

   professor hinton   s capsule net architecture

   in his paper, [59]dynamic routing using capsules, professor hinton uses
   just a 3-layer network to achieve nearly state-of-the-art accuracies in
   mnist.

   the first layer or the bottom layer is convolutional in nature (ironic
   much?). it has 256 convolutional filters with a receptive field of 9  9
   and a stride of 1.

   each filter in this layer converts pixel intensities of the image into
   pose of certain entities in that image. along with that, it also gives
   a value of id203 of a certain entity being present. so, in this
   layer, everything is going to be shared.

   the second layer is the    primary capsule    layer. each capsule contains
   8 convolutional units with 9  9 kernels and a stride of 2. there are 32
   of these channels. the 32 primary capsules sees the inputs from all the
   convolution kernels in the first layer. they output a 8d vector. no
   routing takes place yet.

   the last layer is the digitcaps layer. it has a 16d capsule per digit
   in mnist. routing takes place in between the digitcaps layer and the
   primary capsule layer.

   during training, the routing is initialized to zero, which means the
   output from the primary capsule layer is sent to all the capsules in
   the digitcaps layer. then the routing between the two layers is
   learned.

      talk is cheap. show me the accuracy!   

   professor hinton and team trained their caps net on an expanded mnist
   dataset. they expanded it by translating all the images by 2 pixels.
   this expanded mnist dataset had 60k training examples and 10k testing
   examples. they also trained a state-of-the-art convolutional net on the
   same dataset.

   the authors of this paper also went one step further and added a
   decoder network at the end of the capsule network predictions. the
   decoder network would reconstruct the images that the capsule network
   thought it saw and also give a prediction of the digit. the results are
   in the image below


   l, p, r represents the label, the prediction and the label of the
   reconstructed image. the network failed to predict the two rightmost
   images, but it did reconstruct the second from the right image
   correctly.

   the reconstructed images are not only clearer and less noisy, but they
   keep all the important details of the digits. capsules with more
   routing and reconstruction achieved a lower test accuracy error in both
   the mnist and the expanded mnist data set as can be seen in the table
   below.

   [60]machine learning

   the authors also say that they achieved comparable results with a
   lesser number of parameters than a most advanced id98.

   the authors also created another dataset called affmnist. this dataset
   contained images that had affine transformations like scale, thickness,
   localized skew, width, and translation.

   when the caps net was tested on this dataset with training on only the
   expanded mnist dataset, they achieved a classification accuracy of 79%,
   whereas a similarly trained id98 achieved an accuracy of only 66%.

   in a previous talk, professor hinton also mentioned that capsules could
   achieve the utmost level of accuracy after training on less than
   one-tenth of the data as compared to id98s!

   these are amazing results that show how the capsule net can generalize
   better across many different viewpoints and transformations.

   overlapping digits

   dynamic routing can be seen as a parallel attention mechanism. this
   means that each capsule can attend to several details, allowing the
   model to identify multiple objects in an image.

   to test this, they created the multimnist dataset which contained two
   digits with about 80% overlap. the results are shown in the image
   below.

   [61]id22

   r:(r1, r2) represents the image that was fed to the network with
   overlap and l:(l1, l2) shows the reconstructed images with green and
   red representing the two different digits. the two rightmost columns
   shows an example of a classification and reconstruction error.

   the capsule net achieved a classification error rate of 5% in the test
   dataset. which is comparable to a similar sequential attention model
   overlap architecture that was trained on a dataset that had only a 4%
   overlap!!!

   all these results shows us that id22 are definitely better
   at identifying multiple objects and also at generalizing among
   viewpoints than convolutional neural networks. however, there is more
   work to be done in this field and we can achieve better results with
   better architectures and better capsule and routing algorithms.

   the authors of the paper say,    there are many possible ways to
   implement the general idea of capsules. the aim of this paper is not to
   explore this whole space but simply to show that one fairly
   straightforward implementation works well and that dynamic routing
   helps.   

   but despite that, with results like the ones above, i believe that the
   end of our dependence on id98s is fast approaching.
