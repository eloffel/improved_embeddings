   welcome to a new section in our machine learning tutorial series: deep
   learning with neural networks and tensorflow. the artificial neural
   network is a biologically-inspired methodology to conduct machine
   learning, intended to mimic your brain (a biological neural network).
   the id158, which i will now just refer to as a
   neural network, is not a new concept. the idea has been around since
   the 1940's, and has had a few ups and downs, most notably when compared
   against the support vector machine (id166). for example, the neural
   network was popularized up until the mid 90s when it was shown that the
   id166, using a new-to-the-public (the technique itself was thought up
   long before it was actually put to use) technique, the "kernel trick,"
   was capable of working with non-linearly separable datasets. with this,
   the support vector machine catapulted to the front again, leaving
   neural nets behind and mostly nothing interesting until about 2011,
   where deep neural networks began to take hold and outperform the
   support vector machine, using new techniques, huge dataset
   availability, and much more powerful computers.
