what is blacklab?

   [74]blacklab is a corpus retrieval engine built on top of [75]apache
   lucene. it allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting
   on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text. it was developed at the
   institute of dutch lexicology (inl) to provide a fast and feature-rich
   search interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora.

   we're also working on blacklab server, a web service interface to
   blacklab, so you can access it from any programming language. blacklab
   server is included in the repository as well.

   blacklab and blacklab server are licensed under the [76]apache license
   2.0.
