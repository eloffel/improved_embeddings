microsoft recommends you install a download manager.

   a download manager is recommended for downloading multiple files.

microsoft download manager

   manage all your internet downloads with this easy-to-use manager. it
   features a simple interface with many customizable options:
     * download multiple files at one time
     * download large files quickly and reliably
     * suspend active downloads and resume downloads that have failed

   would you like to install the microsoft download manager?
     * (*) yes, install microsoft download manager (recommended)
     * ( ) no, thanks

   [53]what happens if i don't install a download manager?
   [54]close
   why should i install the microsoft download manager?

   generally, a download manager enables downloading of large files or
   multiples files in one session. many web browsers, such as internet
   explorer 9, include a download manager. stand-alone download managers
   also are available, including the microsoft download manager.

   if you do not have a download manager installed, and still want to
   download the file(s) you've chosen, please note:
     * you may not be able to download multiple files at the same time. in
       this case, you will have to download the files individually. (you
       would have the opportunity to download individual files on the
       "thank you for downloading" page after completing your download.)
     * files larger than 1 gb may take much longer to download and might
       not download correctly.
     * you might not be able to pause the active downloads or resume
       downloads that have failed.

   the microsoft download manager solves these potential problems. it
   gives you the ability to download multiple files at one time and
   download large files quickly and reliably. it also allows you to
   suspend active downloads and resume downloads that have failed.

   microsoft download manager is free and available for download now.

   the microsoft speech language translation corpus release contains
   conversational, bilingual speech test and tuning data for english,

   includes audio data, transcripts, and translations and allows
   end-to-end testing of spoken language translation systems on real-world
   data.

          + the microsoft speech language translation corpus release
            contains conversational, bilingual speech test and tuning data
            for english, french, and german collected by microsoft
            research. the package includes audio data, transcripts, and
            translations and allows end-to-end testing of spoken language
            translation systems on real-world data. all data contained in
            this release has been created using a non-public version of
            skype translator. no private user data has been collected or
            released. instead we hired consultants to have loosely
            constrained conversations, giving them a list of predefined
            topics to talk about and a few related questions to start the
            conversations. topical constraints were loosely enforced so as
            to ensure free-form conversations. see the iwslt paper for
            more details. we release two sets, one containing test data,
            the second containing dev data. each set contains data for
            three languages: english, french, and german. for every
            utterance, we include the audio file in wave format, the
            disfluent transcript, a cleaned up, segmented and fluent
            version of the transcript, and the translation from english
            into french or german or vice versa.
