under the hood with id23     understanding basic rl models

   summary:  id23 (rl) is likely to be the next big push
   in artificial intelligence.  it   s the core technique for robotics,
   smart iot, game play, and many other emerging areas.  but the concept
   of modeling in rl is very different from our statistical techniques and
   deep learning.  in this two part series we   ll take a look at the basics
   of rl models, how they   re built and used.  in the next part, we   ll
   address some of the complexities that make development a challenge.


   now that we have pretty much conquered speech, text, and image
   processing with deep neural nets, it   s time to turn our attention to
   what comes next.  it   s likely that the next most important area of
   development for ai will be id23 (rl).

   rl systems are getting a lot of play in the press from self-driving
   cars and winning at go but the reality is that they are not quite yet
   ready for commercialization. we wrote about the [36]readiness of the
   various techniques behind ai earlier and published this chart.

    [37] [aicommercialacceptability.png?width=550]

   why so important?

   the reason that id23 will be so important going
   forward is that it has so many applications that are not addressed by
   any other techniques.  specifically rl is what enables all of robotics
   and will enable smart iot.

   brandon rohrer is both a senior data scientist at microsoft and also a
   prolific explainer of all things data science.  [38]in one remarkable
   article he lists the 96 most common question categories addressed by
   data science and techniques most likely to solve them.  although the
   great majority of our work is still in predicting consumer behavior,
   brandon shows that rl is or will be the preferred technique to address
   10 of the 96.  that   s a huge percentage for a technique that   s just
   beginning to come into its own.  here   s his list of questions for rl.
    1. which offer should this customer receive?
    2. which advertisement should be listed first for this reader?
    3. where should i place this ad on the webpage so that the viewer is
       most likely to click it?
    4. how many shares of this stock should i buy right now?
    5. should the robot vacuum clean the living room or continue to
       charge?
    6. do i move this obstacle or navigate around it?
    7. should the thermostat adjust the temperature higher, lower, or
       leave it where it is?
    8. should i continue driving at the same speed, brake, or accelerate
       in response to that yellow light?
    9. [39]what is the translation of this sentence from english into
       chinese?
   10. in which direction should this robot move given what it sees?

   yes for each of these 10 there   s at least one alternative in classical
   predictive analytics but brandon proposes that rl will be the superior
   choice in these cases.

   remember that the unique feature of rl is that it learns from trial and
   error which makes it quite different from all the other statistically
   based techniques at our disposal.  some have likened rl to groundhog
   day for algorithms.

   most importantly it puts it in a completely separate category from
   supervised and unsupervised learning.  it   s going to be your go-to
   when:
     * data for learning currently does not exist.
     * or you don   t want to wait to accumulate it (because delay might be
       costly).
     * or the data may change rapidly causing the outcome to change more
       rapidly than a typical model refresh cycle can accommodate.


   different from supervised and unsupervised

   it   s only been a few years since rl was identified as a third leg of
   analytics differentiating it from supervised and unsupervised
   learning.  rl systems are simple in the sense that no statistical
   training on labeled data is required.  in fact rl occupies a middle
   ground between supervised and unsupervised learning.

   where supervised learning has target labels for each observation and
   unsupervised has none, id23 needs labels only for the
   actions that we want to reward.  during training the vast number of
   examples are likely to be unsuccessful and therefore don   t need a
   label.  only those actions that we want to reward (or discourage) that
   direct the agent how to behave in the environment need to be labeled.
   so these labels are going to be sparse, and in many situations,
   time-delayed.


   under the hood with id23

   in this article we   ll take a look at what   s under the hood in rl.
     * how rl models are constructed.
     * what they look like.
     * how they are interpreted

   in a follow-on article we   ll address many of the complexities and
   challenges involved in actual implementation.

   we assume that you   re familiar with the basic schema of rl and can
   understand the roles of goals, sensors, actuators, the environment (the
   world and its    state   ), actions, and rewards.

                        [40][rldiagram.jpg?width=300]

   if not, you may want to first [41]read our introductory article which
   serves as a foundation for this one.

   throughout we will use the concept of state / action pairs and policy.
   the    policy    is the highest value    action    that can be taken given the
      state    (the current condition of the system and all its parts) looking
   typically just one step ahead.  the value of that    policy    is
   calculated by the q-function (determining the value of the next step)
   which is written q(s,a), the maximum discounted future reward when we
   perform action a in state s.


   building a basic rl model

   unlike statistically based modeling where the output of training on
   existing data is an algorithm that can be used to score or categorize
   unseen data, the core of the rl model is simply a very large table in
   which each iteration of the action is recorded along with the outcome.
   given enough iterations of the action, the table will represent the
   id203 that each of the actions attempted was successful or
   unsuccessful.

   to illustrate how such a table might be built we   ll use a very
   simplified example based on the problem of maintaining the temperature
   of an automated house where we   ll show only a very small portion of the
   overall table.  this particular example also comes from brandon rohrer
   who has [42]a great explainer video.

   the goal:  move the house from its current temperature of 68 degrees to
   70 degrees.

   sensor:  thermometer in the thermostat.

   actuator:  the heater.

   possible actions (the decision):  the heater may be turned on or left
   off.  in this portion of the table the heater is on or off for 10
   minutes and measured at the end of each interval.

   so our table represents what are essentially tests of what happens
   recording the temperature before, the temperature after, and whether
   the heater was on or off.  for each set of conditions we   ll note the
   number of times it occurs and continuously update the id203 of
   that outcome.  in this table we have 758 observations (a little over 5
   days) with roughly equal examples of the heater on and off.

    [43] [rltableinitial.png?width=600]

                brandon roher, how id23 works in becca 7

   to use this as a model, we simply look up all the instances in which
   the starting temperature was 68 and the goal temperature of 70 was
   successfully achieved.

    [44] [rltableinterpreted2.png?width=600]

                 brandon roher, how id23 works in becca
   7

   there are two instances of this, one with the heater on and one off.
   based on the id203 our rl system would decide to turn on the
   heater for 10 minutes since the id203 of success for that action
   is almost 50x higher than for leaving it off.


   wait     what about   

   i   m sure you observed that the real table is much, much larger.  for
   starters the table would have to include all the reasonable starting
   and ending temperatures between perhaps 50 and 100 degrees even though
   many of those rows might be empty.  here are just a few other
   conditions we might need to incorporate into the table.
     * if the heater is cycled for more or less than 10 minutes, perhaps
       in increments of 5 minutes of up to 30 minutes each would need its
       own entry.
     * what about reducing temperature?  there need to be entries for when
       the ac is activated to reduce temperature.
     * what about time of day?  we probably need several different tables
       that account for day, night, and whether we   re home.
     * what about factors that work together like heat and humidity?  if
       we   re heating a house in the winter and we add humidity then our
       perception of comfortable temperature changes.  the interaction
       between these variables would be complex and would require two
       sensors and a formula interrelating the two variables.  the goal
       would also change from an exact temperature to some other measure
       indicating    comfort    when combining temperature and humidity.
     * what about other actuators like automatically opening and closing
       the shades?

   you begin to see the pattern.  anytime we increase complexity the table
   expands.  when we add sensors or actuators we   re basically multiplying
   the size of the table by the number of sensors and actuators.  pretty
   soon this gets into big data territory.


   tables or calculation     look up or neural nets

   for relatively simple environments like our automated house, the math
   in the table itself is quite simple and the id203 can be
   recalculated on the fly with very few resources.  simple rl systems are
   not compute intensive, they are look up intensive.  fortunately in this
   era of big data rapid look up is easy and inexpensive.

   it   s likely that the table will be sparse so a column-based nosql
   scheme like hbase would be efficient and could also be condensed,
   reducing storage size.

   however as the state space grows in size and complexity it   s not
   practical to store a q factor for every state / action pair.  what we
   can do instead is to train a neural net, typically a convolutional
   neural net (id98) to calculate the q factor on the fly and store a
   limited number of those in a table.

   however, these aren   t the only complexities facing building rl
   systems.  although the core concept is really this simple, actual
   implementation is another matter.  in our next article we   ll explore
   several of them.
