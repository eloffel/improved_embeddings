sarcasm corpus v2

   if you use this data in your research, please refer to and
   cite: shereen oraby, vrindavan harrison, lena reed, ernesto hernandez,
   ellen riloff and marilyn walker. "[36]creating and characterizing a
   diverse corpus of sarcasm in dialogue." in the 17th annual sigdial
   meeting on discourse and dialogue (sigdial), los angeles, california,
   usa, 2016.

   overview: the sarcasm corpus v2 is a subset of the internet argument
   corpus (iac, also available for download), including response text from
   quote-response pairs annotated for sarcasm. it is an update to the
   sarcasm corpus v1, and contains data representing three categories of
   sarcasm: general sarcasm, hyperbole, and rhetorical questions.

   the data: this download is currently a random sample of the dataset -
   the full corpus will be released as we continue to add more data.

   the data is presented in "quote-response" pairs, where the quote
   functions as a "dialogic parent" to the response. the quote could be a
   post earlier in thread, or a quote from a post earlier in the thread
   (thus, more than one response post may map to the same quote post). the
   sarcasm annotations relate only to the *response*, but we include the
   quote text for context.

   the largest subset of the sample is the generic sarcasm subset,
   containing 1,630 quote-response pairs per class (sarcastic and
   not-sarcastic). the hyp and rq samples are smaller, containing 291 and
   425 quote-response pairs per class, respectively. some of the posts in
   the hyp and rq samples are instances also existing in the gen corpus,
   exhibiting sarcastic/not-sarcastic instances of hyperbole or rhetorical
   questions. hyp response posts contain cue words signaling hyperbole,
   and rq response posts contain question-answer pairs where the speaker
   continues with their turn (not allowing a direct answer to their
   question).

   the sample is a single csv file with the following fields:

     * corpus: the corpus type - one of gen (general sarcasm), hyp
       (hyperbole), and rq (rhetorical questions).
     * label: the class label of the response utterance - one of "sarc"
       (sarcastic) or "notsarc" (not-sarcastic)
     * id: a unique id for the quote-response pair -
       {corpus}_{label}_{id}. each quote-response is independent, i.e.
       pairs with the same id numbers across different datasets are not
       related.
     * quote text: the text of the dialogic parent of the response post,
       for context
     * response text: the text of the response to the quote, annotated for
       sarcasm (i.e. the sarcasm label relates to this utterance)

   2.0.
