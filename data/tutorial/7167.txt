gathering human feedback

   [11]rl-teacher is an open-source implementation of our interface to
   train ais via occasional human feedback rather than hand-crafted reward
   functions. the underlying technique was [12]developed as a step towards
   safe ai systems, but also applies to id23 problems
   with rewards that are hard to specify.

   [13]view codethis simulated robot is being trained to do ballet via a
   human giving feedback. it's not obvious how to specify a reward
   function to achieve the same behavior.

   the release contains three main components:
     * a [14]reward predictor that can be plugged into any agent and
       learns to predict the actions the agent could take that a human
       would approve of.
     * an [15]example agent that learns via a function specified by a
       reward predictor. rl-teacher ships with three pre-integrated
       algorithms, including [16]openai baselines ppo.
     * a [17]web-app that humans can use to give feedback, providing the
       data used to train the reward predictor.

   the entire system consists of less than 1,000 lines of python code
   (excluding the agents). after you've set up your web server you can
   launch an experiment by running:
$ python rl_teacher/teach.py -p human --pretrain_labels 175 -e reacher-v1 -n hum
an-175

   humans can give feedback via a simple web interface (shown above),
   which can be run locally (not recommended) or on a separate machine.
   full documentation is available on the project's [18]github repository.
   we're excited to see what ai researchers and engineers do with this
   technology     please [19]get in touch with any experimental results!
