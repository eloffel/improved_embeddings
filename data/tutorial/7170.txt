deep id23 agents

   this repository contains a collection of id23
   algorithms written in tensorflow. the ipython notebook here were
   written to go along with a still-underway tutorial series i have been
   publishing on [83]medium. if you are new to id23, i
   recommend reading the accompanying post for each algorithm.

   the repository currently contains the following algorithms:
     * q-table - an implementation of id24 using tables to solve a
       stochastic environment problem.
     * q-network - a neural network implementation of id24 to solve
       the same environment as in q-table.
     * simple-policy - an implementation of policy gradient method for
       stateless environments such as n-armed bandit problems.
     * contextual-policy - an implementation of policy gradient method for
       stateful environments such as contextual bandit problems.
     * policy-network - an implementation of a neural network
       policy-gradient agent that solves full rl problems with states and
       delayed rewards, and two opposite actions (ie. cartpole or pong).
     * vanilla-policy - an implementation of a neural network
       vanilla-policy-gradient agent that solves full rl problems with
       states, delayed rewards, and an arbitrary number of actions.
     * model-network - an addition to the policy-network algorithm which
       includes a separate network which models the environment dynamics.
     * double-dueling-id25 - an implementation of a deep-q network with the
       double id25 and dueling id25 additions to improve stability and
       performance.
     * deep-recurrent-q-network - an implementation of a deep recurrent
       q-network which can solve id23 problems involving
       partial observability.
     * q-exploration - an implementation of id25 containing multiple
       action-selection strategies for exploration. strategies include:
       greedy, random, e-greedy, boltzmann, and bayesian dropout.
     * a3c-doom - an implementation of asynchronous advantage actor-critic
       (a3c) algorithm. it utilizes multiple agents to collectively
       improve a policy. this implementation can solve rl problems in 3d
       environments such as vizdoom challenges.
