   this post presents a summary of a series of tutorials covering the
   exercises from andrew ng's machine learning class on coursera. instead
   of implementing the exercises in octave, the author has opted to do so
   in python, and provide commentary along the way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   by john wittenauer, data scientist.

     editor's note: this tutorial series was started in september of
     2014, with the 8 installments coming over the course of 2 years. i
     only mention this to put john's first paragraph into context, and to
     assure readers that this informative series of tutorials, including
     all of its code, is as relevant and up-to-date today as it was at
     the time it was written. this is great material, both for anyone
     taking andrew ng's mooc and as a standalone resource.

   one of the pivotal moments in my professional development this year
   came when i discovered coursera. i'd heard of the "mooc" phenomenon but
   had not had the time to dive in and take a class. earlier this year i
   finally pulled the trigger and signed up for andrew ng's [36]machine
   learning class. i completed the whole thing from start to finish,
   including all of the programming exercises. the experience opened my
   eyes to the power of this type of education platform, and i've been
   hooked ever since.

   [37]python exercises

   [38]part 1 - simple id75

   this blog post will be the first in a series covering the programming
   exercises from andrew's class. one aspect of the course that i didn't
   particularly care for was the use of octave for assignments. although
   octave/matlab is a fine platform, most real-world "data science" is
   done in either r or python (certainly there are other languages and
   tools being used, but these two are unquestionably at the top of the
   list). since i'm trying to develop my python skills, i decided to start
   working through the exercises from scratch in python. the full source
   code is available at [39]my ipython repo on github. you'll also find
   the data used in these exercises and the original exercise pdfs in
   sub-folders off the root directory if you're interested.

   [40]part 2 - multivariate id75

   in [41]part 1 of my series on machine learning in python, we covered
   the first part of exercise 1 in andrew ng's [42]machine learning class.
   in this post we'll wrap up exercise 1 by completing part 2 of the
   exercise. if you recall, in part 1 we implemented id75 to
   predict the profits of a new food truck based on the population of the
   city that the truck would be placed in. for part 2 we've got a new task
   - predict the price that a house will sell for. the difference this
   time around is we have more than one dependent variable. we're given
   both the size of the house in square feet, and the number of bedrooms
   in the house. can we easily extend our previous code to handle multiple
   id75? let's find out!

   [43]python exercises

   [44]part 3 - id28

   in part 2 of the series we wrapped up our implementation of
   multivariate id75 using id119 and applied it to
   a simple housing prices data set. in this post we   re going to switch
   our objective from predicting a continuous value (regression) to
   classifying a result into two or more discrete buckets (classification)
   and apply it to a student admissions problem. suppose that you are the
   administrator of a university department and you want to determine each
   applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
   you have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a
   training set. for each training example, you have the applicant's
   scores on two exams and the admissions decision. to accomplish this,
   we're going to build a classification model that estimates the
   id203 of admission based on the exam scores using a somewhat
   confusingly-named technique called id28.

   [45]part 4 - multivariate id28

   in part three of this series we implemented both simple and regularized
   id28, completing our python implementation of the second
   exercise from andrew ng's machine learning class. there's a limitation
   with our solution though - it only works for binary classification. in
   this post we'll extend our solution from the previous exercise to
   handle multi-class classification. in doing so, we'll cover the first
   half of exercise 3 and set ourselves up for the next big topic, neural
   networks.

   [46]part 5 - neural networks

   in part four we wrapped up our implementation of id28 by
   extending our solution to handle multi-class classification and testing
   it on the hand-written digits data set. using just id28
   we were able to hit a classification accuracy of about 97.5%, which is
   reasonably good but pretty much maxes out what we can achieve with a
   linear model. in this blog post we'll again tackle the hand-written
   digits data set, but this time using a feed-forward neural network with
   id26. we'll implement un-regularized and regularized
   versions of the neural network cost function and compute gradients via
   the id26 algorithm. finally, we'll run the algorithm through
   an optimizer and evaluate the performance of the network on the
   handwritten digits data set.

   [47]part 6 - support vector machines

   we're now hitting the home stretch of both the course content and this
   series of blog posts. in this exercise, we'll be using support vector
   machines (id166s) to build a spam classifier. we'll start with id166s on
   some simple 2d data sets to see how they work. then we'll look at a set
   of email data and build a classifier on the processed emails using a
   id166 to determine if they are spam or not.

   [48]python exercises

   [49]part 7 - id116 id91 & pca

   we're now down to the last two posts in this series! in this
   installment we'll cover two fascinating topics: id116 id91 and
   principal component analysis (pca). id116 and pca are both examples
   of unsupervised learning techniques. unsupervised learning problems do
   not have any label or target for us to learn from to make predictions,
   so unsupervised algorithms instead attempt to learn some interesting
   structure in the data itself. we'll first implement id116 and see how
   it can be used it to compress an image. we'll also experiment with pca
   to find a low-dimensional representation of images of faces.

   [50]part 8 - anomaly detection & recommendation

   we've now reached the last post in this series! it's been an
   interesting journey. andrew's class was really well-done and
   translating it all to python has been a fun experience. in this final
   installment we'll cover the last two topics in the course - anomaly
   detection and id126s. we'll implement an anomaly
   detection algorithm using a gaussian model and apply it to detect
   failing servers on a network. we'll also see how to build a
   id126 using id185 and apply it to a
   movie recommendations data set.
