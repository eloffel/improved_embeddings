   [64]breakout

   [65]video demo

   reproduce (performance of) the following id23
   methods:
     * nature-id25 in: [66]human-level control through deep reinforcement
       learning
     * double-id25 in: [67]deep id23 with double
       id24
     * dueling-id25 in: [68]dueling network architectures for deep
       id23
     * a3c in [69]asynchronous methods for deep id23. (i
       used a modified version where each batch contains transitions from
       different simulators, which i called "batch-a3c".)

performance & speed

   claimed performance in the paper can be reproduced, on several games
   i've tested with.

   [70]id25

   on one gtx 1080ti, the ale version took ~3 hours of training to reach
   21 (maximum) score on pong, ~15 hours of training to reach 400 score on
   breakout. it runs at 50 batches (~3.2k trained frames, 200 seen frames,
   800 game frames) per second on gtx 1080ti.

how to use

with ale (paper's setting):

   install [71]ale and gym.

   download an [72]atari rom, e.g.:
wget https://github.com/openai/atari-py/raw/master/atari_py/atari_roms/breakout.
bin

   start training:
./id25.py --env breakout.bin
# use `--algo` to select other id25 algorithms. see `-h` for more options.

   watch the agent play:
# download pretrained models or use one you trained:
wget http://models.tensorpack.com/deepqnetwork/doubleid25-breakout.npz
./id25.py --env breakout.bin --task play --load doubleid25-breakout.npz

with gym's atari:

   install gym and atari_py.
./id25.py --env breakoutdeterministic-v4

   a3c code and models for atari games in openai gym are released in
   [73]examples/a3c-gym
