   i am interested in various aspects of machine learning, statistics and
   signal processing. in the deep past (1990s), i started in the domain of
   speech and audio processing. more recently (2000s), i contributed to
   bayesian methods, id115 and to some applications in
   natural language processing. most of my recent works are related to
   online learning methods or multi-armed bandit models.

   i am also scientific deputy director of the [14]cnrs division of
   information sciences and technologies (ins2i), where i coordinate
   activities in the field of information sciences at large (e.g., in
   quantum computing, cybersecurity or artificial intelligence).
