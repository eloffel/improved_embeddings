data

tree structured models for image annotation

   this data has been used in our publications [1,2,3]. below we give
   details of the three different dataset, the download links and some
   additional meta-data (like train/test splits).

    1. imageclef 2010 visual concept detection and annotation task -
       dataset
       we have used this dataset extensively: we won the 2010 challange
       [3], and used it in [1,2].
       the complete task description of the challenge, and the dataset
       including groundtruths are available for download at:
    [2]task description at imageclef.org website
    [3]dataset and ground truth download from fraunhofer-institut

          + we provide the id166 classification scores for our training
            folds 1 upto 5, and for the testset, including the used splits
          + we provide the multi-word queries
    2. sun 09 dataset
       the dataset contains 12.000 annotated images covering a large
       number of scene categories (indoor and outdoors) with more than 200
       object categories and 152.000 annotated object instances. this
       dataset was introduced by [choi et al., cvpr 2010]. the paper and
       the dataset (images) can be downloaded from
    [4]exploiting hierarchical context on a large database of object categories
at mit

    3. animals with attributes
       this dataset was introduced by [lampert et al., cvpr 2009], for
       zero-shot prediction. the paper and the dataset (features) can be
       downloaded from:

    [5]animals with attributes - a dataset for attribute based classification
