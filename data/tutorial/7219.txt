limitations	of	supervised	learning

1. starts	from	scratch	for	every	novel	problem

2. assumes	fixed	and	known	vocabulary	of	concepts

unknown	how	to:

1.

incrementally	add	classes

2. generalize	to	novel	(unseen)	classes

why	zero-shot	learning?

the	more	complex	tasks	we	target,	
the	fewer	annotations	we	have,	
the	more	relevant	zero	shot	learning	is.
