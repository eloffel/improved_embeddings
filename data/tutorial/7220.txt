main point of this talk
to be useful in education, ai doesn   t have to be so smart.
it just has to be smarter than you.
at least, in the subject matter.  
that   s how it has something to teach you.
it also has to know how to teach.
needs at least a crude idea of what your learning looks like.
but it got smart itself via machine learning    
    which might not be a terrible model of human learning.

   part of a well-balanced diet   
can we design a good energy bar, using science?
educational technology
q: how are models of learners used now in education?
summative assessment     e.g., item response theory
formative assessment     e.g., bayesian knowledge tracing
feedback during interactive homework
intelligent tutoring systems
educational games
fit a competence model of student   s current behavior

new(?) goal: construct new educational materials
not just selection from an existing item bank
individualized     interesting and useful to this student now
need a learning model to predict effect on student
construct stimuli that are predicted to achieve a desired effect
if the actual effect doesn   t match, adjust learning model   s parameters

foreign language comprehension

kids learn language through exposure
so do l2 learners, eventually:
   it is widely agreed that much second language vocabulary learning occurs incidentally while the learner is engaged in extensive reading.    (huckin & coady, 1999)
	
9
immersion: learning through doing
   incidental learning    is powerful:
you   re reading something that interests you.
you learn how a word is really used in context.
if you needed to engage with the new word to understand the text, you   ll retain it better.
(   depth of processing    hypothesis, craik et al. 1972)
builds coping strategies for using the language successfully outside the classroom.

(krashen 1989, huckin & coady 1999,
elgort & warren 2014, etc.)
10
immersion: learning through doing
   incidental learning    is powerful
but not possible for adult beginners??
to guess new words, you need to understand about 98% of the context      	(nation 1990, laufer 1997, etc.)
so to read adult text, you need ~5000 words already
and understand suffixes, sentence structure, etc.
   participants whose text comprehension
was low were less likely to learn the
meanings of the new vocab items       
			(elgot & warren 2014)

   larger gains were revealed for ... readers who reported higher interest and enjoyment      
		(elgort & warren 2014)
back to 1985
13
studying high school french
great deal of vocabulary
occasional exciting tidbits of grammar
little exposure to living language
trying to read a novel or newspaper was a painful exercise with a dictionary





could i write a novel that gradually transitioned from english into french??
macaronic language
14
what is this that roareth thus?
can it be a motor bus?
yes, the smell and hideous hum
indicat motorem bum!
implet in the corn and high
terror me motoris bi:
bo motori clamitabo
ne motore caedar a bo---
dative be or ablative
so thou only let us live:---
whither shall thy victims flee?
spare us, spare us, motor be!
thus i sang; and still anigh
came in hordes motores bi,
et complebat omne forum
copia motorum borum.
how shall wretches live like us
cincti bis motoribus?
domine, defende nos
contra hos motores bos!
computers got better since 1985
15
a spectrum of macaronic text
slider interface

why is this good?
constructivism        meeting the student where he/she is   
meaningful reading experience
student can choose material (today   s news, romance,    )
can ask for hints by hovering over a word
we showed them that word in french because we hoped they   d get it
if they can almost guess or remember it, the hint will be timely
use hints and animation to show translation process

user interface trickiness
idiomatic vs. literal translation
show intermediate steps?
should we use human translations when available, or are those too free?
compound words
word endings (tense, agreement, etc.)
orthographic conventions (contraction, caps,    )
right-to-left languages

two kinds of machine learning
replicate human intelligence (traditional ai)

augment human intelligence (big data)
47
how to build ai?
replicate human intelligence (traditional ai)
old way: build an adult
write down everything an adult knows (id109)
new way: build a learner
exposed to examples of correct behavior (learn to mimic)
or merely rewarded for    good    behavior (learn to plan)

these cognitive models of learners might also 
have a use in teaching!


48
cognitive models in educational software
calibration     what does student know now?

constructing materials     what would student learn from?

planning     what should we teach first?


49
two learners in this picture
50
system   s model of the l2 student	
what would happen if the student read a given macaronic sentence?
would they understand it?
what would they take away from it that would affect their understanding of future sentences?
what should we do about that?

translating macaronic german to english is a simplification of translating german to english.
in both cases, machine needs to use context.
but in the macaronic case, some of the work has already been done (yay).
54
simple case: guess one word
55
those who received high lohn later receive high pensions.
but that was more than 30 jahre ago.
context + spelling + previous exposure
competence model of student
context + previous exposure + spelling
cue combination, perhaps merely by naive bayes:
what english words would fit in this german word   s context?
have i seen this german word before, and how did i translate it then?
have i seen any of these german sounds/subwords before?
hill-climbing to deal with uncertainty:
translating one word provides more context for others

56
learning model of student
how does competence model change with exposure to macaronic text?
training data for standard mt learner:
une strat  gie r  publicaine pour contrer la r    lection d'obama
a republican strategy to counter the re-election of obama 
training data for our macaronic learner:
a republican strategy pour contrer the re-election d'obama 
guess what this means in english, using competence model
update competence model to predict that answer better (self-training)
57
learning model of student
training data for our macaronic learner:
a republican strategy pour contrer the re-election d'obama 
guess what this means in english, using competence model
update competence model to predict that answer better (self-training)

why might real learners diverge from this idealized model?
and from one another?
two natural answers:
learning doesn   t always succeed     updates are sometimes zero or small.
forgetting     parameters sometimes revert to prior values.  
so, model per learner when this tends to happen.  
certain types of parameters learn / forget at different rates?   
how sure do you have to be that you understood before you   ll update?
how hard do you try to understand in the first place?


58
simple case: guess one word
sentences from www.nachrichtenleicht.de
(news site in    simple german   )

mturkers are asked to guess the english word
given the german word or its english context or both
no german experience - find out what beginners can do 
can we model these human guesses?
if so, we can use that as the initial state of our competence model



59

harder task: interpret german sentence
mturkers are asked to translate a german sentence
they are allowed to peek first at some words     but not all

what words do they think they understand?
and are they right: do they actually understand them?
which words are most helpful in guessing which other words?
again, fit a competence model that we can start with.
and perhaps a learning model: do our subjects improve?

60

possible extensions to the system
intersperse quizzes with macaronic reading
provides an incentive to the student
gathers cleaner info about student   s current competence
demand macaronic writing too
ask student to write freely, macaronically if needed
similar to    inventive spelling    for young children
provides incentive to recall foreign words, learn gender, etc.
suggest modest edits to make text more foreign
speaking and listening 
others have worked on this; integrate with macaroni
