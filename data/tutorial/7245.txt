   sequence-to-sequence (id195) learning was introduced in 2014, and has
   since been extensively studied and extended to a large variety of
   domains. id195 yields state-of-the-art performance on several
   applications such as machine translation, image captioning, speech
   generation, or summarization. in this tutorial, we will survey the
   basics of this framework, its applications, main algorithmic techniques
   and future research directions.

   code to get started and understand the basics is [1]here.

   this tutorial will be given at [2]icml 2017 (sydney, australia) in
   august 2017.

   here are the slides for the talk.
