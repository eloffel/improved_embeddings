    1. 1. september 8-9, 2016
    2. [58]2. bigml, inc 2 ensembles poul petersen cio, bigml, inc making
       trees unstoppable
    3. [59]3. bigml, inc 3supervised learning     rather than build a single
       model        combine the output of several    weaker    models into a
       powerful ensemble        q1: why would this work?     q2: how do we build
          weaker    models?     q3: how do we    combine    models? ensemble idea
    4. [60]4. bigml, inc 4supervised learning 1. every    model    is an
       approximation of the    real    function and there may be several good
       approximations. 2. ml algorithms use random processes to solve
       np-hard problems and may arrive at di   erent    models    depending on
       the starting conditions, local optima, etc. 3. a given ml algorithm
       may not be able to exactly    model    the real characteristics of a
       particular dataset. 4. anomalies in the data may cause over-   tting,
       that is trying to model behavior that should be ignored. by using
       several models, the outliers may be averaged out. why ensembles in
       any case, if we find several accurate    models   , the combination may
       be closer to the real    model   
    5. [61]5. bigml, inc 5supervised learning ensemble demo #1
    6. [62]6. bigml, inc 6supervised learning weaker models 1. bootstrap
       aggregating - aka    id112    if there are    n    instances, each tree
       is trained with    n    instances, but they are sampled with
       replacement. 2. random decision forest - in addition to sampling
       with replacement, the tree randomly selects a subset of features to
       consider when making each split. this introduces a new parameter,
       the random candidates which is the number of features to randomly
       select before making the split.
    7. [63]7. bigml, inc 7supervised learning over-   tting example diameter
       color shape fruit 4 red round plum 5 red round apple 5 red round
       apple 6 red round plum 7 red round apple id112! random decision
       forest! all data:    plum    sample 2:    apple    sample 3:    apple    sample
       1:    plum    }   apple    what is a round, red 6cm fruit?
    8. [64]8. bigml, inc 8supervised learning 1. plurality - majority
       wins. 2. con   dence weighted - majority wins but each vote is
       weighted by the con   dence. 3. id203 weighted - each tree
       votes the distribution at it   s leaf node. 4. k threshold - only
       votes if the speci   ed class and required number of trees is met.
       for example, allowing a    true    vote if and only if at least 9 out
       of 10 trees vote    true   . 5. con   dence threshold - only votes the
       speci   ed class if the minimum con   dence is met. voting methods
       linear and non-linear combinations of votes using stacking

       interpretability increasing stochasticity increasing complexity

   12. [68]12. bigml, inc 12supervised learning     how many trees?     how
       many nodes?     missing splits?     random candidates?     too many

   14. [70]14. bigml, inc 3supervised learning     classi   cation implies a
       discrete objective. how can this be a regression?     why do we need
       another classi   cation algorithm?     more questions   . logistic
       regression id28 is a classification algorithm

       the data
   19. [75]19. bigml, inc 8supervised learning discrete data function?

   21. [77]21. bigml, inc 10supervised learning logistic function    x   -    :
       f(x)   0    x       : f(x)   1    looks promising, but still not     "discrete"

   23. [79]23. bigml, inc 12supervised learning     assumes that output is
       linearly related to "predictors"        but we can "   x" this with
       feature engineering     how do we "   t" the logistic function to real
       data? id28 lr is a classification algorithm     that
       models the id203 of the output class.
   24. [80]24. bigml, inc 13supervised learning id28       is
       the "intercept"       is the "coef   cient" the inverse of the logistic
       function is called the "logit": in which case solving is now a
       id75
   25. [81]25. bigml, inc 14supervised learning id28 if we
       have multiple dimensions, add more coef   cients:

   27. [83]27. bigml, inc 16supervised learning lr parameters 1. bias:
       allows an intercept term. important if p(x=0) != 0 2.
       id173:     l1: prefers zeroing individual coef   cients     l2:
       prefers pushing all coef   cients towards zero 3. eps: the minimum
       error between steps to stop. 4. auto-scaling: ensures that all
       features contribute equally.     unless there is a speci   c need to
       not auto-scale, it is recommended.
   28. [84]28. bigml, inc 17supervised learning id28     how
       do we handle multiple classes?     what about non-numeric inputs?
   29. [85]29. bigml, inc 18supervised learning lr - multi-class     instead
       of a binary class ex: [ true, false ], we have multi- class ex: [
       red, green, blue,     ]     k classes     solve one-vs-rest lr    
       coef   cients       for     each class
   30. [86]30. bigml, inc 19supervised learning lr - field codings     lr is
       expecting numeric values to perform regression.     how do we handle
       categorical values, or text? class color=red color=blue color=green
       color=null red 1 0 0 0 blue 0 1 0 0 green 0 0 1 0 null 0 0 0 1
       one-hot encoding only one feature is "hot" for each class

       freedom class color_1 color_2 color_3 *red* 0 0 0 blue 1 0 0 green

       between classes    . so which one? class    eld "in   uence" red 0.5

   33. [89]33. bigml, inc 22supervised learning lr - field codings     the
       "text" type gives us new features that have counts of the number of
       times each token occurs in the text    eld. "items" can be treated
       the same way. token "hippo" "safari" "zebra" instance_1 3 0 1

       we could add a feature where ???? possible to add any higher order
       terms or other functions to match shape of data
   36. [92]36. bigml, inc 25supervised learning id28 demo
       #3
   37. [93]37. bigml, inc 26supervised learning lr versus dt     expects a
       "smooth" linear relationship with predictors.     lr is concerned
       with id203 of a discrete outcome.     lots of parameters to get
       wrong:     id173, scaling, codings     slightly less prone to
       over-   tting        because    ts a shape, might work better when less
       data available.        adapts well to ragged non-linear relationships    
       no concern: classi   cation, regression, multi-class all    ne.    
       virtually parameter free        slightly more prone to over-   tting       
       prefers surfaces parallel to parameter axes, but given enough data
       will discover any shape. id28 decision tree
