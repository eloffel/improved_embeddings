       it stored?     what are the features?     can you access it
       programmatically?     feature engineering: transform the data you
       have into the data you actually need.     evaluate: try it on a small
       scale     accept that you might have to start over   .     but when it

       uses plain text to store tabular data.     in a csv    le, each row of
       the    le is an instance.     each column in a row is usually separated
       by a comma (,) but other "separators" like semi-colon (;), colon
       (:), pipe (|), can also be used. each row must contain the same
       number of    elds     but they can be null     fields can be quoted using
       double quotes (").     fields that contain commas or line separators
       must be quoted.     quotes (") in    elds must be doubled ("").     the
       character encoding must be utf-8     optionally, a csv    le can use
       the    rst line as a header to provide the names of each    eld. after
       all the data transformations, a csv (   comma-separated values) file
       has to be generated, following the rules below: select * from
       scores_last_label into outfile "./scores_last_label.csv"; select
       'name', 'address', 'city', 'state', 'postal_code', 'latitude',
