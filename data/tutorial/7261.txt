automating machine learning workflows

   by [20]jao on may 19, 2016

   [21]whizzml_logo

   machine learning (ml) services are quickly becoming a taken-for-granted
   part of the software developer   s toolbox, in any domain. these days,
   databases or networking are a standard component of almost any
   non-trivial application, so easily integrated that almost no special
   expertise is required. we expect to see machine learning becoming, in
   the very near future, a similar layer in the software stack.

   this commoditization of ml services has been driven so far by
   service-oriented platforms such as bigml, which have provided a key
   ingredient of the process: abstraction. simple and easy to use rest
   apis hide away not only the details of the sophisticated algorithms
   underlying the services at hand, but also the complexities of scaling
   those computations both over cpu cycles and input data volumes. a
   programmer no longer needs to be an expert in distributed systems or
   the fine details of implementing ml algorithmics in order to
   incorporate intelligent behaviour in her applications.

   or does she? the answer is, well, sometimes. machine learning platforms
   excel at hiding away the complexities of distributed computation, and
   are already providing powerful building blocks in the algorithmic
   department: id90, ensembles, id79s, anomaly
   detectors, automated feature engineering and many other pieces are
   already there. and, sometimes, they are enough to cover the needs of
   the end user. however, it is also often the case that the machine
   learning solution for non-trivial problems requires combining many of
   those primitives and algorithms into a complex workflow.

a fresh approach to automation

   machine learning workflows are most of the time iterative, and
   typically involve the creation of many intermediate datasets, models,
   evaluations and predicitions, all of them dynamically interwoven. there
   are many examples of such workflows, and we have covered in the past
   several of them in this very blog, from basic ones that automate
   repetitive tasks (e.g., create a dataset, filter it removing anomalies,
   then cluster it to label instances and finally model the result and
   make predictions) to sophisticated algorithms that enhance our machine
   learning arsenal (e.g., feature selection or hyperparameter
   optimization techinques).

   so, quite often, the predictive components of end-user applications are
   workflows that must be built on top of our machine learning platforms
   using a general purpose language such as python or java and its
   bindings to the corresponding platform   s simple and nice api. that is,
   we write client-side programs that combine server-side api calls to
   solve our problem.

   while effective, this way of automation destroys a good deal of the
   simplicity and abstraction that those apis had worked very had to
   provide. in particular, automation based on client-side programming
   against remote apis presents, among others, the following drawbacks:
     * complexity coding the workflow in a standard programming language
       implies worrying over details outside of the problem domain and not
       directly related to the machine learning task.
     * reuse rest apis such as bigml   s provide a uniform,
       language-agnostic interface for solving machine learning problems;
       however, the moment we codify a workflow using a specific
       programming language we lose that interoperability. for instance,
       workflows written in python, won   t be reusable by the node.js or
       java communities.
     * scalability complex, client-side workflows are potentially very
       hard to optimize, and they lose the automatic parallelism and
       scalability offered by sophisticated server-side services.
       furthermore, there are performance penalties inherent to the
       client-server paradigm: asynchronously pipelining a remote workflow
       introduces an extra number of intermediate delays just to check the
       status of a created resource before moving forward in the workflow.
     * client-server brittleness client-side programs need to take care of
       non-trivial error conditions derived from network failures. when
       any step in a complex workflow can potentially fail, handling
       errors and resuming from interruptions without losing valuable work
       already performed becomes a big challenge.

   in short, the underlying rest api is already providing an abstraction
   layer over computing resources and the nitty-gritty details of many
   algorithms, but client-side workflows are re-introducing inessential
   details in our workflow specifications.

   we need a way to recover for workflows the nice properties the ml
   platforms are already giving us for each step the workflow is made of.

   in the sofware engineering field, we have long known a very effective
   method to cure the kind of problems outlined above. to increase the
   abstraction level of our workflow descriptions and free them from
   inessential detail, we must express our solution in a new language that
   is closer to the domain at hand, i.e., machine learning and feature
   engineering. in other words, we need a domain-specific language, or
   dsl, for machine learning workflows.

   if you are a bigml user, chances are that you are already familiar with
   another dsl that the platform offers to perform feature synthesis and
   dataset transformations, namely, [22]flatline. with that
   domain-specific language, we offer a solution to the problem of
   specifying, via mostly declarative symbolic expressions, new fields
   synthesized from existing ones in a dataset that is traversed using a
   sliding window. the dsl lets you also name things and use those names
   inside your expressions, an archetypal means of abstraction.

   in flatline, we talk only of the domain we are in, namely features (old
   and new), as well as their combination and composition. also note how
   the flatline language is based on expressions for the new features we
   are creating, rather than a procedural sequence of instructions
   describing how to synthesize those features.

   now, we want to be able to formulate machine learning workflows with a
   similarly expressive dsl. and that is precisely what whizzml provides:
   a language specifically tailored to the domain of machine learning
   workflows, containing primitives for all the tasks available via
   bigml   s api (such as model creation or evaluation or dataset
   tranformation) and providing powerful means of composition, iteration,
   recursion and abstraction.

an example whizzml workflow

   to give you a quick flavor of what whizzml syntax looks like, here   s a
   very simple workflow. it generates a batchcentroid dataset from a
   source, encapsulating all the steps needed. namely, creating a dataset,
   creating a cluster, creating a batchcentroid and extracting the
   resulting dataset from it:
(define (one-click-batch-centroid src-id)
  (let (ds-id (create-and-wait "dataset" {"source" src-id})
        cl-id (create-and-wait "cluster" {"dataset" ds-id
                                          "default_numeric_value" "median"})
        bc-id (create-and-wait "batchcentroid" {"cluster" c-id
                                                "dataset" ds-id
                                                "output_dataset" true
                                                "all_fields" true}))
     (get (fetch bc-id) "output_dataset_resource")))

(define dataset-id (one-click-batch-centroid source-id))

   here, we can already recognize some of the qualities we have been
   discussing: the keywords define and let, which introduce new names for
   different artifacts: the identifiers of the dataset, cluster and
   batchcentroid that are created (ds-id, cl-id and bc-id), of a function,
   one-click-batch-centroid that encapsulates the workflow, and of the
   identifier of the resulting dataset, dataset-id, which will be the
   workflow   s output. we also see how primitives for the creation of bigml
   resources are readily available (create-and-wait-dataset, etc.), and
   take care of their time evolution (in this case, by waiting for their
   successful completion). all the steps of the workflow are thus
   trivially rendered.

   admittedly, careful use of high-level language bindings such as
   python   s can attain similar levels of readability for workflows as
   simple as this example. however, as you   ll see in other examples,
   whizzml   s readability scales better when the complexity of the workflow
   increases.

   moreover, there are other immediate advantages of using the whizzml
   script for expressing your workflow, even in this simple case. for one,
   it is automatically cross-language and available for any development
   platform. even more importantly, it is executable as a single unit
   fully on the server side, inside bigml   s system: there, we not only
   avoid the inefficiency of all the network calls needed by, say, a
   python script, but also automatically parallelize the job. in that way,
   we are recovering one of the big advantages of machine
   learning-as-a-service: scalability of the available machine learning
   tasks, which are mostly lost for composite workflows when using the
   traditional, bindings-based solution.

the power of reusability

   another very important advantage of using whizzml instead of
   client-side scripts written in your favorite programming language is
   that code written in whizzml becomes reusable server side resources.
   specifically, you have three kinds of resources at your disposal:

   [23]whizzml_actions
     * library a collection of whizzml definitions that can be imported by
       other libraries or scripts. libraries therefore do not describe
       directly executable workflows, but rather, new building blocks (in
       the form of new whizzml procedures, such as
       one-click-batch-centroid above) to be (re)used in other workflows.
     * script a whizzml script (as the ones we have seen in the previous
       section) has executable code and an optional list of parameters,
       settable at run time, that describe an actual workflow. scripts can
       use any of the whizzml primitives and standard library procedures.
       they can also import other libraries and use their exported
       definitions. when creating a script resource, users can provide a
       list of outputs in its metadata, in the form of a list of variable
       names defined in the script   s source code.
     * execution when a user creates a script, its syntax is checked and
       it gets pre-compiled and readied for execution. each script
       execution is described as a new bigml resource, with a dynamic
       status (from queued to started to running to finished) and a series
       of actual outputs. when creating an execution, besides the
       identifier of the script to be run, users will typically provide
       the actual values for the script   s free parameters (just as you
       provide its arguments    values, when you call a function in any
       programming language). it is also possible to pipe together several
       scripts in a single execution.

   workflow scripts written in whizzml are reusable server side resources,
   which makes whizzml   s procedural abstraction capabilities especially
   powerful. new procedures can be made available, as part of a library
   (just another kind of rest resource), to other scripts. we have thus
   gained the ability to define new machine learning primitives, climbing
   even higher in our abstraction layer, without losing the benefits of
   performance or scalability associated with a service-oriented platform
   such as bigml.
