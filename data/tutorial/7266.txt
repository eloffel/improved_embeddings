image recognition and understanding

y lecun

almost all modern image understanding systems use convnets.
google, facebook, microsoft, ibm, baidu, yahoo/flickr, adobe, yandex, wechat,
nec, nvidia, mobileye, qualcomm   .. everyone uses convnets
each of the 700 million photos uploaded on facebook every day goes through
two convnets:

1 for object recognition, 1 for face recognition.

the tesla autopilot uses a convnet
all the hardware companies are tuning their chips for running convnets

nvidia, intel, mobileye, qualcomm, samsung   ...
