(scisumm-corpus @ [85]https://github.com/wing-nus/scisumm-corpus)

   this package contains a release of training and test topics to aid in
   the development of computational linguistics summarization systems.

   the cl-scisumm shared task is run off the cl-scisumm corpus, and
   comprises three sub-tasks in automatic research paper summarization on
   a new corpus of research papers. a training corpus of forty topics has
   been released. a test corpus of ten topics will be released. the topics
   comprise of acl computational linguistics research papers, and their
   citing papers and t hree output summaries each. the three output
   summaries comprise: the traditional self-summary of the paper (the
   abstract), the community summary (the collection of citation sentences
      citances   ) and a human summary written by a trained annotator. within
   the corpus, each citance is also mapped to its referenced text in the
   reference paper and tagged with the information facet it represents.

   the manually annotated training set of 40 articles and citing papers is
   already available for download and can be used by participants. this
   data can be found in
   /data/training-set-2019/task1/from-training-set-2018 and
   /data/training-set-2019/task2/from-training-set-2018

   new changes for cl-scisumm 2019 further, this year we have introduced
   1000 document sets that were automatically annotated to be used as
   training data. this training data was generated following nomoto,2018.
   this data can be found in
   /data/training-set-2019/task1/from-scisummnet-2019. note that the
   auto-annotated data is available only for task 1a. no discourse facet
   is provided for the classification task: task1b. we recommend you to
   use the auto-anootated data only for training 'reference span
   selection' models for task 1a and use the manually annotated training
   data from 40 document sets for task1b.

   further, for task 2 one thousand summaries that were released as part
   of the scisummnet (yasunga et al., 2019) have been included as human
   summaries to train on. this data can be found in
   /data/training-set-2019/task2/from-scisummnet-2019

   the test set of 20 articles is available in /data/test-set-2018. this
   is a blind test set, that is, the ground truth is withheld. the system
   outputs from the test set should be submitted to the task organizers,
   for the collation of the final results to be presented at the workshop.

   for more details, see the contents section at the bottom of this
   readme. to know how this corpus was constructed, please see
   ./docs/corpusconstruction.txt

   results of the cl-scisumm-19 will be released in the birndl workshop
   collocated with [86]acm sigir 2019, paris, france. [87]go to task
   website.

readme for the 5th computational linguistics scientific document
summarization shared task corpus (cl-scisumm 2019)

   march 19, 2019

   please read further for details on the computational linguistics shared
   task run as part of birndl 2019 workshop collocated with sigir 2018 -
   official website hosted at:
   [89]http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2019

overview

   you are invited to participate in the cl-scisumm shared task at birndl
   2019. the shared task will be on automatic paper summarization in the
   computational linguistics (cl) domain. the output summaries will be of
   two types: faceted summaries of the traditional self-summary (the
   abstract) and the community summary (the collection of citation
   sentences    citances   ). we also propose to group the citances by the
   facets of the text that they refer to.

   this task follows up on the successful previous editions at sigir 2018,
   sigir 2017, jcdl 2016 and the pilot task conducted as a part of the
   biomedsumm track at the text analysis conference 2014 (tac 2014).

   the task is defined as follows:

   given: a topic consisting of a reference paper (rp) and [del: upto 10
   :del] citing papers (cps) that all contain citations to the rp. in each
   cp, the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain
   to a particular citation to the rp.
     * task 1a: for each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text
       spans) in the rp that most accurately reflect the citance. these
       are of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or
       several consecutive sentences (no more than 5).
     * task 1b: for each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper
       it belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.
     * task 2 (optional bonus task): finally, generate a structured
       summary of the rp from the cited text spans of the rp. the length
       of the summary should not exceed 250 words.

   evaluation: task 1 will be scored by overlap of text spans measured by
   number of sentences in the system output vs gold standard. task 2 will
   be scored using the id8 family of metrics between i) the system
   output and the gold standard summary fromt the reference spans ii) the
   system output and the asbtract of the reference paper. again, task 2 is
   optional.

   xml format in utf-8 character encoding. the file corresponds to the
   similarly named pdf file in documents_pdf/. all annotations and offsets
   for the topic are with respect to the xml files in this directory. all
   the files were created from the pdf file using adobe acrobat.
   note that there were ocr errors in reading several of the files, and
   the annotators often had to manually edit the converted txt files.
   research groups using are free to use alternative parsing tools on the
   pdfs provided, if they are found to perform better.

./data/training-set-2019/task1/from-scisummnet-2019/???-????/annotation/

   this directory contains the annotation files for the topic, from 3
   different annotators.

   the summary task (task 2) is an optional, "bonus" task which
   participants may want to attempt. this directory contains the two kinds
   of summaries - i. the abstract, and ii.human written summaries of the
   reference paper.

annotation

   given a reference paper (rp) and 10 or more citing papers (cps),
   annotators from the university of hyderbad were instructed to find
   citations to the rp in the cps. annotators followed instructions in
   scisumm-annotation-guidelines.pdf to mark the citation text, citation
   marker, reference text, and discourse facet for each citation of the rp
   found in the cp.
