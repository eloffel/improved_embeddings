what	is	nlp?

unstructured
ambiguous
lots	and	lots	of	it!

humans	can	read	them,	but
    very	slowly
    can   t	remember	all
    can   t	answer	questions

information	
extraction

   knowledge   

structured
precise,	actionable
specific	to	the	task

can	be	used	for	downstream
applications,	such	as	creating
knowledge	graphs!
