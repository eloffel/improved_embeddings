matrices, tensors, and neural networks

probabilistic models: downsides

limitation to logical relations

    representation restricted by manual design

    id91? assymetric implications?
   

information flows through these relations

    difficult to generalize to unseen entities/relations

computational complexity of algorithms
    complexity depends on explicit dimensionality

    often np-hard, in size of data
    more rules, more expensive id136
    query-time id136 is sometimes np-hard
    not trivial to parallelize, or use gpus

embeddings

    everything as dense vectors
    can capture many relations
   

learned from data

    complexity depends on 

   

latent dimensions
learning using stochastic 
gradient, back-propagation

    querying is often cheap
    gpu-parallelism friendly

embeddings ~ logical relations
relation embeddings, w
    similar embedding for 2 relations denote they are paraphrases

    is married to, spouseof(x,y), /person/spouse

    one embedding can be contained by another

    w(topemployeeof)     w(employeeof)
    topemployeeof(x,y)     employeeof(x,y)

    can capture logical patterns, without needing to specify them!

entity pair embeddings, v

similar entity pairs denote similar 
relations between them
entity pairs may describe multiple

matrix vs tensor factorization

    vectors for each entity pair
    can only predict for entity pairs that 

appear in text together

    no sharing for same entity in different 

entity pairs

    vectors for each entity
    assume entity pairs are    low-rank   

    but many relations are not!

compositional neural models

so far, we   re learning vectors for each entity/surface pattern/relation..

but learning vectors independently ignores    composition   

composition in surface patterns

composition in relation paths

    every surface pattern is not unique

    every relation path is not unique

    synonymy:

a is b   s spouse.
a is married to b.

    explicit:

a parent b, b parent c

a grandparent c

   

inverse:

x is y   s parent.
y is one of x   s children.

   

implicit:

x bornincity y, y cityinstate z

x    borninstate    z

    can the representation learn this?

    can the representation capture this?
