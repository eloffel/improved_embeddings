   id13s have become an increasingly crucial component in
   machine intelligence systems, powering ubiquitous digital assistants
   and inspiring several large scale academic projects across the globe.
   our tutorial explains why id13s are important, how knowledge
   graphs are constructed, and where new research opportunities exist for
   improving the state-of-the-art. in this tutorial, we cover the many
   sophisticated approaches that complete and correct id13s. we
   organize this exploration into two main classes of models. the first
   include probabilistic logical frameworks that use id114,
   id93, or statistical rule mining to construct id13s.
   the second class of models includes latent space models such as matrix
   and tensor factorization and neural networks. we conclude the tutorial
   with a critical comparison of techniques and results. we will offer
   practical advice for novices to identify common empirical challenges
   and concrete data sets for initial experimentation. finally, we will
   highlight promising areas of current and future work.

   our goal is to present an accessible and structured overview of the
   existing approaches to extracting candidate facts from text and
   incorporating these into a well-formed id13. our approach
   includes identifying the common themes and challenges in the area, and
   comparing and contrasting the existing approaches on the basis of these
   aspects. we believe such a unifying framework will provide the
   necessary tools and perspectives to enable the newcomers to the field
   to explore, evaluate, and develop novel techniques for automated
   id13 construction.
