    3. [63]3. 1.the recommender problem
    4. [64]4. the    recommender problem        traditional definition: estimate
       a utility function that automatically predicts how much a user will
       like an item.     based on: o past behavior o relations to other
       users o item similarity o context o    
    5. [65]5. recommendation as data mining the core of the recommendation
       engine can be assimilated to a general data mining problem

   10. [70]10. what works     depends on the domain and particular problem    
       however, in the general case it has been demonstrated that the best
       isolated approach is cf. o other approaches can be hybridized to
       improve results in specific cases (cold-start problem...)     what
       matters: o id174: outlier removal, denoising, removal
       of global effects (e.g. individual user's average) o    smart   
       id84 using mf o combining methods through
       ensembles
   11. [71]11. 2. the netflix prize
   12. [72]12. what we were interested in:     high quality recommendations
       proxy question:     accuracy in predicted rating     improve by 10% =
       $1million!
   13. [73]13. 2007 progress prize     top 2 algorithms     svd - prize rmse:
       0.8914     rbm - prize rmse: 0.8990     linear blend prize rmse: 0.88    
       currently in use as part of netflix    rating prediction component    
       limitations     designed for 100m ratings, not xb ratings     not
       adaptable as users add ratings     performance issues
   14. [74]14. what about the final prize ensembles?     offline studies
       showed they were too computationally intensive to scale     expected
       improvement not worth engineering effort     plus   . focus had already
       shifted to other issues that had more impact than rating
       prediction.
   15. [75]15. 3. beyond rating prediction
   16. [76]16. everything is a recommendation
   17. [77]17. evolution of the recommender problem rating ranking page
       optimization 4.7 context-aware recommendations context
   18. [78]18. 3.1 ranking
   19. [79]19. ranking     most recommendations are presented in a sorted
       list     recommendation can be understood as a ranking problem    
       popularity is the obvious baseline     what about rating predictions?
   20. [80]20. ranking by ratings 4.7 4.6 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5

       two features, linear model
   24. [84]24. learning to rank     machine learning problem: goal is to
       construct ranking model from training data     training data can be a
       partial order or binary judgments (relevant/not relevant).    
       resulting order of the items typically induced from a numerical
       score     learning to rank is a key element for personalization     you
       can treat the problem as a standard supervised classification
       problem
   25. [85]25. learning to rank - metrics     quality of ranking measured
       using metrics as o normalized discounted cumulative gain o mean
       reciprocal rank (mrr) o fraction of concordant pairs (fcp) o
       others        but, it is hard to optimize machine-learned models
       directly on these measures (e.g. non-differentiable)     recent
       research on models that directly optimize ranking measures
   26. [86]26. goal: present most interesting stories for a user at a
       given time interesting = topical relevance + social relevance +
       timeliness stories = questions + answers ml: personalized
       learning-to-rank approach relevance-ordered vs time-ordered = big
       gains in engagement

       questions will be interesting?     not only about similarity, but
       also    interestingness        features such as:     textual     co-visit    
       topics             important for logged-out use case

   31. [91]31. example of graph-based similarity: simrank     simrank (jeh &
       widom, 02):    two objects are similar if they are referenced by
       similar objects.   
   32. [92]32. similarity ensembles     similarity can refer to different
       dimensions     similar in metadata/tags     similar in user play
       behavior     similar in user rating behavior             combine them using
       an ensemble     weights are learned using regression over existing
       response     or    some mab explore/exploit approach     the final
       concept of    similarity    responds to what users vote as similar
   33. [93]33. 3.3 social recommendations
   34. [94]34. recommendations - users     goal: recommend new users to
       follow     based on:     other users followed     topics followed     user
       interactions     user-related features     ...

       using the interaction as an opportunity to learn more about the
       user     we need to have informed and optimal strategies to drive

   61. [121]61. implicit vs. explicit     many have acknowledged that
       implicit feedback is more useful     is implicit feedback really
       always more useful?     if so, why?
   62. [122]62.     implicit data is (usually):     more dense, and available
       for all users     better representative of user behavior vs. user
       reflection     more related to final objective function     better
       correlated with ab test results     e.g. rating vs watching implicit
       vs. explicit
   63. [123]63.     however     it is not always the case that direct implicit
       feedback correlates well with long-term retention     e.g. clickbait
           solution:     combine different forms of implicit + explicit to
       better represent long-term goal implicit vs. explicit

       going to the cinema to watch a movie and rate it    highly    by using
       purchase history and previous ratings. use ndcg of the ranking as
       final metric using only movies rated 4 or higher as positives.

   78. [138]78. ensembles & feature engineering     ensembles are the way to
       turn any model into a feature!     e.g. don   t know if the way to go
       is to use factorization machines, tensor factorization, or id56s?
