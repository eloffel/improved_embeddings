can we figure out that these have the same meaning?
xyz corporation bought the stock.
they sold the stock to xyz corporation.
the stock was bought by xyz corporation.
the purchase of the stock by xyz corporation... 
the stock purchase by xyz corporation...

a shallow semantic representation: semantic roles
predicates (bought, sold, purchase) represent an event
semantic roles express the abstract role that arguments of a predicate can take in the event

semantic roles
getting to semantic roles
neo-davidsonian event representation:

sasha broke the window
pat opened the door

subjects of break and open: breaker and opener
deep roles specific to each event (breaking, opening)
hard to reason about them for nlu applications like qa
7
thematic roles
breaker and opener have something in common!
volitional actors
often animate
direct causal responsibility for their events
thematic roles are a way to capture this semantic commonality between breakers and eaters. 
they are both agents. 
the brokenthing and openedthing, are themes.
prototypically inanimate objects affected in some way by the action



8
thematic roles
one of the oldest linguistic models
indian grammarian panini between the 7th and 4th centuries bce 
modern formulation from fillmore (1966,1968), gruber (1965)
fillmore influenced by lucien tesni  re   s (1959) e  l  ments de syntaxe structurale, the book that introduced dependency grammar
fillmore first referred to roles as actants (fillmore, 1966) but switched to the term case
9
thematic roles
a typical set:

10
thematic grid, case frame,   -grid
11
thematic grid, case frame,   -grid
break:
    agent, theme, instrument. 
example usages of    break   
some realizations:
diathesis alternations (or verb alternation)
dative alternation: particular semantic classes of verbs,    verbs of future having    (advance, allocate, offer, owe),    send verbs    (forward, hand, mail),    verbs of throwing    (kick, pass, throw), etc.
levin (1993): 47 semantic classes (   levin classes   ) for 3100 english verbs and alternations. in online resource verbnet.
12
break: agent, instrument, or theme as subject

give:  theme and goal in either order

problems with thematic roles
hard to create standard set of roles or formally define them
often roles need to be fragmented to be defined.
levin and rappaport hovav (2015): two kinds of instruments
intermediary instruments that can appear as subjects 
the cook opened the jar with the new gadget. 
the new gadget opened the jar. 
enabling instruments that cannot
shelly ate the sliced banana with a fork. 
*the fork ate the sliced banana. 



13
alternatives to thematic roles
fewer roles: generalized semantic roles, defined as prototypes (dowty 1991)
proto-agent 
proto-patient 

more roles: define roles specific to a group of predicates

propbank
id14
the proposition bank (propbank)
propbank
palmer, martha, daniel gildea, and paul kingsbury. 2005. the proposition bank: an annotated corpus of semantic roles. computational linguistics, 31(1):71   106 

16
propbank roles
proto-agent
volitional involvement in event or state
sentience (and/or perception)
causes an event or change of state in another participant 
movement (relative to position of another participant)
proto-patient
undergoes change of state
causally affected by another participant
stationary relative to movement of another participant



17
following dowty 1991
propbank roles
following dowty 1991
role definitions determined verb by verb, with respect to the other roles 
semantic roles in propbank are thus verb-sense specific.
each verb sense has numbered argument: arg0, arg1, arg2,   
arg0: proto-agent
arg1: proto-patient
arg2: usually: benefactive, instrument, attribute, or end state
arg3: usually: start point, benefactive, instrument, or attribute
arg4 the end point
(arg2-arg5 are not really that consistent, causes a problem for labeling)

27
framenet
baker et al. 1998, fillmore et al. 2003, fillmore and baker 2009, ruppenhofer et al. 2006 
roles in propbank are specific to a verb
role in framenet are specific to a frame: a background knowledge structure that defines a set of frame-specific semantic roles, called frame elements, 
includes a set of pred cates that use these roles
each word evokes a frame and profiles some aspect of the frame


28
the    change position on a scale    frame
this frame consists of words that indicate the change of an item   s position on a scale (the attribute) from a starting point (initial value) to an end point (final value)

id14
id14 algorithm
id14 (srl) 
the task of finding the semantic roles of each argument of each predicate in a sentence.
framenet versus propbank:

39
history
semantic roles as a intermediate semantics, used early in
machine translation (wilks, 1973)
question-answering (hendrix et al., 1973)
spoken-language understanding (nash-webber, 1975)
dialogue systems (bobrow et al., 1977)
early srl systems
simmons 1973, marcus 1980: 
parser followed by hand-written rules for each verb
dictionaries with verb-specific case frames (levin 1977) 



40
why id14
a useful shallow semantic representation
improves nlp tasks like:
id53 
shen and lapata 2007, surdeanu et al. 2011
machine translation 
liu and gildea 2010, lo et al. 2013

41
a simple modern algorithm
42
how do we decide what is a predicate
if we   re just doing propbank verbs
choose all verbs
possibly removing light verbs (from a list)
if we   re doing framenet (verbs, nouns, adjectives)
choose every word that was labeled as a target in training data
43
id14
44
features
headword of constituent
examiner
headword pos
nnp
voice of the clause
active
subcategorization of pred
vp -> vbd np pp


45
named entity type of constit
organization
first and last words of constit
the, examiner
linear position,clause re: predicate
	before

path features
path in the parse tree from the constituent to the predicate 



46
frequent path features
47
from palmer, gildea, xue 2010
final feature vector
for    the san francisco examiner   , 
arg0, [issued, np, examiner, nnp, active, before, vp   np pp, org, the, examiner,                         ]

other features could be used as well
sets of id165s inside the constituent
other path features
the upward or downward halves
whether particular nodes occur in the path 

48
3-step version of srl algorithm
pruning: use simple heuristics to prune unlikely constituents. 
identification: a binary classification of each node as an argument to be labeled or a none. 
classification: a 1-of-n classification of all the constituents that were labeled as arguments by the previous stage 

49
why add pruning and identification steps?
algorithm is looking at one predicate at a time
very few of the nodes in the tree could possible be arguments of that one predicate
imbalance between 
positive samples (constituents that are arguments of predicate)
negative samples (constituents that are not arguments of predicate)
imbalanced data can be hard for many classifiers
so we prune the very unlikely constituents first, and then use a classifier to get rid of the rest.
50
pruning heuristics     xue and palmer (2004)
add sisters of the predicate, then aunts, then great-aunts, etc
but ignoring anything in a coordination structure

51




a common final stage: joint id136
the algorithm so far classifies everything locally     each decision about a constituent is made independently of all others
but this can   t be right: lots of global or joint interactions between arguments
constituents in framenet and propbank must be non-overlapping. 
a local system may incorrectly label two overlapping constituents as arguments 
propbank does not allow multiple identical arguments
labeling one constituent arg0 
thus should increase the id203 of another being arg1 





52
how to do joint id136
reranking
the first stage srl system produces multiple possible labels for each constituent
the second stage classifier the best global label for all constituents
often a classifier that takes all the inputs along with other features (sequences of labels)
53
more complications: framenet
we need an extra step to find the frame
54

frame     classifyframe(predicate,predicatevector)

56
not just verbs: nombank 
57
meyers et al. 2004
figure from jiang and ng 2006
additional issues for nouns
features:
nominalization lexicon (employment    employ)
morphological stem
healthcare, medicate     care
different positions
most arguments of nominal predicates occur inside the np
others are introduced by support verbs
especially light verbs     x made an argument   ,    y took a nap   

58
id14
conclusion
id14
a level of shallow semantics for representing events and their participants
intermediate between parses and full semantics
two common architectures, for various languages
framenet: frame-specific roles
propbank: proto-roles
current systems extract by 
parsing sentence
finding predicates in the sentence
for each one, classify each parse tree constituent
