this report is prepared based on walkerton hospital admissions data. it is part of the 
ecads project led by dr. richard davies (rfdavies@ottawaheart.ca). we investigate the 
extent to which the hospital admissions data reveals the effects of the walkerton crypto 
outbreak in mid/late may 2000.

we tested many variants of spatial scan, listed (with cryptic names) in the first column
column 2 shows that if you set your alarm threshold high enough that there   d be an alarm on may 
18th, all methods would produce hundreds of additional alarms on other occasions throughout the 
three years. 
column 3 shows that detecting may 19th involves far fewer false alarms, especially for the ewma 
models

now we imagine a vastly more general kind of monitoring. a method which is not 
told what sydrome, hospital, city or demographics to look for, but just to find 
anything that   s strange on each day and to assess accurately how significant this 
is.
the univariate methods were told what to watch (gi) and where (walkerton)
the spatial methods were told what to watch (gi) but not where
the following method is meant to be a kind of safety net for entirely unanticipated 
things. there are papers about it on the auton lab website.

    want to try some other univariate methods
    get better spatial coding of home locations?
    should do a search for other syndromes/locations with increase early in 

outbreak

    search on other spatial regions centered on walkerton
    run wsare on data in which all the syndrome==other records are removed
    analyse the chief complaint strings to see if there was a pattern in those 

strings in the days leading up to may 19th that is more specific than the gi 
syndrome coded by coco

    get hold of data about which three-letter postcodes are in which water supply 

regions and allow home-water-region as another feature in the data
