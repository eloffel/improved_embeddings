these arrows can be interpreted   
    causally (then it   s called an influence diagram)
    probabilistically (if i know the value of my parent nodes, then knowing 
other nodes above me would provide no extra information: conditional 
independence

real-sized bayes nets

how do you 
build them? 
from experts 
and/or from 
data!
how do you use 
them? predict 
values that are 
expensive or 
impossible to 
measure. decide 
which possible 
problems to 
investigate first.

building bayes nets

    bayes nets are sometimes built manually, 

consulting domain experts for structure 
and probabilities.

    more often the structure is supplied by 

experts, but the probabilities learned from 
data.

    and in some cases the structure, as well 

as the probabilities, are learned from data.

example: pathfinder

pathfinder system. (heckerman, probabilistic similarity 
networks, mit press, cambridge ma).

    diagnostic system for lymph-node diseases.
   
   
   

60 diseases and 100 symptoms and test-results.
14,000 probabilities.
expert consulted to make net.

    8 hours to determine variables.
    35 hours for net topology.
    40 hours for id203 table values.

   

apparently, the experts found it quite easy to invent 

the causal links and probabilities.

pathfinder is now outperforming the world experts in 
diagnosis.  being extended to several dozen other medical 
domains.
