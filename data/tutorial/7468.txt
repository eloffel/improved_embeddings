cl for lrl

questions of interest
    what is a low-resource language? (aka less-studied 

language, resource-poor language, minority language, 
less-privileged language, ...)

    what are the challenges posed by lrl, and what are 

the major approaches to addressing these challenges?

cl for lrl

questions of interest
    what is a low-resource language? (aka less-studied 

language, resource-poor language, minority language, 
less-privileged language, ...)

    what are the challenges posed by lrl, and what are 

the major approaches to addressing these challenges?

some major themes
    role of labeled/annotated data
    role of expert/linguistic knowledge (anno & beyond)
    single language vs.    universal    solutions
    resource creation: does it always make sense? how 

can it be done most efficiently?

language endangerment

language loss
    current estimated rate of language death: one every 2 

weeks (crystal 2000)

    half of world  s languages extinct by end this century
    unesco endangered languages programme (under 
auspices of section on intangible cultural heritage)

    un general assembly: 2008 was international year of 

languages

unesco endangerment status
    six levels: safe, unsafe (or vulnerable), definitively 
endangered, severely endangered, critically 
endangered
    criteria go beyond number of speakers

evaluating language endangerment

criteria to consider (unesco 2003)
    intergenerational language transmission
    absolute number of speakers
    proportion of speakers  within the total population
    trends in existing language domains
    response to new domains and media
    materials for language education and literacy
    governmental and institutional attitudes and policies, 

including official status and use

    community members   attitudes toward their own 

language

    amount and quality of documentation

documenting endangered languages

the realities
    most projects are individual or small-group endeavors 

with very small budgets

    each project seems to find its own workflow
    basic workflow: collection, transcription, translation, 

detailed linguistic annotation (not a pipeline)

    tangible end products: orthographies, grammars, 

dictionaries, language teaching and learning materials, 
collections of stories, websites, etc.

    such materials support survival of the language
    do they support cl/nlp???

challenges and approaches

having to do with insufficiency of data
    create more data?
    leverage resource-rich languages
    use semi- or unsupervised methods
    use rule-based methods
    ...

having to do with the nature of the data
    use linguistic knowledge to seed unsupervised models
    use linguistic knowledge to adapt models/approaches
    change the data to look more like familiar languages
    ...
