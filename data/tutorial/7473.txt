tutorial slides by andrew moore

   the decision tree is one of the most popular classification algorithms
   in current use in data mining and machine learning. this tutorial can
   be used as a self-contained introduction to the flavor and terminology
   of data mining without needing to review many statistical or
   probabilistic pre-requisites. if you're new to data mining you'll enjoy
   it, but your eyebrows will raise at how simple it all is! after having
   defined the job of classification, we explain how information gain
   (next andrew tutorial) can be used to find predictive input attributes.
   we show how applying this procedure recursively allows us to build a
   decision tree to predict future events. we then look carefully at a
   question so fundamental, it is the basis for much of all statistics and
   machine learning theory: how do you choose between a complicated model
   that fits the data really well and an    occam's razor    model that is
   succinct yet not so good at fitting data (this topic will be revisited
   in later andrew lectures, including    cross-validation    and
      vc-dimension   ). we also discuss the very wide world of improvements
   and tweaks on the basic decision tree idea.

   advertisment: i have recently joined google, and am starting up the new
   google pittsburgh office on cmu's campus. we are hiring creative
   computer scientists who love programming, and machine learning is one
   the focus areas of the office. if you might be interested, feel welcome
   to send me email: awm@google.com .
