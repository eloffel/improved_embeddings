game theory

a pure strategy for a player is a mapping from all the possible states 
that player could see to the move the player would make.

four pure strategies for a:

a   s strategy i:  (1   l , 4   l) 
a   s strategy ii:  (1   l , 4   r)
a   s strategy iii:  (1   r , 4   l)
a   s strategy iv:  (1   r , 4   r)

three pure strategies for b:

b   s strategy i:  (2   l , 3   r)
b   s strategy ii:  (2   m , 3   r) 
b   s strategy iii:  (2   r , 3   r)

in general, if each player can see n
possible states, and there are b moves 
from each state, how many pure 
strategies?

a can decide from this matrix which 
strategy is best.  for each strategy, a
considers the worst-case counter strategy 
by b.  a chooses the row with the 
maximum minimum value.  for a, the 
value of the game is this value.
in this example a chooses a-ii, and says game has 
value 3.
when b decides which strategy is best, b 
searches for which column has the 
minimum maximum value.
in this example, b chooses b-ii, and says game has 
value 3.

fundamental game theory result (proved by von neumann):

in a 2-player, zero-sum game of perfect information, 
minimax==maximin.  and there always exists an optimal 
pure strategy for each player.

makes a choice, but instead a random decision is made

two person zero-sum finite games, 

hidden information

examples:  poker, 2-player bridge, scrabble, diplomacy.  this gets 
very interesting.
bottom line: foundations of economic theory and    multiple agent   
decision-making start here.
bad news: the computational complexity of these foundations makes 
chess look like integer multiplication.
imagine a version of mini-poker in which red cards are bad for a and 
black cards are good.
player a is dealt a card.  it is red or black with 50% id203.

a may resign if the card is red: a loses 20c
else a    holds   .

b may then resign:  a wins 10c
b may    see   :

if card is red:  a loses 40c
if card is black: a wins 30c

mini-poker pure strategies

in games of hidden 
information, pure 
strategies are mappings 
from all possible states 
that the player can 
detect to moves.

between these.

for player a there are two pure strategies:

strategy resigner: resign if card = red
strategy holder: hold if card = red

for player b there are two pure strategies:

strategy resigner: resign if a holds
strategy  seer:

if a holds then see

if a is a resigner, how much will a win on average?  depends on b   s strategy!
if b is a resigner, how much will a win on average?  depends on a   s strategy.

with hidden information, minimax no longer necessarily equals maximin.
a   s optimal strategy depends on b   s and vice versa.  what can we do?  what should a 
computer program for playing a do?

slide 12

von neumann   s game theoretic 

values for games of hidden 

information

it turns out for the game of mini-poker, the game 
theoretic value for a is 1c.  a can expect to win 1 
cent per game on average if a does the right thing.

furthermore, a can even tell b in advance what 
a   s strategy is.  that information will not help b!

slide 13

mixed strategies

the trick is that a must not use a pure strategy, 
but a mixed strategy, in which at the start of the 
game (before play) a selects which pure strategy it 
will use for that game at random.  and there will be 
an optimal id203 distribution for it.

for mini-poker, a must decide to be a holder with 
id203 p and a resigner with id203 1-p.  
how do we compute the optimal p?

and the expected profit is 1 cent if b is a resigner.
what if b uses a mixed strategy (choose seer with prob q and resigner with 
prob 1-q)?

    say player a will use strategy i with prob p.
    compute player a   s expected gains if b uses pure strategy 1: m11p +   

m21(1-p)

    compute player a   s gains if b uses pure strategy 2: m12p + m22(1-p)
    find the p between 0 and 1 that maximizes
min( m11p + m21(1-p) , m12p + m22(1-p) )

since the two lines are, er, linear, the optimum will be either at p = 0, or p
= 1, or at the p which makes the two expressions equal.

say player a will use strategy n with prob pn.

you are planning a meal out with your date.  unfortunately both you and your 
date happen to be game theorists.  worse still (and with desperate 
implausibility) you have diametrically opposed views as to what makes a good 
meal.  you agree that in order to decide:

you   ll choose between mexican and thai food.
your companion will choose the location from: atwood street, walnut 
street, or monroeville.
you will choose simultaneously.

you generally like mexican food.  the mexican at atwood street gives you 
three units of gustatory joy.  the walnut mexican gives you just one unit.  but 
the monroeville mexican is -4 units: you strongly dislike that mall-style cuisine.  
as for thai, you are not so keen.  monroeville offers reasonable thai (one unit).  
atwood you dislike (-3 units) and walnut street   s thai is also bad, giving you -2 
units of joy.
as mentioned, your companion has opposite tastes: any joy units you have are 
negated from your companion   s perspective.  your companion would wish to 
minimize your joy units as much as you wish to maximize them. fearing your 
companion   s game theoretic powers of analysis, what is your minimax optimal 
mixed strategy for selecting between mexican and thai dinner?  and what is 
your expected number of gustatory joy units?

what you should know
    understand the meaning of, and how to

    understand principles of decision making in
