in a bayesian game each player is given a type.  all 
players know their own types but only a prob. dist. for their

negotiation: a bayesian game

two players:

ts = [0,1]

tb = [0,1]

s, (seller) and
b, (buyer)
the seller   s type is a real number between 0 
and 1 specifying the value (in dollars) to 
them of the object they are selling
the buyer   s type is also a real number.  the 
value to the buyer.

assume that at the start

vs    ts is chosen uniformly at random
vb    tb is chosen uniformly at random

copyright    2001, andrew w. moore

non-zero-sum game theory: slide  45

the    double auction    negotiation

s   writes down a price for the item   (gs)
b   simultaneously writes down a price  (gb)
prices are revealed
if   gs = gb no trade occurs, both players have 

payoff 0

then buyer pays the midpoint price    

if   gs = gb
(gs+gb)

2            and receives the item

similar algebra shows: e

[ vb | trade ]     2/3e

[ vs | trade ] =

[ profit to b | trade occurred ] = 1/4 also

using this game

if both were    honest   

[ b   s profit ]= 1/4x9/32=0.07
[ s   s profit ]=                 0.07

[ b profit ]=1/12=0.083
[ s profit ]=1/12=0.083

double auction: final comments
    there are other nash equilibrium strategies.
    but the one we saw is provably most 

efficient.

    in general, even for arbitrary prob. dists. of 

vs and vb, no efficient ne   s can exist.

    and no other games for this kind of trading 

can exist and be efficient.

double auction discussion

what if seller used    giant eagle    tactics?
seller states    i   ll sell it to you for price p : take it or leave it   
exercise:
    how should* seller choose price (taking into account vs of 

course) ?

    and how should* buyer choose whether to buy ?

*(at a b.n.e.)

    when could/should double auction technology be 

used?
(how) can    vs,vb drawn randomly from [0,1]    be 
relaxed ?

first price sealed bid

seller wants to sell an object that has no value to 

seller    anything seller is paid is pure profit.

there are n available buyers
assumptions:
    assume buyer i has a value for the object   
distributed uniformly randomly in [0   1]    vi
    assume v i   s all independent
    buyer i does not know vj for i?j
    buyer i does know all vj   s randomly generated from 
[0,1]

first price sealed bid rules

each buyer writes down their bid.

call buyer i   s bid   gi
buyer who wrote highest bid must buy 
object from seller at price=bid

question: why is    bid = vi    a stupid 
strategy ??

copyright    2001, andrew w. moore

non-zero-sum game theory: slide  55

auction analysis: back to 

bayesian nash equils

we   ll assume that all 
players other than i do a 
linear strategy:
gj*(vj) = mjvj

for  j ? i

then what should i do ?

this assumption is 
completely unjustified 
right now. later we   ll 
see why it was an 
okay assumption to 
make.

(cid:216) no more efficient
