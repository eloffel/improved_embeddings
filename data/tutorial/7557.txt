    what next?

what is           ? 

    interactive scienti   c computing framework

what is           ? 

    interactive scienti   c computing framework

what is           ? 

    similar to matlab / python+numpy

what is           ? 

    easy integration into and from c 
    example: using cudnn functions

what is           ? 

    strong gpu support

neural networks

    nn: neural networks made easy 
    building blocks of differentiable modules

autograd by 

    write imperative programs 
    backprop de   ned for every operation in the language

distributed learning

    multi-gpu and multi-node 
    distlearn by  

    mpi-like model 
   

scales to a large amount of nodes

core philosophy

    interactive computing 

    no compilation time 

    imperative programming 

    easy to understand, think and debug 

    minimal abstraction 

    thinking linearly 

    maximal flexibility 

    no constraints on interfaces or classes

    id170 

    viterbi style decoders

a next-gen framework

    interop with environments 
    like universe, vizdoom, etc. 
    easy data loaders 

    rich scienti   c ecosystem (such as scipy) 

    neural networks are not the only methods to be used 

    dynamic neural networks 

    with no speci   c or static structure 

    minimal abstractions 

    better debugging and low-level programming in the hands of researcher
