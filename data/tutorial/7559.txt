supervised learning of policy networks

policy network: 12 layer convolutional neural network

training data: 30m positions from human expert games (kgs 5+ dan)

training algorithm: maximise likelihood by stochastic id119

                              

 

training time: 4 weeks on 50 gpus using google cloud

results: 57% accuracy on held out test data (state-of-the art was 44%)

id23 of policy networks

policy network: 12 layer convolutional neural network

training data: games of self-play between policy network

training algorithm: maximise wins z by policy gradient id23

training time: 1 week on 50 gpus using google cloud

results: 80% vs supervised learning. raw network ~3 amateur dan.

value network: 12 layer convolutional neural network

training data: 30 million games of self-play

training algorithm: minimise mse by stochastic id119

training time: 1 week on 50 gpus using google cloud

results: first strong position evaluation function - previously thought impossible
