   abstract

   graphs naturally represent information ranging from links between web
   pages, to communication in email networks, to connections between
   neurons in our brains. these graphs often span billions of nodes and
   interactions between them. within this deluge of interconnected data,
   how can we find the most important structures and summarize them? how
   can we efficiently visualize them? how can we detect anomalies that
   indicate critical events, such as an attack on a computer system,
   disease formation in the human brain, or the fall of a company?

   this book presents scalable, principled discovery algorithms that
   combine globality with locality to make sense of one or more graphs. in
   addition to fast algorithmic methodologies, we also contribute
   graph-theoretical ideas and models, and real-world applications in two
   main areas:

      individual graph mining: we show how to interpretably summarize a
   single graph by identifying its important graph structures. we
   complement summarization with id136, which leverages information
   about few entities (obtained via summarization or other methods) and
   the network structure to efficiently and effectively learn information
   about the unknown entities.

      collective graph mining: we extend the idea of individual-graph
   summarization to time-evolving graphs, and show how to scalably
   discover temporal patterns. apart from summarization, we claim that
   graph similarity is often the underlying problem in a host of
   applications where multiple graphs occur (e.g., temporal anomaly
   detection, discovery of behavioral patterns), and we present
   principled, scalable algorithms for aligning networks and measuring
   their similarity.

   the methods that we present in this book leverage techniques from
   diverse areas, such as matrix algebra, id207, optimization,
   id205, machine learning, finance, and social science, to
   solve real-world problems. we present applications of our exploration
   algorithms to massive datasets, including a web graph of 6.6 billion
   edges, a twitter graph of 1.8 billion edges, brain graphs with up to 90
   million edges, collaboration, peer-to-peer networks, browser logs, all
   spanning millions of users and interactions.
