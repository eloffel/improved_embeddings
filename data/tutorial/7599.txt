[m. gupta et al.: vldb   14]

motivation: understand and rewrite/expand web queries

goal:  collect attributes (birth place, spouse, population, height, etc.)

determine domain, range, sub-attributes, synonyms, misspellings

ex.: capital     domain = countries, range = cities,

synonyms = capital city, 
misspellings = capitol, ..., 
sub-attributes = former capital, fashion capital, ...

lessons learned

size & coverage:
pick low-hanging fruit first, then tackle difficult terrain

scale:
pattern-centric methods scale out well
reasoning and advanced learning form bottleneck

quality:
consistency reasoning is key asset
1 hour of domain modeling can beat 1 year of ml 

open-world:
need to discover emerging entities, new relations,    
quality gap between model-driven harvesting and open ie

what   s next

further improve algorithms
for consistency reasoning (kg quality)
combine with human curation (active learning)

construct more background resources:
relational paraphrases, statistics on user queries,

at what time point or during which time intervals ?

marriedto (madonna, guyritchie) [ 22dec2000, dec2008 ]

hasadvisor (susandavidson, hectorgarcia-molina) [ oct 1982, forever ]

how can we query & reason on entity-relationship facts
in a    time-travel    manner - with uncertain/incomplete kb ?

us president   s wife when steve jobs died?
students of hector garcia-molina while he was at princeton?

temporal knowledge is challenging

for all people in wikipedia (> 500 000) gather all spouses, 

incl. divorced & widowed, and corresponding time periods!
>95% accuracy, >95% coverage, in one night

1) recall: gather temporal scopes for base facts
2) precision: reason on mutual consistency

consistency constraints are potentially helpful:

    functional dependencies:  husband, time     wife
    inclusion dependencies:  marriedperson        adultperson
    age/time/gender restrictions:  birthdate +     <  marriage  <  divorce

hong kong is poised to hold the first election in more than half <timex3 tid="t3"

advocate seeking high office in territory controlled by the chinese government in beijing. a pro-
democracy politician, alan leong, announced <timex3 tid="t4" type="date"
val="20070131">wednesday</timex3> that he had obtained enough nominations to
appear on the ballot to become the territory   s next chief executive. but he acknowledged that
he had no chance of beating the beijing-backed incumbent, donald tsang, who is seeking re-
election. under electoral rules imposed by chinese officials, only 796 people on the election
committee     the bulk of them with close ties to mainland china     will be allowed to vote in the
<timex3

election. it will be the first contested election for chief executive since britain returned hong
kong to china in <timex3 tid="t6" type="date" val="1997">1997</timex3>.
mr. tsang, an able administrator who took office during the early stages of a sharp economic
upturn in <timex3 tid="t7" type="date" val="2005">2005</timex3>,
is
popular with the general public. polls consistently indicate that three-fifths of hong kong   s

temporal facts from text

temporal fact = basic fact + temporal scope

[y. wang et al. 2011]

1) candidate gathering: 

extract pattern & entities
of basic facts and
time expression

2) pattern analysis: 

use seeds to quantify
strength of candidates

3) label propagation: 

construct weighted graph
of hypotheses and
minimize id168

4) constraint reasoning:

use ilp for
temporal consistency

reasoning on t-fact hypotheses

temporal-fact hypotheses:
s(ca,ni)@[2008,2012]{0.7},  s(ca,ben)@[2010]{0.8}, s(ca,al)@[2007,2008]{0.2}, 
s(li,ni)@[1996,2004]{0.9}, s(li,joe)@[2006,2008]{0.8},    

[y. wang et al. 2012, p. talukdar et al. 2012]

cast into evidence-weighted logic program
or integer linear program with 0-1 variables:

for temporal-fact hypotheses xi
and pair-wise ordering hypotheses pij
maximize     wi xi with constraints
   

xi +  xj     1 
if xi, xj overlap in time & conflict
pij +  pji     1
(1     pij ) + (1     pjk)      (1     pik)  
if xi, xj, xk must be totally ordered
(1     xi ) + (1     xj)  + 1     (1     pij)  + (1     pji)

goal: commonsense knowledge

every child knows that

apples are green, red, round, juicy,    
but not fast, funny, verbose,    

pots and pans are in the kitchen or cupboard, on the stove,    
but not in in the bedroom, in your pocket, in the sky,    

children usually live with their parents

but: commonsense is rarely stated explicitly
plus: web and social media have reporting bias

rich family: 27.8 mio on bing
poor family: 3.5 mio on bing

singers: 22.8 mio on bing
workers: 14.5 mio on bing

pattern-based harvesting of

commonsense properties

(n. tandon et al.: aaai 2011)

approach 2: start with seed facts for

apple hasproperty round
dog hasability bark
plate haslocation table

find patterns that express these relations, such as

x is very y, x can y, x put in/on y,    

apply these patterns to find more facts.

problem: noise and sparseness of data
solution: harness web-scale id165 corpora

    5-grams + frequencies

confidence score: pmi (x,y), pmi (p,(xy)), support(x,y),    
are features for regression model

webchild: commonsense properties

[n. tandon et al.: wsdm   14,  aaai   14]

who looks hot ? what tastes hot ?

what is hot ?

what feels hot ?

    4 mio sense-disambiguated spo triples for predicates:

hasproperty, hascolor, hasshape, hastaste, hasappearance,

commonsense: what is it good for?

    how-to queries:

repair a bike tire, pitch a tent, cross a river,    

    scene search (over videos, books, diaries):

romantic dinner, dramatic climb,    

    question disambiguation:

hottest battles with jz ?

hottest place on earth ?

    id31:

warm beer in cool bar     got the flu

the bar was cool and the beer, too

the bar was warm but the beer was cool

the hot springs are very cool

lessons learned

temporal knowledge:
factual knowledge must and can be
positioned in time (and geo-space)

extracting t-facts seems harder than
harvesting basic facts
(little low-hanging fruit here?)

commonsense:
acquiring what every child knows
is amazingly hard for machines

what   s next

advanced algorithms for t-fact extraction:
web scale, relative t-expressions, narrative texts

dynamically acquire knowledge of
emerging events in news and social media

understand, support and automate
the long-term maintenance of the kg: 
knowledge life-cycle

acquire more and cleaner commonsense:
sophisticated properties, advanced rules, visual scenes

use cases for temporal and commonsense knowledge:
time-aware info needs, how-to queries,

lessons learned

nerd lifts text to entity-centric representation:
nearly as valuable and usable as a structured db 

kg is key asset for high-quality nerd:

entity descriptions, semantic relations, 
keyphrases, statistics

best nerd methods can capture also
long-tail and emerging entities

what   s next

high-throughput nerd: semantic indexing
low-latency nerd: speed-reading

popular vs. long-tail entities, general vs.specific domain

leverage deep-parsing features & semantic typing

example: page played kashmir on his gibson

subj

obj

mod

short and difficult texts: 
tweets, headlines, etc.
fictional texts: novels, song lyrics, tv sitcoms, etc.

handle newly emerging entities in kg life-cycle

for web tables, lists, questions, dialogs, summarization,

lessons learned

if data is the new oil, then text is the new chocolate:

web, news, journals, social media

entity view of text has enormous benefit:

lifts text (almost) on par with structured data
and opens up all kinds of analytics

entity-relationship view is ultimately needed,
but relational paraphrases are harder to deal with

deep text analytics enables business apps and insight:

journalists, market&media analysts, company scouts,     

[gartner etc: from $2bio in 2014 to $20bio by 2020]

what   s next

opportunity: combine text & data for deeper insight

huge research avenue: 
analytics (olap, kdd, ml,    ) for text & data

challenge veracity: 
cope with highly varying trust and credibility

challenge variety:
cope with high diversity of names and phrases

plenty of algorithmic and scalability challenges

lessons learned

natural language is most natural ui
for searching data & knowledge bases

sparql-like query language
appropriate as api

translating questions into queries
becomes viable and essential

combine spo triples with text
automatically relax queries

what   s next

make question-to-query translation (id29)
robust and versatile

automatically generate spox query
from speech input in discourse

consider multimodal input:
speech, touch, gesture, gaze, facial expression

cope with spatial / temporal / sentiment / belief modifiers
