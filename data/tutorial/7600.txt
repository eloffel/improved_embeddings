every child knows that

apples are green, red, round, juicy,    
but not fast, funny, verbose,    

pots and pans are in the kitchen or cupboard, on the stove,    
but not in in the bedroom, in your pocket, in the sky,    

children usually live with their parents

but: commonsense is rarely stated explicitly
plus: web and social media have reporting bias
