   abstract

   this book introduces chinese language-processing issues and techniques
   to readers who already have a basic background in natural language
   processing (nlp). since the major difference between chinese and
   western languages is at the word level, the book primarily focuses on
   chinese morphological analysis and introduces the concept, structure,
   and interword semantics of chinese words.

   the following topics are covered: a general introduction to chinese
   nlp; chinese characters, morphemes, and words and the characteristics
   of chinese words that have to be considered in nlp applications;
   chinese id40; unknown word detection; word meaning and
   chinese linguistic resources; interword semantics based on word
   collocation and nlp techniques for collocation extraction.

   chinese morphological processing / chinese id40 / unknown

   review

   "this book focuses on the unique properties of chinese language and
   chinese nlp, offering careful comparisons with english wherever
   necessary. not only will it benefit chinese speakers, including a
   better understanding of chinese nlp, but it also offers a good way for
   non-chinese speakers to grasp the essence of the subject. the book
   contains a concise and insightful linguistic analysis of the problems
   faced by chinese nlp, establishing foundations for the techniques
   introduced in later chapters. the technical details are described in
   appropriate depth with illustrative examples. in addition, this book is
   written in a consistent and didactic manner, and many insightful
   discussions in the book are guaranteed to inform and enlighten.

   this introduction of chinese nlp is a valuable resource for students
   and researchers of theoretical and computational linguistics, as well
   as nlp practitioners and language engineers, who are interested in,
   and/or working on, chinese nlp." --dr. yanjun ma. springer
