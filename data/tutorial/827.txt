   abstract

   search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the
   native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other
   languages. this gives rise to the problem of cross-language information
   retrieval (clir), whose goal is to find relevant information written in
   a different language to a query. in addition to the problems of
   monolingual information retrieval (ir), translation is the key problem
   in clir: one should translate either the query or the documents from a
   language to another. however, this translation problem is not identical
   to full-text machine translation (mt): the goal is not to produce a
   human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding
   relevant documents. specific translation methods are thus required.

   the goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the
   specific problems arising in clir, the solutions proposed in this area,
   as well as the remaining problems. the book starts with a general
   description of the monolingual ir and clir problems. different classes
   of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an mt
   system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel
   and comparable corpora. in addition, the typical retrieval
   effectiveness using different approaches is compared. it will be shown
   that translation approaches specifically designed for clir can rival
   and outperform high-quality mt systems. finally, the book offers a look
   into the future that draws a strong parallel between id183 in
   monolingual ir and query translation in clir, suggesting that many
   approaches developed in monolingual ir can be adapted to clir.

   the book can be used as an introduction to clir. advanced readers can
   also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining
   research challenges in the future. it is suitable to new researchers
   who intend to carry out research on clir.

   table of contents: preface / introduction / using manually constructed
   translation systems and resources for clir / translation based on
   parallel and comparable corpora / other methods to improve clir / a
   look into the future: toward a unified view of monolingual ir and clir?
