   abstract

   dependency-based methods for syntactic parsing have become increasingly
   popular in natural language processing in recent years. this book gives
   a thorough introduction to the methods that are most widely used today.
   after an introduction to dependency grammar and id33,
   followed by a formal characterization of the id33
   problem, the book surveys the three major classes of parsing models
   that are in current use: transition-based, graph-based, and
   grammar-based models. it continues with a chapter on evaluation and one
   on the comparison of different methods, and it closes with a few words
   on current trends and future prospects of id33. the book
   presupposes a knowledge of basic concepts in linguistics and computer
   science, as well as some knowledge of parsing methods for
   constituency-based representations.
