vi.1 motivation and overview 

beyond keywords as queries  
  and documents as retrieval units: 
    extract entities and annotate text documents or web pages 
    (e.g., id39) 
    find instances of semantic classes (e.g., not yet known in id138) 
    extract facts (relations among entities) from text documents  
    or web pages (e.g., wikipedia) to automatically populate and 
    enhance an ontology/knowledge base 
    answer questions by analyzing natural-language 
    and translation into machine-processable format 

technologies: 
    lexicon lookups (name dictionaries, geo gazetteers, etc.) 
    nlp (id52, chunking/parsing, id14, etc.) 
    pattern matching & rule learning (id157, fsas) 
    statistical learning (id48s, mrfs, etc.) 
    id111 in general

information extraction (ie): text to relations 

max karl ernst ludwig planck was born in kiel,  
germany, on april 23, 1858, the son of  
julius wilhelm and emma (n  e patzig) planck.  

planck studied at the universities of munich and berlin,  
where his teachers included kirchhoff and helmholtz,  
and received his doctorate of philosophy at munich in 1879.  
he was privatdozent in munich from 1880 to 1885, then  
associate professor of theoretical physics at kiel until 1889,  
in which year he succeeded kirchhoff as professor at  
berlin university, where he remained until his retirement in 1926.  
afterwards he became president of the kaiser wilhelm society  
for the promotion of science, a post he held until 1937. 

he was also a gifted pianist and is said to have at one time  
considered music as a career. 
planck was twice married. upon his appointment, in 1885,  
to associate professor in his native town kiel  
he married a friend of his childhood, marie merck, who died  
in 1909. he remarried her cousin marga von h  sslin.  
three of his children died young, leaving him with two sons.
