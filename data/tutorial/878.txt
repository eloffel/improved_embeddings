   computational modeling of human id146

   synthesis lectures on human language technologies, 2010, vol. 3, no. 1
   , pages 1-107

   abstract

   human id146 has been studied for centuries, but using
   computational modeling for such studies is a relatively recent trend.
   however, computational approaches to language learning have become
   increasingly popular, mainly due to advances in developing machine
   learning techniques, and the availability of vast collections of
   experimental data on child language learning and child-adult
   interaction. many of the existing computational models attempt to study
   the complex task of learning a language under cognitive plausibility
   criteria (such as memory and processing limitations that humans face),
   and to explain the developmental stages observed in children. by
   simulating the process of child language learning, computational models
   can show us which linguistic representations are learnable from the
   input that children have access to, and which mechanisms yield the same
   patterns of behaviour that children exhibit during this process. in
   doing so, computational modeling provides insight into the plausible
   mechanisms involved in human id146, and inspires the
   development of better language models and techniques. this book
   provides an overview of the main research questions in the field of
   human id146. it reviews the most commonly used
   computational frameworks, methodologies and resources for modeling
   child language learning, and the evaluation techniques used for
   assessing these computational models. the book is aimed at cognitive
   scientists who want to become familiar with the available computational
   methods for investigating problems related to human language
   acquisition, as well as computational linguists who are interested in
   applying their skills to the study of child id146.

   different aspects of language learning are discussed in separate
   chapters, including the acquisition of the individual words, the
   general regularities which govern word and sentence form, and the
   associations between form and meaning. for each of these aspects, the
   challenges of the task are discussed and the relevant empirical
   findings on children are summarized. furthermore, the existing
   computational models that attempt to simulate the task under study are
   reviewed, and a number of case studies are presented.
