computational modeling of narrative

[40]synthesis lectures on human language technologies

   december 2012, 142 pages,
   ([41]https://doi.org/10.2200/s00459ed1v01y201212hlt018)

   abstract

   the field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one
   of the oldest in natural language processing (nlp) and artificial
   intelligence (ai), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is
   such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity. in
   recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in
   the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have
   provided a fresh impetus to this field. this book provides an overview
   of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in
   modeling the narrative structure of stories. the book introduces
   classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their
   mapping to computational approaches. it demonstrates how research in ai
   and nlp has modeled character goals, causality, and time using
   formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning,
   and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches. it proposes
   new representations for embedded narratives and fictional entities, for
   assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of
   audience response. these notions are incorporated into an annotation
   scheme called narrativeml. the book identifies key issues that need to
   be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary
   narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and
   characterizing the goals of narrators. it also suggests a future
   characterized by advanced id111 of narrative structure from
   large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful
   authoring aids.

   this is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that
   integrates together narratology, ai, and computational linguistics. it
   can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an
   elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists. it is
   written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a
   broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and
   formal semanticists), ai researchers, cognitive scientists, computer
   scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.
