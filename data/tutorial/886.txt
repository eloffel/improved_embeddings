what is morphosyntax?

    the difference between a sentence and bag of words

2

#

    the constraints that a language puts on how words can be combined 

    ... both in form and in the resulting meaning

3

#

    in nlp, we often want extract from a sentence (as part of a text) who did what 

to whom

    the morphosyntax of a language solves the inverse problem: how to indicate 

the relationship between the different parts of a sentence

    different languages do this differently, but there are recurring patterns

4

#

my goals for this tutorial

    provide information about the structure of human languages that is useful in 

creating nlp systems

    give a sense of the ways in which languages differ from each other, to 

support more language-independent nlp systems

    provide pointers to useful resources to    nd out more

your goals for this tutorial

    what kind of applications are you currently (considering) using dependency 

structures, constituent structures or morphological information in?

    what are you hoping to get from them?

typological preliminaries

    languages can be classi   ed    genetically    (by family), areally (by region 

spoken) or typologically (by grammatical properties)

#

    these dimensions are distinct, but correlated (cf. daum   iii, 2009)

    ethnologue.com (as of 4/5/12) lists 6,909 known living languages, distributed 

across 128 language families, with 1-1,532 languages each

    form is prototypically a sequence of phones.  however:

    the phones don   t have to be contiguous

    the form doesn   t have to be phones: tonal morphemes, signed languages, 

non-phone-based writing systems

    the form can vary with the linguistic context (cf. morphophonology)

morphology

    morphemes: the smallest meaningful units of language, i.e., smallest pairings 

of form and meaning

    the meaning part of that form-meaning pairing can also be less than 

straightforward.

    roots convey core lexical meaning

# 11

    derivational af   xes can change lexical meaning

# 1 2

    but root+derivational af   x combinations can also have idiosyncratic 

meanings

    in   ectional af   xes add syntactically or semantically relevant features

    e.g.: case-marking af   xes arguably don   t convey meaning directly

# 1 3

    morphemes can be ambiguous (alternatively: underspeci   ed)

what is a    word   ?

    the notion of    word    can be contentious in many languages.

# 1 4

    ... if there isn   t an orthographic tradition establishing one notion of word 

boundaries (cf. japanese, chinese, thai); and even if there is:

    id32 (marcus et al 1993) segments don   t into do + n   t, but 

zwicky & pullum (1983) show that n   t is an af   x

    romance languages separate so-called clitics from the verb root with 

white space, but miller & sag (1997) show that they are af   xes

what is a    word   ?

    is this one of those theoretical issues that don   t matter to nlpers?

    maybe not: words and morphemes are subject to different ordering principles 

    generally: words can be separated from the other words they are ordered 

with respect to by e.g., modi   ers; morphemes appear in a stricter sequence

    on the other hand, the distinction isn   t clear partially because of language 

change: 

    words with relatively free position > words with    xed position > clitic > 

bound morpheme (hopper and traugott 2003)

    clitic: a linguistic element which is syntactically independent but 

phonologically dependent.  examples: english the and (possessive)    s

the person standing by the river   s edge/coat

agreement example

    bantu languages have many noun classes, and both verbs and nominal 

dependents agree with nouns in those classes:

swahili [swa]:

nc1p-good

wa-wili
nc1p-two

wa-le
nc1p-those

wa-me-anguka.

why might we care?
hohensee & bender 2012 preview

    previous work incorporating morphology into language-independent 

id33 algorithms didn   t model agreement

    hohensee & bender propose a series of features that capture agreement 
between head & dependent in any morphological feature, discarding the 
actual value

    serves as a kind of natural (nearly) non-lossy back-off

    improves performance across languages/treebanks with any 

morphological information, with far fewer features than baseline

    different types of arguments (grammatical roles)

heads v. dependents

    heads: 

    required element of a constituent

    determine its internal structure (what else is required)

    determine its external distribution (where it can appear)

8

4

#

    dependents (after kay 2005):

    arguments: required by the head; complete the meaning of a predicate

    adjuncts: optional; re   ne the meaning of a complete predication

heads v. dependents examples: n as head of np

    required element: 

[the cat on the mat] is sleeping.
the cat is sleeping.
*the on the mat is sleeping.
*cat on the mat is sleeping.

    determines what else can appear:

the book about syntax is heavy.
*the cat about syntax is heavy.

    determines external distribution:

the book about cat/cats is heavy.
*the book about cat/cats are heavy.

arguments v. adjuncts

    arguments can in principle be predicted from the lexical identity of the head

0

5

#

    in many (all?) languages, (some) arguments can be left unexpressed

    the number of semantic arguments provided for by a head is a 

fundamental semantic property

tests distinguishing arguments from adjuncts

    pat slept until noon does entail pat did something until noon

    pat ate lunch in montreal does entail pat did something in montreal

arguments v. adjuncts in propbank

    framing guidelines take a pragmatic approach to distinguishing arguments 

(argns) from adjuncts (argms):

       a semantic role is being marked as an argument, if it frequently occurs in 

a corpus and is speci   c to a particular class of verbs.    (http://
verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/ace/framingguidelines.pdf)

types of arguments

    subject v. complements

    whether subject exists as a gr in all languages is a matter of debate

    subjects = distinguished argument, which may be the only one to display 
properties related to agreement, relativization, control, coordination, word

#

    ... though they often stand in regular relations to each other

#

what are grammatical functions good for?

    syntactic phenomena differentiating arguments are sensitive to grammatical 

function

    lexical items map semantic roles to grammatical functions

#

the dog scared kim.
kim feared the dog.
kim loaded the wagon with hay.
kim loaded the hay onto the wagon.

what are grammatical functions good for?

    there can be mismatches:

    some syntactic phenomena rearrange the mapping (e.g., passive)

5

7

#

kim took the picture./the picture was taken by kim.

7
    some syntactic dependents don   t    ll a semantic role
kim expects it to bother sandy that pat left.
kim expects pat to leave.

    some syntactic dependents aren   t realized locally

kim continues to be likely to be easy to talk to.

#

what are grammatical functions good for?

    the mapping of syntactic constituents to semantic argument positions is 

mediated by both:

    grammatical functions

    the lexical properties of the selecting predicate

8

7

#

    identifying the grammatical function of a constituent can help us understand 

its semantic role with respect to the head, provided we also know:

    the mapping provided by the head 

    and any intervening heads (e.g., raising predicates)

    whether the clause is passive, etc

examples

    word order (english):

kim saw sandy != sandy saw kim
    agreement (swahili [swa; niger-congo]):

jana
yesterday

ni-li-mw-on-a
sa.1s-past-oa.ncl1-see-ind

m-levi
ncl1-drunkard

   yesterday i saw (that) drunkard.    (ud deen, 2006:233)

    case (wambaya [wmb; australian]):

ngaragana-nguja
grog-prop.iv.acc

ngiy-a
3.sg.nm.a-pst

gujinganjanga-ni
mother.ii.erg

jiyawu
give

ngabulu.
milk.iv.acc

   (his) mother gave (him) milk with grog in it.    (nordlinger 1998:223)

    agreement (head marking): morphological marking on the head re   ecting

    languages tend to prefer one or the other of these; agreement (head-

marking) is more common in the world   s languages (nichols 1986)

mismatches: passive

    passive is a grammatical process which demotes the subject to oblique 

status, making room for the next most prominent argument to appear as the 
subject

#

    note that this changes the semantic role associated with subject position for 

a given verb

kim saw sandy.
sandy was seen (by kim).

    in english, only transitive verbs allow passive (and even then, not all 

transitives)

    other languages (including german, dutch, turkish, shona [sna; niger-
congo]) allow passives of intransitives, too.  (keenan and dryer, 2007)

mismatches: dative shift

    another example of a grammatical phenomenon affecting the mapping 

between syntactic and semantic arguments

kim gave a book to sandy.
kim gave sandy a book.

    interacts with passive:

a book was given to sandy (by kim).
sandy was given a book (by kim).

mismatches in arity

    syntactic arguments without any semantic role: expletives

it seems that sandy left.
it turns out that sandy was right.
i take it that sandy left.
sandy is living it up.
kim and sandy battled it out.
(postal and pullum, 1988)

    syntactic arguments without any local semantic role: raising

sandy expected kim to laugh.
sandy continued to laugh.

    syntactic arguments which play two roles: control

sandy persuaded kim to leave.
sandy tried to laugh.

    some languages allow arguments and/or adjuncts to appear separated from 

their selecting head, even in a different clause

    wh questions:

what does sandy think kim likes to eat ?

    relative clauses:

this is the dish which sandy thinks kim likes
to eat

.

       topicalization   :

semantically empty words

    don   t contribute lexical content

    examples from english:

    do serve as syntactic    glue   

    complementizers: that, to

    sometimes contribute features to 

    expletives: there, it

the semantics

    vary across languages

    give rise to mis-matches in aligned 

bitexts

    auxiliaries: do, be, will, have

argument drop, aka null instantiation (fillmore 1986)

    de   nite null instantiation: referent is recoverable from discourse context

    inde   nite null instantiation: referent is non-speci   c/not recoverable from 

discourse context

    constructional null instantiation: referent is determined by syntactic context 

(imperatives, control)

argument drop, aka null instantiation (fillmore 1986)

    de   nite null instantiation: 

she promised.
i tried.
when did she leave?

they agreed.
she found out.
i forgot.

    inde   nite null instantiation: 

i spent the afternoon baking.
we already ate.
what happened to my sandwich? *fido ate.

argument drop, aka null instantiation (fillmore 1986)

    lexically licensed: possibility of an argument going missing depends on the 

lexical identity of the head (eat v. devour)

fido ate.
she promised.
they accepted.
she found out.
he lost the race/his wallet. he lost.

*fido devoured.
*she pledged/vowed/guaranteed.
*they authorized.
*she discovered.

    systematic: subjects (e.g., in spanish) or any argument (e.g., japanese) can 

be dropped, if supported by the discourse context

argument drop: why does it matter?

    mt: identifying dropped arguments in the source language that should be 

overt pronouns in the target

    reference resolution: dropped arguments participate in coreference chains; a 

suf   ciently salient argument can be    mentioned    via dropped arguments in 
successive clauses

    dependency triples: dropped arguments participate in dependencies, and 

(when resolved via their antecedents) can add valuable information to co-
occurrence patterns

    wals: world atlas of language structures online (wals.info; dryer and 

haspelmath, 2011)

    typological properties of languages: 76,492 data points, 2,678 languages, 

192 properties

    adapt nlp systems to languages based on typological properties

    expand nlp systems to handle more languages based on understanding 

of features

resources: morphological analyzers

    map surface forms (e.g., standard orthography) to regularized strings of 

morphemes or morphological features

    useful for:

    machine translation into morphologically complex languages (toutanova et 

al 2008)

    handling morphologically-induced data sparsity (e.g., through factored 

language models, bilmes and kirchhoff 2003)

resources: syntax, beyond the well-known 
parsers

    the english resource grammar (flickinger, 2011), used with delph-in 
parsing algorithms (www.delph-in.net), provides linguistically-motivated 
parses mapping to deep dependencies

    the wikiwoods treebank (www.delph-in.net/wikiwoods; flickinger et al 2010): 

erg-based treebank (with automatic parse selection) over wikipedia 
snapshot from july 2008

    the grammar matrix (bender et al 2002, 2010) supports the creation of new 

grammars in the style of the erg

summary/re   ection:
my goals for this tutorial

    provide information about the structure of human languages that is useful in 

creating nlp systems

    give a sense of the ways in which languages differ from each other, to 

support more language-independent nlp systems

    provide pointers to useful resources to    nd out more

summary/re   ection

    topics covered today:

    morphology (incl morphotactics, morphophonology, morphosyntax)

    basic syntax

    some syntactic complications

    in what ways will this information be useful for nlp?

    what (if anything) was the most surprising thing (of the 100)?

    what do you want to know more about?
