   abstract

   considerable progress has been made in recent years in the development
   of dialogue systems that support robust and efficient human-machine
   interaction using spoken language. spoken dialogue technology allows
   various interactive applications to be built and used for practical
   purposes, and research focuses on issues that aim to increase the
   system's communicative competence by including aspects of error
   correction, cooperation, multimodality, and adaptation in context.

   this book gives a comprehensive view of state-of-the-art techniques
   that are used to build spoken dialogue systems. it provides an overview
   of the basic issues such as system architectures, various dialogue
   management methods, system evaluation, and also surveys advanced topics
   concerning extensions of the basic model to more conversational setups.

   the goal of the book is to provide an introduction to the methods,
   problems, and solutions that are used in dialogue system development
   and evaluation. it presents dialogue modelling and system development
   issues relevant in both academic and industrial environments and also
   discusses requirements and challenges for advanced interaction
   management and future research.
