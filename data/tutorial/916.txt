   this book introduces basic supervised learning algorithms applicable to
   natural language processing (nlp) and shows how the performance of
   these algorithms can often be improved by exploiting the marginal
   distribution of large amounts of unlabeled data. one reason for that is
   data sparsity, i.e., the limited amounts of data we have available in
   nlp. however, in most real-world nlp applications our labeled data is
   also heavily biased. this book introduces extensions of supervised
   learning algorithms to cope with data sparsity and different kinds of
   sampling bias.

   this book is intended to be both readable by first-year students and
   interesting to the expert audience. my intention was to introduce what
   is necessary to appreciate the major challenges we face in contemporary
   nlp related to data sparsity and sampling bias, without wasting too
   much time on details about supervised learning algorithms or particular
   nlp applications. i use text classification, part-of-speech tagging,
   and id33 as running examples, and limit myself to a small
   set of cardinal learning algorithms. i have worried less about
   theoretical guarantees ("this algorithm never does too badly") than
   about useful rules of thumb ("in this case this algorithm may perform
   really well"). in nlp, data is so noisy, biased, and non-stationary
   that few theoretical guarantees can be established and we are typically
   left with our gut feelings and a catalogue of crazy ideas. i hope this
   book will provide its readers with both. throughout the book we include
   snippets of python code and empirical evaluations, when relevant.
