              linguistic structure prediction by [1]noah a. smith

   this is volume 13 of the [2]morgan & claypool synthesis lectures on
   human language technologies, edited by [3]graeme hirst.

abstract

   a major part of natural language processing now depends on the use of
   text data to build linguistic analyzers. we consider statistical,
   computational approaches to modeling linguistic structure. we seek to
   unify across many approaches and many kinds of linguistic structures.
   assuming a basic understanding of natural language processing and/or
   machine learning, we seek to bridge the gap between the two fields.
   approaches to decoding (i.e., carrying out linguistic structure
   prediction) and supervised and unsupervised learning of models that
   predict discrete structures as outputs are the focus. we also survey
   natural language processing problems to which these methods are being
   applied, and we address related topics in probabilistic id136,
   optimization, and experimental methodology.
